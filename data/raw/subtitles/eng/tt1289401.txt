1
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,742
So, the Aldridge Mansion is the only
19th century home in New York City

2
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,286
preserved both inside and out.

3
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,038
At the time of its construction,

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,457
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence,

5
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:28,630
featuring every luxury, including a face bidet
and an anti-Irish security fence.

6
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,174
Over here,

7
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,553
you can imagine Sir Aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests.

8
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,767
It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants.

9
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,144
And if you'll follow me...

10
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,986
Now, I'm gonna tell you
something a little spooky.

11
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:57,742
On the morning of October 25th, 1894,
Sir Aldridge awoke, furious,

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,828
when his breakfast was not waiting for him.

13
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,707
So he called to his servants,
but none of them responded.

14
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,583
Why?

15
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,797
Because, during the night, one by one,

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,300
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep.

17
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,262
It was later discovered

18
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,057
they were murdered by his eldest daughter,

19
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,144
Gertrude Aldridge.

20
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,229
Sir Aldridge once wrote in his diary,

21
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,148
"I know God makes no mistakes,

22
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,818
"but I believe he may have been drunk
when he built Gertrude's personality."

23
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,654
Now, to spare the family public humiliation,

24
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,906
instead of turning her in to the police,

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,618
they locked her in this basement.

26
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,579
And they fed her

27
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,707
through this slot.

28
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,419
Years later, when a new owner moved in,

29
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,671
they dug out her remains.

30
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,884
But, after repeatedly hearing strange sounds,

31
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,011
he sealed it shut.

32
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,265
That's right.
No one has opened this door since then.

33
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,481
Okay.

34
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,732
Follow me.

35
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,650
Maybe steer clear of the door.

36
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,347
Sorry, Sir Aldridge. I got to get out of here!

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,116
Garret, you idiot.

38
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,870
No.

39
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,040
No.

40
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,847
No! No! No!

41
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,141
No! No!

42
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,226
No!

43
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,201
Daniel. Teresa.

44
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,580
Sean, that is an excellent question.

45
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,999
As you can see from my calculations,

46
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:38,421
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory.

47
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,257
Teaching in the big hall. Big day.

48
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,932
Big hall. Big hall. Big hall!

49
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,017
Big hall!

50
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,187
Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak to you
about something you wrote.

51
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,441
I'm sorry. Yes. What...

52
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,859
What publication?

53
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,236
I'm talking about your book.

54
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,031
Book.

55
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,409
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

56
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,452
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my class will be here any minute.

57
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,995
You're Erin Gilbert, right?

58
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,539
Co-author of <i>Ghosts from Our Past:</i>

59
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>Both Literally and Figuratively:</i>
<i>The Study of the Paranormal?</i>

60
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,795
No self-respecting scientist
believes in the paranormal.

61
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,380
I can assure you that.

62
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,132
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,842
You're looking for a different Erin Gilbert.

64
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,971
Okay. But this really does look like you.

65
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,306
What? No.

66
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,766
Yeah, that's me.

67
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
Look, it was a very long time ago,

68
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,688
and it was just a gag
between a couple of friends.

69
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,064
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,108
A 460-page gag?

71
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,486
The first sentence is, "This is not a joke."

72
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,946
What do you want?

73
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,322
Well, I'm Ed Mulgrave.

74
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,534
I'm the historian at the Aldridge Mansion,
and I believe it's haunted.

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,244
If you could just come take a look.

76
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,164
I tried the police, but I just sound crazy.

77
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,459
I'm sorry.
That book you're holding is utter nonsense.

78
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,463
I don't even know how you got that.
I thought I burned both copies.

79
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,506
It's on Amazon. Both hard copy and e-book.

80
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,092
-What?
-It's on Books on Tape, too.

81
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,635
Only, I know how to read.

82
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,179
Is it now?

83
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,056
No!

84
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,558
No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna kill you, Abby.

85
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,685
Erin.

86
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,896
Hi! Dr. Filmore. Hello, hi.

87
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,232
We're set for the final review
of your tenure case on Thursday.

88
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,776
Great.

89
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,487
But I saw that you had
a recommendation letter

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,364
from Dr. Branum at Princeton.

91
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,659
Their science department
is really not what it used to be.

92
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,955
And I would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college.

93
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,832
More prestigious than Princeton?

94
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,292
Yes.

95
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,632
You see, I think you're an asset
to modern physics,

96
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,718
but I would hate to see you
throw it down the drain.

97
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,055
I won't throw it down the drain, sir.

98
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
And I will get on that letter.

99
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,308
And about your clothes...

100
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,102
Yes? Did you...

101
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,773
Too sexy for academia?

102
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,316
Never mind.

103
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,527
No, no, no. What is it?

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,654
-Never mind!
-I don't...

105
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,703
Abby. You promised you wouldn't do this.

106
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,290
"Abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal

107
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,919
"at the Kenneth P. Higgins
Institute of Science."

108
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,431
Come on, F7!

109
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,057
Are you kidding me?

110
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,446
Hello?

111
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,322
I've been waiting a long time.

112
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,742
Has been a while, hasn't it?

113
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,870
Hope you brought me more than one wonton.

114
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,955
Excuse me?

115
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,132
Well, well, well.

116
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,800
Erin.

117
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,385
Abby.

118
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,304
Bennie.

119
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,098
Yes, I know who you are, Bennie. Can I just...

120
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,643
Can I have my lunch
that I've been waiting an hour for?

121
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,645
You know they make
smaller headphones now, right?

122
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,272
It's an advance in science.

123
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,066
Thank you for asking.

124
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,026
Probably the future you're looking at.

125
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,277
Here you go.

126
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,863
Why don't you show Miss Gilbert to the door.

127
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,740
It's just the same door we came in from.

128
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
-Yeah, I know how to get out. It's figurative.
-It's really not that hard.

129
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,119
-No, I'm okay.
-Don't.

130
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,080
-I tried.
-Poorly.

131
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,292
You put our book online
without my permission.

132
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,086
I don't need your permission.

133
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,421
Of course you need my permission.
I wrote that book with you.

134
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,714
My name is on it.

135
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,966
No. Absolutely not.

136
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,469
That book is a whole new
revenue stream for me.

137
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,472
And I'm, like, one-tenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here.

138
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,973
Look, I am up for tenure right now.

139
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,350
"I'm up for tenure."

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,395
And if my colleagues at Columbia University
google my name,

141
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,271
that is the first thing that comes up.

142
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,691
Along with a ghost emoji now,
thank you very much,

143
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,858
-that does a little dance.
-You know what?

144
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,694
That book was our baby.

145
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,364
And you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly!

146
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,325
Okay, well, books can't fly.
And neither can babies, so...

147
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,035
You don't know. I'll tell you what.

148
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,956
If I had a human baby that could fly,
I wouldn't be telling the press about it.

149
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,418
If I had a flying baby,
I'd zip this, and so would you.

150
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,212
There is no experimental backing
for anything in that book.

151
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,381
And it makes me look like a crazy person.

152
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,883
-God! Are you kidding me?
-What?

153
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,969
I got one wonton!

154
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,973
I got a tub of soup,
and I got one split wonton.

155
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,808
Look at that, just floating there.

156
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm sorry you're having
a soup crisis right now.

157
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,604
There's not even any meat in there.
That's just a carrot.

158
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,939
Abby, please.

159
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,774
-Yes.
-Abby!

160
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,028
You're killing me. I got one wonton again.
You got to send Bennie back.

161
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,739
And tell him no tip. I should charge him.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,282
And it was split up the middle!

163
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,533
Come here often?

164
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,327
I'm sorry, hello?

165
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,495
Who are you?

166
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,252
-Holtzmann.
-Erin.

167
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,546
I've heard terrible things about you.

168
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,631
Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.

169
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,009
She'll ask you to write a book,
and then she'll squash your dreams.

170
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,093
Okay.

171
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,428
Holtzmann works with me here in the lab.

172
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,057
She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.

173
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,017
She would not abandon you.

174
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,435
I get it.

175
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,271
She also happens to specialize in
experimental particle physics.

176
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,774
Holtzmann and I are really busy here

177
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,277
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book.

178
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,445
-Really?
-Yeah.

179
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,990
We're incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam.

180
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,325
Really close.

181
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,910
You're making a reverse tractor beam?

182
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,871
Abby, why don't you let her listen to the EVP.

183
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,998
-What EVP?
-No. Not... There's no EVP.

184
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,626
-EVP is electro...
-Electro voice phenomenon.

185
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,294
I'm familiar. I know what it means.

186
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,880
And there's never been one substantiated.

187
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
There hasn't? There hasn't been one...

188
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,342
You know what? You come with me.

189
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,552
With a suit on and you get so cocky.

190
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,474
A few months ago, we spent eight nights
at the Chelsea Hotel.

191
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,725
We didn't get anything.

192
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,769
Well, we didn't think so.

193
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,648
And then later, in the lab, when we were
reviewing these tapes...

194
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,452
-You really got me.
-You know what?

195
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,912
Usually we can't even get people over here.

196
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,872
-But we have never...
-She came right over to it.

197
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,792
Never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine.

198
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,753
It's a cool joke. That was funny.
It's disgusting.

199
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,339
Is it more or less disgusting
if I tell you it came from the front?

200
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,092
What's next? You gonna give me a wedgie?

201
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,513
No. I think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt.

202
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,931
Burn!

203
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,852
Okay, you know what, I thought
we could have an adult conversation,

204
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,687
but apparently we can't.

205
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,064
Erin, if you don't believe
in this stuff anymore,

206
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,150
then why were you looking for the book?

207
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,237
A man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted.

208
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,822
What building?

209
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,490
The Aldridge Mansion.

210
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,659
It's obviously a joke.

211
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,371
What are you doing?

212
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,623
See, this is, this is exactly...

213
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,584
-You want to go find some ghosts?
-Yes.

214
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,046
Break!

215
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,216
-Wait, you're going?
-I got the pack.

216
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,886
Abby! Please, Abby. The book.

217
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,763
Come on. Let's go!

218
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,181
I'm not going with you guys.

219
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,849
No. Are you kidding?

220
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,309
You were never invited!

221
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,728
I need you out of the lab,
so I can lock the door.

222
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,147
Well, you said "let's," so...

223
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,607
-Oh, my God. Just pull the...
-We're wasting time.

224
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,192
Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!

225
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,526
Abby, wait!

226
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,570
Hey! Taxi!

227
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,530
-Hey! Hey!
-Abby.

228
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,074
Abby, come on.

229
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,159
Please, Abby, just
take the book down. Please.

230
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,952
All right, all right,

231
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,247
but you have to introduce us
to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.

232
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,582
Yes, he would love to meet you.

233
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,876
Then I will consider, maybe,

234
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,962
taking the book down
until you get your stupid tenure

235
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,422
at your stupider college.

236
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,758
Absolutely. Yes, I will. Yes, of course!

237
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,389
You got it?

238
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,226
Excuse me! Excuse me!

239
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,769
We're not open.

240
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,604
-Can I help you?
-Yes. Hi.

241
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,980
We're looking for Ed Mulgrave.

242
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,775
-I wanted to introduce these people to him.
-Hi there.

243
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,568
He came to see me this morning.

244
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,529
-Ed Mulgrave?
-Yes.

245
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,198
But Ed Mulgrave died 15 years ago.

246
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,117
-Yes! That's awesome!
-What?

247
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,743
Dead for 15 years!

248
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,995
Ed's a ghost! Knew it!

249
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,622
I just saw him today...

250
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,624
He's...

251
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,209
So, who is this?

252
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,461
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.

253
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,213
Okay. That's obviously who I meant. That's...

254
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,801
Hi, Junior. If I may, when is the last time
the paranormal entity was actually seen?

255
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,847
And if you were to rank it, let's say between
probably a T1 and T5...

256
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,100
Garret here saw it on Tuesday,
and I believe it made him soil himself.

257
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,227
-Jesus.
-Wow. Soiling.

258
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,062
I'd put that at a T3.

259
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,647
T4, if it was poop.

260
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,190
-What?
-Unless you ate something weird.

261
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,483
Then it wasn't the ghost.

262
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,652
Kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though.

263
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,987
I didn't soil myself.

264
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,906
He did. He called me sobbing, saying,
"Oh, my God, my pants are toast."

265
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,908
-Okay. All right.
-I'd love to get that back to the lab.

266
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,703
Well, so I have made the introduction.

267
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,246
-Yeah, thank you.
-There you go.

268
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,165
All right, well, how 'bout
you take us across the street.

269
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,751
I got to get in there, set up.
Let's go on a tour.

270
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,420
You're gonna die in there.

271
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,589
Aldridge Mansion. Take one.

272
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,507
And we are rolling.

273
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,509
Checking the settings. We look good.

274
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,553
What is that?

275
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,389
Looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy.

276
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,350
It's a PKE meter.

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,228
There's a ghost anywhere around here,
this baby's gonna find it.

278
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,688
Does it work?

279
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,024
Yeah, it works.

280
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,778
I just haven't had the appropriate proximity
to an entity for it to work.

281
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,363
Strange reading here.

282
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,450
Ma'am, can you tell us where you got
the world's tiniest bow tie?

283
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,702
It came with the shirt.

284
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,415
Okay, somebody really doesn't
want us getting in that door.

285
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,876
Can you tell us what it's like
to walk around in those shoes all day?

286
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,128
-It's not fun.
-All right.

287
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,464
Holtzmann, check this out.

288
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,715
Hold your ponies.

289
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,322
All right. Good gag.

290
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,907
Hey, are you getting that?

291
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,033
Very funny.

292
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,036
Is everything a joke to you guys?

293
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,329
Just your mama.

294
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,581
No, actually, I think the world of your mom.

295
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,667
You guys put all that
gooey stuff on the floor.

296
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,628
You opened the basement door.
You tried to freak me out.

297
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,296
We did not open the basement door...

298
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,590
Basement door is open.

299
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,177
-I didn't open it. Did you open it?
-I did not open it.

300
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,389
You know what, it was probably Ed.
And the guy who didn't poop his pants.

301
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,142
Look over there.

302
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,274
I didn't even know it did that.

303
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,320
-I... My ears just...
-Mine just popped, too.

304
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,405
That is definitely...

305
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,115
-An AP-xH shift. Yes!
-Shift.

306
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,659
-I mean, for sure. That's...
-Guys?

307
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,037
I don't think we're alone.

308
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,371
Holy crap.

309
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,914
Let me have the camera. Thank you.

310
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,041
Okay.

311
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,339
How can you be eating right now?

312
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,799
You try saying no to these salty parabolas.

313
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,894
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

314
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,812
Good God.

315
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,647
Class 4 apparition.

316
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,191
Distinct human form.

317
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,151
This can't be happening.

318
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,819
It's happening, all right.

319
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,780
That's the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

320
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,993
I'm gonna try to talk to it.

321
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,914
Just be careful, she could be malevolent.

322
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,874
Yeah, just make sure you're recording it.

323
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,501
-Yeah, I'm getting it all.
-Okay.

324
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,877
Just be cautious.

325
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,380
I think she wants to communicate with us.

326
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,756
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

327
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,342
It's okay. She seems peaceful.

328
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,011
Hello.

329
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,930
I think you're gorgeous.

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,891
Hello. Hi.

331
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,104
My name is Erin Gilbert,
Doctor of Particle Physics at Columbia...

332
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,825
-Yes!
-God!

333
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,118
She's getting away! Come on!

334
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,413
-Hurry, hurry!
-Run!

335
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,997
-Get it, get it!
-Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

336
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,375
-Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
-There!

337
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,381
What just happened?

338
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,049
Abby, what just happened?

339
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,053
I'll tell you what just happened.
We saw a ghost.

340
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,346
-We saw a ghost!
-Yeah, we saw a ghost!

341
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,056
We saw a ghost! Oh, my God!

342
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,641
-We saw a ghost.
-We saw a ghost!

343
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,977
Oh, my God, we saw a ghost!

344
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,564
We were right! We weren't crazy!

345
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,987
We saw a ghost!

346
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,905
<i>Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!</i>

347
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,491
<i>I believe in ghosts 'cause I just saw one!</i>
<i>They're real!</i>

348
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,662
Who is that?

349
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,664
Dr. Bronstein saw this on Reddit.

350
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,003
It was re-blogged
from a site entitled Ghost News.

351
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,589
Not a publication I'd heard of.

352
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,425
I hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure...

353
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,260
I accept your tenure.

354
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:41,181
When we give someone tenure,
they represent this institution.

355
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,934
But this is just not
what this institution is about.

356
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,312
Dr. Gibbons. Hello.

357
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,105
Just moving offices.

358
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,983
You know.
They found a couple cats in the wall.

359
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,361
Really stunk in there. Glad I'm getting out.

360
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,113
I didn't get fired.

361
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,198
<i>I got fired!</i>

362
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,408
After years,

363
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,160
years of hard work.

364
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,495
And ass-kissing.

365
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,622
God, I kissed so many
different kinds of asses.

366
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,875
Erin, we're sorry that you lost your job.

367
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,753
But, I mean, there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it.

368
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,880
I mean, we saw a real ghost.

369
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,465
You know, and she was beautiful.

370
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,593
Till she dislocated her jaw
and ecto-projected all over you.

371
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,262
Yeah, that stuff went everywhere,
by the way, in every crack.

372
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:25,684
But, I got to say,
even that was kind of spectacularly beautiful.

373
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,896
I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.

374
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,980
I mean, I could smell it.

375
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,943
A full-torso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression.

376
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,945
I mean, how often does that happen?

377
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,822
I mean, they want us to be quiet about that?

378
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,782
We are not gonna be quiet about that.

379
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,077
And it's not just us.
We have over 100 comments already.

380
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,495
And they're not all crazies.

381
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,996
Come here, I want to show you this.

382
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,458
Read that.

383
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,128
"Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."

384
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,754
No, no. Okay.

385
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,506
The one below it.

386
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,176
This woman is describing
a Class 3 haunting in her house.

387
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,595
She can't just move. She can't call the police.

388
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,514
She can't call her friends.
Who's she gonna call?

389
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,558
<i>Ghost Jumpers!</i>

390
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,060
<i>Tonight, the Ghost Jumpers</i>
<i>make contact with the ghost of Bigfoot.</i>

391
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,104
God! These phonies!

392
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,439
I mean, you know what?

393
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,108
These guys are the reason you got fired.

394
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,279
It's because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work.

395
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:22,157
This cannot be the best option for people.

396
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,326
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here,
a real discovery.

397
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:30,123
Unlike Columbia,
this institute is 100% behind us.

398
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,291
Really?

399
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:35,628
Erin, this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids.

400
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:40,216
I know that if you come and join us here,
they are gonna be so pumped.

401
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,802
We just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money.

402
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,889
I just honestly didn't realize
your department still existed.

403
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,516
-What?
-Come on, ghosts?

404
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,813
I will not let the 12-year reputation
of this fine institution be besmirched by you!

405
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,942
Come on! Suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold?

406
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,862
You're only dean now
because the last dean went to jail.

407
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,739
Are you saying that I'm not qualified?

408
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,033
You spell science with a "Y."

409
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,870
And what's upsetting about that is
I don't think you know that that's wrong.

410
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,082
This is an institution of higher learning.

411
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,042
And if you guys want to study "ghosts,"

412
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,671
do it somewhere else,
because I have two words for you.

413
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,214
Let me guess, "Get out"?

414
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,883
-No, he's gonna say "suck it."
-He's not gonna say "suck it."

415
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,551
Suck it.

416
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,178
-You were right.
-You know...

417
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,429
My gosh.

418
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,682
I think it might be a ghost.

419
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,642
No, it's not. It's just a bird.

420
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,102
Bye. There's the door.

421
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,354
Later days. Can you hear this?
Let me turn it up.

422
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,191
Oh, my God.

423
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,778
This is incredibly immature behavior.

424
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,615
Caught it.

425
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,409
Just a minor setback.

426
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,786
You know what, guys?
I think we can really do this.

427
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,039
We can become the first scientists to prove
the existence of the paranormal.

428
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,291
All we have to do is
find an entity and capture it

429
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,378
and bring it into a controlled environment.
That's all!

430
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,965
Hey! There's the Erin I remember.
Welcome back.

431
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,175
-Thank you.
-Nice.

432
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,969
Okay, we should probably
get this equipment out of here.

433
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,138
-They're gonna want it back.
-I thought this stuff was yours.

434
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,347
-All stolen.
-No...

435
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,683
Hey! That worthless garbage
belongs to this school!

436
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,643
Scatter! Scatter! Scatter!

437
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,645
Go, go, go, scatter!

438
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,446
Hey. Good morning.

439
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,822
Okay.

440
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,616
Hey, how you doing, sir? Got a Metro...

441
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,953
Hey. That's a dope jacket, man.
I got that jacket.

442
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,247
You know what? It's a sweater.
I made a mistake.

443
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,665
You have a good day, all right?

444
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,626
Hey! How you doing, man?

445
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,211
They'll always ignore you.

446
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:45,216
They are walking sewage,
concerned only with their own trivial matters.

447
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,593
Okay.

448
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,011
When the Fourth Cataclysm begins,

449
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,140
laborers, such as yourself,
will be among the last led to the butchery.

450
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,392
So, make the most of your extra time.

451
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,521
You are just a bundle of joy, ain't ya?

452
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,024
You have a good day with your crazy ass.

453
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,651
I wonder what train he taking.

454
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,656
Is he going on the tracks?

455
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,201
Man...

456
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,751
You want to use the bathroom,

457
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,046
there's a perfectly nice bathroom
upstairs at Starbucks.

458
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,608
Hey, hey!

459
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,777
Hey, you're not supposed to be
down here, man. Only subway...

460
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,801
What in the sweet hell?

461
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,305
Exquisite.

462
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,936
I'm cool, dude. Yeah.

463
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,274
Forget this, man!

464
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,568
Forget this!

465
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,787
<i>Aldridge Mansion? Check.</i>

466
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,540
<i>Seward Street subway station?</i>

467
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,708
<i>Check.</i>

468
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,960
Well done, Rowan.

469
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,129
But still so many more checks to go.

470
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,091
You have been bullied your entire life.

471
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,969
Now you will be the bully.

472
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,514
Trust in your abilities,

473
00:25:56,598 --> 00:26:00,185
and the universe shall bend before your will.

474
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:04,105
<i>Hey, weirdo.</i>
<i>We got a clogged toilet in 1843. It's bad.</i>

475
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,316
<i>I mean, like, biblically bad. Get on it.</i>

476
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,109
Absolutely.

477
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,986
Nothing would make me happier.

478
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,280
<i>Whatever, freak show. Just do it.</i>

479
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:19,579
And the universe shall bend before your will.

480
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,209
Charge the lines.

481
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,710
Create the vortex.

482
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,504
Break the barrier.

483
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,257
I found a fantastic spot for your business.

484
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,676
It's more of a research lab.

485
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,679
-What do you think?
-That's it?

486
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,263
Let's go see your new home.

487
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,307
-Oh, my God! Look at...
-Look at it!

488
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,226
-Look at how high!
-Look at the amazing spread!

489
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,936
Look at the ceiling to the floor height!

490
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,690
Look at this. Look at it.

491
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,234
It's perfect.

492
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,027
-We got tons of space.
-Stripper pole!

493
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,447
-The rent is $21,000 a month.
-Burn in hell.

494
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,824
Oh, my God.

495
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,576
I'm sorry. Wait, that's the monthly rent?

496
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,495
-Yeah.
-Who can afford that?

497
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,871
All your friend said was that

498
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,207
you were looking for a place
to explore the unknown.

499
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,001
Okay, we need to explore
something a lot cheaper.

500
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,210
There's an upstairs!

501
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,212
Are you offended by the smell
of Chinese food?

502
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,552
I have now moved above you,
and you still can't help me out.

503
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,888
How does it take you an hour
to go up one flight of stairs?

504
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,223
I have really bad knees.

505
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,725
You know what?

506
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,351
What is that?

507
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,311
It's our hot and sour shrimp soup.

508
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,982
That looks like dishwater and one shrimp,
and I think it's...

509
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,942
I hope that's a water chestnut.

510
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,337
We're dancing? Okay.

511
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,005
Let's be safe, though.

512
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,763
Holtz. Holtz. Holtzmann!

513
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,222
Fire!

514
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,767
Over towards the fire.

515
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,564
Thank you.

516
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,610
I hate to DeBarge in.

517
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,404
-She loves that.
-Is that by DeBarge?

518
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,614
I thought it was Devo.

519
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,824
Anyway, I got the website up.

520
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,826
I passed out a bunch of these fliers
all over town,

521
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,703
so I'm drumming us up a little business.

522
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,790
"If you see something, say something."

523
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,500
-It's catchy.
-It's good.

524
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,795
-Yeah, I'll take it.
-I think it might be the anti-terrorism slogan.

525
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,296
God.

526
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,965
-It is, isn't it?
-It is. I'm sorry.

527
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,134
Well, I guess now we know
why so many people are calling

528
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,261
about suspicious-looking bags.

529
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,222
Dang it.

530
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,307
-I love the green paper!
-Thank you.

531
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,479
Hey. I'm here about the receptionist job.

532
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,107
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

533
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,025
Is this a big ol' robot?

534
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,652
What?

535
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,571
The receptionist job that was in the paper.
That's what I was here about.

536
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,989
You're hired.

537
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,787
Okay, I... God, you're all sweaty.

538
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,456
I think I got it.
"If there's something strange in the..."

539
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:13,837
Kevin. Right?

540
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,921
-Kevin.
-Yeah.

541
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,339
Abby. We spoke on the phone.

542
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,549
-We did. Yeah.
-Hello there.

543
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,883
-Okay.
-Kevin.

544
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,678
That's a manly name.

545
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,180
My name's Erin. With an "E."

546
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,474
For "everything you want."

547
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,853
Okay. Well, we should probably...

548
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,980
Should probably get started.

549
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,982
Erin? Do you want to join us?

550
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,443
-Yes.
-Erin.

551
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,944
I've got some questions.

552
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,363
Okay. Here we go.

553
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,074
Let me just get to my notes.

554
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,201
Okay.

555
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,203
All right, first off, I just want to say...

556
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,873
You know, we should probably start with
a very important question

557
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,543
that we're asking all of the applicants.

558
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,129
You know, are you seeing anyone right now?

559
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,382
-Seeing anyone?
-Yeah.

560
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,885
-Just for business purposes.
-Business purposes only.

561
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:03,762
Well, I'm seeing all three of you.

562
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,264
In front of me.

563
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:10,477
Just forget she even asked,
because if she did, that would be illegal, so...

564
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:11,895
Forgotten.

565
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,855
Jillian Holtzmann, <i>Radio Times.</i>

566
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,609
What have you been doing
with your whole life?

567
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,818
Great question.

568
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,112
Well, lots of different jobs.

569
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,823
I did the "actor thing."

570
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,409
-Worked for...
-I'm just gonna... Just real quick.

571
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,079
Can I ask why no glass?

572
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,749
Yeah. They just kept getting dirty,
so I took them out.

573
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,417
-That's...
-Don't have to clean them anymore.

574
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,543
-Oh, boy.
-And I can just...

575
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,587
-I got to try to keep that in mind.
-Yeah.

576
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,006
Would it be okay
if I bring Mike Hat to work sometimes?

577
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,217
He has major anxiety problems.

578
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,720
You know what? I would love
to let your cat live here with you,

579
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,098
but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

580
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,766
No, I don't have a cat.

581
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,394
He's a dog. His name is Mike Hat.

582
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,813
Your dog's name is My Cat?

583
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,356
No, Mike Hat.

584
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,692
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat?

585
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,527
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

586
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,279
I can't say that I'm allergic to dogs, so...

587
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,115
It's all right. He lives with my mum.

588
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,242
-Well, then we have that figured out.
-Okay. That was...

589
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,369
One down. No cat.

590
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,830
But you know what I say, let's jump ahead.

591
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,708
Kevin dabbles in web design.

592
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,628
And I asked him to throw together
maybe a couple of logos for us.

593
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,005
-You want to see them?
-Now is your moment.

594
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,297
Pull it out.

595
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,049
Sure.

596
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,802
You're like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

597
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:27,679
Here we go.

598
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,972
Okay, so...

599
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,141
What do you think of that?

600
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,147
Yeah, you do see how this
might make us look bad, right?

601
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,483
Is it the boobs you don't like?
'Cause I can make them bigger.

602
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,318
No, I can see them.

603
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,529
Yeah, I can definitely see them.

604
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,157
You know what? I think
it's not always about the end result.

605
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,658
It's about the journey.

606
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,160
Well, what about this one?

607
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,248
I think that's already a thing.

608
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,374
What, 7-1-1?

609
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,584
It's 7-Eleven.

610
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,044
Yep, it is. I have another option, though.

611
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,587
-Okay, please.
-It's this one.

612
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:02,839
That's one of my favorites.

613
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,717
I think you might've made a mistake.
I don't think that one's for us.

614
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,177
No. No, that's for you.

615
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,348
You know, I just thought the floating hot dog
implies that a ghost is holding it.

616
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,353
Your work is more cerebral than I expected.

617
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:17,520
See some more?

618
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:19,606
-Those are great.
-Yeah.

619
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,942
We're actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second,

620
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,652
so if you could just stand over there,

621
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,613
-we just need to convene for a moment.
-Okay.

622
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,073
-Sure. All right.
-Thank you.

623
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,366
Just go right over there.

624
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,575
Don't listen.

625
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,202
I won't.

626
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,245
He covered his eyes.

627
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:39,626
Guys, look, as much as
I would like to have him here to look at...

628
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:40,960
What?

629
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,213
You don't find him attractive?

630
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:44,839
Kevin?

631
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,967
God, no. Poor guy.

632
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,764
-I don't know, guys. I don't know.
-Come on, Erin.

633
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,265
We need help around here.

634
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,101
We cannot keep carrying
that equipment up here.

635
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,312
And I know the phones aren't ringing
off the hook right now, but they will be.

636
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:01,231
You know,
an aquarium is a submarine for fish.

637
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:02,816
Listen, let's just see
how the rest of the day goes.

638
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:07,195
You know, talk to other people, and we will
hire who is most qualified, okay? Deal?

639
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,531
There are no other people.
He's the only applicant.

640
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:10,573
Excellent.

641
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,245
God, that's loud.

642
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,913
-It's loud.
-It's loud.

643
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,916
Kevin. You got the job.

644
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,543
-Welcome aboard.
-Cool.

645
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,253
Can I bring my suitcases up?

646
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,587
Yep, you sure can.

647
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,256
Look at him.

648
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,384
Ma'am?

649
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:32,762
Hi, ma'am. If you're waiting for takeout,
you should really wait downstairs.

650
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,599
This... The magazine was here,
so, I don't know,

651
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,810
I just thought that might be
your waiting room.

652
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,104
You know, fun fact about this place,

653
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,773
that this building is built in the same place

654
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:47,318
as the first Chinese gambling den
in New York. Did you know that?

655
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,779
I mean, it's, like, coincidence.

656
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,532
Also, I got chased by a ghost.

657
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:54,909
What?

658
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,704
You know, up above us
was the old New York prison.

659
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,874
It's the first place in New York
that they electrocuted people.

660
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,418
I'm telling you, it used to take so long

661
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,379
that they'd just be like, "Shoot him.
We using too much electricity."

662
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,882
That's why I knew something weird
was going on down here, man.

663
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,801
Did you see that?

664
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,637
-Yes. I saw that.
-Did you see that?

665
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,556
-That wasn't me.
-I saw that quite a bit.

666
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,434
Wait, wait. Hey! Seriously? For real?

667
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,602
'Ey. Come on, man.

668
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,229
-Didn't I tell you?
-Is he down here all the time?

669
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,482
He think this is his art studio.

670
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:28,151
No, no. My studio is in SoHo.
This is more of a gallery.

671
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:29,486
Okay, hello there.

672
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:34,324
Have you seen a Class 4, semi-anchored
entity anywhere in the vicinity?

673
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:36,493
-You talking like a boat?
-Can you speak English?

674
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,661
-I'm being specifically clear.
-Let me. Let me.

675
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,331
Hi. Have you seen a ghost down here?

676
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,624
-Okay, that's clearer.
-Yeah.

677
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,417
-Yeah, I've seen a ghost.
-You, too?

678
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,502
Yeah.

679
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,170
Would you be able to describe it to us?

680
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,215
-Thank you.
-But...

681
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,716
Come on, man. Come on, man.

682
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,093
No, no, no, no. Let him, let him...

683
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,177
-I'll take a visual.
-No! I can't let him.

684
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,220
This is my job. I'm gonna get fired!

685
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,596
-We want the visual!
-No, no, this is very helpful.

686
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,264
This is not helpful for me.

687
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,392
'Ey. Look at me. Stop.

688
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,853
-Stop painting.
-I'm so sorry.

689
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,021
I don't like this on my wall.

690
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,064
You don't want it here anymore?

691
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,191
-I don't want this ghost on my wall.
-No ghost.

692
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:09,526
-Let me fix this, then.
-Well, I...

693
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,568
No ghosts allowed.

694
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,070
-You know what? You know what?
-Right?

695
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,405
-Get your ass up out of here.
-Come on.

696
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,614
Bye, Patty!

697
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,157
-I love you.
-Man!

698
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,701
This ain't art!

699
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,411
And y'all encouraging him.

700
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,787
Come on!

701
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:23,915
Come on!

702
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,545
Am I on crack, or is that a good logo?

703
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,297
Guys, I cannot do it by myself.

704
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,092
This equipment is untested
and highly unstable.

705
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:38,263
All right, ladies, we got a limited window
for when the next train arrives,

706
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:39,389
I'm telling you.

707
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:40,682
And don't touch the third rail

708
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,977
unless y'all little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts.

709
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,523
-Come on.
-You know what?

710
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,568
I should've gave you some coveralls, man.
It's so unsanitary down here.

711
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,739
You know, you don't usually think about
the amount of urine smell.

712
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,367
That's pretty much how it's gonna be.
It's not gonna freshen up at all.

713
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,952
Oh, boy. Okay.

714
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,538
Definitely got something over here.
Look at... Is that...

715
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,706
What is that, a burn?

716
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,458
That's where I saw that weird sparking thing.

717
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,709
What was it?

718
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,004
Baby, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't say "a weird sparking thing."

719
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,382
It looks like fission scorch.

720
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,135
What? Fission scorch down here?

721
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,511
Except that you're right.

722
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,890
What is... Wait, I'm smelling
both electrical discharge

723
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,558
-and isotopic decay.
-Isotopic decay.

724
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,101
How is that... Holtzmann?

725
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,437
-Yeah. What?
-Come here. I need your snoot on this.

726
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,272
Am I nuts?

727
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,523
'Ey, 'ey, ladies.

728
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,401
While y'all over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage,

729
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,195
we only got a couple of minutes.

730
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,615
Do you see that?

731
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,325
-The eyes.
-All right, Holtzmann.

732
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,660
-Now is not the time to be messing with...
-No.

733
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:45,997
Cream and sugar.

734
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,917
Hey, Patty, can I get some
illumination on this subject?

735
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,085
Yeah, I can put some light on that.

736
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,629
Oh, boy!

737
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:55,632
That is more and more unsettling.

738
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:58,301
That's the dude I saw!
I'm telling you, that's him!

739
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,594
We got another Class 4,

740
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,847
and this one's even more ionized
than the one at the Aldridge Mansion.

741
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,974
Where are these ghosts coming from?

742
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:06,685
You know what?
I got to get this thing on film.

743
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:07,811
-Holtzmann?
-Yup.

744
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:08,895
-Power us up.
-Okay.

745
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,314
'Cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab.

746
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,983
This is a little rough.
It's in its early stages. Got to be honest.

747
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,819
Just gonna plug these things in here.

748
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,321
-Okay, Erin, come here.
-Let me document this.

749
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:20,990
-Grab it, grab it.
-Wait.

750
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,243
That's gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost, okay?

751
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,286
So whenever I say, "Go," you just do that.

752
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,497
Why am I operating
the untested nuclear laser?

753
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,040
You have the longest arms.

754
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,500
You guys might want to hurry up.

755
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,336
Oh, my God. I forgot the most important part.

756
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,838
Yeah. Sorry.

757
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:38,508
Erin, this is just a little bit of grounding
so you don't die immediately.

758
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,968
Do you know your iron level?

759
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,470
It's fine.

760
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:45,140
You have done this before, right?

761
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,474
Okay, Erin, on my cue.

762
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,226
Aim the barrel at him.

763
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,979
Ready, aim, fire!

764
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,111
Okay, this is a little underwhelming.
Can we get more power?

765
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,529
And once again, fire!

766
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,741
This isn't working!

767
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,452
Can this beam get any stronger?

768
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,829
Well, not at the moment.

769
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,588
That's the train! We got to move!

770
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,214
Just try to lure him back to the platform!

771
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:20,759
Grab her!

772
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,511
-Come on!
-Move, move, move!

773
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:24,554
Come on, move!

774
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,724
-Hurry!
-That's the express train!

775
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,309
And it's not stopping!

776
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,603
It's coming! Get her up!

777
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,064
Not the collar!

778
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,824
Well, I guess he going to Queens.

779
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,535
He's gonna be the third scariest thing
on that train.

780
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,579
God, did you see that?

781
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,706
You can't see anything.

782
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:55,251
My God! I mean,
that power surge really held him.

783
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,337
We need more juice.

784
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,963
We need to be more mobile.
I know what to do.

785
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,423
-Yes.
-I almost got killed.

786
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,050
Yeah, I know. It was so awesome.

787
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,093
It was awesome.

788
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,723
Everyone thinks this video is fake.
Look at these comments.

789
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,101
We have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it, you guys.

790
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:13,603
I mean, this stuff is real.
We have to be able to prove it.

791
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,605
We will. And you shouldn't
be reading this stuff.

792
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,565
You're not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write

793
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:18,775
in the middle of the night online.

794
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,735
Look at...
"Bogus equipment"? You know what?

795
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,154
I'd love you to meet me any place, any time.

796
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,156
No, no, no, let's... You're right. We should...

797
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,784
-Here is your coffee, Abby.
-Thank you.

798
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,703
Did you get sugar in it this time?

799
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,751
I hate coffee.

800
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,461
-Yeah, the sugar's in there.
-Sugar's in it.

801
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,130
I'll take it.

802
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,757
Don't want to waste a cup of coffee.

803
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,052
Can we just pretend
that didn't happen, please?

804
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,221
All right, well, what do you think?

805
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,557
I... You know what? I just can't watch that.

806
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:54,394
I'm not sure.
I mean, it's just a lot of bits and pieces.

807
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,896
I'm pretty sure none of it is
supposed to be in the subway, though.

808
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,441
It's like it was part of a miniature cyclotron.

809
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,818
And they used a chromium alloy for the hull.

810
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,822
I would've used aluminum, but I'm crazy.

811
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,992
What's that weird thing that guy said
to the lady from the subway?

812
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,994
I know what you're talking about.

813
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:12,954
Fourth Cataclysm. Yeah.

814
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,123
-Hi.
-Fourth Cataclysm.

815
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,459
That sound like a franchise
nobody ever wanted.

816
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,336
Yeah, you guys, you have a visitor.

817
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,504
She's here to see you in the booth.

818
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,590
Booth number one. With the earrings.

819
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,134
-Yeah.
-Yeah. We see her now.

820
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,260
-Thanks.
-No worries.

821
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,553
I'm joining the club.

822
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,681
Well, it's not really a... I'm sorry.

823
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,185
Kevin. Hi, can you answer the phone, please?

824
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,936
-I can't. It's in the fish tank.
-No.

825
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,396
The one on the desk that's ringing. That one.

826
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,023
-That one.
-Yep.

827
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,400
-Oh, my God.
-What's this place called again?

828
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,819
Conductors of
the Metaphysical Examination. Talk.

829
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,198
Got it. Conductors of Metamucils and Stuff.

830
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,159
Slow down. I... What...

831
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:54,704
They hung up?

832
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,873
No, I was just not into that conversation.

833
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,710
Kevin, I'm really gonna need you
to try a little harder. Okay, buddy?

834
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,129
Well, if they call back, I will.
I got to take off, though.

835
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,216
I'm in a hide-and-seek tournament,
and we are in the semis.

836
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:09,552
Kevin, I'm gonna need you
to pick up all those suitcases.

837
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,305
Did you hurt your face?

838
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:15,684
Hey, did y'all hire that big dumb dude?

839
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,851
Bye!

840
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,770
Man, I got a cousin Mookie.

841
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:22,232
He is half as stupid,
and he will work for Vienna sausages.

842
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:26,736
The thing is, this isn't really a club.
It's a scientific research group.

843
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,155
And I understand that,
but let me tell you something.

844
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,825
I read a lot of nonfiction,

845
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:34,703
and you guys know
a lot about this science stuff,

846
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:35,787
but I know New York.

847
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,580
And check this out!

848
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,916
I can borrow a car from my uncle,

849
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,252
and y'all won't have to lug
all this heavy equipment around.

850
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,254
-Guys, we got to get a car.
-Come on, baby.

851
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:47,799
You need me. You need Patty.
Patty come with benefits. You need me.

852
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,426
Stop playing like you don't.

853
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:50,593
You're in.

854
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,598
Yeah.

855
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,728
You get a car,
and you get a car, and you get a car!

856
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:04,274
You didn't disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse.

857
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:08,319
I'm sorry. My uncle owns a funeral home,
not a Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

858
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,530
Hope you checked to see
there wasn't a body in the back.

859
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:13,783
I don't think so. I don't really know.

860
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,035
You didn't check?

861
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,286
I mean, I was in a hurry.

862
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:19,122
I checked to see if we had gas.
That was more important.

863
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,248
So there is a body?

864
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,459
Let Holtzmann check.
She likes that type of stuff.

865
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,712
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today.

866
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:27,464
No, Dr. Frankenstein,

867
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,008
we got to turn in the body
if there's one in there.

868
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,719
-All right.
-Don't do that.

869
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:35,388
Based on the results
of the subway field test...

870
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,973
The one where you were
almost killed, remember?

871
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,141
I remember.

872
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:42,687
I added a booster using microfabricated
radio-frequency quadrupoles

873
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:45,565
to speed up particles
before entering the DLA device,

874
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,401
portable, wearable for maximum flexibility.

875
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:51,654
Then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync

876
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,824
plus Holtzy's hollow beam to this baby,
and <i>voilГ .</i>

877
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:56,076
We got a ghost in there.

878
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,703
-Slap me.
-Okay.

879
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,205
I will slap you as...

880
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,374
I just want to say
what an exciting moment this is.

881
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,376
Holtzmann, I am beyond impressed.

882
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,086
Abby, is that comfortable?

883
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,171
It's a lot heavier than I expected,

884
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,049
and I'm pretty sure
it's compacting my spinal column, but...

885
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:13,176
-So you're gonna want to plant your feet firm.
-Okay.

886
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:15,762
Bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback.

887
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:18,014
All right. Turning the machine on.

888
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,686
Boy, she's got an impressive purr.

889
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,438
All right, so that's the target right there.

890
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,941
Just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there.

891
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,693
-Yeah.
-And go to town.

892
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:30,777
Okay.

893
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:32,821
And here we go!

894
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,204
I guess she's not
bending her knees enough, right?

895
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:45,625
She's doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon.

896
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,211
We just got to let her ride it out
until she's out of juice.

897
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,046
She's corkscrewing me!

898
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:51,798
Abby, I'll make some adjustments.

899
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,216
It's like fighting a gator!

900
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,054
So, how did the two of you guys meet?

901
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:01,307
Abby transferred
to my high school, junior year.

902
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,851
Go, Karate Cats.

903
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:06,771
We started telling ghost stories,
and we just kind of bonded right away.

904
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,566
And all the other kids were, you know,
getting drunk and going to parties,

905
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,693
and we're like, "That's stupid."

906
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,362
Plus, we were never invited to the parties.

907
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:18,742
No, I think that's because we told
very, very scary ghost stories,

908
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:20,660
and I think the other kids were terrified of us.

909
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,037
That's what was actually happening.

910
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:25,206
So, how did y'all get into ghosts?
Did one of you see one?

911
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:27,375
Yeah, I did.

912
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,460
Really?

913
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,756
When I was eight years old,
the mean old lady that lived next door died.

914
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:37,302
And that night, I woke up

915
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,387
and she was standing at the foot of my bed,

916
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,682
just staring at me.

917
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:49,481
She did that every night for almost a year.

918
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:50,690
What?

919
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:55,070
And I told my parents,
and they didn't believe me.

920
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:56,946
Still don't believe me.

921
00:44:57,822 --> 00:44:59,699
I had to go to therapy for years,

922
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:02,660
and the kids at school found out,

923
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:05,622
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me,

924
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,165
call me "ghost girl."

925
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,462
Abby was the only person who believed me.

926
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,465
Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.

927
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:17,092
Thanks.

928
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:19,219
-I have some questions.
-Seriously?

929
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,722
It was a long time ago.

930
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,436
Hello.

931
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,980
Looking forward to this metal show.

932
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:32,899
Hi.

933
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:35,026
Ozzy rocks!

934
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:37,070
Yeah!

935
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,154
Yes.

936
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:40,115
He certainly does rock.

937
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,704
This world cannot be cleansed fast enough.

938
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:47,122
Hi.

939
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,248
Enjoy the show.

940
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:50,500
Rock and roll.

941
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:55,130
<i>A local team of paranormal investigators</i>
<i>released a video of a proclaimed ghost.</i>

942
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:58,591
<i>You can see clearly there's something</i>
<i>in the picture that isn't easily explained.</i>

943
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,886
Oh, my God! They're showing the video!
We famous! We famous.

944
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,555
<i>As a result, there are</i>
<i>a lot of questions being asked now</i>

945
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:05,473
<i>about the people who shot the video.</i>

946
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:09,019
<i>So, what do we think of these Ghostbusters?</i>
<i>Are they to be taken seriously? And...</i>

947
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,937
"Ghostbusters"? That is not our name.

948
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,397
They can't just make up a name
and just call us...

949
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,523
<i>I spoke with Martin Heiss earlier.</i>

950
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:14,983
<i>-He's with the Council for Logic and Data.</i>
-Okay.

951
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,359
-Martin Heiss. Okay, okay.
-Okay.

952
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,154
<i>He is a famed debunker of the paranormal.</i>

953
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:21,364
<i>Dr. Heiss, you're a highly regarded</i>
<i>scientific authority.</i>

954
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,408
<i>-Your credentials are impeccable.</i>
<i>-Thank you, Pat.</i>

955
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,578
<i>If you see something</i>
<i>of true scientific interest in this video,</i>

956
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:30,540
<i>that goes a long way to legitimize these</i>
<i>Ghostbusters and everything they stand for.</i>

957
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,459
<i>A game changer, yes.</i>

958
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,462
<i>So, tell me, Dr. Heiss, is this for real?</i>

959
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,964
<i>Hell no.</i>

960
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:40,550
So, now we're the ghost girls.

961
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,594
I feel your pain, Erin.

962
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:45,472
No. You know what? Screw that.

963
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:47,015
We are scientists.

964
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,391
-Plus Patty.
-Thank you.

965
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,102
Okay, we believe in provable,
physical results.

966
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,771
-That's what we believe in.
-Yes, we do!

967
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:54,064
-Preach.
-I will preach.

968
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:55,357
You know what we're gonna do, ladies?

969
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,567
We're gonna catch a ghost,
we're gonna bring...

970
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:58,943
God.

971
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,738
We're gonna catch a ghost,
bring it back to the lab...

972
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:03,073
-Kevin?
-Yes, boss?

973
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,574
Can you answer the phone
that's ringing, please?

974
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:06,368
-Buddy.
-Yes, I can, boss.

975
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,745
Ghostbusters.

976
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:10,413
-"Conductors of the Metaphysical..."
-Okay.

977
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,706
Cool. See ya.

978
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,417
Hey, guys, which one of these
makes me look more like a doctor?

979
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:18,213
Me playing saxophone
or me listening to saxophone?

980
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:20,173
Who was on the phone?

981
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,092
The Stonebrook Theatre.

982
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,593
There's a goat on the loose.

983
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:26,304
I'm gonna load up the car.

984
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,515
Okay, okay, okay!

985
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,016
Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!

986
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:34,437
Hey, hey, hey, you guys,
I got these from work.

987
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:35,730
I'm making it official, man.

988
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,607
You put one of these on,
you won't get slimed again.

989
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:38,692
That's great.

990
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,360
Hey!

991
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:41,903
Look at this beauty!

992
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,616
Wait a minute, what did you do
to my uncle's hearse?

993
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,701
I fixed it.

994
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,120
Man, this is so inappropriate for this vehicle.

995
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,122
We have fun.

996
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,242
-Let's go.
-Let's go...

997
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:30,452
-Did you want to...
-I'm sorry.

998
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:31,911
-I'll let you. I'll let you.
-Next time.

999
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,427
Are you the Ghostbusters?

1000
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,095
Actually, we're
the Conductors of the Metaphysical...

1001
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,181
We're... Yes. We're the Ghostbusters.

1002
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,316
"There's a chicken frying itself in the library."

1003
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,526
-That is strange.
-That is not what he said.

1004
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,320
Please, follow me.

1005
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,406
Right away. Please, all of you.

1006
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,410
Fernando was down here when
something crawled out of a wall vent, and...

1007
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,788
I heard him screaming, so I went to check,

1008
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:19,209
and that's when the "thing" was
tossing Fernando all around the room.

1009
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:22,337
I thought it was gonna kill him.
I shrieked when I saw it. I...

1010
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:26,216
I guess I scared it, because I'm told
that I have a very disturbing scream.

1011
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,634
I could see that.

1012
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:30,512
Anyway, if you could just mosey around,
you'll probably bump into it.

1013
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,638
'Kay, girls?

1014
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,307
All right. Well, we know
it's down here somewhere.

1015
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:37,268
Let's split up, and if you see anything,
get on the walkie.

1016
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:39,688
Roger.

1017
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,539
Holtzmann! Come on!

1018
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,290
The hat is too much, right?

1019
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,792
Is it the wig or the hat?

1020
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,210
Come on.

1021
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,649
Guys, I think I got
another one of those devices.

1022
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,651
I just thought this was gonna be
like a book club.

1023
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,778
Play some Stevie Nicks albums, you know?

1024
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:32,115
'Cause I'm telling you right now,
if I see two twins from <i>The Shining,</i>

1025
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:33,199
I'm gonna pass out.

1026
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,579
Okay, yep.

1027
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,290
Room full of nightmares. Not going in there.

1028
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:42,834
I don't understand
how I get wrapped up in this stuff.

1029
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,087
I had a good job at the MTA.

1030
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:49,466
Was it perfect?
No, of course it wasn't perfect.

1031
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:52,427
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

1032
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:56,931
Was that there before?

1033
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,142
Please do not answer.

1034
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,603
I said, don't answer!

1035
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:06,816
Okay...

1036
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:13,823
Hi.

1037
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,993
It's a full paranormal transferal embodiment.

1038
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:20,205
Erin, all of our theories
on spectral possession are true.

1039
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,041
There's a ghost in that thing, and I want it.

1040
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:24,167
Let's light 'em up!

1041
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,388
Run! We're gonna lose it! Come on!

1042
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,014
-I love your fire!
-Man.

1043
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:49,859
Upstairs! Go, go, go! Come on!

1044
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,530
<i>Why fear what's around you?</i>

1045
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:56,074
<i>It could be everything you dreamed</i>
<i>And it's about to be true</i>

1046
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,618
<i>Yeah</i>

1047
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:02,038
<i>Come with the one who wants to</i>
<i>drag you away from the shore</i>

1048
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:03,206
<i>'Cause you're looking for more</i>

1049
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,750
<i>You want some more</i>

1050
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,253
That's not mine!

1051
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,466
I think those machines
are making them stronger!

1052
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,010
That thing is super ionized!

1053
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:16,553
And super not-benign!

1054
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:19,180
This music is so terrible,
it's making him more angry.

1055
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:20,640
Play something gentle!

1056
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:23,852
<i>Behold the power of the undead!</i>

1057
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:27,480
<i>We have summoned Satan himself!</i>

1058
00:52:27,939 --> 00:52:29,899
<i>For we are the kings of all...</i>

1059
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,743
-Let's do this!
-Go, go.

1060
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,092
This auditorium is Art Deco, you idiots!

1061
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,886
Aim for the ghost!

1062
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,141
Hey, Patty, you take that aisle.
I'll take the far one.

1063
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:06,269
Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!
We need to get up those aisles!

1064
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:08,938
All right, move, people!
I need to get down that aisle!

1065
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:11,649
If you're not gonna move,
you're gonna become part of this operation!

1066
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,485
All right, heads up!

1067
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:15,570
Come on! Move me left!

1068
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,281
Watch the rings. Watch the rings.

1069
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,866
Okay, you sweaty freaks.

1070
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,993
I'm 'bout to save you from this ghost!

1071
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:31,628
Okay, so I don't know if it was a race thing
or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell.

1072
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,421
-Pick me up!
-All right, put me down!

1073
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,965
Put me down! Down, down, thank you.

1074
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:39,427
Okay, Patty, stay still!

1075
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,680
-You have sort of a...
-Okay, I just...

1076
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,431
I don't need you to tell me
anything right now.

1077
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,809
-No, no, no... You got a...
-Nope.

1078
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,561
I really need you not to tell me
anything right now.

1079
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,814
-But, Patty, there...
-Hey. I'm tired.

1080
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:51,898
-No, no, no...
-Listen...

1081
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:53,441
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off,
how about that?

1082
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,652
No, no, no,
I don't really think that's a good idea.

1083
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,946
-Going to take off...
-Come on, Patty. Patty!

1084
00:53:57,987 --> 00:54:02,033
And I don't want to piss off the ghost.

1085
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:06,496
Moving, going back to my booth at the MTA,

1086
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,707
so let me know if you need some MetroCards.

1087
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,458
-Do it, do it, do it.
-'Cause I am...

1088
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:13,169
-Really?
-All right, ladies, light 'em up!

1089
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,171
Patty, stay still.

1090
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:16,840
Just don't hit Patty anywhere important.

1091
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:18,174
-What?
-Nothing!

1092
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:23,596
You gonna get it now!

1093
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:27,934
Holtz, open that trap!

1094
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,144
Okay.

1095
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:31,688
And I'm gonna open it on three.

1096
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,148
-Holtzmann!
-Ready?

1097
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,983
-Sweetie!
-Two...

1098
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:37,193
-Open the box!
-And one. Okay!

1099
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:43,241
Erin, doing great. Abby, doing great.

1100
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,160
Patty, try a little harder, okay?

1101
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:46,870
Get in the box, you hellion!

1102
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:50,582
Come on, we got you!

1103
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:51,708
Come on.

1104
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:02,594
Excuse me, gotta get...
Excuse me, excuse me.

1105
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:03,803
I got a ghost to get. Thank you.

1106
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:12,437
Did we just catch a ghost?

1107
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,563
Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,398
We put a ghost in a box!

1109
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:20,570
<i>You want some more, you want some more?</i>

1110
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:21,863
Yes!

1111
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,990
<i>What you're looking for</i>
<i>You want some more...</i>

1112
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:25,075
Right in there!

1113
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:27,410
<i>We are the Beasts of Mayhem!</i>

1114
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,336
Sorry, can't buy you another one.

1115
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:37,420
Yeah!

1116
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,760
Sharon! I think I'm having another flashback!

1117
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,012
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1118
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:47,555
-My gosh.
-Thanks so much.

1119
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:49,265
Why are there ghosts in New York?

1120
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:51,935
We made magic today,
and that's all I got to say. I'm Holtzmann.

1121
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,687
Where are these ghosts coming from?

1122
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:56,856
Are there any more ghosts
inside the theater?

1123
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,441
I think we took it out.

1124
00:55:58,525 --> 00:55:59,567
Listen, we're scientists.

1125
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:03,113
We're here for the unanswerable questions
and, really, to pursue truth.

1126
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:04,447
We're the Ghostbusters!

1127
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,949
Yeah!

1128
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,453
Nope. I had him yesterday.

1129
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:11,705
So?

1130
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:12,956
So, it's your turn.

1131
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:15,125
Weirdo city.

1132
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,210
Charge the lines.

1133
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,629
Create the vortex.

1134
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:21,798
Break the barrier.

1135
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:25,260
Enjoy your fun, Ghostbusters.

1136
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:29,014
For soon, you shall bow down before me.

1137
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:44,863
There he is.

1138
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:46,865
Come on, Kevin. Let's go.

1139
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:47,991
Kev.

1140
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:49,159
Go, Kev.

1141
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,369
Go, Kev. Go, Kev.

1142
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:52,454
Go, Kev.

1143
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,122
Stop, Kev.

1144
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,665
-Watch it!
-Stop, Kev.

1145
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,625
-Watch it.
-Stop it, Kevin.

1146
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,216
Please.

1147
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,512
Get it. Get it.

1148
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:11,806
This is so good. We have to celebrate.

1149
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,808
-Come on! This is what...
-You're right, you're right.

1150
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,352
-Yep.
-...legit feels like.

1151
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,436
-Right here. This.
-Yep.

1152
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:17,729
Oh, my God.

1153
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,357
You have to stop kissing this.

1154
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,526
That... It just makes me feel
so warm and tingly inside.

1155
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,320
That's probably the radiation.

1156
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:29,574
Hey, guys, I got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here,

1157
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:31,618
if you want to just turn your head.

1158
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:35,789
I got some newly printed circuit boards,
and I rebuilt the superconducting magnets.

1159
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,123
I improved beam accuracy

1160
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,417
by adding a plasma shield
to the RF discharge chamber.

1161
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,711
I have cryocooler to reduce helium boil-off,

1162
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:45,423
and to top it all off,
we got a freakin' Faraday cage

1163
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,634
to attenuate RF noise and avoid quenching.

1164
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:50,845
-Nice!
-All right!

1165
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,847
There's a Smartin Christ here to see you.

1166
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:55,934
Smartin Christ?

1167
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:58,269
Wait, are you saying "Martin Heiss"?

1168
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,896
-Doctor...
-No. No.

1169
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,065
Dr. Martin Heiss, the famed scientist
and paranormal debunker?

1170
00:58:02,148 --> 00:58:04,109
-He's in this building right now?
-Yeah, that guy.

1171
00:58:05,568 --> 00:58:07,237
Okay, you tell him that we're not here.

1172
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,364
-Wait, what? What?
-I don't want to talk to him.

1173
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,407
They're not here.

1174
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:15,662
Dr. Heiss, hello. Welcome. Dr. Erin Gilbert.

1175
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:20,000
Is this a good time, Doctor,
or is this dinner rush?

1176
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:22,585
Why don't you call
and make an appointment?

1177
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:23,920
It's actually a perfect time.

1178
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:28,174
We were just
doing some experiments over here.

1179
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,886
Yes, please, have a seat.

1180
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:33,263
Let's start light and easy.

1181
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:39,352
Why are you pretending to catch ghosts?

1182
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:44,107
You know, it's really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer,

1183
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,942
when you don't actually do anything.

1184
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:49,946
You know that we only comprehend
about 4% of the universe.

1185
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,281
4%!

1186
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,950
-Across the board! It's four!
-Abby, Abby...

1187
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:57,787
We all believe in the scientific method.

1188
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,581
I've dedicated my life to it.

1189
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:04,210
And we have actually done it.

1190
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:07,130
Today, at 4:32 p.m.,

1191
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:11,509
we successfully trapped a Class 3 vapor.

1192
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:12,761
You're telling me

1193
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:14,971
there is a ghost

1194
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:17,807
inside that thermos?

1195
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,934
-In that can?
-Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1196
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:21,603
Booyah. Emphasis on the "boo."

1197
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,897
Well, I would love to see that. I really would.

1198
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,192
Shoot. You know what?
You're not gonna get that treat today.

1199
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:30,945
We're still assessing what type
of containment method we're gonna use.

1200
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:33,948
We're testing the lab... In the...

1201
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:38,578
So, till we figure out
how to best keep the entity,

1202
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,081
that's not gonna happen.

1203
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,624
How's that for my timing?

1204
00:59:42,665 --> 00:59:44,209
I come.

1205
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,628
You've caught a ghost. I can't see it.

1206
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,339
Look, I know it probably
sounds like we're making this up.

1207
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:51,424
-Yeah.
-It sounds crazy,

1208
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:55,387
and we probably don't really look like
legitimate scientists.

1209
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,931
No, you only lack the proper equipment,

1210
00:59:58,014 --> 01:00:01,142
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of.

1211
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:05,897
Said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat.

1212
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:07,148
It was my mother's.

1213
01:00:07,732 --> 01:00:09,025
Yeah, that is an awesome hat.

1214
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,528
All right, man. Thanks for stopping by.

1215
01:00:12,278 --> 01:00:14,531
Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.

1216
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,075
You want to see it?

1217
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:20,203
I would love to see it.

1218
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:21,371
Well, he can't see it.

1219
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:23,790
I'm going to show it to you, then.
How about that?

1220
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:25,792
-Gear up, you guys.
-No, you're not. Don't.

1221
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:29,546
Excuse me. Why are you doing this?

1222
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,131
Because he doesn't believe us.

1223
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:34,009
Erin. Come on, we have finally succeeded

1224
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,511
at doing the thing that we have talked about
since we were little kids.

1225
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,222
And you want to risk it all, what, for him?

1226
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:41,057
Who cares if you impress him?

1227
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:43,727
Golly, you two are something.

1228
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:45,645
You're right. I'm sorry.

1229
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:47,230
-I don't...
-Okay.

1230
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:48,690
-I don't know what I was thinking.
-All right.

1231
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:49,858
It's okay.

1232
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:53,570
Attagirl!

1233
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:54,696
Sorry. I did it. I'm sorry.

1234
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:55,780
-My God!
-I know!

1235
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:56,948
Casper?

1236
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:02,996
Man!

1237
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:05,331
Hey, that man went out the wrong door.

1238
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,336
Oh, my God.

1239
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:13,089
Who threw him out the window?

1240
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:15,258
A ghost threw him out the window.

1241
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:16,634
You mean like Patrick Swayze?

1242
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,511
Like, he's sitting behind you,
making some pottery?

1243
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,347
Yeah. Like Patrick Swayze.

1244
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,767
That's it. Then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the Catskills.

1245
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,852
And then we sat down,
and he was behind me,

1246
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:26,936
and we made a vase.

1247
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:28,146
You're combining the two...

1248
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:29,939
-I combined a couple of Swayze movies.
-Yeah.

1249
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,274
You know what was a good one?
<i>Road House.</i>

1250
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:32,609
I loved <i>Road House.</i>

1251
01:01:32,692 --> 01:01:33,777
<i>-Point Break.</i>
-He was a...

1252
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,944
<i>Point Break.</i>

1253
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:36,404
Come on. At the end with the big wave?

1254
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,572
He was a ghost in that, too!

1255
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:38,865
Well, you don't know if he dies at the end.

1256
01:01:38,948 --> 01:01:41,368
He doesn't die.
He doesn't die. They don't say he dies.

1257
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,619
Well, now what?

1258
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,122
-Who are you guys?
-Official business.

1259
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,624
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

1260
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:48,917
-What?
-You need to come with us.

1261
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:49,959
-What?
-Why?

1262
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,336
The mayor needs a word, ladies.

1263
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,303
Mayor.

1264
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,597
Hey! There you are.

1265
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,475
Welcome. Sorry for the mess
and for the drama.

1266
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,435
Please, come sit down. Take that one.

1267
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,562
Good. That's right.
And, you, that's a good one for you.

1268
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:12,023
And take the end seat. Good.

1269
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:14,484
That's not so good.

1270
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:16,236
No feet on the table, please.

1271
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,821
Sir, we don't have a lot of time.

1272
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:19,072
-And we're not frauds.
-No.

1273
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,532
-We are legitimate scientists.
-Let me interrupt you.

1274
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:22,033
We know you're not frauds,

1275
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:24,661
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely.

1276
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:27,872
Agents Hawkins and Rorke
are with Homeland Security.

1277
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:32,043
So we've been investigating
this extremely quietly.

1278
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,671
-Okay.
-So, what do you know?

1279
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:38,008
We believe that someone is creating a device

1280
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,385
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity.

1281
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:42,637
And that activity can be escalating now

1282
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:45,140
and giving us an even larger scale event.

1283
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:47,183
"Larger scale." Well, that sounds terrible.

1284
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,103
Okay, well,
you've been doing great work. Well done.

1285
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:52,522
We really appreciate it,
but it's time to knock it off.

1286
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:54,941
-What?
-Knock it off.

1287
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:57,986
No, I heard you and I see the hand gesture.
What does...

1288
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:00,280
These gentlemen are on it.
Let the government do their work.

1289
01:03:00,363 --> 01:03:04,909
We're just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention...

1290
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,536
-Exactly.
-...to yourselves.

1291
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,704
What?

1292
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:09,664
-Patty does wear big earrings.
-Patty.

1293
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:13,877
Well, if it's a crime to look good,
guilty as charged.

1294
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:17,213
Other than that, I feel like
we keep a very low profile.

1295
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:18,882
You drive a hearse with a ghost on it,

1296
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:21,384
and you use a distinctly
un-American-sounding siren.

1297
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:22,469
We do.

1298
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,220
Do you have any idea
how many federal regulations

1299
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:25,805
you're breaking on a daily basis?

1300
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,223
-One?
-No.

1301
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:29,309
-Two?
-No.

1302
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:30,393
Is it one?

1303
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:32,062
Just sit quietly.

1304
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:33,563
Here's the essence of the deal.

1305
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:36,566
We are gonna have to
make the public believe

1306
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:37,942
that you are frauds.

1307
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:39,986
-What? Wait. Why?
-What?

1308
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,572
The human brain, you know,
it can only handle so much.

1309
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:45,700
If everybody knew what was going on,
you know, there'd be a panic.

1310
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:50,413
So, we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax.

1311
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,792
'Cause, otherwise, there'd be mass hysteria.

1312
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:57,128
We don't want mass hysteria either.

1313
01:03:57,212 --> 01:04:00,006
Our main concern is that
we're allowed to continue our work.

1314
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,801
-Yes, that is very important.
-Very important.

1315
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:09,766
But my concern is, I feel like the cat is sort of
already kind of out of the bag.

1316
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:13,186
I think what they're saying is
the cat is out of the bag.

1317
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:16,773
They want us to put the cat
back inside the bag.

1318
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:17,941
No, I know that's what they're saying.

1319
01:04:17,982 --> 01:04:20,026
-But I'm saying the cat's already out.
-I know. I know it's out.

1320
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,861
-So it's hard to put the cat back in.
-It's not impossible.

1321
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,863
-But that's why they have that saying.
-It's a nonsense saying.

1322
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:25,615
If the cat is outta the bag,
you can't put it back in!

1323
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:26,700
I put a cat in a bag all the time.

1324
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:27,784
But once the cat is out of the bag,

1325
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,035
aren't you like, "The cat is out of the bag!"

1326
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,162
We just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag.

1327
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,039
The cat has been out of the bag before,

1328
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:35,625
and yet, people lose interest
and put it back in.

1329
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,127
People always move on.

1330
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,338
Sheriff in New Mexico
reports a UFO encounter.

1331
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:43,717
The crew of the <i>SS Ourang Medan</i>
dies mysteriously.

1332
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,303
The entire town of Langville, Montana,
goes missing.

1333
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:48,847
It does?

1334
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:49,973
Okay, but he...

1335
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,975
We're talking about relocating.

1336
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:55,228
No one's being killed here, right?

1337
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:57,397
They were turned inside out.

1338
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,858
Their skin is on the inside of their body?

1339
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:04,154
Their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside.

1340
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:05,822
But they're okay, right?

1341
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:07,407
Sure.

1342
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,325
I think they're dead.

1343
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:12,912
On that horrifying note,
thank you all so much for coming.

1344
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:17,083
Now, the mayor said we could
continue our work, and so we shall.

1345
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,209
We got to be prepared.

1346
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:21,171
That's why I've made a table of treats.

1347
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:23,006
Erin, you've had a hard day. Step right up.

1348
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,299
Pick a gun, any gun.

1349
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:26,426
No!

1350
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:28,136
I'm sorry, not that gun.

1351
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:30,180
That one's not ready. It's yours when it is.

1352
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:31,556
Here, in the meantime...

1353
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:33,516
This.

1354
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:35,894
What does it do?

1355
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:37,520
It's a Swiss Army knife.

1356
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,647
No woman should walk around unarmed.

1357
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:41,274
I know what it does.

1358
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,693
-Also, here, why don't you take this.
-Yeah?

1359
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:45,820
Give that a toss.

1360
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:47,864
That's gonna send up a little poof.

1361
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,866
It's only dangerous to ghosts.

1362
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:51,326
-All right.
-Okay.

1363
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,331
Nice!

1364
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:02,837
Yeah, my mistake. It was a medium poof.

1365
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,215
This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.

1366
01:06:05,256 --> 01:06:09,177
Hollow-laser technology,
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.

1367
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,263
Step up to bat and do what you're gonna do.

1368
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:15,183
You truly scare me.
I just want to let you know that.

1369
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:18,853
I'm gonna just...

1370
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:26,611
Come on!

1371
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,988
It's like Mardi Gras in there.

1372
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:30,657
It's a proton glove.

1373
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,910
It's gonna maximize flexibility
during hand-to-specter combat.

1374
01:06:33,993 --> 01:06:36,079
Just give it a punch, it's motion-activated.

1375
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:48,758
Okay. That

1376
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:51,136
was awesome!

1377
01:06:55,932 --> 01:06:57,892
-No, that is a deadly high five.
-No.

1378
01:06:57,934 --> 01:06:59,269
-No.
-Hey, ladies,

1379
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:01,563
I'd call this a successful test.

1380
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,151
<i>It's fraudulent and unsafe, frankly.</i>

1381
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:10,321
<i>You know, these Ghostbusters</i>
<i>are creating an unnecessary panic</i>

1382
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,157
<i>-in a sad grab for fame.</i>
-It's fine.

1383
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,659
<i>People can rest assured</i>
<i>that these women are fake.</i>

1384
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:17,537
Well, it's official. We're all ghost girls now.

1385
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,165
All right, I would like
to remind everybody here

1386
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:22,625
that in a very short amount of time,

1387
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:26,004
we have seen
multiple Class 4 malevolent apparitions.

1388
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:27,297
-Yeah.
-We did.

1389
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:29,257
Who cares what anybody else
is saying about us?

1390
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:30,467
We know what we're doing.

1391
01:07:30,508 --> 01:07:34,054
I mean, all morning,
I've been reading about this stuff.

1392
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,472
There's sightings all over the city.

1393
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:38,391
"Wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th."

1394
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:41,895
Another one,
"Spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th."

1395
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:45,273
Then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at Chelsea.

1396
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:50,403
-Wait. Did you say 6th and 26th?
-Yeah. "Wailing spirits, 6th and 26th."

1397
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:54,032
6th and 26th. 6th and 26th. Okay.

1398
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:55,283
6th and 26th.

1399
01:07:56,284 --> 01:08:00,580
Aldridge Mansion. Upper West Side. Yes?
70... 72nd.

1400
01:08:00,663 --> 01:08:01,998
Where did we find the first device?

1401
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,751
-At the subway, right here.
-Okay.

1402
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:06,336
Theater. Downtown. Downtown.

1403
01:08:06,419 --> 01:08:08,088
-Downtown?
-Yes, yes. In here.

1404
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,631
Okay, what was the other address you said?

1405
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:12,133
Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.

1406
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:13,635
And the one in Chelsea?

1407
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:17,472
-Chelsea is at 10th Avenue and 18th.
-18th. 10th and 18th.

1408
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:30,819
What do those look like to you?

1409
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:34,072
It's an "X." Touching other little "X's."

1410
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:35,532
-Ley lines.
-Ley lines.

1411
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:36,825
What's "ley lines"?

1412
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:40,578
It's a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the Earth.

1413
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,872
It's a current of supernatural energy.

1414
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:46,459
Supposedly, if you look at sacred sites
and weird events all over the world,

1415
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:48,837
and connect them with lines
where they intersect,

1416
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:51,423
it's an unusually powerful spot.

1417
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:52,716
Abby and I just dismissed this theory

1418
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:55,719
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit.

1419
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,429
Dismiss this.

1420
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:02,851
Okay. That looks like it's got some merit.

1421
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,022
He's using the devices
to charge the ley lines.

1422
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,942
-He's creating a vortex.
-A vortex.

1423
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:12,610
Oh, boy.

1424
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:15,905
Okay, if he gets one of his machines in there
and it's big enough,

1425
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:18,783
he's gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier.

1426
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:21,077
Letting whatever's on this plane

1427
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,539
come crashing down on this plane.

1428
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:26,124
Okay, I'm calling this in.

1429
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:33,089
Okay, that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th.

1430
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,258
What is there now?

1431
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,262
The Mercado.
Mercado. It's Spanish for "table."

1432
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,473
The Mercado? That actually makes sense.

1433
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:44,434
Okay, yes, I'm looking for
Agents Hawkins and Rorke.

1434
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,020
The Mercado has one of
the weirdest histories

1435
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,313
of the buildings in New York.

1436
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,774
Okay, so it's your standard-issue
haunted building.

1437
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:53,109
No. This is even before it was a building.

1438
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,737
All sorts of massacres happened at that spot.

1439
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:59,491
Like the peaceful trade between
the Lenape Indians and Captain Warren.

1440
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,493
Then, all of a sudden, everybody dies.

1441
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:04,621
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is the dude that was at the subway

1442
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:06,790
that was talking about the cataclysms!
This is him!

1443
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,418
It's always the sad, pale ones.

1444
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,046
Okay, ladies, let's gear up
and hit that Mercado.

1445
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,929
Who's in the mood to save New York City?

1446
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:49,666
And did you try adjusting the thermostat
before placing this call?

1447
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:52,836
Well, I'm terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room.

1448
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:56,339
Why don't you hold while I connect you
to someone who might care.

1449
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:59,009
-Hi. Excuse me.
-Hold on.

1450
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,177
-What do you want?
-Where's your janitor?

1451
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:03,680
That nut-job! What has he done...

1452
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:05,348
I don't want to know.

1453
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,685
Just take the stairs down and get him out.

1454
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,092
Hey, stop right there!

1455
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,677
Shut it down!

1456
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,514
The Ghostbusters.

1457
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:49,351
Look, I think it's great
you found yourself a little hobby,

1458
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:52,228
and I'm sure, on paper,
flooding New York City with ghosts

1459
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,563
seemed like a great idea,

1460
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:56,107
but we happen to like the world the way it is.

1461
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:59,944
Then you must've been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being,

1462
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:01,154
which I have been denied.

1463
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:02,572
Not really.

1464
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,574
People dump on us pretty much all the time.

1465
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:09,329
I am a genius.
I see things that no one else does.

1466
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:13,708
And for it, I am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery.

1467
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,087
Luckily, I am not
the only one seeking revenge.

1468
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:19,089
Behind these are millions of souls,

1469
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,715
souls which have been cast aside.

1470
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:25,428
Souls who see the world
as it truly is, as garbage.

1471
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:27,597
Garbage that needs to be cleaned up.

1472
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,933
When these barriers are destroyed,

1473
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:34,020
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living.

1474
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:37,607
"Pester the living" doesn't sound so bad.

1475
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:41,861
They will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment.

1476
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:45,407
That's a different definition of "pester"
than what I was thinking.

1477
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,743
I think the word we're looking for
is apocalypse. Apocalypse.

1478
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:52,580
Well, let's get these barriers destroyed,
shall we?

1479
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,709
Wait, wait, wait! Rowan.

1480
01:12:55,792 --> 01:13:00,005
I get it. You don't like people.
People can be terrible.

1481
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:03,717
The thing is, though,
there's so many terrific things out there.

1482
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,721
I mean, wonderful things
that are worth living for.

1483
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:10,807
I mean, you got soup,

1484
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:15,729
and, you know, that first... You know when...

1485
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:18,940
God. I can only think of soup.
Anybody? Somebody? Patty?

1486
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,150
-Salad.
-Salad.

1487
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:21,901
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1488
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:23,486
Okay, stop what you're doing.

1489
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,113
The police are already on their way.

1490
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,866
It's over. You're going to jail, Rowan.

1491
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,285
Well, in that case,

1492
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,495
bye.

1493
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:43,965
That's a weird move.

1494
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:45,258
He dead. That's a dead man.

1495
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:47,385
See if you can shut that thing down.

1496
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,099
-Come on!
-Holtz?

1497
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:56,311
Holtz, are we good?

1498
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,065
Well, he's not, but, yeah, we're okay.

1499
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:02,233
Okay. Well, that's over.

1500
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,778
Okay, we're down here! Down here!

1501
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:06,571
You hate to see the smart ones go bad.

1502
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,575
Man, it smells like burned bologna
and regrets down here.

1503
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:13,119
Like, the dude that worked here,

1504
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:16,081
he, like, dressed, like,
in a Captain Kirk-type outfit.

1505
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:17,707
-What's up?
-He was, like, standing over here...

1506
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:18,875
I don't know. It's strange.

1507
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,753
You know, his technology's
not that different from ours.

1508
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:24,964
It's basically, like, we're
both using the same science.

1509
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:27,175
-That is strange.
-I think I know why.

1510
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:31,179
Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants
has been reading at the beach. No.

1511
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:32,305
Oh, my God.

1512
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:35,308
I told you that there would be
people out there that loved our work.

1513
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:38,103
Why am I so flattered that
that weird little sociopath bought our book?

1514
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:42,524
Thank you for everything you did.
You saved us all.

1515
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:44,067
The mayor thanks you, of course.

1516
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,486
Privately, so don't tell anyone.

1517
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:47,570
Can I walk you out?

1518
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:49,739
Well, why don't you all go get some rest?

1519
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,492
These gentlemen here
will get you out of here. Okay?

1520
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:53,743
-Thank you. That's very nice.
-All right.

1521
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:56,538
-Thanks for all you've done, ladies.
-Thank you very much.

1522
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:00,000
I just have to say a couple things
to the press. You know how that goes.

1523
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,252
So we just are gonna fake-arrest you now.

1524
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:05,088
And we towed your car.
Real-tow, not fake-tow.

1525
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,172
-Ms. Lynch!
-What's that?

1526
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:08,091
-Ms. Lynch!
-What? Wait, why?

1527
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:10,135
-Excuse me!
-Stop resisting.

1528
01:15:10,218 --> 01:15:12,345
I'm not. I'm walking with you.

1529
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:14,806
-Is New York in trouble?
-Everything is fine.

1530
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:21,312
It was just another publicity stunt
by these incredibly sad and lonely women.

1531
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:24,065
It's like they read <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>
and just ran with it.

1532
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:29,172
Did you guys lose your keys?

1533
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:33,093
What did I tell you? Pin it to your bra strap.
That's where mine is, and it...

1534
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:57,909
Who's out there?
Holtzmann, I swear to God, I...

1535
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:16,720
Hello, Abby.

1536
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:22,892
<i>Ghostbusters. What do you want?</i>

1537
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:26,813
<i>Hello? Guys, it's me.</i>
<i>Are you there? Please pick up if you're there.</i>

1538
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:27,981
Call me as soon as you get this.

1539
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:31,568
I think when Rowan killed himself,
it was just the next step in his plan.

1540
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:34,029
<i>The mayor's itinerary has been set.</i>

1541
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:38,241
<i>Mayor Bradley is meeting with the diplomats</i>
<i>at Lotus Leaf this very moment.</i>

1542
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,618
Lotus Leaf.

1543
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:46,541
Abby! We got you a sandwich
so you don't be picking off of ours, man.

1544
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,461
You need some food.
Your moods have been real bad, yo.

1545
01:17:49,544 --> 01:17:50,754
Come on now.

1546
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,214
Abby? You in there?

1547
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:57,427
Everything okay?

1548
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:00,555
<i>Abby, come and get your sandwich</i>

1549
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,474
<i>Come and get your sandwich, please</i>

1550
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,809
You want your little sandwich?

1551
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:07,354
Abby...

1552
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:08,772
Hello, Jillian.

1553
01:18:09,272 --> 01:18:10,357
Hello, Abby.

1554
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:12,734
Are you okay?

1555
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,152
I'm quite well.

1556
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:16,029
That's good.

1557
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,124
You found my pipe.

1558
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,626
I got it at the dumpster yesterday.

1559
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:32,712
I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.

1560
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:34,130
Pretty cool, right?

1561
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:37,008
If it doesn't work,
we can just swing it around and break stuff,

1562
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:38,677
so it's kind of a win-win.

1563
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:41,346
-What?
-What are you doing?

1564
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,306
Not my babies!

1565
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:45,475
Hey!

1566
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:47,143
-Wait a minute!
-No!

1567
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,561
Man, are y'all playing?

1568
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:51,356
'Cause this ain't funny, man. Yo! For real!

1569
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:53,775
See, Abby, I told you
to have that sandwich, man.

1570
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,318
Low blood sugar is serious!

1571
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,861
-Hello, Patricia.
-What?

1572
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,618
Abby!

1573
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:04,994
What the...

1574
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:06,996
Look at the view.

1575
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:10,291
This is fun, right?

1576
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:12,502
Good-bye.

1577
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:15,672
I got you, baby! I got you!

1578
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:31,438
-Oh, my God, help me.
-Hi, Patty.

1579
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:37,444
Hell no! The Devil is a liar!

1580
01:19:39,696 --> 01:19:40,989
Hellion, begone!

1581
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:43,241
Shit.

1582
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:44,951
No!

1583
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:48,872
Holtzy! Got you, Holtzy!

1584
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:51,583
No!

1585
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,877
Get out of my friend, ghost!

1586
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:00,717
That's gonna leave a mark!

1587
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:03,345
The power of Patty compels you!

1588
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:06,556
Is that you, Abby?

1589
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:07,640
Where did he go?

1590
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,059
Hey, guys, check it out!

1591
01:20:09,225 --> 01:20:10,310
Hey, listen.

1592
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:13,146
I figured you're gonna need my help,
so I borrowed all this stuff.

1593
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:16,066
If you could just chuck me down
my own proton pack, that'd be great.

1594
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:17,692
-Kevin, come inside!
-Kevin.

1595
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:18,818
-Come inside.
-I'm part of the team.

1596
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:20,070
I can help out. I'm not gonna get in your way.

1597
01:20:20,153 --> 01:20:21,404
-Come on, move!
-Move!

1598
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:22,989
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?

1599
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:24,074
Nothing's gonna stop me!

1600
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:28,828
-Man.
-Kevin!

1601
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:30,622
Come on, Rowan, get out of him!

1602
01:20:30,705 --> 01:20:32,332
Thanks for the upgrade.

1603
01:20:32,832 --> 01:20:34,250
Rowan, ya big bully!

1604
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,212
Hope this guy knows
how to ride a motorcycle.

1605
01:20:37,253 --> 01:20:38,546
Rowan, not Kevin!

1606
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:40,757
Yeah, he does.

1607
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:44,427
That's so not good.

1608
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,937
No, no. It's just a magic trick.
He didn't actually cut her in half.

1609
01:20:53,978 --> 01:20:56,398
-No, no. I was there. She was cut in half.
-There's two women.

1610
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,066
-Yeah, I saw it.
-It's just a trick.

1611
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:00,110
Mayor Bradley, it's me!

1612
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:02,445
-Oh, boy. Code Red.
-Come here!

1613
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:04,489
-I have something in my teeth?
-No, no, that's Code Green.

1614
01:21:04,614 --> 01:21:06,366
It's me! It's Erin.

1615
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:08,284
She thinks that's a sliding door.

1616
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,577
It's Erin. Hi!

1617
01:21:09,619 --> 01:21:11,955
She thinks they're all doors. That's sad.

1618
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:13,456
She's a scientist.

1619
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,041
Mayor Bradley.

1620
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,210
You have to evacuate the city!

1621
01:21:17,293 --> 01:21:18,294
Never say that word.

1622
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,754
You have to shut down the power
to the whole city!

1623
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:22,507
Don't you understand? He's using
the power to energize them!

1624
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,884
You know what, as you can see,
the mayor is very busy.

1625
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,136
No.

1626
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:27,345
It's happening.

1627
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:29,389
Can you hear it?

1628
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:32,517
It's...

1629
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:36,896
Okay, that's a dumpster.

1630
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,315
But the undead are still arriving.

1631
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,775
Please, Mayor Bradley,
you have to believe me.

1632
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:42,318
You're the only one
that can do something. Don't...

1633
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:43,820
Please don't be like the mayor in <i>Jaws.</i>

1634
01:21:45,321 --> 01:21:47,782
Never compare me to the <i>Jaws</i>mayor. Never!

1635
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:48,825
Please, you have to get everyone out.

1636
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:49,993
You're endangering everyone in the city!

1637
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:51,202
That took way too long.

1638
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,328
What are you doing?

1639
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:53,955
My... Get off of me!

1640
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:56,958
Mayor Bradley, you have to listen to me!

1641
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,878
Get out of the city! Get out of the city!

1642
01:21:59,961 --> 01:22:01,504
They're coming!

1643
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:03,923
Don't you understand?
These ghosts kill people!

1644
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:14,768
50 cents a T-shirt.

1645
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:16,895
My plan is to wear a new one every day,

1646
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:20,315
and then just throw 'em out
and then start over every month, yeah.

1647
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:23,818
Hey. Man, nobody ordered
a Clark Kent strippergram.

1648
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,070
Clark Kent?

1649
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:28,239
Because of the glasses
and the handsomeness?

1650
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,336
I should have worked out more
when I was alive.

1651
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:54,349
I definitely should have worked out more.

1652
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:31,761
You have to get out of the city!

1653
01:23:32,762 --> 01:23:34,597
Please! Get out!

1654
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:37,767
No.

1655
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:40,103
It's happening.

1656
01:24:34,532 --> 01:24:36,076
-Let's do this.
-Yeah.

1657
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:46,836
Taxi! Taxi!

1658
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:51,758
-Where you going?
-Chinatown.

1659
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:54,177
Nah. That's, like,
one more block south than I want to go.

1660
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:56,846
Sir, those are actual ghosts flying around!

1661
01:24:56,888 --> 01:24:59,307
They're Class 5 floating vapors.
Nothing to worry about.

1662
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:01,559
No, no, no, it's important.
Don't you see what's happening?

1663
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:02,811
Look, I don't go to Chinatown,

1664
01:25:02,852 --> 01:25:05,355
I don't drive wackos,
and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

1665
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:06,940
What? No, no, no, wait!

1666
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,317
God, I got to get my gear.

1667
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,829
Seem to have hit an impasse.

1668
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,247
Yeah, I'd say so.

1669
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,127
All right, let's clear a path.

1670
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,462
You guys, this looks like my kitchen.

1671
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:44,269
What the hell is that thing?

1672
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:51,276
-Hey, hey!
-Wait!

1673
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,736
Really?

1674
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:54,404
Did you leave the keys in the car?

1675
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,162
My uncle is gonna be pissed.

1676
01:26:06,499 --> 01:26:08,084
-Okay, light him up!
-No, don't shoot.

1677
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,211
The equipment on top of that
is basically a nuclear reactor.

1678
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:12,505
-What?
-Okay, I vote we don't shoot at that.

1679
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:29,856
Well, we just gave a ghost a nuke.

1680
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:31,524
We should probably run.

1681
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:32,776
Yep.

1682
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:35,111
Go! Go! Moving out!

1683
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:59,969
Yo, was Thanksgiving
like Halloween back in the 1920s?

1684
01:27:00,011 --> 01:27:02,180
'Cause that's a creepy-ass Macy's Parade.

1685
01:27:02,263 --> 01:27:06,559
I don't know. I've always kind of been
attracted to husky men in hats.

1686
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,146
I just made eye contact.

1687
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:11,815
-With the balloon?
-Yeah, straight down the barrel.

1688
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:18,321
-Damn.
-I think we may look like chew toys to him.

1689
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:20,448
All right, let's pop some balloons!

1690
01:27:47,809 --> 01:27:49,436
Lord, have mercy.

1691
01:27:49,519 --> 01:27:51,354
This is just wrong!

1692
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:53,940
I can't move my hand.

1693
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:56,109
I can't reach the trigger.

1694
01:27:56,943 --> 01:28:00,030
You guys, this is exactly
how I pictured my death.

1695
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:11,374
Come on.

1696
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,210
Proton guns are all well and good,

1697
01:28:14,252 --> 01:28:17,005
but sometimes you need the Swiss Army.

1698
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:19,966
Welcome back!

1699
01:28:20,383 --> 01:28:22,218
-Am I shouting?
-Yeah.

1700
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:25,305
I think the balloon popped my ear!

1701
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:29,976
All right, let's go save this city
and get our terrible receptionist back.

1702
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,103
We're not gonna find another one that pretty.

1703
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:47,911
Who's the flying beefcake?

1704
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:51,498
Hello.

1705
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,100
Women. Always late.

1706
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:14,062
Probably couldn't decide
which dirty jumpsuit to wear.

1707
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:17,982
Let's give 'em a proper New York welcome,
shall we?

1708
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:23,613
Welcome to the glory days of New York City.

1709
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:24,698
Have fun!

1710
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,629
Never been good in a fight.

1711
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:41,339
Well, good news.

1712
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,258
Here's your chance to work on that.

1713
01:29:46,177 --> 01:29:48,013
Guys, you all have your sidearms.

1714
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:49,723
I suggest you use them.

1715
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:51,224
Okay, power up.

1716
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,037
Holtzy, get down! Get down!

1717
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:19,169
Slap shot!

1718
01:30:20,337 --> 01:30:21,338
Gotcha.

1719
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:26,718
This isn't very Puritan behavior!

1720
01:30:30,638 --> 01:30:31,890
D'oh. Nuts!

1721
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:39,481
I'm getting the hang of this!

1722
01:30:42,692 --> 01:30:43,693
Shoot.

1723
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,403
I lost my glasses!

1724
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,781
Wait, wait, I got 'em! They're in my hand!

1725
01:30:47,864 --> 01:30:48,948
A little help!

1726
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,209
Impressive.

1727
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:04,464
Holtzy! I got you!

1728
01:31:05,882 --> 01:31:07,884
It's chipping time now, ghost.

1729
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:12,180
And this is what you get for sitting on me!

1730
01:31:13,556 --> 01:31:14,599
Missed me!

1731
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:15,767
Thanks, Patty.

1732
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:28,780
Not you guys again!

1733
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:32,784
Say hello to my little...

1734
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:36,871
What the hell?

1735
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:43,586
Forgot about my new toys.

1736
01:31:46,589 --> 01:31:47,716
Let's go.

1737
01:32:15,493 --> 01:32:17,787
You just got Holtzmanned, baby!

1738
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:19,330
You know what?

1739
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:21,833
I'm glad I didn't know
any of you when you were alive,

1740
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,252
'cause I don't enjoy any of you,
especially you.

1741
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:26,212
Okay. All right, Abby, let's reel it in tighter.

1742
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:28,631
-I don't like you either!
-We got to save our energy.

1743
01:32:28,673 --> 01:32:30,175
Come on, let's go.

1744
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:34,512
Oh, my God, you killed a Pilgrim.

1745
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:36,306
It appears I did.

1746
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:46,733
-This is weird.
-It sure is.

1747
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:48,818
Hey, why y'all like this?

1748
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:50,528
Something's up, man.

1749
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:55,075
Yeah, great work, fellas.

1750
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:56,785
Your country thanks you.

1751
01:33:06,169 --> 01:33:08,797
Well, that thing's having the time of its life.

1752
01:33:10,006 --> 01:33:11,049
Let's go.

1753
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:36,408
God.

1754
01:33:37,867 --> 01:33:40,203
It feels like the slime is after me, personally.

1755
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:41,955
That's all I'm saying.

1756
01:33:42,038 --> 01:33:43,373
This might be a crazy hunch,

1757
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:45,792
but I think he's got that machine
up and running again.

1758
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,211
Come on.

1759
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:55,385
Damn, I missed.

1760
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:56,886
Kevin!

1761
01:33:57,887 --> 01:33:59,681
Is that what this thing's name is?

1762
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:01,266
He seemed more like a Chet to me.

1763
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:02,934
I must admit I am enjoying the body.

1764
01:34:03,393 --> 01:34:06,062
First time in my life I don't have to suck it in.

1765
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,773
I know you're getting real comfy
in your Kevin skin suit,

1766
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:10,191
but it's time you hop out.

1767
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:14,279
We like him,
despite his many, many frustrating quirks.

1768
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:16,906
-He just started figuring out the phones!
-Yeah.

1769
01:34:17,824 --> 01:34:18,950
I don't know.

1770
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,412
Is this a little too Peter Pan?

1771
01:34:23,329 --> 01:34:24,497
Anyway, I'll embrace it.

1772
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:28,918
You know, to be honest with you,

1773
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:31,296
this guy's making me feel
stupider by the second.

1774
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:32,380
He's all yours.

1775
01:34:33,214 --> 01:34:34,341
-No!
-No, no, no!

1776
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:39,012
Don't let Rowan get away!

1777
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:40,972
I got his ass! Here I am.

1778
01:34:41,931 --> 01:34:45,268
Nobody hurts Kevin, man!
Nobody hurts Kevin!

1779
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:48,271
<i>Come out, come out wherever you are</i>

1780
01:34:48,313 --> 01:34:49,356
Over here.

1781
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:52,776
Those guns come with instructions?

1782
01:34:52,817 --> 01:34:56,112
Come on, Rowan! Come get your virginity
out of the lost-and-found!

1783
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,947
-You shoot like girls.
-12 o'clock!

1784
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,873
I think you broke it.

1785
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:08,291
Look what you made me do!

1786
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,001
It's ridiculous. Let's get Kevin.

1787
01:35:11,544 --> 01:35:13,338
I knew he was dumb as a box of rocks.

1788
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:15,840
I didn't know he's as heavy as one.
What's he made out of?

1789
01:35:15,924 --> 01:35:17,801
Pure muscle. And baby-soft skin.

1790
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:20,970
Come on, Rowan, show yourself!

1791
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:23,431
What form would you prefer I take?

1792
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:26,184
Maybe something stationary.
Like a bull's-eye.

1793
01:35:26,267 --> 01:35:27,977
Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.

1794
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:31,356
I prefer something nice and cute,
like a friendly little ghost.

1795
01:35:32,857 --> 01:35:34,275
Is this what you want?

1796
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:35,694
Something more familiar?

1797
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:37,320
Ice cream.

1798
01:35:37,862 --> 01:35:39,656
Well, you know what,
I don't have no problem with that.

1799
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,324
Thank you very much for being reasonable.

1800
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,743
If this is what you want, it works for me.

1801
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:47,831
God, he's really going for it.

1802
01:35:47,914 --> 01:35:50,083
Man, I said cute. Cute!

1803
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,334
God.

1804
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:54,504
No. No, no, no.

1805
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:55,547
No.

1806
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:58,508
Okay, this is not good.

1807
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:18,194
Run! Run!

1808
01:36:49,726 --> 01:36:50,894
Come on!

1809
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:53,063
Erin!

1810
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,739
Okay. Homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon.

1811
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:09,245
What part of "small and friendly"
did he not understand?

1812
01:37:34,938 --> 01:37:36,231
This is bad.

1813
01:37:36,272 --> 01:37:39,275
We need to reverse the portal.
It's gonna take an insane amount of energy.

1814
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:47,826
Yo, what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car?

1815
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:50,912
If we can get those reactors
super-critical inside the vortex,

1816
01:37:50,954 --> 01:37:53,248
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity.

1817
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:55,542
Causing a total protonic reversal.

1818
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,794
It's gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap.

1819
01:37:57,836 --> 01:37:59,504
You are a genius, Patty.

1820
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:00,964
I'm a Ghostbuster.

1821
01:38:01,715 --> 01:38:03,633
All right, let's narrow his path.

1822
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:15,937
Aim for the silver canisters.

1823
01:38:37,834 --> 01:38:38,960
It's working!

1824
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:52,057
He's too strong.

1825
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,559
We can't let the portal close
with him still here.

1826
01:38:54,642 --> 01:38:55,685
All right, ladies.

1827
01:38:56,519 --> 01:38:57,729
Let's loosen his grip.

1828
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:08,406
Yo, that's where
you wanted us to shoot, right?

1829
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:09,699
Yes.

1830
01:39:17,707 --> 01:39:18,833
Look out!

1831
01:39:20,293 --> 01:39:21,378
Abby!

1832
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:40,814
The portal's closing!

1833
01:39:40,897 --> 01:39:43,400
-Abby, hang on! I'm coming!
-What is she doing?

1834
01:39:50,031 --> 01:39:51,074
Hang on, Abby!

1835
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:21,271
Abby!

1836
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:31,698
Erin.

1837
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,242
I wasn't gonna leave you twice.

1838
01:40:34,576 --> 01:40:35,702
Yeah.

1839
01:40:38,455 --> 01:40:39,539
Hold on!

1840
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:44,961
-Oh, my God.
-We got to get 'em out of there.

1841
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:46,212
We got to get 'em out of there!

1842
01:41:11,696 --> 01:41:13,073
Shut up!

1843
01:41:13,656 --> 01:41:14,657
Yeah!

1844
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,493
Hell yeah!

1845
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,830
Yeah! Yeah!

1846
01:41:20,914 --> 01:41:22,791
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

1847
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:23,833
Oh, my God!

1848
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:26,169
Yeah! Yeah!

1849
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:28,630
-What's "whoa"?
-Yes.

1850
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:29,839
No!

1851
01:41:31,216 --> 01:41:32,342
My...

1852
01:41:33,301 --> 01:41:34,511
My gosh.

1853
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,556
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1854
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,891
My gosh!

1855
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:42,352
What year is it?

1856
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:43,603
-It's 2040.
-What?

1857
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:46,022
-Our president is a plant.
-Oh, my God!

1858
01:41:46,064 --> 01:41:47,691
I'm kidding. You were gone two seconds.

1859
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:49,150
-We did it?
-Yeah.

1860
01:41:49,192 --> 01:41:51,027
-Yeah, you did it.
-Yep.

1861
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,487
-We all did it.
-We all did it.

1862
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:54,197
-We all did it.
-That's right.

1863
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,032
-We all did it.
-Well...

1864
01:41:57,075 --> 01:41:59,202
What did you do, Kevin?

1865
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:00,453
I did a lot, actually.

1866
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:02,372
I'll have you know that
I walked over to the power box,

1867
01:42:02,455 --> 01:42:03,623
pushed a bunch of buttons.

1868
01:42:03,707 --> 01:42:06,251
Everything got sucked into the portal,
then it closed up.

1869
01:42:06,334 --> 01:42:07,669
-Kev.
-That's...

1870
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:09,879
Sweet, sweet Kev. The two are unrelated.

1871
01:42:11,214 --> 01:42:14,342
More important question.
When did you have time to get a sandwich?

1872
01:42:14,384 --> 01:42:16,803
When I was looking for you guys,
I looked in that deli over there.

1873
01:42:16,886 --> 01:42:20,557
When we were risking our lives,
trying to save New York City,

1874
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:22,642
you stopped in to get a sandwich?

1875
01:42:22,726 --> 01:42:24,394
Quit splitting hairs, okay?

1876
01:42:24,436 --> 01:42:26,062
Potatoes, tomatoes. It doesn't matter.

1877
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:27,856
Point is, the Ghostbusters...

1878
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:30,066
Are back together again, okay?

1879
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:31,276
And that's what friends are for.

1880
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:35,321
-Just glad you okay, man.
-Kevin!

1881
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:37,115
Yes. Hold my hand longer.

1882
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:38,783
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1883
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:41,244
I love the hair, by the way.
Makes you look a lot older.

1884
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:42,412
You know what?

1885
01:42:44,414 --> 01:42:45,707
A little help, please?

1886
01:42:47,459 --> 01:42:48,543
No.

1887
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:50,211
<i>In the aftermath of the events,</i>

1888
01:42:50,253 --> 01:42:51,921
<i>authorities are still trying to understand</i>

1889
01:42:51,963 --> 01:42:54,799
<i>what happened in Times Square</i>
<i>and throughout the city.</i>

1890
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:57,135
<i>I saw Pilgrims. Ghost Pilgrims.</i>

1891
01:42:57,385 --> 01:43:01,097
<i>So you're honestly gonna stand here</i>
<i>and tell me that we didn't all see ghosts,</i>

1892
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:02,849
<i>that what actually happened</i>

1893
01:43:02,932 --> 01:43:05,643
<i>was that terrorists drugged all of the water</i>
<i>with hallucinogens.</i>

1894
01:43:05,727 --> 01:43:06,811
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

1895
01:43:06,895 --> 01:43:08,188
<i>Wait, what?</i>

1896
01:43:08,271 --> 01:43:09,939
<i>-Baba Booey!</i>
<i>-I... I...</i>

1897
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:13,568
<i>...with the government trying to claim</i>
<i>the event wasn't supernatural,</i>

1898
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:16,863
<i>despite so many eyewitness accounts</i>
<i>to the contrary.</i>

1899
01:43:16,946 --> 01:43:18,156
<i>The big question is,</i>

1900
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,951
<i>was it the four women</i>
<i>who refer to themselves as Ghostbusters</i>

1901
01:43:21,993 --> 01:43:23,828
<i>who actually thwarted the attack?</i>

1902
01:43:23,912 --> 01:43:24,913
<i>We may never know.</i>

1903
01:43:24,954 --> 01:43:26,915
Well, now I know how Batman feels.

1904
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,794
You know what?
You don't have to keep fiddling with it.

1905
01:43:30,877 --> 01:43:33,630
I think it looks nice. Right?

1906
01:43:33,672 --> 01:43:35,465
I'd talk to you at an AA meeting.

1907
01:43:36,466 --> 01:43:37,467
It's my fault, anyway.

1908
01:43:37,509 --> 01:43:39,177
The box said the color was called Garfield.

1909
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:43,139
It wasn't even the cat. It was the president.

1910
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:44,933
Well.

1911
01:43:45,475 --> 01:43:47,143
You know what? I want to make a toast.

1912
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:51,648
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

1913
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:55,485
Physics is the study of
the movement of bodies in space,

1914
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:58,822
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe.

1915
01:43:58,905 --> 01:44:03,535
But it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here.

1916
01:44:03,618 --> 01:44:06,996
And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.

1917
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:10,625
And to love is what you have shown me.

1918
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:13,670
I didn't think that I would
ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

1919
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:16,006
and then I feel like I have a family of my own.

1920
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:17,507
And I love you. Thank you.

1921
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:19,300
Thank you.

1922
01:44:19,801 --> 01:44:21,094
I mean, that was like a real thing right there.

1923
01:44:21,177 --> 01:44:23,013
-Yeah, that was...
-That was, like, so real.

1924
01:44:23,054 --> 01:44:24,848
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1925
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,394
We want to thank you for your discretion.

1926
01:44:29,477 --> 01:44:32,105
It's not working at all, but thank you.

1927
01:44:32,188 --> 01:44:36,192
Actually, we'd like you to continue
to study this subject,

1928
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:37,861
fully funded.

1929
01:44:37,902 --> 01:44:41,031
You know, we need to be better prepared,
just in case.

1930
01:44:41,114 --> 01:44:42,741
-Yeah. Yes, that's smart.
-Yes.

1931
01:44:42,824 --> 01:44:44,826
Whatever you need, going forward.

1932
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:46,077
Anything at all.

1933
01:44:47,245 --> 01:44:48,371
Anything?

1934
01:44:49,497 --> 01:44:50,582
Anything.

1935
01:44:50,665 --> 01:44:51,708
Hell yeah!

1936
01:44:53,501 --> 01:44:54,544
Second floor is mine.

1937
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:56,504
You can't claim a whole floor.

1938
01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:57,589
-I just did.
-You can't...

1939
01:44:57,672 --> 01:44:59,382
You can't do that, Holtzy!

1940
01:44:59,716 --> 01:45:01,384
Not bad, ghost girl.

1941
01:45:01,426 --> 01:45:03,511
Thank you, and I proudly take that title.

1942
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:09,809
-Is that...
-Patty's uncle.

1943
01:45:14,147 --> 01:45:15,315
Unc!

1944
01:45:16,107 --> 01:45:17,150
Where is it?

1945
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:19,527
What are you talking about?
I told you what happened.

1946
01:45:19,569 --> 01:45:20,862
Where's the car?

1947
01:45:20,904 --> 01:45:23,281
-It's on the other side.
-In Jersey?

1948
01:45:23,365 --> 01:45:24,949
No, in the portal.

1949
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:28,620
You know what? We should probably
let them just work this out.

1950
01:45:28,703 --> 01:45:29,704
-Excuse me.
-Patty,

1951
01:45:29,746 --> 01:45:31,623
I got four funerals this weekend.

1952
01:45:31,706 --> 01:45:33,416
I can't do them with just one hearse.

1953
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,085
Maybe you could do two at a time.

1954
01:45:35,126 --> 01:45:36,628
We're not stacking 'em like flapjacks!

1955
01:45:49,057 --> 01:45:50,809
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1956
01:45:50,892 --> 01:45:52,185
I know what you did.

1957
01:45:52,435 --> 01:45:53,603
What?

1958
01:45:53,687 --> 01:45:56,356
Bennie, don't get weird on me, okay?

1959
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:58,900
What is...

1960
01:45:59,317 --> 01:46:00,944
Yeah!

1961
01:46:00,985 --> 01:46:05,281
I'm just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth.

1962
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:06,908
This is absolute madness.

1963
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:25,468
Ghostbusters. Please give
a detailed description of your apparition.

1964
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:28,138
Well, that sounds like

1965
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:32,517
an illusional meta-physious, spectro-mian.

1966
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:35,437
I'm talking like you guys.

1967
01:46:35,478 --> 01:46:36,855
-Way to go, Kev.
-Yeah.

1968
01:46:36,938 --> 01:46:39,107
Well, that sounds very scary.

1969
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:42,485
It's probably 'cause you got
a lot of bad karma from your previous life.

1970
01:46:44,446 --> 01:46:45,655
I hate coffee.

1971
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:47,657
I'm just gonna disconnect his phone.

1972
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:48,992
-He won't notice.
-No.

1973
01:47:05,008 --> 01:47:06,676
How's it going over here?

1974
01:47:07,677 --> 01:47:08,720
Good. Really good.

1975
01:47:08,803 --> 01:47:11,931
I'm working on some kind of next-level stuff.

1976
01:47:12,515 --> 01:47:13,975
Case in point.

1977
01:47:19,064 --> 01:47:20,106
What is this for?

1978
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:23,318
It catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else.

1979
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,694
I don't know where,

1980
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:27,280
but I have a feeling it's Michigan.

1981
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:41,503
Hey, how's this containment unit?

1982
01:47:41,544 --> 01:47:42,962
You got that up and going?

1983
01:47:43,046 --> 01:47:45,215
That? That's going real smooth.

1984
01:47:45,882 --> 01:47:50,053
I just would say don't be in a room with it
for more than an hour at a time,

1985
01:47:50,136 --> 01:47:53,473
because I'm thinking a lot of hair loss.

1986
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:56,142
Well, that might be
something we want to work on.

1987
01:47:57,227 --> 01:47:59,813
Hi. Hello. Sorry, I didn't know
anyone else was here.

1988
01:47:59,896 --> 01:48:01,398
What a ding-a-ling. I forgot to introduce.

1989
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:03,817
This is my mentor, Dr. Rebecca Gorin.

1990
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:06,194
This is reckless, Jillian.

1991
01:48:06,236 --> 01:48:07,946
All someone has to do is sneeze too hard

1992
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:10,365
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate.

1993
01:48:10,407 --> 01:48:12,867
It's completely unstable.

1994
01:48:12,909 --> 01:48:14,577
Do we need this safety light?

1995
01:48:14,619 --> 01:48:16,579
Safety lights are for dudes.

1996
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:18,707
Safety lights are for dudes.

1997
01:48:21,251 --> 01:48:22,335
I hate doing that.

1998
01:48:23,003 --> 01:48:25,922
Hey, y'all need to come check this out.
Come up to the roof.

1999
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,517
Is that for us?

2000
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:40,770
I guess some people
actually do know what we did.

2001
01:48:41,855 --> 01:48:43,606
Well, that's not terrible.

2002
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:45,608
No, it's not.

2003
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:47,152
It's not terrible at all.

2004
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:06,841
I call it the nutcracker.

2005
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:08,885
'Cause it crushes the ghost.

2006
01:56:08,927 --> 01:56:10,261
No, it's for walnuts.

2007
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:14,391
Smart.

2008
01:56:19,562 --> 01:56:21,773
What is it? Did you get something?

2009
01:56:21,856 --> 01:56:24,484
Yeah. I heard something really weird.

2010
01:56:26,444 --> 01:56:27,737
What's "Zuul"?
