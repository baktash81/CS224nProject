1
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,554
Here's what I found out.

2
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,849
That all of life
is a learning experience.

3
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:50,313
Everything is part
of a big master plan.

4
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,691
But sometimes it's...
Well, it's hard to read.

5
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,402
I mean, it's like if you get too close
to the screen,

6
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,946
all you can see
is a bunch of little dots.

7
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,491
You don't see the big picture
until you stand back.

8
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,493
But when you do,

9
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,204
everything comes into focus.

10
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,711
Hi. My name is Suzanne Maretto.

11
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,255
No, wait. I'm sorry.

12
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,133
Suzanne Maretto
is my married name.

13
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,010
My own name

14
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,304
is Suzanne Stone.

15
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,015
That's my professional name.

16
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,352
Suzanne Stone.

17
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,231
It's not like I have any negative
feelings about the name Maretto.

18
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,611
Maretto is the name, after all,

19
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,112
of my husband,

20
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,533
who I loved very, very much.

21
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,245
Um... Heh.

22
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,872
Sorry.

23
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,543
It's also the name of his parents,
Joe and Angela Maretto,

24
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,547
and of his lovely and talented
sister, Janice Maretto,

25
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,676
who have been like
a second family to me

26
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,220
and who I regard
as I do my own family,

27
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,849
particularly since
my recent tragedy.

28
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,646
And who, just through knowing
and being related to them,

29
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,983
have given me what I think is
a very valuable insight

30
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,694
into the different kinds
of ethnic relationships

31
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,656
that are part of the very things
that I've been trying to explore

32
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,827
as a member
of the professional media.

33
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,463
First impressions in one word?
You really want to know?

34
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,386
Wet.

35
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,181
Four letters, begins with "C."

36
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,559
Larry, it's a girl.

37
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,312
You've never seen
one of them, huh?

38
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,606
Cold.

39
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,569
Cold. C-O-L-D. Cold.

40
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,487
Yeah.

41
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,781
What did you think of Suzanne
when you met her?

42
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,117
I just didn't get the Suzanne thing.

43
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,704
I mean, all the girls around town
thought Larry was really cute.

44
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,958
I mean, they all used to hang out
at the restaurant on the nights

45
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,463
when my dad would let Larry
and his dopey rock band play there.

46
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,506

Laura Risley, I remember.
She really...

57
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,509
Peggy Holden.
I mean, she's kind of a slut.

58
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,845
But, I mean, he could've had anybody,
basically, is what I'm saying.

59
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,890
But I don't know. Suzanne, blond.

60
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,517
I don't know.

61
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,195
Well, yeah, sure,
I could've said some things.

62
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,824
Well, to tell you the truth,
I did say some things.

63
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,367
Yeah, it's my brother.

64
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,578
But in a very subtle way.

65
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,290
Larry, what do you think
of Angela Raguzzo?

66
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,210
She's all right.
She's hot.

67
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,795
Why?

68
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,548
She wants you to ask her out.

69
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,468
Look, sis, don't try and fix me up
with people. It's embarrassing.

70
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,387
All right.

71
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,764
What do you think of
Dana Defalco?

72
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,809
You want me to go out with a girl
whose father's in the mob?

73
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,894
Who says he's in the mob?
Everybody.

74
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,564
Everybody. So?
Don't you want a little excitement?

75
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,776
I got all the excitement I can take.
Oh, with who? The ice maiden?

76
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,820
You don't know
what you're talking about.

77
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,238
I don't?
No.

78
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,115
Okay.

79
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,159
Inform me.

80
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
Well, it's none of
your business.

81
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,915
But, Suzanne, she looks, you know,
very fragile and delicate, right?

82
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,792
Mm-hm.

83
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,670
But when we're...
When we're...

84
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,173
I mean, when I'm...

85
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,759
Look, I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
Details are too graphic.

86
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,637
But let me just tell you,
she's like...

87
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,265
She's like a volcano.

88
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,225
You mean,
people come from miles around

89
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,019
just to watch her explode?
Heh-heh-heh.

90
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,395
Is that it?
Very funny.

91
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,273
Like Mount St. Helene?
Very funny. Ha-ha-ha!

92
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,984
Man, when he says to me...

93
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,611
I'm gonna marry her.

94
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,989
Wait a minute. You what?

95
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,450
"You what?" I said.
And then he says...

96
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,286
I'm telling you, sis,
she's it.

97
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,789
She's the golden girl of my dreams.
Oh, God.

98
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,793
And I did one of these:

99
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,131
Which I regretted right away,
because, you know, he looked at me

100
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,051
with that kind of doggy look
that guys get.

101
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,554
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

102
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,516
She can't even bowl.

103
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,310
Yes. Yes.

104
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,104
Let me tell you something, all right?
Yeah.

105
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:29,026
She's like... She's like, uh,
a delicate china doll.

106
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,821
Larry, you ever try kissing a doll?
You know, they don't kiss back.

107
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,659
She's like one of those porcelain
figurines that Mom collects.

108
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,163
She is so pure and delicate

109
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,332
and innocent.

110
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,418
You just have to look at her,
and you wanna take care of her

111
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
for the rest of your life.

112
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,341
Yeah, I can see that.

113
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,510
So...

114
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,514
Anyway, so when she, Suzanne,
says to me...

115
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,434
If you're actively seeking a career
in the professional ice skating field...

116
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,436
In the spotlight, so to speak.

117
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,439
- I think you have to maximize
your positive features.

118
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,733
Mm. Sure.
So, what I'm saying

119
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,777
is that a qualified
plastic surgeon

120
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,364
could just snip away those little
beauty spots or facial blemishes,

121
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,535
whatever you call them.
You'd see how much better you'd feel.

122
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,623
You know, commenting about
my face and stuff. I, you know...?

123
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,419
I knew where she was going,
Miss Fixer-Upper.

124
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,587
I believe that Mr. Gorbachev...

125
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,881
You know, the man who
ran Russia for so long?

126
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,468
I believe he would be in power today
if he'd done what people suggested

127
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,054
and had that big purple thing
taken off his forehead.

128
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,724
I firmly believe that.

129
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,976
I hope to interview him.
We'll discuss that

130
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,105
along with other more pertinent
international things, you know?

131
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,358
I'm telling you, sis, she's gonna be
the next Barbara Walters.

132
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,693
Oh, is that right?

133
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,612
Well, Barbara does have
many admirable qualities.

134
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,906
A wide range of knowledge
of current events,

135
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,075
and a sympathy
for people's feelings,

136
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,912
which is a trait so many people have
who are of the Jewish persuasion.

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,832
Isn't she something else?

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,584
So, yeah, that was it.

139
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,004
I mean, a done deal, finite.

140
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,173
He was a goner.

141
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,593
The point is that, for instance,

142
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,179
Connie Chung,
who is married, I believe,

143
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,223
to Maury Povich, the well-known
interviewer, doesn't say,

144
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,560
"Hello, this is Connie Povich
with the news." Now, does she?

145
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,146
And I don't think she would be
embarrassed by it,

146
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,483
because she's already pretty ethnic
when you think about it.

147
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,443
Or to take another example,

148
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,112
someone who doesn't have
an ethnic bone in her body.

149
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,615
There's Jane Pauley,

150
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,158
who I strongly relate to

151
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:45,162
because, you know,
we have similar physical traits.

152
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,417
Although I don't have to struggle with
the weight problem like she does.

153
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,961
And she also,
to the best of my knowledge,

154
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,340
has never identified herself,
audience-wise,

155
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,300
as Jane Trudeau,

156
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,053
even though her husband,
Mr. Trudeau,

157
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,139
is a prominent cartoonist
of some kind,

158
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,643
and not, as so many people believe,
the ex-president of Canada.

159
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,187
So, what I'm saying is this:

160
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,858
There are some people
who never know who they are

161
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,070
or who they wanna be
until it's too late,

162
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,532
and that is a real tragedy
in my book,

163
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,577
because I always knew who I was
and who I wanted to be.

164
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,829
Always.

165
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:32,334
- Okay. Who wants to be on TV?
- There she is.

166
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,503
Oh, look at who's looking at herself.

167
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,839
- Just look at that.
- Suzanne, look there.

168
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,591
- Look there. Come here.
- Look at the camera.

169
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,635
- See?
- Look at what a darling.

170
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,345
Oh, sweetheart.

171
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,348
Can't you get it focused
better than that?

172
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,104
And we're back with the families
of Suzanne and Larry Maretto.

173
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,689
Mr. Stone.

174
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,524
Mr. Stone?

175
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,819
At first, I have to admit we...

176
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,656
We didn't think too much of it,
the relationship.

177
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:07,161
I mean, here was our daughter,
a college graduate.

178
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:13,250
Junior college, yes, but with
good grades and a degree in...

179
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,419
Electronic journalism.

180
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,045
Exactly.

181
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,300
And here was
this young man,

182
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,969
a good boy, obviously,

183
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,763
but, still, a boy
whose education was...

184
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
limited to high school.

185
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,395
And I remember saying to her,
"Honey..."

186
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,899
I'm worried that you don't know
what you're getting into with this kid.

187
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,861
Dad, I'm not a little girl any more.
I know that, sweetheart.

188
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,115
All I'm saying is that we come
from pretty different backgrounds.

189
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,785
"For all you know, his family could be
mixed up with the Mafia or something."

190
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,456
I'm sorry, Joe.
No problem, Earl.

191
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,750
I was just being...
No, no. No. I understand.

192
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,920
Oh, I understand. Please.

193
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,882
Of course, she just laughed at me.

194
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,595
Dad, don't worry.
Well, I have to worry.

195
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,430
That's what dads do.

196
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,106
If you ask me, I'd say that Larry
appealed to a side of her

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,026
that you wouldn't ordinarily know
was there.

198
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,780
It was a kind of a... What? Uh...

199
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,407
A wild side.

200
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:32,371
Well, not wild, but, uh...

201
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,294
Wild.

202
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,296
I thought he would marry...
I don't know.

203
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,133
You know, like,
a nice Italian girl.

204
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,303
But like the guy
in The Godfather says,

205
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,348
"This is America, okay?

206
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,684
The melting pot."

207
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,813
Anyway, one day, Larry comes over to me.
He says...

208
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm gonna tell you something, Pop.
She's going places.

209
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,528
She's got goals.
You know, she's studying stuff.

210
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,781
She's sending out résumés
all the time.

211
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,784
Did I show you what
she gave me for my birthday?

212
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,995
"You Can Be The One."

213
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,830
The one what?

214
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:19,459
Well, the one anything. That's the point.
It's self-motivation.

215
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,837
It's from that guy on TV,
the millionaire

216
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,506
with all the houses and yachts.

217
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,716
You know?

218
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:31,763
Sounds pretty serious, Larry.
Serious? Pop, I sold my drums.

219
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,642
You sold your drums?
Yep.

220
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,688
And he did. He sold his drums

221
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,483
and he turned himself right around
just for her.

222
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,571
The veil Suzanne wore,

223
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,949
she had copied
from a picture in a magazine.

224
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,203
The exact same one
Maria Shriver wore at her wedding.

225
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,417
Larry was, uh...
He was so proud, you know,

226
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,128
because Suzanne,
she designed the wedding rings

227
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,213
all by herself.

228
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,549
You want me to describe them
for you?

229
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,511
They were round and gold.

230
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,764
I mean, big fucking deal.

231
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,558
Come on, Suze, let's go!

232
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,978
I'll still never find a guy like you,
Dad.

233
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,314
Suze.

234
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,815
What?

235
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,951
We got a postcard
from Suzanne

236
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,080
every single day that
they were on their honeymoon.

237
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,209
And it very much surprised us
that they went to Florida,

238
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:47,255
because Suzanne was never
one to lie around the beach.

239
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,592
But Larry was very much
into boating and fishing,

240
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,178
and I think she just wanted
to make him happy.

241
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,305
That's a pretty little lady
you got there.

242
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,682
Yes, sir.

243
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,477
We've been married for four days
and, uh, 18 hours.

244
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,271
I wouldn't let her
out of my sight for very long.

245
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,649
Well, she can't go in the sun.

246
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,568
It's not good to tan
when you're on TV.

247
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,030
TV? What show is she on?
Have I ever seen her?

248
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,284
Not yet, but you will.

249
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,341
Hi, honey.

250
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,009
Suzanne.

251
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,345
Did you miss me?

252
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,305
Hm?

253
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,435
Did you dream about me, baby?

254
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,148
Suzanne.

255
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,454
Ahem. It must've been
a pretty successful honeymoon,

256
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,581
because when they came back,
they were...

257
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,209
Radiant.
Exactly. Radiant.

258
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,504
Larry took money he was saving
in case he wanted to go to college,

259
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,674
he put a down payment
on that condo over at the Heights.

260
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,427
And he bought her
that pretty little Mustang.

261
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,387
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

262
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,474
- Hi.
- How are you?

263
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,309
- Good, good, good.
- Come in.

264
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,518
Hey, Mom.

265
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,189
So you thought Larry changed a lot
after he and Suzanne were married?

266
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,442
Totally. It was like suddenly,
you know, he went from Van Halen

267
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,195
to Jerry Vale overnight.

268
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,740
I don't know. She didn't have any...
Well, she thought she had taste, but...

269
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,247
Barquettes with leek chiffonade.

270
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,334
This is the dish that they serve

271
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,462
in Johnny Carson's
favorite restaurant in Hollywood.

272
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,924
Well, hey, if it's good enough
for Johnny...

273
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,225
Well, was that
some meal or what?

274
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,434
Oh.

275
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,270
I say Julia Childs
better watch her back

276
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,564
or she'll be looking
for another job, huh?

277
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,982
Oh, Larry.

278
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,985
Well, I won't be doing this
every night.

279
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,906
I'm planning to start this exercise
class so I can get rid of a few pounds.

280
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,659
From where? Your feet?
Heh-heh-heh.

281
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,829
- On TV the camera adds five pounds.
- Is that true?

282
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,874
I didn't know that.
Did you know that, Joe?

283
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,668
No.

284
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,340
Talking about exercise,
I gotta go.

285
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,259
- Hey.
- I gotta rehearse.

286
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,429
I got a rehearsal at some god-awful
hour all the way over in Norwalk.

287
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,098
What are you rehearsing, dear?

288
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,891
Janice has a job
in the Ice Follies.

289
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,061
They're going on tour in September.
Hey, sis, that's fabulous.

290
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,271
Thanks.

291
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,774
I'm just one of the chorus,
you know, now, but...

292
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,902
Well, actually, I do skate
this one medley.

293
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,448
It's kind of a, you know,
salute to great TV shows.

294
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,995
I skate the Peggy Lipton part in
The Mod Squad number, you know?

295
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,454
Peggy Lipton?
Yeah.

296
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,249
I get to wear a blond wig
and everything, you know?

297
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,458
How exciting.

298
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,377
Yeah, they're talking about, like,

299
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,297
well, maybe a TV special
this year, so...

300
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,007
Now, listen. Hang on, everybody.

301
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,634
Because, well, we've got

302
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,345
a pretty important announcement
ourselves to make,

303
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,472
and I think congratulations
are in order.

304
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,102
Larry.

305
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,980
Oh, honey.
Wait, wait, wait. Cut, cut, cut.

306
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,899
It's not that.

307
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,028
You're not...?
No, I'm not pregnant, for God's sake.

308
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,487
Oh.

309
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,324
- Suzy's got a job.
- What?

310
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,660
Over at WWEN, the TV station.

311
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,163
The first woman they ever hired.
Isn't that right?

312
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,040
That's right.

313
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,335
Yep, our Suze is on her way now,

314
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,504
and nothing is gonna stop her.

315
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,215
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.

316
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,926
That's great.

317
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,096
We're proud of you.

318
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,475
Great. Great.

319
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,313
- So how are the newlyweds?
- Oh, they're doing great.

320
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,941
Thanks, Sal.
Yeah, cute kids.

321
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,233
Aren't they just?
Yeah.

322
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,111
Did you like the barquettes?
The what?

323
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,530
With the leek chiffonade.
Was it okay?

324
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,491
We never did them before,

325
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,954
but she showed us this recipe
in a book, so, pfft, no problem.

326
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,206
I never told anyone.

327
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,874
Even Joe.

328
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,878
So she couldn't cook.
There are worse crimes,

329
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,214
as we all know.

330
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,384
You're not anybody in America
unless you're on TV.

331
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,303
On TV is where we learn
about who we really are,

332
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,264
because what's the point
of doing anything worthwhile

333
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,766
if nobody's watching?

334
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,603
And if people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

335
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,316
Marry me. Mary, say yes.

336
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,533
I thought she was like
a goddess of some kind.

337
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,910
Like Lady Di
before she dumped the prince

338
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,038
and went nudist and everything.

339
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,750
Suzanne bought me this dress,
which I hope to fit someday.

340
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,132
Suzanne Maretto was
a beautiful human being

341
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,011
with real dreams and "aspiritions."

342
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,406
Suzanne used to say,
"Opportunity is always knocking."

343
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,825
If you aren't listening,
its knuckles get sore,

344
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,618
"and it moves to another house."

345
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
Something like that.

346
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,873
She said that even
on her honeymoon

347
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,083
she had Larry take her to this hotel

348
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,253
in Florida where there was gonna
be this kind of convention

349
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,589
of all these big-shot TV people

350
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,467
that she'd read about
in a magazine.

351
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,845
Which, of course, she didn't tell
Larry, because she didn't want

352
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,640
to maybe hurt his feelings
about her attending to her career

353
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,853
while they were bonding sexually,
so to speak.

354
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,818
So the German reporter
says to the Hungarian editor,

355
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,154
"Of course she's always smiling.

356
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,699
"She gets faxed at least
10 times a day." Boom!

357
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,661
Thank you. Thank you.

358
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,663
I know that's a silly joke,

359
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,833
but it does illustrate
our central thesis today,

360
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,838
which is "Here and Now in the
Fast-Moving Computer Age."

361
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,298
It's the...

362
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,346
In our fast-moving computer age,

363
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,723
it's the medium of television

364
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,894
that joins together
our global community.

365
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,021
And it is the...

366
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:07,195
It is the television journalist
who serves as messenger,

367
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,240
bringing the world
into our homes

368
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,785
and our homes into the world.

369
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,703
Thank you.

370
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,372
Thank you very much.

371
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,042
Thanks a lot.

372
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,969
- The point is, Miss...
- Stone.

373
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,346
Miss Stone.
Suzanne.

374
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,891
Suzanne Stone.
That's a good name.

375
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,228
Now, that's a name
you can remember.

376
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,730
The point is, Suzanne,

377
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,151
if you want it bad enough
you'll get it,

378
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,778
but you gotta really want it.

379
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:53,741
You gotta be able to do things
that ordinary people wouldn't do.

380
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,120
Mm.
You see what I'm saying?

381
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,540
Hm. I think so.

382
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,584
How about another of those?

383
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,045
Oh, um... I don't know about that.
Sweetheart?

384
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,257
- Yes.
- Give us another all around, okay?

385
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,592
Okay. Heh, heh.

386
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,388
Anyway,
when I was at the network,

387
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:19,434
there was this gal from some
10-watt station in the Midwest

388
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,978
where she did the weather.

389
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,396
The weather.

390
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,025
So she comes up to New York

391
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,778
in her best Donna Karan
dress-for-success knockoff,

392
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,449
blond hair all done up
in a French twist,

393
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:39,287
and an audition tape
in her imitation leather briefcase,

394
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:43,291
along with a letter of introduction
from her station manager.

395
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,001
And it says,

396
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,921
"Please give your
most serious consideration

397
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,797
to the bearer of this letter."

398
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,799
Miss So-and-So.

399
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,386
"Who is of moderate intelligence,"

400
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,932
who has some experience
in broadcasting,

401
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,892
and, more importantly,

402
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,229
"who can suck your cock
until your eyes pop out."

403
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,281
And you know
who that gal is today?

404
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,118
Who?

405
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,335
Is that true?

406
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,170
It's true.

407
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,715
And here comes
the best part.

408
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,717
- Yes?
- This is the best part.

409
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,471
About 10 years ago, I'm at
some TV conference somewhere

410
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,515
and I run into that station manager

411
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,851
and I congratulate him
on his letter-writing skills.

412
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:49,107
And he doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

413
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,737
Why doesn't he?

414
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,198
Because, sweetheart,
he didn't write the letter.

415
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,534
Oh. Heh, heh.

416
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,706
Oh. Who did?

417
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,043
She did. She wrote it herself.

418
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,422
Oh.

419
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,300
Oh, I see.

420
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,385
- It's good, isn't it?
- I love it.

421
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,642
- I watch your show all the time.
- Everybody does.

422
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,770
So, uh...

423
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,065
What do you think, Suzanne?

424
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,613
What...?

425
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,033
What do I think about what?

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,826
Well...

427
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,758
Suzanne.

428
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,928
Suze.

429
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,015
Hi, honey.
Suze.

430
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,767
Where were you?

431
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,103
I couldn't sleep.

432
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,023
When I put out the sign
for a gal Friday,

433
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,776
I figured I'd be interviewing
high-school dropouts

434
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,029
who wouldn't mind going to the mall
and picking up doughnuts

435
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,490
and emptying the ashtrays.
That kind of thing.

436
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,409
And this is when we first meet
Gangbusters.

437
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,829
That's what George and I
called Suzanne.

438
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,087
Uh, not to her face, of course.

439
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:53,606
Mr. Grant, I am the woman
you are looking for.

440
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,483
My name is
Suzanne Stone Maretto,

441
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,153
but I, um, plan to use Suzanne Stone
as my professional name.

442
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,115
I'd like you to look over
my résumé,

443
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,826
which details
both my educational background

444
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,662
and my references
in the media field.

445
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,499
Mr. Grant,
I can make you a solemn promise

446
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,001
that I will be dedicated
and committed to this job.

447
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,046
Whoa. Hang on
a second, Suzanne.

448
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,133
We're only looking for someone
to answer the mail, run errands.

449
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,968
Minimum pay, no benefits.

450
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,846
Oh, money is not
my main concern, Mr. Grant.

451
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,515
I just want a chance
to contribute something.

452
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,977
I think you'll find I have very
valuable ideas about programming.

453
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,979
Whoa, whoa. No.

454
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,357
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
Take a look around you.

455
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,736
I mean, Suzanne, we're talking
local cable station here.

456
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,448
Oh, I just want a chance
to get my foot in the door.

457
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,700
Everybody has to start somewhere.

458
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,202
Do you know where
Edward R. Murrow started?

459
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,872
No. No, I don't.

460
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:52,915
No.

461
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,711
No. Well, neither do I offhand.
But I don't think it was at the top, do you? Hm?

462
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,131
I live only five minutes away
from here.

463
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,716
I will be willing and eager

464
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,845
to respond to any newsworthy
emergency you put in front of me.

465
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,805
Uh...

466
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,101
Mr. Grant, this is a dream
I have had all my life.

467
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,104
I will do anything to get this job.
Anything.

468
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,400
This is my associate, George.

469
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,904
Oh.

470
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,239
Pleased to meet you, George.

471
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,159
Well, we'll think about it.

472
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,746
I believe that my assets...

473
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,081
Hey, I said we'll think about it.

474
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,875
And we will.
Okay.

475
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:39,378
Okay?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

476
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,923
Okay.

477
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,845
I believe that
in our fast-moving computer age

478
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,641
it is the medium of television that
joins together the global community,

479
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,810
and it is the television journalist
who serves as messenger,

480
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,773
bringing the world into our homes
and our homes into the world.

481
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,193
It has always been my dream
to become such a messenger.

482
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,403
I look to you, gentlemen, now

483
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,199
to make that dream a reality.

484
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,751
Jesus Christ.

485
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,753
Gangbusters.

486
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,257
Fucking gangbusters.

487
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,073
Hey.

488
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,993
Hey, come on back to bed.
I gotta go to work.

489
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,786
Come on, 10 minutes.
I gotta go.

490
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,705
Five minutes.
I gotta put my face on.

491
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,499
Come on. Put your face on me.
Two minutes.

492
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,627
Take your hand away.

493
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,680
Come, Walter.

494
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,351
The dog was a cute little thing,
now wasn't he?

495
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,145
She was just crazy
about that dog.

496
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,272
It was darling.

497
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,707
Oh, hello.

498
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,135
She named it Walter
after Walter, um...

499
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,889
Is it Cronkite?
The guy who used to be on TV.

500
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,892
I think he was Dan Rather's
uncle or something.

501
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,897
It was like a hairball puked up
by some demon from hell.

502
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,524
There wasn't much to do.

503
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:10,237
Most of the time she just sat
over there and worked on her file.

504
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,740
Her idea file.

505
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,825
She had so many ideas.

506
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,665
This is the presentation on that idea
with me going to movie theaters,

507
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,918
talking to the people coming out
to see what they really think.

508
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,253
An actual, um, ahem,

509
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,006
vox populi, if you know the term.

510
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,886
Here's the memo on that children's
show with me as the hostess

511
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,554
and the live, in-studio animals.

512
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,724
If you could look it over tonight.
Give me your thoughts in the morning.

513
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,311
A couple of pages
outlining that concept

514
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,980
for interviewing everyday citizens,
like mailmen,

515
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,440
school crossing guards,

516
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,319
to inform our citizenry on what kind
of services are available to them.

517
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,161
After a few months,
she wore me down.

518
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,289
I let her do the evening weather
report, which she was fine at.

519
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,333
With the preparation she put into it,

520
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,128
you'd think she was
covering D-Day. Ha-ha-ha.

521
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,296
Six, five,

522
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,299
four, three,

523
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,136
two, one.

524
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,973
You're on.

525
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,227
Good evening
from the WWEN Weather Center.

526
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,812
Weather Center?

527
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,814
The heavy system
we were expecting

528
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,984
Moving down from the north
is not gonna show up after all,

529
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,319
because the high-pressure system

530
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,489
is going to be moving
up to the north.

531
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,951
The temperature for tonight
will remain unseasonably cool

532
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,537
with patches of fog in the morning
and probably...

533
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,999
Hey, come on.
Let's have some quiet here.

534
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,961
The winds are at seven to 10 miles
per hour and sunrise will be at 6:12.

535
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,464
That's it for your
up-to-the-minute weather report.

536
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,549
This is your WWEN
weather person saying

537
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:58,179
I'll be with you again tomorrow
evening, rain or shine.

538
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,281
I never really gave a rat's ass
about the weather

539
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,618
until I got to know Mrs. Maretto.

540
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,871
Now I take it very serious.

541
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,874
If it rains

542
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,711
or there's lightning or thunder

543
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,755
or if it snows,

544
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,298
I have to jack off.

545
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,217
Uh... Hm...

546
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,719

555
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,850
Today's guest, Mrs. Maretto,

556
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:31,605
is a representative of our local
television station, WWEN.

557
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,024
On-air correspondent.
- I'm sorry?

558
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,278
Well, actually,
I'm an on-air correspondent.

559
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,446
Well, that's fine.

560
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,908
Anyway, Mrs. Maretto has asked
to have a few words with you,

561
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:47,746
and I know that while I'm gone
you will give her your best attention.

562
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,456
Here's my best attention.

563
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,627
Did you say something, Russell?

564
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,629
No, Mr. Finlaysson, I didn't.

565
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,632
I didn't.

566
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,309
Well, first of all,
I would like to thank you all

567
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,062
for extending me the courtesy
of your time and attention.

568
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,814
I got something to extend.

569
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,278
And I would like to say
that I hope you'll all be as excited

570
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,324
about the project I'm here
to propose to you as I am.

571
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,409
First of all, I want to ask

572
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,163
have any of you actually ever
been on television before?

573
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,665
Not counting home video,
of course.

574
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,918
No one?

575
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,463
I was.

576
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,718
- What's your name?
- Lydia Mertz.

577
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,513
And how did it happen
that you made this appearance?

578
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,142
Oh, it was down
at Benson's Electronics.

579
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,519
They have this video camera
in the window

580
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,314
and when you walk by
they take your picture.

581
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,027
Well, Lydia, this may come
as a surprise,

582
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:04,114
but that is how some of our most
famous personalities started out.

583
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,451
Just seeing what they look like,
accidentally.

584
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,287
Is that true?
Absolutely.

585
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,708
Now, I am producing
a television documentary

586
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,961
about kids just like yourselves,

587
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,296
because it is teenagers like you

588
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,633
who are the future of our nation.

589
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,719
And, after all, I used to be
a teenager myself once,

590
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,138
back in the Dark Ages.
Heh, heh.

591
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,061
So I would like to find out
about your way of life.

592
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,773
How you feel
about your education,

593
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,401
how you feel about
things like peer pressure,

594
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,237
how you feel about drugs,

595
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,739
um, rap music.

596
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,241
Pussy?

597
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,830
Do we have to get permission slips
from our parents for this?

598
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,165
No. No, that wouldn't be necessary.

599
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,626
Hey, when did your folks learn
to read and write?

600
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,253
Hey, read this, shitface.

601
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,632
All right. All right.

602
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,511
All right, all right, all right.

603
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,931
I am going to put this list
on your bulletin board.

604
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,018
And any of you
who think this project

605
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,063
would be as meaningful
as I know it can be

606
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,149
just put their names on it.

607
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,443
And I would also like
to thank you all

608
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,363
For your interest.

609
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,957
Everything settled then?
Yes.

610
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,212
Well, then let's give
Mrs. Maretto our thanks

611
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,631
and a round of applause.

612
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,767
Thank you. Thank you.

613
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,644
Sign up.

614
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,540
Suzanne.

615
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,629
I'd never really signed up
for anything before

616
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,257
except an after-school
Weight Watchers program,

617
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,053
which I was asked to leave anyway
because they said I wasn't motivated

618
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:35,182
and because I gained 11 pounds
in three weeks.

619
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,018
But this was different,
because it turned out to be

620
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,479
the most important thing
I ever did.

621
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,781
Now, here's some advice,
Russell dear.

622
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,326
That nice Mrs. Maretto
is married to a boy

623
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,579
whose father is a pillar of
the Italian-American community,

624
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,374
and if he knew
how you had insulted

625
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,168
his only beloved daughter-in-law,

626
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,087
he would make one phone call

627
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:09,716
and a man would show up in the middle of
the night and turn you into a eunuch.

628
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,179
You know what a eunuch is,
Russell? Of course you don't.

629
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,098
But you can find it in the dictionary.

630
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,475
If you don't know how to spell it,
look it up

631
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,061
under "nutless wonders."

632
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,274
So I'm thinking,
there must be some simple way

633
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,943
for you to make it up
to Mrs. Maretto

634
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,154
for your offensive behavior.

635
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,406
What do you think? Hm?

636
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,577
Wow, a eunuch.

I have to say
that the staff at WWEN

643
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,476
responded with total enthusiasm
to my project

644
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,437
and gave me excellent support

645
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,606
both editorially and technically.

646
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,733
I think they could sense
immediately

647
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:12,112
that I was onto something important
in a sociological sense.

648
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,616
She must've taped God knows
how many hundreds of hours

649
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,118
with these three dorky kids

650
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,954
who, from what I've seen,
would have a major struggle

651
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,749
just reciting the days of the week
in proper order.

652
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,918
Forget about social insights.

653
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,878
Here, I'll show you.

654
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,346
This is Teens Speak Out project,
tape one, take one.

655
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,764
No, no, no.

656
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,892
I'm Suzanne Stone
and these are...

657
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:48,357
All right, now, let's just say
something in general about ourselves.

658
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,650
Like what?

659
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,818
Like what do you plan to do
with your future, Lydia?

660
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,989
I don't exactly have a plan.

661
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,659
Well, you must have
aspirations of some kind.

662
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,663
What?
A dream, a life goal.

663
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,707
I can tell you Lydia's big life goal.

664
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,917
Yeah?

665
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,836
It's to fuck
the New Kids on the Block.

666
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,715
That's a dirty lie.
Russell.

667
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,677
I don't wanna hear language
like that. It is offensive,

668
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,596
and it is unsuitable for broadcast
under FCC regulations.

669
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,223
You got that?
Yeah.

670
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,016
Anyways, it was Mötley Crüe.

671
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,184
All right, Lydia.

672
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,979
- Just for your information.
- What about you, James?

673
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,441
James?

674
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,403
James.

675
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,862
Huh?

676
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,743
I think you get the point that it's not,
"Mike Wallace, eat your heart out."

677
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,664
But I have to say
I've never seen more persistence.

678
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,000
I, uh... I once said to her...

679
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,795
What about...?
What about we call it a night?

680
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,046
Uh...

681
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,966
Just need to get this reel
cleaned up.

682
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,802
An hour, maybe two.
You go ahead. I'll lock up.

683
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,389
Don't you have that nice husband
waiting at home for you?

684
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,058
Well, he knows how much
this means to me.

685
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:09,146
He works full-time at his dad's
restaurant, so he gets home real late.

686
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,358
Well, Suzanne, I sure pity
the person who says no to you.

687
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,862
No one ever does.

688
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,869
Why are you tying her up again?

689
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,955
Why is she tied up again?

690
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,249
Just leave her alone.

691
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,500
Untie yourself.

692
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,753
Leave her alone.
If she runs away...

693
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,180
As Scripture says, God is the light.

694
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:47,601
- Ouch. Fucker.
- And that light, friends, is heaven.

695
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,770
Heaven is waiting for you.

696
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,564
James?

697
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,860
James.

698
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:01,281
See, nobody ever
called me that before.

699
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,617
All anyone ever called me was

700
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:08,080
Jimmy or Jimbo or other stuff.

701
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,166
My mom told me
that I was named Jimmy

702
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:14,127
after this old movie star
she liked

703
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,546
named Jimmy Dean.

704
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,006
But...

705
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:22,219
Well, when anyone ever asked me,
I always said that I was named Jim

706
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,639
after Jim Morrison of The Doors,

707
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,474
because, you know,

708
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,351
he had this great kind of life,

709
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,438
like, just traveling around
and writing his songs

710
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,066
and having women beg him
to do it to them,

711
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,777
even to take his, uh...

712
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:42,197
organ out on-stage.

713
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,827
The kind of life that I always
thought I'd like to have.

714
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,003
I bet he jumps her
all the time, you know?

715
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,841
Like after dinner, just bang,
right on the kitchen table.

716
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,717
Fucking during even.

717
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,178
Yeah. Maybe both.

718
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,850
Those skinny bitches, they can't
get enough of it, you know?

719
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,519
They're always wanting it.
That's a medical fact.

720
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,728
Yeah.

721
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,315
It's because the nerves in their body
are all bunched up in their snatch.

722
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,736
You know what I mean? They're all right
up in there, so they're all whack.

723
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,280
I don't think that's true.

724
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,032
What are you, a doctor?

725
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,869
She's a perfectly nice person.

726
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,706
You think she's gonna make you
a big movie star, huh, Lydia?

727
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,459
Just to be on TV
will be something nice.

728
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,419
It will be something different.

729
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,338
I got something different
for you right here, all right?

730
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,216
You're a disgusting pig.
Yeah.

731
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,479
You know what we should do?
We should get some money out of her.

732
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,607
What makes you think she's got any?
What, are you shitting me?

733
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,442
Her husband,
Mr. Fucking-Big-Cock,

734
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,111
owns a fucking guinea restaurant,
all right?

735
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,072
Look at the car she drives.
Look at her fucking fingernails.

736
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,075
Big, red, sculpted, glossy nails.

737
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,996
She got plenty of money.
That's rich-bitch stuff.

738
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,498
Yeah, maybe.

739
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,834
You think she's some kind
of hot shit, don't you?

740
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,088
She just looks...
What?

741
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,424
Clean.

742
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,604
All right, come on. They're ready.
Larry, Larry, Larry.

743
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,564
Kids, stop it.

744
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,566
That's a real pretty outfit, honey.

745
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,776
Thanks.

746
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:46,238
Hey, Suze. You want one of these?
No, thanks.

747
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,991
No? What about one of these?
You're going in the pool.

748
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,536
- No, thanks.
Heh-heh-heh.

749
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,791
Sure is great with those kids.
He's gotta stop eating junk.

750
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,585
He's getting a rubber tire
around him like some old man.

751
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,129
He'll make a wonderful father
someday.

752
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,632
He calls them love handles.
I call them flab.

753
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,635
What about you?
Me? You think I look fat?

754
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,972
No. What about the idea of kids?

755
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,641
That's what I mean.
Well, I love kids.

756
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,351
I absolutely love them,

757
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,105
but a woman in my field with a baby
has two strikes against her.

758
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,649
Say I'm in New York, right...
New York?

759
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:26,152
Well, for instance. And I'm suddenly
called on some foreign assignment

760
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,447
like a royal wedding
or a revolution in South America.

761
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,950
You can't run from place
to place with your crew

762
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,495
and conduct serious interviews
with a big, fat stomach.

763
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,832
Or say you've already had the baby,
and you've got this blubber,

764
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,084
these boobs out to here.

765
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,837
Oof. It's just so gross.

766
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,841
Hey, careful. Hey.

767
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,678
- Excuse me.
- Hm. Nice.

768
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,680
You having a good time?

769
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,182
Well, I want to get out of the sun.

770
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,268
I have to go prepare my show.

771
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,187
I sure would like to have a
couple of them around the house.

772
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,607
What do you think, Suze?

773
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,151
Suze. What do you think?

774
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,946
I think if you wanted a babysitter,
you should've married Mary Poppins.

775
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,872
Hi, Ed. Wake up, George.

776
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,582
Let's hit it.

777
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,388
Hi, everybody.

778
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,767
This is Suzanne Stone with your
late-night, sign-off weather report

779
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,353
from the WWEN Weather Center.

780
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,981
I don't think I need to tell you
that today was a hot one.

781
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,234
That old mercury
zoomed on up to 91.

782
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,695
That's a record-breaking temperature
for this date.

783
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,822
Tomorrow promises to be
more of the same,

784
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,367
with relevant numbers
way up in the 90s

785
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,286
humidity to match, and maybe
just a hint of a breeze or two.

786
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,540
Won't be much help with this heat,
the kind of heat

787
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,252
that makes me want to head for that
swimming hole with my friend James,

788
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,755
strip off everything,
including my panties,

789
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,674
which you can see through
anyway,

790
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,967
poke my soft, pink tongue
in his mouth,

791
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,345
slide my hand way up
the inside of his leg

792
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,598
until he's so hot
that he rolls over on top of me,

793
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,143
and I'm yelling, "James,"
his name.

794
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,271
James.

795
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,898
What are you doing to me

796
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,527
with your big, fat, hard...?

797
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,825
Oh, Jesus.

798
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,125
Listen to me, Larry. Okay.

799
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,629
So she finishes
her little docudrama,

800
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,466
whatever the fuck it is.
She sends it off to someone in New York,

801
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,802
and while she's waiting
for an answer,

802
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,888
you should, forgive the expression,
knock her up.

803
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,932
Knock her up and then...

804
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,895
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Los Angeles?
What does Los Angeles got to do with it?

805
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,981
A course in what?

806
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,649
Advanced media?

807
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,943
Advanced bullshit, Larry.

808
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:16,156
Look, I'm sorry.
You're my brother, okay?

809
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,242
I know you love her and you want
her to succeed and all that,

810
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:23,705
but sometimes, man,
you just gotta say no.

811
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,124
What do you mean, how?
N-O, that's how.

812
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,835
Comes to the right of the key,
throws up a hook shot.

813
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,003
It's good!

814
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,840
And the score is again tied
here in the first half at the Palace.

815
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,634
With the ball, Skeeter Jones
brings the ball to the...

816
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,846
- Suzanne?
- Bounce pass to Meadows...

817
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,432
Yeah?
Jump shot on the way, bingo!

818
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,601
Unbelievable play.

819
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,644
What are you doing?

820
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,647
Just sitting here,
waiting for you.

821
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:54,944
Larry, I asked you to please
keep your feet off the coffee table.

822
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,530
We gotta talk about
some things, Suzanne.

823
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,865
What kind of things?

824
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,952
I think you know
what kind of things.

825
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,665
No. No, I don't.

826
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,044
Larry, can't this wait
until tomorrow? I'm really tired.

827
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,545
No.

828
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,632
What?

829
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,052
No, I don't think it can wait. No.

830
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,432
Sit down.
We're gonna talk about this stuff.

831
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,771
The thing is, I think we got
this great future ahead of us.

832
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,233
I just want to make sure we both
understand what the priorities are.

833
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:39,989
I think Pop's gonna let me
take over managing the restaurant.

834
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,910
And I got a lot of exciting ideas,

835
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,162
like introducing
some new menu items

836
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,082
and bringing in some
live music on the weekends

837
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,668
and maybe...
Maybe even one night a week,

838
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,295
open house for
local singers and comics,

839
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,549
which you, with your TV background,
you could help me with.

840
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,343
You know, maybe
shooting the acts

841
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,762
and then maybe
selling the tapes,

842
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,473
which you could edit yourself,
back to the performers.

843
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,852
I talked to my folks about it,
and they thought it'd be a great idea.

844
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,688
Great idea. Really.

845
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,777
And believe me, Suze, I am not
selling short what you're doing now.

846
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,197
I mean, the weather report stuff,

847
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,450
which you're really good at.

848
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,287
But let's face facts.

849
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,956
It's probably not gonna

850
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,710
lead to any big network offers.

851
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,503
Now, this way,

852
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,965
we could be working together
in both our respective fields,

853
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,760
doing what a family
is supposed to be doing.

854
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,973
A family, that's what
I'm talking about, Suze, huh?

855
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,561
What do you think?

856
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,779
Um...

857
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,495
I'll think about it.

858
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,882
It's true that the road
my husband and I chose to travel on

859
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,676
was paved
with many speed bumps.

860
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,680
Larry said he would never stand
in my way, whatever happened.

861
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:32,268
But the word "failure"
is not part of my vocabulary.

862
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:36,022
My commitment to my career
or my marriage, or whatever,

863
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,943
has always been 110 percent.

864
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,530
Regardless of how fast I was growing in my
vocation, I would never leave Larry behind.

865
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,700
The word "divorce"
was never mentioned.

866
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,182
Ta-da. What do you think?

867
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,892
Oh. Wow.
Like the color?

868
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,686
Yeah.
It doesn't make me look fat?

869
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,229
No.
I think I'm gonna get it.

870
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:20,483
Oh, Jesus. Heh-heh-heh.
Mr. Maretto is going to...

871
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:24,737
Mr. Maretto? Pfft. Yeah, right.

872
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,572
Let me tell you something, Lydia.

873
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:32,412
No. No, you wouldn't understand.
Maybe I would.

874
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,418
Well, you grow up, you know?

875
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,254
You think it's all gonna be
like a fairy tale.

876
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:45,216
Like you're Sleeping Beauty and
along comes this Prince Charming.

877
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:48,344
And he looks at you
and it's nighttime.

878
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,139
And he smiles at you
and kisses you.

879
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,142
Yeah, I know that story.

880
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,643
And then...

881
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,353
Then you wake up,

882
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,814
and it's daylight,

883
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,858
and you look at him.

884
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,279
It's just when you work all day,
trying to perfect yourself

885
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,948
and create something meaningful,
you expect support.

886
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:12,326
Does anyone say, "Did you have a good shoot?
" Or "How's the editing?"

887
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,287
Or anything of that nature?

888
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,164
I guess not.

889
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,874
No.

890
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:22,336
I mean, the point is,

891
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,715
Larry is a nice guy, you know,

892
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,926
but he just doesn't know
a thing about television.

893
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,180
Let's get out of here.

894
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,101
Mrs. Maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff,

895
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:40,521
like this ankle bracelet,
for instance.

896
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,567
And a bottle
of real expensive perfume.

897
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,152
A "scent," she called it,

898
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,322
which I'm saving
for a special occasion.

899
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,658
No one ever really
bought me stuff before

900
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,037
except my mom's boyfriend,
Chester,

901
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,331
who got me for my birthday
when I was 12,

902
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:02,752
a bottle of something called
Garden of Eden body oil,

903
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,047
which he said would be good
for my skin

904
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:10,885
and which he wanted
to show me how to use,

905
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,970
which I let him do.

906
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,348
He did other things for a while.

907
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,600
When I was 13,
I got this mild case of T.B.

908
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,436
And he wasn't so interested
any more.

909
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,524
You just have to block that
out of your memory,

910
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,527
like some scary TV movie
where you change the channel

911
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,113
and you pretend
like it never happened.

912
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,365
The whole thing
will be like a bad dream.

913
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:37,703
Yeah, anyway, my mom keeps
this gun hidden up in her closet

914
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,623
because of all
the sex-fiend killers around.

915
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,043
And one time, I told him
if he didn't leave me alone,

916
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,004
I'd get it out
and I'd shoot him.

917
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,885
I mean, he didn't give me
any more trouble or anything.

918
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,141
Now I guess I wish
I hadn't told her all that

919
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,686
because maybe it put some ideas
in her mind or something.

920
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,146
I don't know.

921
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,859
I just told her stuff I'd never told
anyone, because she was my friend.

922
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,069
She was my only real friend.

923
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,077
Where are you going?

924
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,329
Oh, I told you, hon.

925
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,957
Pop and I are going up
to the trade show in Freeport.

926
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,251
We're leaving from the restaurant.
I told you.

927
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,419
Yeah. Right. Right.

928
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:29,589
Look, are you gonna be okay?
Sure.

929
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:33,801
Suze, will you think about
what we talked about?

930
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,971
I have been.

931
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,265
That's great, hon,
because I believe

932
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,934
I got something here
that's really gonna work.

933
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,770
And you know who I want
with me by my side, don't you?

934
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,108
Who?
Who? My best girl, that's who.

935
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,527
My beautiful little lady.

936
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,781
Look, I left the phone
number on the fridge.

937
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,909
And don't forget
to lock the garage.

938
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,577
Bye.

939
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,161
Hi.

940
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,374
You know what I'm thinking, Larry?

941
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,877
Why don't we get some artificial
plants for the restaurant?

942
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,672
Good idea.

943
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,382
We don't have to water them.

944
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,967
Exactly.

01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,983
Yeah, of course you can.

948
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,194

Okay, you know
those great movies

1003
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,670
where everyone is coming out
of their graves?

1004
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,048
With, like,
half their faces missing

1005
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:09,261
and their eyes hanging out
and their lips falling off?

1006
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,596
You know those?

1007
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,097
I think I'll get sick.

1008
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,350

1009
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,770
like, real slow like this.

1010
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:21,398
They're all walking like this
and kind of grunting.

1011
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,277

1012
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,654
Oh, this will be great.

1013
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,114
And they're all looking
for the same thing.

1014
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,076
For regular live people,
to eat their flesh

1015
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:33,827
and drink their blood and all.

Smile. Smile.

1017
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,966
And they can't help themselves

1018
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,218
because they're dead

1019
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,637
and that's just what happens.

1020
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,057
That's what I felt like.

1021
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,644
You gotta tell me
what's wrong, please.

1022
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:03,983
James, do you think about me
when we're not together?

1023
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,402
All I do is think about you.

1024
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,824
When I'm not with you,
I'm not alive.

1025
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,285
Mrs. Maretto,

1026
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:18,038
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1027
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,584
I can't do this any more.
What?

1028
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:26,338
I can't go home every night
and have him try to touch me.

1029
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,842
And all the time
I'm just thinking about you.

1030
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,844
About us.

1031
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,932
And when I push him away,
he has this temper.

1032
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,767
What do you mean?

1033
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,437
Does he hurt you?

1034
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,397
Oh.

1035
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,108
There were these women,
you know,

1036
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,695
on The Sally Jesse Raphael Show
the other day.

1037
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,574
They were all wearing disguises
so their husbands couldn't find them.

1038
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:57,244
They were living in shelters, and
I thought I could live in one of them.

1039
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:00,539
If they let me bring Walter with me,
I could live in one of them.

1040
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:04,710
Someplace in another state
where no one even knows who I am.

1041
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,048
Look. Couldn't you
just get a divorce?

1042
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,801
And then...
But then he would get the condo.

1043
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:16,930
And he'd get the car.
And he'd take Walter from me.

1044
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,475
He'd take Walter.
Listen.

1045
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,728
I know you think
I'm just a kid, but...

1046
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,732
I could never do
anything bad to you

1047
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,527
or ever hurt you.

1048
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,697
A guy that does that
to someone like you

1049
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,700
doesn't deserve to live.

1050
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,911
That's the truth.
He doesn't deserve to live.

1051
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,916
No. I suppose you're right.

1052
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,585
He doesn't.

1053
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:52,716
Oh, fuck! I love this song!

1054
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,177
Don't you love this song?

1055
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,887
I don't know.

1056
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,851
Whoo!

1057
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,026

♪ Where the skies are so blue ♪♪

1063
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,473
Mrs. Maretto used to let me
drive around in her car

1064
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,143
even though I didn't even have
a learner's permit.

1065
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,812
Because she said when
she'd be living in California

1066
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,773
and doing her TV shows,
she'd make me her assistant,

1067
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,443
and I'd have to drive her
around places

1068
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,988
and help her answer
her personal fan mail.

1069
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,492
I guess this is the
most exciting time of my life.

1070
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,745
It was like living
in a really great movie,

1071
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,997
except it was kind of X-rated

1072
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:07,750
on account of all the sex stuff,
you know?

1073
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,552
Hey. Oh. Don't stop.

1074
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,888
You didn't answer my question.

1075
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,806
What question was that?

1076
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,017
Did you talk to Russell?

1077
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,686
Uh... Yeah, I did.

1078
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,147
Well, what did he say?

1079
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,274
He wants a thousand dollars.

1080
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,945
Is that all?
And some CDs.

1081
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,619
Oh, come on.
Did you get the gun?

1082
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,913
No, not yet.

1083
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,915
Why not?

1084
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,543
I don't know. I guess I thought
you'd ask Lydia or...

1085
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,921
I can't ask Liddy.
You have to ask Liddy.

1086
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,881
Don't you understand?

1087
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,510
I guess so, but I thought...

1088
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,721
Do you want me to keep
doing what I was doing?

1089
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:06,183
Yeah, please.
Okay.

1090
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,728
Then you have to do
what you have to do.

1091
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,195
Oh, God.

1092
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,406
So when will it happen?
Ow. Oh, come on. Please don't...

1093
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:25,869
I just want to know when.
Let's just do this.

1094
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,788
I don't know.

1095
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,498
Whenever. Jesus.
Oh.

1096
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,837
Look, if you don't know, I guess
I'll have to find somebody who does.

1097
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,507
Oh. Mrs. Maretto,
you have to understand. This...

1098
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,551
No. I think I do understand.

1099
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,221
Obviously you're not the mature
individual that I thought you were.

1100
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,101
No.

1101
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,396
Actually, I just had a thought.

1102
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:54,940
Maybe a better way to go
on the whole thing.

1103
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,608
What's that?

1104
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,277
Russell.

1105
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,195
What about him?

1106
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:05,576
Russell's enough of a man
to take charge of the situation.

1107
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,745
Well...
He looks at me in a certain way.

1108
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,125
I think he'd be very appreciative
of what I could do for him.

1109
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,629
What do you think?

1110
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,427
I think we could probably do it
next week.

1111
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,554
Is that soon enough?

1112
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,807
Would you really do that for me,
James?

1113
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,393
Anything.

1114
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,981
And then we can be together.

1115
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,609
And you can sleep over.

1116
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,904
And we could do
anything we wanna do.

1117
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,115
Anything?
Yeah.

1118
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,625
Anything.

1119
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,256
Got it?
Yeah, Angela, stand back.

1120
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,342
Tell me if it's straight.

1121
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,470
Oh. It looks great.

1122
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,253
Hey, Walter.

1123
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,096
Five.

1124
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,350
Walter.

1125
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,270
Four.

1126
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,025
Come on, boy.

1127
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,943
Let's go for a walk.

1128
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,111
Three.

1129
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,823
Walter.

1130
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:55,829
Two.

1131
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,081
One.

1132
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:01,835
Hi, everybody.

1133
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,463
- This is Suzanne Stone, live.
- What do you want?

1134
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,089
Don't fucking move.

1135
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,091
Just take whatever you want
and get out.

1136
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,677
Come on, Jimmy. Now.
Wait.

1137
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,056
Just wait.

1138
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:18,602
Okay, take the watch. It's a Rolex.
I know it's a fucking Rolex.

1139
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,147
Think it's the first time I've seen a Rolex?
Give me your fucking chain.

1140
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,274
Hey.
Give me your chain.

1141
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:32,157
You've probably noticed
it's been another beautiful evening

1142
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,159
with a slight chill in the air

1143
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:38,205
and those autumn temperatures
right about where they should be.

1144
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,290
Now, Jim. Now. Do it.

1145
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,668
No, no. No, please.
No, wait. Give me your ring.

1146
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,295
- My ring?
- Give it to me.

1147
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,631
Look, man, I can't give you my ring.

1148
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:49,674
My wife will kill me, man.

1149
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,469
She'd kill you?
Suzanne would kill you?

1150
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,012
Hey, you know my wife?

1151
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,222
The good news is...

1152
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,516
- Oh!
- Jimmy, now. Do it.

1153
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,851
Now. Fucking now, asshole. Do it.

1154
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,730
God, forgive me.

1155
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,614
So for the next few days,
it should be just about perfect

1156
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,366
for boat season weather.

1157
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:17,869
Well, that's about it for tonight.
I'm Suzanne Stone saying...

1158
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:22,207
I'll see you tomorrow, rain or shine.

1159
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:35,137
And if you'll allow me,
just a personal note.

1160
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,349
Um, a special greeting
to my husband, Larry,

1161
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,102
on this, our first anniversary.

1162
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:44,896
Good night, honey.

1163
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:49,109
Come on.

1164
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,712
Hello.

1165
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,927
Oh, God!

1166
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,766
Folks, that's it.

1167
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,446
Hello.

1168
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,324
Anything?

1169
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,826
- We got a little dirt.
- Who knows?

1170
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,496
And this.
What?

1171
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,332
I don't know.

1172
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,295
Feels like pieces of shell.

1173
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,631
- Janice Maretto?
- Yeah, that's me.

1174
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,799
Telephone call at the desk.
Oh, okay.

1175
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,512
Hello.

1176
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,225
What?

1177
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,312
Oh.

1178
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,233
Thank you.

1179
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,659
Hey, wake up.

1180
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,911
We're open right now.

1181
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,997
All Saturday night
around the clock.

1182
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,708
Was there an incident
at the restaurant?

1183
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,627
Some guy came in
and drink too much

1184
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,338
or said something to him?
No.

1185
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,800
Five-piece, all-wood dinettes
in Colonial, oak and white.

1186
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,802
Your choice, 297.

1187
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,014
Mattress, box, frame, 297.

1188
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,184
- That's Tom Peterson.
- And Gloria too.

1189
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:50,355
And that concludes
our broadcast day at WWEN.

1190
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,316
Your community access station
serving Little Hope

1191
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,111
and the greater
Hope County area.

1192
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,912
You don't have to talk to those
people if you don't want to.

1193
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,005
That's what surprised me.

1194
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,550
That he didn't put up
much of a fight.

1195
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,470
I mean, for a guy
with such a mean temper.

1196
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,017
When I was standing in the hall

1197
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,353
with the gun,

1198
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:55,814
I was trying to keep
from being too nervous

1199
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,608
by thinking about Mrs. Maretto

1200
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,403
and how we'd be together
for the rest of our lives.

1201
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,322
Let us take leave of our brother.

1202
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,660
Living in California,
Florida, somewhere,

1203
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:13,331
lying around on beaches
where everyone goes topless

1204
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,999
and working on her TV show.

1205
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,294
When the love of Christ,
which conquers all things,

1206
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,089
destroys even death itself.

1207
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,466
Amen.

I just knew.

1216
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,140
I don't know why I knew.
I just... I just knew.

1217
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:17,270
It was like a light just went off
in my head, and I knew she'd...

1218
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,944
I knew she just got rid of him.

1219
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:27,405
Just got in her way.

1220
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,911
Anyway, um...

1221
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,579
So, um...

1222
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,751
Yeah, and then I didn't see her again.
That was the last time I saw her.

1223
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,544
Suzanne.

1224
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,671
I'm sorry. Could we...?

1225
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,132
Could we stop for a second?

1226
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,062
What do you want, Liddy?
Just to talk.

1227
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,358
Look, I'm really busy right now.
What do you want to talk about?

1228
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:06,236
What we're gonna do.
We?

1229
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,404
You and me and Jimmy.

1230
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,491
I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared about.

1231
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,536
You and I and Jimmy are gonna
stay miles away from each other.

1232
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,455
That's what we're gonna do.
Well, he's here.

1233
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,999
Here? Shit, where?

1234
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,293
Across the street.

1235
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,298
Jesus Christ. Get in here.

1236
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,008
Get in here quick.

1237
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,721
Now, you listen to me.
You tell James to stay away, all right?

1238
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,308
What is the matter with you people?
Don't you watch Mystery Theater?

1239
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,437
He says that he needs to see you
and that he's dying of love.

1240
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,274
Tell him to call a doctor.

1241
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,026
And Russell wants
his money and his CDs.

1242
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,697
Oh. Really? You tell Russell
if he doesn't keep his mouth shut,

1243
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,491
he's gonna be playing his CDs
in the gas chamber.

1244
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:56,327
Suzanne.
What else? What do you want?

1245
01:21:56,495 --> 01:22:00,498
Just to be like before,
like we were.

1246
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,709
Lydia, we can't be
like we were.

1247
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,337
We have to forget
we ever knew each other.

1248
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,340
Go on, get out of here.

1249
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,261
What about the TV show
in California and everything?

1250
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,639
Oh. Jesus, Liddy. Get real.

1251
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,683
God.

1252
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,021
What happened?
What did she say?

1253
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:28,693
Did you tell her I love her?
Yes, I did.

1254
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,363
She said you were sick
and you needed to see a doctor.

1255
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,123
Ed. Ed.

1256
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,584
Hello, Suzanne.

1257
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:47,670
Look...
How's it going?

1258
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:52,175
Ed, I'm real unhappy I haven't been able
to give you an exclusive on everything.

1259
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:53,384
Pardon?
I mean...

1260
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,387
There's all these news markets
just clamoring for attention

1261
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:59,390
and I have to consider
future possibilities.

1262
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,643
Of course. You know,
I understand absolutely.

1263
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,228
Good. Good.
Ed, I need to collect my tapes.

1264
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,065
With the publicity, I've decided
to finish my documentary...

1265
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,067
Well, there's gonna be
a slight problem.

1266
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,028
Problem?
The cops took them.

1267
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:15,073
What do you mean?
They came and they took them away.

1268
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,366
Why would they do that?

1269
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:20,036
They said it was standard procedure.
But those tapes belong to me!

1270
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,498
Well, technically speaking, Suzanne,
those tapes actually belong to us.

1271
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:27,377
I mean, to the station,
until such time...

1272
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:31,631
I'll show you the section that piqued
the cops' interest, you might say.

1273
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,135
Today we're talking about
sexually transmitted diseases

1274
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,930
and teenage attitudes
toward them.

1275
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:42,141
Would anyone like to start it off?

1276
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,102
Personally, I'm against them.

1277
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,690
Let's see if we can be
more specific.

1278
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,442
What do you think of
when I say the word "AIDS"?

1279
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,027
- Queers.
- Perversion.

1280
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,612
The old Hershey highway.

1281
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:58,282
Settle down, children.

1282
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,450
What about you, Liddy?

1283
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:02,412
Supposing you were in a sexual
relationship with a student.

1284
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:05,373
Would you expect that person
to wear a condom?

1285
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,333
I don't know. I mean...

1286
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:12,463
I guess it would depend on, you
know, what kind of person he was.

1287
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,924
Yeah, a blind person.

1288
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,097
How about you, James?

1289
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,975
Are you personally concerned
about AIDS?

1290
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,102
Oh, um...

1291
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,980
Well, in my present situation...

1292
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:32,608
Well, in the relationship
I got going,

1293
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,111
I don't worry
about that type of thing.

1294
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,321
She's not that kind of person.

1295
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,908
She's very clean.

1296
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,131
That's the piece Geraldo used
with some minor editing.

1297
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:58,384
And itwas on First Edition
and American Justice.

1298
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:02,722
We made a few bucks on this one,
and got a nice credit.

1299
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,099
- In the Holy Spirit,
I want you to bow down...

1300
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,684
Arms straight up.

1301
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,104
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you for my life.

1302
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:15,234
Think a little bit about your life.
Think about what you can part with.

1303
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:18,488
A dollar? Ten dollars?
A hundred dollars?

1304
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:21,741
How important is Jesus
in your life?

1305
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,749
As you can imagine,

1306
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:16,295
I was shocked
beyond comprehension.

1307
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,883
I mean, to think that these
disadvantaged youngsters

1308
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:24,428
who I had taken under my wing
and spent my time with

1309
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,973
and who would only stand
to ultimately benefit

1310
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,642
from my media savvy...

1311
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:34,981
To think that they might be
responsible for this heinous crime?

1312
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,568
It simply boggles one
with disbelief.

1313
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,781
Of course, I realized,

1314
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,908
and I hope
this doesn't sound callous,

1315
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:49,745
that the upside to all this,
assuming justice prevailed,

1316
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:53,791
is that I would have
an extremely marketable commodity.

1317
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,460
Something that even PBS
would take an interest in.

1318
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,337
Which would mean
a smaller audience,

1319
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,965
but a much larger prestige factor.

1320
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:04,260
- Want to tell us about it?
- I got nothing to tell.

1321
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,304
Your friend
Russell told us plenty.

1322
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,513
Like what?

1323
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,765
He said your dick
was bigger than your brain.

1324
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:13,311
Heh, heh. Oh, yeah?
He really said that?

1325
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,022
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

1326
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,024
Fucking amateurs.

1327
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:22,403
Who?
Listen, as career criminals,

1328
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:25,239
you guys flunk out of kindergarten.

1329
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,533
Your prints are on the gun.

1330
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,661
Your pal left a trail of clam shells
all over the murder scene.

1331
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:33,205
You boys did everything
but leave a business card.

1332
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,167
There's Larry Maretto's blood
all over those shoes you wore.

1333
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:39,170
Yeah.
And pieces of Larry's brains.

1334
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:45,092
- He used to beat her up all the time.
Uh-huh.

1335
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,804
He said he was gonna kill her.
I'm sure he did.

1336
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,308
We were going to California
because

1337
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:56,228
she said I had real potential
in TV because of my voice.

1338
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:59,065
- Doing what with your voice?
- Sports.

1339
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,525
Like being a sports announcer.

1340
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,319
So when did you
start banging her?

1341
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,697
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like?

1342
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,119
It was just...

1343
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,914
We were...

1344
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,333
You were what?

1345
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,377
In love.

1346
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,718
We were in love.

1347
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:33,557
How many times? How many times
did you do it, you and Mrs. Maretto?

1348
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,895
I don't know.

1349
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,357
- Lots, I guess.
- Where?

1350
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,443
In her bed?
In her and her dead husband's bed?

1351
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,822
Yeah, sometimes.

1352
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,949
Where else?

1353
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,620
In her car.

1354
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:58,624
In her car?
Yeah.

1355
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,459
And once at school.

1356
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,129
Jesus Christ. At school, huh?

1357
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:06,674
Yeah. In the back of the gym.

1358
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:13,139
And once late at night at the station
where she does her weather reports.

1359
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:18,394
And twice at the motel
on Piedmont.

1360
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,480
Oh, and the back of
Russell's truck. Heh.

1361
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:27,111
And the movie theater
on Hayworth.

1362
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,613
Oh, a couple times
at her parents' house

1363
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,950
when they were away
on some vacation or something.

1364
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,494
And...

1365
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:41,167
Also in the field
behind the gas station.

1366
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,335
But, uh...

1367
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:47,465
Probably where you get your
doughnuts and coffee and stuff.

1368
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,301
It's close.

1369
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:53,804
Suzanne?

1370
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:11,989
Hi, Liddy.

1371
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:15,993
Is it my imagination,
or is that diet working, huh?

1372
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,704
You lost a few pounds
in there? Ha-ha-ha.

1373
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:24,043
I don't know. I haven't
been eating much lately.

1374
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:27,421
What's this
about talking to the police?

1375
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:32,051
I just figured that Russell
would tell them everything, so...

1376
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:35,304
Look. No one's gonna believe
anything Russell or Jimmy say.

1377
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:37,223
They're just a couple of punks.

1378
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,726
They wouldn't be in this deep shit
if they kept their mouths shut.

1379
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,937
There's no evidence
that we're involved.

1380
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,939
I wasn't anywhere
near the house.

1381
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:49,151
And if they did find out anything, you
know who'd be in trouble, don't you?

1382
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,403
You would. Heh, heh.
What do you mean?

1383
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,364
If you hadn't gotten
your mother's gun,

1384
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,574
Larry would still be alive,
wouldn't he?

1385
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:59,245
But you asked me to.
No, I didn't.

1386
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:03,249
No. Jimmy did.
Don't you remember that?

1387
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:06,377
But you asked Jimmy, and you
told Russell that you'd pay.

1388
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,213
No, I don't think so.

1389
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,048
Now, you listen to me.

1390
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,677
I never gave Russell any money.
Do you understand?

1391
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:17,888
The way I remember, it was your
plan all along. You and Jimmy.

1392
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:21,767
You had this fixation about me,
and you were getting a kick out it,

1393
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,353
like people with your
sexual problems tend to do.

1394
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:29,316
Russell went along with you because Russell
is basically an evil, little fucking scumbag

1395
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:34,113
who, I'll bet, you were having some kind of
sex with in spite of your lesbian tendencies.

1396
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:36,240
Wait a minute!
Wait for what?

1397
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,534
I thought we were friends.

1398
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,708
Well, okay, then.

1399
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,209
Hm?

1400
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,920
Can you take some advice
from a friend?

1401
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,047
You keep your fucking mouth shut.

1402
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,719
It's their word against mine.
Who are they?

1403
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:59,430
A bunch of 16-year-old losers
who grew up in trailers

1404
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,017
whose parents sit around drinking
and screwing their cousins.

1405
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,438
I'm a professional person,
for chrissake.

1406
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:09,773
I come from a good home.

1407
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,610
Who do you think
a jury would believe?

1408
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:25,206
Thank God we still have
legal procedures in this country.

1409
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,584
The court has wisely ruled this is
a clear case of police entrapment.

1410
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:32,504
The tapes were found to be inadmissible
evidence in the courtroom.

1411
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:39,803
My client was granted bail
in the amount of $200,000,

1412
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,140
which was steep, but at least
she will be able to assist us

1413
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:45,476
in the preparation of her defense.

1414
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:53,651
Do you have a statement? You have
something you'd like to say?

1415
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,070
Suzanne. Suzanne,
please say something.

1416
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:57,988
I just wanna say...

1417
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,618
It's nice to live in a country

1418
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,996
where life, liberty

1419
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:10,125
and all the rest of it
still stand for something.

1420
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,336
Thank you.
What are you gonna do now?

1421
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:16,006
I'm gonna go home
and walk my dog. Thank you.

1422
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,008
How are you gonna
address the questions?

1423
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,010
Will you take the stand
in your defense?

1424
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,180
Suzanne, did you get those kids
to kill your husband?

1425
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:26,016
I loved Larry Maretto

1426
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:29,687
with all my heart.

1427
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:32,231
But the fact is...

1428
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:39,738
my husband had
a serious cocaine problem.

1429
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,365
There.

1430
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,200
I've said it.

1431
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:44,827
I finally said it.

1432
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,579
I believe that while
I was making my documentary

1433
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,873
Teens Speak Out,

1434
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,668
James and Russell
became acquainted

1435
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,045
with my husband
without me knowing

1436
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,673
and got him addicted to drugs

1437
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:00,551
and became his main supplier.

1438
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,929
And when he tried
to break free of them,

1439
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,848
or maybe when he told them

1440
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:09,101
that he was thinking
of turning them in to the law...

1441
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,272
they killed him.

1442
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:17,526
I had no intention
of revealing this dark side

1443
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:20,404
of my late husband's character

1444
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:25,159
because I wanted to spare
his parents the pain.

1445
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,454
But I just don't have a choice
any more.

1446
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:31,248
I have to defend myself
with the truth.

1447
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,586
There were times when...

1448
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:53,604
And I know someday
when my fight is over,

1449
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:56,440
I will be joining my husband

1450
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:00,861
in the heaven that
he so fervently believed in.

1451
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,988
And that was the last time that we...

1452
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:06,658
- The last time we saw her.
- And that...

1453
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,620
That pretty well brings us
up to date.

1454
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,121
Until your phone call,

1455
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,540
which I must say
wasn't entirely unexpected,

1456
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,252
since in the last few days a number
of interesting offers for my story

1457
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,922
have been literally pouring in
from the networks

1458
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,341
and some major movie studios.

1459
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,929
I totally understand why we'll be
keeping this meeting confidential

1460
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:31,308
until such time as we may come
to a mutually beneficial agreement.

1461
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,477
And I have to admit,

1462
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,271
that I really do enjoy

1463
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:40,984
this spy-story aspect of our first
rendezvous, if I may call it that.

1464
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,862
Because I think that being
a good investigative reporter

1465
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:48,325
is very much like
being a kind of secret agent.

1466
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,369
I hope you enjoy
viewing this document,

1467
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:52,955
which I believe could serve
as the first draft

1468
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:57,000
that you Hollywood people
are so richly rewarded for.

1469
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:01,338
Well, I guess that's a wrap.

1470
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,360
Come on, Walter.

1471
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:54,683
- Suzanne?
- Yes.

1472
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:57,436
Finally. The famous
Suzanne Maretto.

1473
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:00,230
Oh.
How nice to meet you.

1474
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,900
Ow. Heh.

1475
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,194
Did you come all the way
from Hollywood?

1476
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,988
I came a long distance to see you.

1477
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,115
Who's this?

1478
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:11,492
Oh.

1479
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:14,077
This is Walter.

1480
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,413
Walter. Hi, Walter.

1481
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,586
I don't know why,
but I thought that you'd be older,

1482
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:25,964
running a big studio
and everything.

1483
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:27,591
Well, I am older.

1484
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,430
Come on out. I want to
show you something.

1485
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,724
Okay.

1486
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,852
I brought my tape.

1487
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:42,272
Let's go. Let's go
for a walk. Come on.

1488
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:48,612
Whoa.

1489
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:50,989
Where are we going?

1490
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,741
To show you.

1491
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,660
What?

1492
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:56,245
Whoa.

1493
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:01,667
It has to do with your story.
It is so funny.

1494
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:04,002
I don't see why
we have to go here.

1495
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,504
Yeah.

1496
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,117
And this is for you.
Thank you very much.

1497
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:37,661
You're welcome.
It looks good. Thanks, Mrs. Maretto.

1498
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:41,832
Maretto's.

1499
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,385
I understand.

1500
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,513
Thank you.

1501
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:32,049
I'll be here

1502
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,217
every day for life.

1503
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:38,555
Plus 30 years, if I live that long.

1504
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:47,064
Russell copped a plea
and got only 16 years.

1505
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,899
I miss him.

1506
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:50,776
He was my friend.

1507
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,362
And Lydia too. She was okay.

1508
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,490
Mostly Mrs. Maretto.

1509
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:00,410
And the weird thing is

1510
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:05,415
now it's hard for me to even
remember what she looked like.

1511
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,042
You know?

1512
01:40:08,086 --> 01:40:10,337
Except when I dream about her,

1513
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,131
which I do every night.

1514
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:17,552
I dream I'm at a baseball game,

1515
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:21,014
and I'm way up
in the broadcasting booth.

1516
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:24,726
And I'm calling all the plays.

1517
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,689
And she's sitting right next to me

1518
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,276
with her hand on my leg,
feeling me up.

1519
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,782
I can hardly wait
to get to sleep at night.

1520
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,953
Suzanne used to say that you're
not really anybody in America

1521
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:45,455
unless you're on TV.

1522
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:48,166
Because what's the point
of doing anything worthwhile

1523
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:51,628
if there's nobody watching?

1524
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:56,383
So when people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

1525
01:40:57,009 --> 01:41:00,303
So if everybody was on TV
all the time,

1526
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:02,973
everybody would be better people.

1527
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:07,144
But if everybody was on TV
all the time,

1528
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,312
there wouldn't be
anybody left to watch.

1529
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,606
That's where I get confused.

1530
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:14,443
Anyhow, they're flying me
to go on Oprah next weekend.

1531
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,612
I hope she's gonna give me
some diet tips.

1532
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,740
And Phil Donahue called too.

1533
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,659
To tell you the truth,
I'm kind of nervous about that one,

1534
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:26,288
because I honestly can't follow
what he's saying most of the time.

1535
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:30,208
There's some others too
that I can't really remember offhand.

1536
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:35,297
But it's really something when you think
that I'm the one who's gonna be famous.

1537
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:38,175
Suzanne would die if she knew.

1538
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:42,345
