1
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,439
I'm Cannella, one of the engineers
called for the test.

2
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,397
- Mister Cattania?
- Yes.

3
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,397
- Mister Nova?
- Present.

4
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,397
- Mister Somenzi?
- Here...

5
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,397
- Mister Bertazzini?
- Yes.

6
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,636
- Mister Cannella?
- Yes.

7
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,476
- Mister Zini?
- I'm here.

8
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,796
- Mister Terzaghi?
- Present.

9
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,390
Mister Colombo? Mister Colombo?

10
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,591
Mister Colombo?

11
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,794
Thank you very much for coming,
but we don't need you.

12
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,116
Colombo!

13
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Tanino!

14
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,999
Salvatore!

15
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,037
Salvatore!

16
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,994
Salvatore!

17
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,273
Salvatore!

18
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,318
Colombo? Colombo!

19
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,194
Salvatore!

20
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,992
Salvatore! Tanino!

21
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,589
Tanino! Tanino!

22
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,394
Tanino!

23
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,029
Salvatore!

24
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,555
Salvatore!

25
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,919
Tanino!

26
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,789
Salvatore!

27
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,191
Salvatore!

28
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,993
Salvatore! Salvatore!

29
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,195
Tanino! Salvatore!

30
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,752
Salvatore!

31
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,836
Colombo!

32
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,274
- No!
- As a matter of fact in our opinion

33
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,075
we firmly repeat that it is not
necessarily the income levels...

34
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,036
No!

35
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,273
In the tertiary sector...

36
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,151
No! No! No!

37
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,271
No!

38
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,191
In fact the parts generally
correspond exactly...

39
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,674
where we find occupation
can be increased...

40
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,635
I need an answer immediately!

41
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,513
A precise and clear stance...

42
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,393
We shall find ourselves forced to
reconsider the entire intervention

43
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,637
in employment
in the tertiary sector...

44
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,429
that was not...

45
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,280
- Is he feeling well?
- Water! Some water, please!

46
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,397
A glass of water! A glass of water!

47
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,039
A glass of water!

48
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,391
Six, zero, nine...

49
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,673
Three, nine, four...

50
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,994
- Hello!
- Hello!

51
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,759
A glass of water right away
for the top floor!

52
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,191
- What?
- A glass of water!

53
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,191
Colombo!

54
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,470
A glass of water!

55
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,716
Off with you!

56
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,799
- A glass of water...
- A glass of water...

57
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,400
- A glass of water...
- A glass of water...

58
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,513
- I phoned.
- He's phoned.

59
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,635
- He finally telephoned for it.
- Good for you! Thank you!

60
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,910
A glass of water!

61
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,394
Water! Water!

62
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,399
Air! Let him have some air!

63
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,159
Air! Air! Air!

64
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,239
Our pain at the deep grief...

65
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,396
which has struck our family.

66
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,398
"We express our heartfelt
condolences...

67
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,229
and share the deep grief
which has struck our great family."

68
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,640
It is a shame
for all of Latin America.

69
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,149
A glass of water!
Just a glass of water!

70
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,559
Here's the water!

71
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,269
The water has arrived!

72
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
Here's the water!

73
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,912
- Here's the water!
- Here's the water!

74
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,191
The water is coming!

75
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,832
Water!

76
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,719
Water! Water!

77
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,914
Seventy, eighty, ninety...
We shall buy all of it, Madam.

78
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,110
We shall build a great Sanctuary
with a swimming pool...

79
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,033
- A Sanctuary?!
- Certainly, Madam.

80
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,438
-With my name, though...
I beg your pardon...

81
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,478
Thank you!

82
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,430
You have broken your clog again.
Give it to me. I'll fix it for you.

83
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,392
Salvatore!

84
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,993
Salvatore!

85
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,592
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

86
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,394
Come along, sir.

87
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,279
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

88
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,399
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

89
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,872
Tanino! Tanino!

90
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,239
Salvatore!

91
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,114
Tanino!

92
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,639
Salvatore!

93
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,720
Tanino!

94
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,674
Tanino!

95
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,909
Tanino!

96
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,711
How's it going? All okay?
I saw some smoke outside...

97
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,752
. and I was a bit worried.
Are you sorry that I came?

98
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,834
I saw you anyway and you were busy
with some strange stuff.

99
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:18,160
Dirty dishes, huh? A big mess...
Like my place, anyway.

100
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,675
Hey, what's this? Did you do this?

101
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,270
It's beautiful!
What are you going to do? Sell it?

102
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,950
I used to sell stuff like that
but since no one ever bought it...

103
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,433
And this little duck?
It looks like an office worker.

104
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,873
Not bad. Some day you'll have
to come to my house and see mine.

105
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,553
Ah, Magic Circus! They were great
when they came to Milan.

106
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,073
Have you read all these books? Did
you understand anything they wrote?

107
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,958
This place is really cool!
I think it's fantastic!

108
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:57,074
And these? Where did you get these?
They're cool.

109
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,113
Why don't you give them to me?
I gotta do something with them.

110
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:04,393
Why don't you come with me today?
Some great stuff is coming...

111
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:08,559
and you'd sure be interested.
But we gotta move absolutely fast!

112
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,399
Don't tell me you have to work,
because I wouldn't believe you.

113
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,796
So, are you coming or not?
C'mon, let's go!

114
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,794
Get a move on! Run!

115
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,271
Oh, what a slowpoke! Move it!
