1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,143
In 1927 the 
"Aeropostale Company"

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,747
pioneered the first airmail service
between Europe and Buenos Aires.

3
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:17,150
After 3 years, 26 airmen had crashed
and died on the treacherous route. 

4
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,220
Nevertheless, having to fight new
competitors, the company decided

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,057
to extend the line to Santiago,
over the impassable Andes.

6
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,871
Mermoz! No! Look!
What are we going to do?

7
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,277
- Do? We're going to land!
- Land? Land! Are you mad?

8
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:49,849
- If we crash we'll never be found!
- Don't worry, don't worry.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,690
Here, look at this! The best 
landing field in South America!

10
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,693
Mermoz! Mermoz!
We're going too fast!

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,097
We're not stopping, Mermoz!
We're not stopping!

12
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,866
- Come on! We're doing great!
- Where are you going?

13
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,136
I'll be the brakes.

14
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,695
- Push!
- I'm pushing!

15
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,598
Again!

16
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,302
Now!

17
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,950
He'll be OK, Noëlle. Mermoz 
has crossed it dozens of times.  

18
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,419
He even found places to land.

19
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,555
I know, but I worry.

20
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:09,529
Well, the flying will be tough, 
but that's part of the promotion. 

21
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,135
Hey, there's no need to worry,
if Mermoz did it, I can do it.

22
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,338
Why couldn't I have fallen
in love with the milkman!

23
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,727
Alright, I'll show you.

24
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,731
Here is Santiago, and 
over here, is Buenos Aires.

25
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:50,336
And in between, we save the most
difficult part for you: the Cordillera.

26
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,072
I've flown all over
this mountain range,

27
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,809
you can't find a pass through
here at less than 12,000 ft.

28
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,479
You have to keep the 
plane as light as possible.

29
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,682
- Do you know what that means?
- That I'll be flying alone.

30
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,985
Mermoz! You know that Henri flew 
solo over the Sahara for a year?

31
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,054
Señor Mermoz.
Please, it's for my daughter.

32
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,090
Her name's Consuelo. 
She's a big fan.

33
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,460
Maybe, but the Sahara
is not the Cordillera.

34
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,767
There's no place to land, 
if you drop... pfff! 

35
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:25,271
Remember what the locals say.
"The Andes don't give men back".

36
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,008
Never. If you break
down, you're dead!

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,983
- What's all this paperwork?
- His contract, his insurance policy,

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,219
his, err, work permit.

39
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:44,057
Insurance policy? I'd sure 
sign that one if I were you!

40
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,427
Olé! To the Atlantic!

41
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,632
- Why the Atlantic?
- You see, Antoine...

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,136
I'm crossing it next month.
First time. First time in history.

43
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:04,611
And to you, Henri, the new
mailman of the Cordillera!

44
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,914
Don't let it bother you, Henri.

45
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,859
He's right, you know,
it's gonna be tough.

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,695
The competition is
waiting for us to fail.

47
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,665
We have to prove that we can
make this run dependably, 

48
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,101
every day, whatever the weather.

49
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,704
At the first slip up,
Lufthansa will bury us.

50
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,807
It's crucial we succeed.

51
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,579
You can count on him.

52
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,534
WINGS OF COURAGE

53
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,862
12 June 1930.

54
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,174
What do we do,
Monsieur de Saint-Exupéry?

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,443
I have to leave
without the Santiago mail.

56
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,778
He shouldn't be long now. Let's wait.

57
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,613
If it's this bad here,

58
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,683
 I can't imagine what it's like
up there in the mountains.

59
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,053
- Henri's seen a lot worse. 
- But what if he couldn't get through? 

60
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,556
What if he had to turn around? 

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,126
Lufthansa will have
beaten us by a whole day!

62
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,731
In a half hour, I can't get up.

63
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,502
We wait.

64
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,271
It's Henri's plane!

65
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,208
He turned back!

66
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,179
The watering cans! 
Quick, light the watering cans!

67
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,947
Oh, Henri. Why couldn't you make it?

68
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,417
Why? 

69
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,621
Saint Ex, yes, he's
here with me in Santiago.

70
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,091
He just landed.
He had to turn back.

71
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,328
The storm started as soon as he left.
He couldn't find a hole.

72
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,063
- But he always gets through.
- I know, 

73
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,598
it's never happened to him before.

74
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,635
He says he tried 8 times. The
pass was blocked, it was hailing.

75
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,073
As long as he's OK. How
did the plane hold up? Deley?

76
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,443
We had to change the propeller
and re-canvas the right wing. 

77
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,980
- It really got knocked through.
- Yeah, there's quite a lot of damage.

78
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,315
Will it be ready for tomorrow?

79
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,317
Renée says it could
be repaired overnight.

80
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,053
Listen, I'm holding 2 days of mail.

81
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:11,357
I need to be sure that he'll be
able to get here tomorrow. Deley?

82
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,260
Saint Ex has made the
European mail wait.

83
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,796
He's asking if you're sure
you'll be able to get there.

84
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,865
I'll be there.

85
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,467
- Yes, it's OK for tomorrow.
- Good. Good.

86
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,703
Henri wants to speak with Noëlle.

87
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,038
Ah, very important.
I'll get the operator.

88
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,208
Right, he'll hold.

89
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,334
Hello? Hello?

90
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,571
Loup de Loup, go get Noëlle.

91
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,913
- Hello? - Hello, Noëlle.
- Hello, Saint Ex.

92
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,216
- Henri is in Santiago.
I'll connect you. - Yes.

93
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,051
What are you today, sweetheart?

94
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,487
I'm wearing the little sweater you
like, the one with the butterflies.

95
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,289
Remember? The one you
bought me in Barcelona.

96
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,726
- It's nice. - Loup de Loup's
dancing, he's happy it's you.

97
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:27,366
- Henri, be careful.
- Of course I will.

98
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,538
Well I'll, uh, I'll see
you tomorrow, Noëlle.

99
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,173
See you tomorrow, my love.

100
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,344
See you tomorrow, Saint Ex.

101
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,482
- Good night, Saint Ex, thank you.
- Good night, you love birds.

102
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,392
I wonder...

103
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,630
No. Don't think, Henri.
Just fly.

104
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,013
- Henri, be careful.

105
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,842
- Of course I'll be careful.

106
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,956
What's going on? 
There's too much power!

107
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,164
Come on! Pull back! Come on!

108
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,434
Bring it back! Bring it back!

109
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,031
We'll start the search as
soon as it calms down.

110
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,499
We'll use every man we've got.

111
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,801
Well, let's just hope he
hasn't crashed into a mountain

112
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,770
 and was able to land somewhere.

113
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,705
Mmm. And that he doesn't
stray from the plane.

114
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,175
Of course not,
won't stray from the plane.

115
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,262
Don't worry. I promise I'll be back.

116
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,133
Go to sleep, dear.

117
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,271
Be strong, Loup. Good night.

118
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,436
14 June 1930.

119
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:20,913
Better get ready.
They'll be here in the morning.

120
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,323
Forget it. They'll never find you.

121
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,963
Deley!

122
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,569
Here, Deley. Here! 

123
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,940
Deley!

124
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,484
Deley!

125
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,953
I'm down here!

126
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,056
Deley!

127
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,505
Let's see. I'm exactly
halfway across the range,

128
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,008
on the border between
Chile and Argentina.

129
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,311
I have to cross over 1, 2, 3...

130
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,415
6 passes at about 12,000 ft.

131
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,987
It can't be done.
It simply can't be done. 

132
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,162
Well. Let's go.

133
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,072
Since the airplane didn't spot me
I'm heading east towards Argentina.

134
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:51,396
And to you, Henri.
The new mailman of the Cordillera.

135
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,346
Don't worry, fellas.

136
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:12,050
I'll tell them where you are.
We'll be back for you.

137
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,228
3 or 4 more days of good weather.
What do you think?

138
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,399
3 at most.
Ah, what do you know.

139
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,141
I'm walking, I'm walking...

140
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,444
I'm not stopping, I'm walking...

141
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:17,015
I'm walking, I'm walking...
I'm not stopping.

142
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,851
He knew that if he fell asleep... 

143
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,254
...the cold would turn him numb.

144
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,190
And he said to himself, 
"If I fall asleep...

145
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,661
...I'm a dead man."

146
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,097
"I'm a dead man."

147
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,400
So he kept repeating
and walking, walking...

148
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,510
Walking!

149
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm in the ant, and I'm walking.

150
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,620
16 June 1930.

151
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,690
17 June 1930.

152
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,744
I'm walking, I'm
the ant who's walking...

153
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,115
I'm walking.

154
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,255
Noëlle.

155
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,635
I'm walking.

156
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,139
I'm the ant who's walking...

157
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,043
I'm walking.

158
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,424
18 June 1930.

159
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,019
This is "Radio Argentina",
it is 1 o'clock.

160
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,256
Weather conditions throughout
the country are shifting rapidly.

161
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,494
Winter storms are expected to
reach the Andes by mid-afternoon

162
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,698
and Govt. authorities have decided
to end the search for the French pilot

163
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,068
who disappeared five days ago.

164
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,670
The novelist, Antoine
de Saint Exupéry,

165
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,906
manager of the
Aeropostale company,

166
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,309
 and himself a pilot, is still
searching the mountain range,

167
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,212
but will likely return by evening.

168
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:39,151
Despite this new tragedy, the valiant
pioneers of postal aviation carry on.

169
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,421
Dauntless aviator, Mermoz,
who last month crossed the...

170
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:58,637
It's no use, Saint Ex.
You can't see an ant.

171
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,585
Remember what the locals say:

172
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,521
"The Andes don't give
men back". Never!

173
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,719
You're never gonna make it, Henri.

174
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,989
Forgive me, Saint Ex.

175
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,225
Forgive me, Saint Ex.
Forgive me.

176
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,596
I know you were counting on me.

177
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:36,601
I know the... the company was
counting on me, but I can't go on.

178
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:43,108
Think of us and of our faith in you.
Think of what Mermoz would do.

179
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,244
Arggh... But I'm not Mermoz!

180
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,714
I'm an ant.

181
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,383
And I can't make it.

182
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,687
Look at the map.

183
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,026
Look at the map! It's
obvious nobody could make it!

184
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,031
Henri...

185
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,502
Look, you'll never die in our memory.

186
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,640
You'll remain an example to us all.

187
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,743
"Another hero dies for mail".

188
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,447
Help me, Noëlle.

189
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,151
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm gonna die.

190
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,089
Please help me.

191
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,880
Farewell to all.

192
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:14,219
My last thought will be for my wife.
With a kiss, Henri.

193
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,605
Goodbye, my love.

194
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,841
Madame Guillaumet, 

195
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,612
I'm sorry to have to talk
to you about such matters.

196
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,516
I have brought you his
life insurance contract. 

197
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,951
It's all in perfect order.

198
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,256
Easy. Everything in order now.

199
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,131
There's just one detail...

200
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,701
the money cannot be paid,

201
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,337
unfortunately, there's
no exception for pilots,

202
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,073
until his body has been found.

203
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:16,915
My body. They'll never find my body.

204
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,416
Here, honey. I found a place.

205
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,186
They'll find me here,
when the weather clears.

206
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,056
I can be spotted very easily here.

207
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,060
Now there's no way
they can't find me. 

208
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,431
So, tell me the word.

209
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,268
The word only you can say.

210
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,873
Tell me I can die.

211
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,210
I'm waiting for you
to give me the word.

212
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,888
No, I know him.

213
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,958
If he has crashed, he's walking.

214
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,857
Noëlle!

215
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm coming home, Noëlle!

216
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,703
19 June 1930.
Look at me, Mermoz!

217
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,071
Look at me!

218
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:26,110
The Andes don't give men back, huh?
Well, they'll give me back!

219
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,939
Señor?

220
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,141
Señor?

221
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,678
Noëlle...

222
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,484
Deley!

223
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,392
There!

224
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,668
- Did you find them?
- What?

225
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,806
- Did you find the plane?
- No, we didn't find the plane.

226
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,648
34º 20' South.

227
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,485
69º 35' West.

228
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,364
No. He couldn't have done it.

229
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:12,210
But I did. Even Mermoz
couldn't have done it.

230
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,355
Noëlle, it's me.

231
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,628
I'm coming home, Noëlle.

232
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,731
Yes, my sweet.

233
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,299
- Noëlle.
- Yes?

234
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,810
Noëlle...

235
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:51,315
I owe my life to you. I love you.

236
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,610
Ten days later, Henri, his hands
still swollen from frostbite,

237
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,446
was back on duty above the Andes.

238
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,917
He saw from the sky the many
summits, chasms and gorges

239
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,053
that reminded him
of his stunning victory.

240
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,955
He also flew over the promontory

241
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,857
where he had been
tempted to surrender,

242
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,862
to abandon the will to fight, to live.

243
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,065
Following Henri's indications,
the damaged plane was recovered

244
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,001
and the mail delivered
to the European addresses.

245
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,538
Admittedly, the letters arrived
several months late

246
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:53,077
but, after all, this is a true story,
and cannot be perfect.
