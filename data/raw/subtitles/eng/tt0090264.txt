1
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,468
I thought you'd never get back.

2
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,955
There was a heck of a crowd on the piste.

3
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,196
So I see.

4
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,359
- Mission accomplished?
- Best beluga.

5
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,510
Vodka - rather shaken -
and one microchip.

6
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,837
Good. I'll make a signal to M.

7
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,552
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.

8
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,755
And we could do with a couple of glasses.

9
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,077
They're in the overhead rack.

10
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,557
Commander Bond...!

11
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,911
Call me James. It's five days to Alaska.

12
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,838
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.

13
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,837
A little over the top for the office?

14
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,714
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?

15
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
Rest and recreation, my darling.

16
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,637
The trip back from Siberia
took a lot out of me.

17
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,389
Your dedication when you're on the job
is most commendable, James.

18
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,672
Omit the customary pleasantries, Miss
Moneypenny. We're pressed for time.

19
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,155
I'll fill you in later, Moneypenny.

20
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,313
- Minister.
- Commander.

21
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,396
Good morning, sir.

22
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,593
A new pet, Q?

23
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,918
If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department,

24
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,556
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine.

25
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,114
Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.

26
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,196
Very good, sir.

27
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,392
Gentlemen...

28
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,237
A silicon integrated circuit:

29
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,955
the essential part
of all modern computers.

30
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,878
No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.

31
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,996
Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage

32
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,829
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.

33
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,110
- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.

34
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,199
One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,

35
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,472
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems,

36
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,591
would be rendered useless.

37
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,270
We'd be paralysed -
at the Russians' mercy.

38
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,676
That is why a private defence
contractor came up with this:

39
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,318
a chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.

40
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,750
Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator

41
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,394
and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered

42
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,274
from the body of 003 in Siberia...

43
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,759
- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.

44
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,190
The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.

45
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,833
It would appear so.

46
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,999
Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:

47
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,758
Zorin lndustries.

48
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,033
There has been a security
check of the plant?

49
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,029
A very extensive one.
But we have no leads.

50
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,232
What about Zorin himself?

51
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,989
Max Zorin? lmpossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.

52
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,079
A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.

53
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,191
With due respect, Minister,

54
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,039
the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.

55
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,628
Precisely why
I've initiated an investigation.

56
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,399
All right, but let's be discreet about it.

57
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,676
But of course, Minister.

58
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,192
You have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed, 007.

59
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,909
They round the turn.
Just under a mile to race from this point.

60
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,200
Come on, Fluke! Move your ar...

61
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,198
- Who is number one? The grey with him?
- Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse.

62
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,912
With the cane. Max Zorin?

63
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,874
Yes. Born in Dresden.
Fled from East Germany in the sixties.

64
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,109
French passport.
Speaks at least five languages, no accent.

65
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,232
Now the talk of the City and the Bourse.

66
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,512
- The old rags-to-riches story.
- Made his first fortune in oil and gas.

67
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,995
Now a second in electronics and hi-tech.

68
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,432
Who's that with him under the hat?
With the red dress. A girlfriend?

69
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,389
We're not sure about her.

70
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,833
American. She's never far from him.
Name's May Day.

71
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,828
And dressed for the occasion.

72
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,799
Come on, Fluke! Get a wiggle on!

73
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,919
Pegasus has come from nowhere,
and as they go for the line

74
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,875
it's Pegasus who storms clear
off Fluke and Cooper Girl.

75
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,029
First, number one, second, number two,
and third, number five.

76
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,709
First number one, Pegasus,
second number two, Fluke,

77
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,991
and third number five, Cooper Girl.

78
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,992
Unbelievable! ln all my years as a trainer

79
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,918
I've never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong.

80
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,998
Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Our department.

81
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,717
- Many congratulations.
- Thank you.

82
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,949
- Lucky man, Zorin.
- Could be more than luck, Admiral.

83
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,072
- Fixed?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

84
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,832
The French Jockey Club have hired
a detective, Aubergine, to look into it.

85
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,036
Easy, Pegasus.

86
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,911
Calm down, Pegasus.

87
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,351
Steady.

88
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,519
She must take a lot of vitamins.

89
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,790
Perhaps Pegasus does too.

90
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,751
I think I should meet with
this detective friend of yours.

91
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,351
Yes. Might have some interesting
information for us. Set it up, Tibbett.

92
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,833
Right you are.

93
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,077
Moneypenny - be a darling, would you,
and collect that for me.

94
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,919
- I'll buy you dinner when we get back.
- Pegasus!

95
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,792
Bollinger, '75.

96
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,957
I see you are a connoisseur,
Monsieur Bond.

97
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,232
- Ensuite, Lafite Rothschild '59.
- Another excellent choice.

98
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,751
I'm pleased you approve -
since you're paying the bill.

99
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,599
- Cheers.
- Santé, Monsieur Aubergine.

100
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,471
The Sûreté has no information on Zorin
before he came over from East Germany?

101
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,196
Through a personal connection
I saw his dossier myself.

102
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,552
But even Sûreté records
are sometimes incomplete!

103
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,435
Et voici maintenant the fabulous
Dominique and the enchanted papillons!

104
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,389
Perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection, no?

105
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,235
Tell me, why do Zorin's horses
beat others with superior bloodlines?

106
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,237
This is a mystery.

107
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,115
- Could he be using drugs?
- Nothing showed up in the tests.

108
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,949
Later this month, Zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near Paris.

109
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,914
Security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there.

110
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,759
And l, Achille Aubergine,
intend to find it.

111
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,909
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- There's a fly in his soup.

112
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
- Follow that parachute.
- Crazy English!

113
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,550
Out.

114
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,956
My car!

115
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,555
My car!

116
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,636
Congratulations.

117
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,556
So?

118
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,953
This operation was to be
conducted discreetly.

119
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,632
It took six million francs
in damages and penalties

120
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,876
for violating most of the Napoleonic Code.

121
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,675
Under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin.

122
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,158
What did you learn from Aubergine
before his demise?

123
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,798
Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here.

124
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,433
I should be there.

125
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,348
- Can you help me, Sir Godfrey?
- I may be able to arrange an invitation.

126
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,189
It's a bit short notice...
but I might just be able to squeeze you in.

127
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,196
Thank you.

128
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,436
Sir Godfrey, your hat.

129
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,950
Mr Saint John Smith?

130
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,272
St John Smythe, my dear.

131
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,075
- My name is Scarpine. Head of security.
- How do you do.

132
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,909
- We have a room for you at the chateau.
- Oh, splendid.

133
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,350
By the way, the preview is in progress
at the main stables.

134
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,552
- Is that it?
- No, no, those are the servants' quarters.

135
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,830
The stables are over here.

136
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,556
Let me escort you there.

137
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,517
- Catalogue of the sales.
- Thank you.

138
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,110
Tell me - the lthacus colt. Is it here?

139
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,800
- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?
- Yes.

140
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,673
He's the outstanding horse of the sales.

141
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,351
He'll be shown last. We expect him
to fetch over three million dollars.

142
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,630
Sounds quite reasonable.

143
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,718
If you need any further assistance
please call me.

144
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,796
Thank you.

145
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,240
Steady! Steady, Pegasus.

146
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,756
Keep him on a tight rein!

147
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,953
Steady now, Pegasus.

148
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,470
We are now very proud to present
the full brother ofPegasus.

149
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,795
This colt is born in the purple.

150
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,356
Monsieur Smythe.

151
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,516
Monsieur Zorin has been detained.

152
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,679
He's anxious to meet you at the
reception in the chateau gardens later.

153
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,233
I look forward to it.

154
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,069
- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.
- I'm sorry, sir.

155
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,430
Your driver may stay
in the servants' quarters.

156
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,918
I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.
What do you say, Tibbett?

157
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,949
- Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex.
- Of course you are.

158
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,232
- I'll call a porter.
- Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it.

159
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,239
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.

160
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,271
When you're ready, Tibbett.

161
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,591
Well, my dear, I take it you spend
a lot of time in the saddle.

162
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,158
- Yes, I love an early morning ride.
- I'm an early riser myself.

163
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,397
Come along, Tibbett. Stop wheezing.

164
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,033
Don't stand there panting, Tibbett.
Start unpacking.

165
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,196
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

166
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,954
- The reception is at six.
- Thank you, my dear.

167
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,875
Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex
said: there is a reception at six.

168
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,515
- Yes, sir.
- So I need a white jacket and a black tie.

169
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,239
Yes, sir.

170
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,477
- And if possible, a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,070
Oh, my Lord, Tibbett!
Look at the state of my clothes.

172
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,795
- How on earth do you pack my bags?
- Sorry, sir.

173
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,235
Mr Faras told his trainer
he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt.

174
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,636
- Good. Anything from St John Smythe?
- Nothing about the sale, sir.

175
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,514
- But I'd hate to be his valet.
- You'll have to buck up your ideas.

176
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,552
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be so damned obsequious.

177
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,517
Oh, my Lord.
What the devil's wrong with these shoes?

178
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,633
- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?
- Terribly sorry, sir.

179
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,478
You blasted well should be.

180
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,674
I don't know how long
you expect to remain in my employ...

181
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,999
- Well done, my good man.
- Must we keep this up when we're alone?

182
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,079
A successful cover becomes
almost second nature.

183
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,839
What's all this about
Pegasus disappearing?

184
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,350
One minute he's in his stall -
the next, neither hide nor hair of him.

185
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,118
We should look into it.

186
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,869
Well, don't you concern yourself with that.

187
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,196
There's the man I saw
at the Pegasus stable

188
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,715
- Another wealthy owner?
- Who knows?

189
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,072
- But she'd bear closer inspection.
- We're on a mission.

190
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,193
Sir Godfrey, on a mission
I am expected to sacrifice myself.

191
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,795
Lovely party.

192
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,239
Enjoying our little party,
Monsieur... Saint John Smythe?

193
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,794
Immensely. St John Smythe.

194
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,789
Looks as though you'll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow.

195
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,633
May I introduce Miss Sutton?
Sheikh Farouk.

196
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,873
- Welcome.
- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?

197
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,150
We'll know after the 22nd.

198
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,712
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.

199
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,715
You were looking for something?

200
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,513
Yes, l... was looking for the bar.

201
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,108
Come. I will show you.

202
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,279
Oh, by the way, the name is
St John Smythe. James St John Smythe.

203
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,312
Dr Carl Mortner. At your service.

204
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,796
- Hiya, doc!
- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.

205
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,239
Mr Conley, Mr Smythe.

206
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,835
Bob Conley.

207
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,635
- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.

208
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,513
- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas?

209
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,315
Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.

210
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,398
Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.

211
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,352
Are you a doctor of medicine?

212
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,474
Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.

213
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,353
Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.

214
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,157
How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?

215
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,635
Selective breeding is important.

216
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,675
But more important
is conditioning and a desire, ja?

217
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,360
Are you talking about people or horses?

218
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,190
My principles apply equally
to human beings.

219
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,039
Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.

220
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,752
Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.

221
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,555
- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.

222
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,636
You will excuse me?

223
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,835
I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.

224
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,192
Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.

225
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,231
Have thoroughbreds interested you long?

226
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,514
Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.

227
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,996
So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.

228
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,477
- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.

229
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,309
A fellow-sportsman.

230
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,635
What about fishing?

231
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,276
Fly casting?

232
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.

233
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,756
I'm sure they are.

234
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,839
Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.

235
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,594
By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.

236
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,797
- I never would have guessed.
- Really?

237
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,639
Well, are you buying or selling?

238
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,915
- Selling?!
- Horses.

239
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,593
No, I'm not interested in horses.

240
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,154
Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?

241
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,156
May Day.

242
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,634
Get her away from him.

243
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,116
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.

244
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,396
Have Security keep a good eye on him.

245
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,350
You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...

246
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,716
No. I didn't.

247
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,952
I suppose you travel a lot?

248
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,640
Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.

249
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,912
You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.

250
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,435
Now I shall be all alone.

251
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,199
I doubt that.

252
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,949
- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.

253
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,110
- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?

254
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,316
Are you looking for this?

255
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,316
Quite a letdown.

256
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,912
- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.

257
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,358
That's a boy. There we are.

258
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,437
It's interesting. He's had surgery.

259
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,311
Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.

260
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,591
Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.

261
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,312
You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection

262
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000
of additional natural horse steroids.

263
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,312
- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?

264
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,951
The injection itself,
with that small needle,

265
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,311
is triggered by
a remote-control transmitter

266
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,353
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip -

267
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,232
or a cane.

268
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,393
The lights!

269
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,718
There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!

270
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,874
- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.

271
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,712
Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.

272
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,595
- What now?
- We'd better get back.

273
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,870
The tape ran out five minutes ago.

274
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,712
I told you not to disturb us.

275
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,196
It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.

276
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,550
Put Security on full alert.

277
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,629
Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.

278
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,713
He was the man at the Eiffel Tower.

279
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,637
- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.

280
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,356
May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

281
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,916
To take care of me personally.

282
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,271
I see you're a woman of very few words.

283
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,076
What's there to say?

284
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,078
- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.

285
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,156
Except this.

286
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,235
It is in the wrong place.

287
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,195
Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.

288
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,193
Good morning.

289
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,232
I understand you wish to see me.

290
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,593
- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.

291
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,393
I have the Progeny lndex
on the computer:

292
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,875
a compilation of thoroughbred bloodlines.

293
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,358
Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.

294
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,677
As I see it, you need a stallion.
For breeding.

295
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,997
A stallion sounds right to me.

296
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,680
I find a computer indispensable.

297
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,150
I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.

298
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,556
Misty.

299
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,675
We have several horses
that might interest you.

300
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,391
Splendid.

301
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,314
Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?

302
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,353
- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.

303
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,999
I think I have just the horse for you.

304
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,195
It's time for my morning ride.

305
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,869
- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.

306
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,159
- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.

307
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,794
Half an hour, then.
Scarpine will collect you.

308
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,876
Thank you.

309
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,759
Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.

310
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,509
Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.

311
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,474
What shall I say
if they ask where I'm going?

312
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,229
Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.

313
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,671
Just going to town to get the car washed.

314
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,632
- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.

315
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,876
A little spirited. What's his name?

316
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,956
Inferno.

317
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,113
- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.

318
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,153
Jumping together
is more realistic training.

319
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,999
Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.

320
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,829
As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.

321
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,988
You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.

322
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,994
- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.

323
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,430
You leave me little choice.

324
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,553
Splendid. Scarpine will start us.

325
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,473
Steady!

326
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,716
Keep going!

327
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,630
Sir Godfrey. Let's get...

328
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,756
You lost, 007.

329
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,952
- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.

330
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,674
My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.

331
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,116
If you're the best they have,

332
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,391
they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.

333
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,670
Don't count on it, Zorin.

334
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,395
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.

335
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,156
Other side.

336
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,396
Open up.

337
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,112
- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.

338
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,876
- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.

339
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,514
But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.

340
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,835
Come to the point, General.

341
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,996
You disregard procedure.

342
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,432
You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.

343
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,998
- Reprisals might jeopardise operations.
- You jeopardise mine!

344
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,793
Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research centre.

345
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,319
That was regrettable.

346
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,319
Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,

347
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,911
but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures.

348
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,996
We cannot tolerate that.

349
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,430
The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.

350
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,710
I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.

351
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,673
We trained you. Financed you.

352
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:10,631
What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.

353
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,517
Enough of this! Control yourselves.

354
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,592
You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.

355
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,596
Gentlemen.

356
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:41,192
For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.

357
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,348
Today we make microchips from silicon,
which is common sand.

358
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,275
But far better than gold.

359
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,833
For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:

360
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,478
you as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information

361
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,149
that made you competitive, successful.

362
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:10,430
We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel

363
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,590
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.

364
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,036
There is one obstacle.

365
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,836
Silicon Valley.

366
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,030
Near San Francisco.

367
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,950
Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.

368
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,516
This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,

369
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,395
which accounts for what -
80% of the world microchip market.

370
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,476
I propose to end

371
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,557
the domination of Silicon Valley.

372
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,753
- And to leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?

373
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,235
Project Main Strike.

374
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,193
For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.

375
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,834
A hundred million dollars?!

376
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,430
Plus half our net income?

377
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,797
Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.

378
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,638
These are outrageous terms!

379
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,832
Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.

380
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,997
- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish.

381
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,637
The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.

382
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,038
- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.

383
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,197
May Day will provide you with a drink.

384
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,196
This way.

385
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,075
So, does anybody else want to drop out?

386
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,316
Wow!

387
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,638
What a view!

388
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,115
To a kill.

389
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,832
Five dollars.

390
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,916
Thank you.

391
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,074
- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.

392
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,111
Might have some in the back.

393
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,031
I'll be a few minutes.

394
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,309
Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.

395
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,149
- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.

396
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,430
No, not yet.

397
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,156
Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.

398
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,352
Last job: chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.

399
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,358
Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.

400
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,631
Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?

401
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,955
You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?

402
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,913
We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.

403
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,959
- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.

404
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,200
His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.

405
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,118
That ties in with the horse injections.

406
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,950
In World War Il he used steroids on
pregnant women in concentration camps
