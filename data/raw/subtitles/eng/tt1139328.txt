00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:46,908
Well, I'm with you there.
So, what turned you on to politics?

(CHUCKLES)

344
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,211
Turned me on, indeed.

345
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:57,550
Let's see, I was 23, something like that,
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

346
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:02,220
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
it was raining.

347
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,992
I was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.

348
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,928
And, you know,
I'd been out the night before

349
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,528
and had a few drinks and what have you.

350
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:15,404
So, I get the pillow and I put it
over my head, and it starts up again.

351
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,999
Knock, knock, knock, knock!

352
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:21,036
And I get up, I'm swearing,
I go to the door and there's this girl.

353
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:25,016
She's soaking wet, but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections.

354
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,609
And that's it.

355
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,619
- I'm in love.
- And this is Ruth?

356
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,018
This is Ruth.

357
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:37,663
And the only way I can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

358
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,198
This is great.

359
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,259

Cambridge?

390
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,760
It was such a long time ago,
I can hardly remember.

391
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,394
You did a lot of acting?

392
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:01,163
Some.

393
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:04,837
It must have been good training
for politics, acting?

394
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,275
It was a good way to meet girls.

395
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:09,836
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?

396
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:12,611
Still, acting must have been
very important to you.

397
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,049
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.

398
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,110
You know, you go on the stage,
pretend to be somebody else,

399
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,849
and people actually applaud you for it.

400

Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.

401

- No.
- Why not?

402
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,425
Because these are the memoirs
of a Prime Minister.

403
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:25,725
And whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with,

404
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:27,856
they always said I was a bloody actor!

405
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:31,267
Do you know what the Times of London
said the day I resigned?

01:02:05,672 --> 01:02:08,436
Calling to find out how I think it went.

848
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,172
- Let him sweat.
- Does he always ask for your advice?

849
01:02:12,246 --> 01:02:13,714
Yes,

850
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:16,913
and always usually takes it.

851
01:02:17,986 --> 01:02:19,476
Until lately.

852
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:23,987
- Are you married?
- Certainly not.

853
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:26,083
- Gay?
- No.

854
01:02:26,928 --> 01:02:29,692
- Did you have a...
- I had a... Um...

855
01:02:29,764 --> 01:02:32,892
- What? Girlfriend?
- Well, a bit more than that.

856
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:34,298
Partner?

857
01:02:35,103 --> 01:02:36,468
A bit less than that.

858
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:38,369
I don't know,
40,000 years of human language

859
01:02:38,439 --> 01:02:40,600
and there's no word
to describe our relationship.

860
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,869
It was doomed.

861
01:02:41,943 --> 01:02:42,932
(CHUCKLES)

862
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,704
Come on. Let's eat.

863
01:02:51,553 --> 01:02:53,817
- How's it going?
- The book?

864
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:58,250
- Well, it's not, to be honest.
- Sit there.

865
01:02:58,594 --> 01:03:01,256
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

866
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,858
I find it difficult
to understand certain things.

867
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:08,426
- What things?
- Well...

868
01:03:10,906 --> 01:03:13,136
I can't understand
why this good-looking lad

869
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:17,201
who goes to Cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics

870
01:03:17,646 --> 01:03:21,047
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls,

871
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:23,614
- suddenly ends up...
- Married to me?

872
01:03:23,686 --> 01:03:26,587
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.

873
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,352
No, what I don't get

874
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:33,793
is why, at 22,
he's suddenly a political activist.

875
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:36,592
- I mean, where does that come from?
- Didn't you ask him?

876
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:39,327
He said he joined the party because of you.

877
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:42,200
Told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain.

878
01:03:42,272 --> 01:03:45,105
- I was gonna start the whole book with it.
- And now you're not?

879
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:48,201
No, I can't. It's not true.

880
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:52,073
- Isn't it?
- Well, you know it's not.

881
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:54,574
He'd been a member for two years
before he met you.

882
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:56,482
How do you know that?

883
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,278
I've got a copy
of his original party membership card.

884
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,351
Mike McAra found it in the archives.

885
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:08,193
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story
with too much research.

886
01:04:08,264 --> 01:04:10,255
Did he find anything else?

887
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,767
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.

888
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,230
You were more political than he was.

889
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:21,766
I was certainly a change
from his Cambridge girlfriends.

890
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:24,474
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.

891
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:27,483
And so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital,

892
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:30,111
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party.

893
01:04:30,187 --> 01:04:32,985
And I thought he married me for my body.

894
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,830
Did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right?

895
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:43,094
Of course.
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?

896
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:45,591
Ouch.

897
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:51,007
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.

898
01:04:52,243 --> 01:04:55,076
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.

899
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:57,673
We are sensitive spirits.

900
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,547
Talking of spirits, could you...

901
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,888
Let me get you a proper drink.

902
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:17,024
White wine,
never really seen the point of it.

903
01:05:17,669 --> 01:05:19,933
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.

904
01:05:20,005 --> 01:05:22,599
Ah! At last, something in common.

905
01:05:25,777 --> 01:05:28,712
Do you know the coroner reckoned
he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?

906
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,441
That's convenient.

907
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:33,717
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

908
01:05:38,356 --> 01:05:41,519
- You think his death was suspicious?
- Don't you?

909
01:05:41,593 --> 01:05:42,719
Yes.

910
01:05:44,863 --> 01:05:46,228
Yes, I do.

911
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:52,565
Today at the beach,

912
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:56,497
I met a man, an old timer
who was familiar with the currents.

913
01:05:56,576 --> 01:05:58,339
And he said that there was no way

914
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:01,744
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot.

915
01:06:01,814 --> 01:06:02,838
You're kidding.

916
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:07,113
He also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night.

917
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:11,054
And then she fell down the stairs,
and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.

918
01:06:11,124 --> 01:06:14,059
That's all you know? Jesus.

919
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:21,633
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Why?

920
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:24,098
I need to call Adam.

921
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:32,536
- What?
- Nothing.

922
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:36,014
- Aren't you gonna call him?
- Later. I'm going out for a walk.

923
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,677
But it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.

924
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:40,777
- It'll clear my head.
- Well, I'll come with you.

925
01:06:40,854 --> 01:06:44,585
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one
through on my own.

926
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:47,627
Stay here. Have another drink.
Don't wait up.

927
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:05,371
(DOOR OPENING)

928
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,806
Are you awake?

929
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:14,846
- Well, I am now.
- I'm sorry.

930
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:18,855
It's all right. Hang on.

931
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:26,326
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

932
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:30,193
I called Adam.

933
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,641
- And?
- Can I come in?

934
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:51,187
The day before Mike died,

935
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,085
he and Adam had a terrible row.

936
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:56,255
I've never told anyone this before,
not even the police.

937
01:07:56,331 --> 01:07:58,356
- What about?
- I don't know.

938
01:07:59,101 --> 01:08:02,764
But it was furious. They never spoke again.

939
01:08:03,005 --> 01:08:04,404
(DISTANT THUNDERING)

940
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:09,709
When I asked Adam about it,
he refused to discuss it.

941
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:15,275
After what you just said,
I felt I should ask him again.

942
01:08:15,851 --> 01:08:17,648
And what did he say?

943
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:20,549
He was having dinner
with the Vice President.

944
01:08:20,623 --> 01:08:24,115
That bloody Bly woman
wouldn't even give him the phone.

945
01:08:25,261 --> 01:08:28,059
(SOBBING)
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

946
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:31,795
What's he got himself mixed up in?

947
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:35,735
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.

948
01:08:37,873 --> 01:08:39,238
I'm scared.

949
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:44,071
I've never been scared in my life before,
but I am now.

950
01:08:44,547 --> 01:08:45,639
(CRYING)

951
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:50,045
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched.
Let me get you a towel.

952
01:09:06,703 --> 01:09:07,692
(SOFTLY) Bad idea.

953
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:11,106
Do you mind?

954
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:13,341
Course not.

955
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,530
The modesty of the morning after?

956
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:17,336
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.

957
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,569
You mean you thought I'd be gone?

958
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:39,090
You've taken out the family tree.
He's very proud of the Langs.

959
01:10:39,631 --> 01:10:43,362
You know, if you want a family tree,
go to a garden center.

960
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,770
Why have you underlined my name
every time?

961
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:50,137
I was surprised
there wasn't more about you.

962
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,734
Why? I'm just the wife.

963
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:55,945
Yeah, even so.
You ought not to be written out of history.

964
01:10:56,015 --> 01:10:57,778
Why not? Most women are.

965
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,909
Then I'll reinstate you.

966
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:02,315
I'll put in all the occasions
that he's forgotten.

967
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:06,791
How kind. Like the boss's secretary
that remembers his wife's birthday for him?

968
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:11,193
Something like that. But then,
like you say, I'm not a proper writer.

969
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:13,824
- What are you planning to do?
- Leave.

970
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,669
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.

971
01:11:17,737 --> 01:11:20,228
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.

972
01:11:20,306 --> 01:11:23,002
- Where will you go?
- Back to the hotel.

973
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,738
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed
in a client's house.

974
01:11:26,813 --> 01:11:30,579
- It always ends up with...
- With you screwing the client's wife?

975
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,618
No, not always.

976
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:35,415
But it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance.

977
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:40,153
And the thing we discussed last night?
What do you propose to do about that?

978
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:43,958
- That's none of my business.
- Well, you can't just ignore it.

979
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:48,195
Look, I'm his ghostwriter.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

980
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:51,931
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.

981
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:53,905
Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells AII.

982
01:11:53,974 --> 01:11:55,669
Well, if you ever decide to do that,
give me a call.

983
01:11:55,742 --> 01:11:58,176
You think I need someone like you
to produce my book?

984
01:11:58,245 --> 01:12:01,146
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.

985
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:04,511
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.

986
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:07,410
And she can do the prison visits.

987
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,719
Morning, sir.

988
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:46,885
- Finished for the night, have we?
- Why don't you just piss off?

989

(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE)
BMW ConnectedDrive.

990
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,042
Traffic is clear to your destination.

991
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,830
Join the road when possible.

992
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,887
In 200 yards, turn left.

993
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,952
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.

994
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:33,164
Turn around when possible.

995
01:14:33,237 --> 01:14:35,364
This is getting ridiculous.

996
01:14:56,394 --> 01:14:58,123
Turn around when possible.

997
01:14:58,195 --> 01:14:59,958
All right, you win.

998
01:15:14,313 --> 01:15:17,214
In 50 yards, turn left.

Turn left.

01:15:27,426 --> 01:15:29,485
You've got to be joking.

1001
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:45,540
Single or return?

1002
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,544
Return. I hope.

1003
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,509
Forty bucks, please.

1004
01:15:51,516 --> 01:15:53,245
- Have a good one.
- Ta.

1005
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:19,742
Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.

1006
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:22,147
A little more. Stop.

1007
01:16:51,812 --> 01:16:54,406
In 50 yards, turn left.

1008
01:17:02,256 --> 01:17:04,918
Please proceed to the indicated road.

1009

you will have reached your destination.

1023
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:52,352
- Is that Mrs. Emmett?
- Who is this?

1024
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:54,727
I wondered if I might have a word
with Professor Emmett.

1025
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:56,130
Do you have an appointment?

1026
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,829
It's about Adam Lang.
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.

1027
01:20:00,304 --> 01:20:02,238
Just a moment, please.

1028
01:20:04,976 --> 01:20:08,844
PAUL: This is Paul Emmett.
I think you must have made a mistake.

1029
01:20:08,913 --> 01:20:11,177
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?

1030
01:20:11,248 --> 01:20:15,379
We were contemporaries, yes,
but I can't claim to know him.

1031
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:18,014
I have a photograph of you together.

1032
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,053
Come on up to the house.

1033
01:20:50,155 --> 01:20:53,921
I make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment.

1034
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:58,228
But your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity.

1035
01:20:59,932 --> 01:21:03,663
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

1036
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:06,262
Yes, he's here now.

1037
01:21:06,873 --> 01:21:09,569
- May I?
- Sure.

1038
01:21:09,976 --> 01:21:12,376
NANCY: Yes. Yes, he's on his own.

1039
01:21:13,246 --> 01:21:14,770
He didn't say.

1040
01:21:15,515 --> 01:21:17,312
British, about 40.

1041
01:21:17,383 --> 01:21:21,285
Well, well.
I literally have no recollection of this.

1042
01:21:21,688 --> 01:21:23,315
- But that is you?
- Yes, it is.

1043
01:21:23,389 --> 01:21:26,586
I was on the board of the Dramat.
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.

1044
01:21:26,659 --> 01:21:30,789
- The Dramat?
- I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.

1045
01:21:30,863 --> 01:21:32,831
I maintained my theatrical interests

1046
01:21:32,899 --> 01:21:36,198
when I went to Cambridge
for my doctoral research.

1047
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:40,602
- Could I keep this?
- No, I'm afraid not.

1048
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:44,770
- I'm sure I could get you a copy.
- Would you? That would be kind.

1049
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,211
Maybe you could tell me
how you came by it.

1050
01:21:48,282 --> 01:21:49,943
I'd be happy to.

1051
01:21:52,786 --> 01:21:54,583
Come into my study.

1052
01:21:58,992 --> 01:22:01,460
Yes, the wall of ego.

1053
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:05,562
We all have one.
It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.

Um...

1058
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:23,707
I've been working with Adam Lang
on his memoirs.

1059
01:22:23,785 --> 01:22:25,844
Yes, I know, you told me.

1060
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:30,755
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business,
this posturing by The Hague.

1061
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:34,659
As for Rycart, the worst
British Foreign Secretary since the war.

1062
01:22:34,729 --> 01:22:35,855
Lang was right to fire him.

1063
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,797
- How well do you know Lang?
- Hardly at all.

1064
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:43,300
- You seem surprised.
- He mentions you in his memoirs.

1065
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:44,633
Oh, really?

1066
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:50,076
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised.
What does he say?

That's very decent of him.

1070
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:13,932
As Prime Minister,
he always had good instincts.

1071
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,137
- But that doesn't mean I know him.
- But the...

1072
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:19,231
That. That was taken at a reception
in London

1073
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:22,303
to mark the 10-year anniversary
of the Arcadia.

1074
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:24,812
- Arcadia?
- Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.

1075
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,644
Very highbrow.
No reason why you should have heard of it.

1076
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,810
The Prime Minister graced us
with his presence.

1077
01:23:30,986 --> 01:23:34,547
What can you remember of him
from Cambridge?

1078
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:38,824
- I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

1079
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:41,385
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.

1080
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:44,830
No one's mentioned the Cambridge
connection between us in all these years.

1081
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,529
- But you performed together?
- In one production.

1082
01:23:49,672 --> 01:23:52,904
It was the summer revue.
I can't even remember what it was called.

1083
01:23:52,976 --> 01:23:56,537
- Can I show you something else?
- If you must.

Is that what I think it is?

1088
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:11,985
Let's hope he didn't inhale.

1089
01:24:12,062 --> 01:24:13,927
But that is you standing behind him,
isn't it?

1090
01:24:13,997 --> 01:24:15,487
I do believe it is.

1091
01:24:15,565 --> 01:24:18,659
And I do believe I'm on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him

1092
01:24:18,735 --> 01:24:20,965
on the perils of drug abuse.

1093
01:24:21,037 --> 01:24:25,974
Is Mr. Lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs?

1094
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:28,977
If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.

than we were.

- Can you tell me about any of the others?
- No, I'm afraid not.

The whole summer is a blur,
a very happy blur.

1099
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:46,193
Now, you were going to tell me
about these pictures.

1100
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:49,094
I got them from Michael McAra.

1101
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:52,561
And he is whom, exactly?

1102
01:24:52,637 --> 01:24:55,105
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.

1103
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:58,467
- He resigned?
- No, he died.

1104
01:24:59,377 --> 01:25:00,776
I'm sorry to hear that.

1105
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:04,474
Yes, a couple of weeks ago.
He drove up here to see you.

1106
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:06,442
And he died a few hours afterwards.

1107
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:09,975
He drove up to see me?
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

1108
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:13,747
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

1109
01:25:13,824 --> 01:25:15,223
Poor fellow.

1110
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:21,128
I've never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless, have you?

1111
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,690
Seems to me it must be agonizing.

1112
01:25:24,303 --> 01:25:26,237
And the police never said anything to you
about this?

1113
01:25:26,305 --> 01:25:28,773
I've had no contact with the police.

1114
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,603
But were you here that weekend?

1115

on the 11th and 12th of January.

1121

Do we possess that information?

for old time's sake.

Yeah, just about.

they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!

You do work for Lang.

if I might take a look at that book.

1244
01:41:57,885 --> 01:42:02,447
No. Before we go any further,
there's a few things I'd like to know first.

1245
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:05,424
Such as,
why did Mike McAra have your number?

1246
01:42:10,064 --> 01:42:11,429
Okay. Sure.

1247
01:42:12,232 --> 01:42:13,699
He was helping me.

1248
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:15,727
McAra? How?

1249
01:42:15,803 --> 01:42:19,364
Mike found the documents linking Lang
to the torture flights.

1250
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,067
What? It was McAra
who gave you the documents?

1251
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:25,407
- Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal.
- But why?

1252
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:29,040
He didn't like discovering
he was working for a war criminal.

1253
01:42:29,116 --> 01:42:30,413
Would you?

1254
01:42:31,352 --> 01:42:33,217
Oh, I forgot. You are.

1255
01:42:35,523 --> 01:42:36,751
The book?

1256
01:43:06,488 --> 01:43:07,955
Well, don't tell me
you're gonna read it now.

1257
01:43:08,023 --> 01:43:10,423
Not all of it. Just the beginning.

1258
01:43:11,059 --> 01:43:13,186
There's something very important about it.

No, thanks, love.

01:43:24,707 --> 01:43:29,235
Mike said he'd discovered something new.
It's the last time he called me.

1263
01:43:29,612 --> 01:43:33,070
He said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government.

1264
01:43:33,149 --> 01:43:35,845
- What was it?
- He wouldn't say over the phone.

1265
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:40,753
He just kept saying if anything happened
to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.

1266
01:43:41,123 --> 01:43:42,784
"It's all there in the beginning".

1267
01:43:42,858 --> 01:43:44,382
The beginning?

1268
01:43:45,494 --> 01:43:47,462
Then he means Cambridge.

1269
01:43:59,341 --> 01:44:00,639
What the hell's this?

1270
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:03,508
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.

1271
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:06,872
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?

1272
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:10,613
On the day that Mike McAra died,
he drove up to see Emmett,

1273
01:44:11,054 --> 01:44:12,954
and I think he was murdered
on his way home.

1274
01:44:13,023 --> 01:44:14,388
- What?
- I went to see Emmett today,

1275
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:17,689
and two guys followed me from his house.
That's why I called you.

1276
01:44:18,929 --> 01:44:21,397
At the time that this photograph was taken,

1277
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:25,901
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.

1278
01:44:26,403 --> 01:44:27,427
Emmett?

1279
01:44:27,504 --> 01:44:30,473
- Foreign Resources Division.
- Oh, my God.

1280
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:34,805
You realize how important this is,
don't you?

1281
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:38,112
This explains why Lang went into politics.

1282
01:44:38,615 --> 01:44:42,415
Everyone knows he didn't have
a political thought in his pretty little head.

1283
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:47,686
This is why he rose so quickly,
with a little help from his friends.

1284
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:50,522
- Well, do you think it's possible...
- Okay, a quiz for you.

Name one decision Lang made in 10 years
as Prime Minister

which wasn't in the interests of the USA.

1287
01:44:58,569 --> 01:45:01,367
Well, come on, it's not a trick question.

1288
01:45:01,939 --> 01:45:05,602
Iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense,

1289

buying American nuclear missiles,
support of terrorist rendition.

1290

including yours truly.

1292
01:45:16,687 --> 01:45:18,279
McAra was right.

1293
01:45:18,789 --> 01:45:20,222

you're stuck at the ferry terminal.

If you refuse, he'll get suspicious.
Tell him yes.

1310

That'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks.
I'll get to the airport.

1311

See you there.

1312
01:46:16,282 --> 01:46:17,943
He sounds worried.

1313
01:46:19,419 --> 01:46:20,977
I really don't think this is a good idea.

You have no choice.

1315
01:46:22,322 --> 01:46:24,347
Emmett must have told Lang
that I'd been to see him.

1316
01:46:24,424 --> 01:46:26,790
So, what's he gonna do about it?
Dump you in the ocean?

1317
01:46:26,859 --> 01:46:29,657
- Well, it happened before!
- Which means it can't happen again.

1318

He can't drown two ghostwriters,
for God's sake. You're not kittens.

1319
01:46:36,569 --> 01:46:39,163
All this is just theory.
We don't have any proof.

1320
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,434
- You'll get us the proof.
- Me?

1321
01:46:41,507 --> 01:46:44,032
You're his ghostwriter.
Presumably, he lets you tape him.

1322
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:46,340
- I use discs, actually.
- Discs, tapes.

1323
01:46:46,412 --> 01:46:48,710
You've got to confront him with this.
Record his reaction.

1324
01:46:48,781 --> 01:46:50,510
Even if he denies it, it's something.

1325
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:54,714
I'm in a tricky position here.
I signed a confidentiality agreement.

1326
01:46:54,788 --> 01:46:55,846
It's a bit late for that.

1327
01:46:55,923 --> 01:46:59,188
- It means the discs are his property.
- The court can subpoena them.

1328
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,554
And what if I don't record any discs?

1329
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,258
Then you'll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story.

1330
01:47:05,332 --> 01:47:06,424
Then I'll deny it.

1331
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,491
Then I'll give them this.

1332
01:47:11,105 --> 01:47:13,232

Oh! Come on!

1335
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,911
Don't look so shocked.
What did you expect?

1336
01:47:21,982 --> 01:47:24,382
That I'd come into a meeting
with a man working for Lang

1337
01:47:24,451 --> 01:47:26,646
without taking any precautions?

1338
01:47:27,288 --> 01:47:30,018
Except you're not working
for Lang anymore.

1339
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,990
You're working for the good guys.

1340
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:35,888
You know all this is pointless, don't you?

1341
01:47:36,431 --> 01:47:39,662
In the end, he'll just retire over here
with his CIA pension,

1342
01:47:39,734 --> 01:47:43,397
and he'll tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.

When McAra found this,
he went to Boston to show it to Emmett,

1372

you to go into politics in the first place.

Mike betrayed you to Rycart.

just before he died.

02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:39,156
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us,

1515
02:00:39,965 --> 02:00:43,924
but because he was so brilliant
at making speeches

1516
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,337
and I'm so terrible.

"Langs are Scottish folk".

1518
02:00:49,775 --> 02:00:51,606

RUTH: Well, you'll be relieved to hear
I'm not making a speech this evening.

1526
02:01:22,542 --> 02:01:24,669
I just want to thank
our wonderful publishers,

1527
02:01:24,744 --> 02:01:27,304
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox,

1528
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:30,577
and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.

1529
02:01:31,651 --> 02:01:37,453
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.

1530
02:01:37,657 --> 02:01:40,182
Mike, our thoughts are with you.

1531
02:01:40,994 --> 02:01:45,795
In these very difficult few months,
I've drawn great comfort from this book,

1532
02:01:45,865 --> 02:01:50,700
from knowing that, despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them,

1533
02:01:51,204 --> 02:01:55,038
Mike and Adam did at least live long
enough to complete it.

1534
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:59,811
And I really believe that,
as people read these pages,

1535
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:03,907
Adam's voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come,

1536
02:02:04,018 --> 02:02:06,612
eloquent, strong and full of hope.

1537
02:02:07,354 --> 02:02:10,881
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.

1538
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:16,352
If I've left out anyone's name,
I hope you'll forgive me.

1539
02:02:19,733 --> 02:02:21,826
But now I must make a toast.

1540
02:02:22,303 --> 02:02:25,136
To the memory of a great man

1541
02:02:26,473 --> 02:02:28,941
and a great patriot,

1542
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:31,773
a wonderful husband and a devoted father.

1543
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:32,834
To Adam!

1544
02:02:32,913 --> 02:02:34,380
ALL: To Adam!

Yeah, it's just happened just now.
Yeah, if you could.
