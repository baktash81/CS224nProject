1
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,676
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,485
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,262
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,585
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,288
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,021
Mommy!

7
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:59,570
Lucy, come on!

8
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,802
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,229
Run!

10
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:08,181
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,079
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,791
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,142
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:20,168
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,104
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,897
Get out!

17
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,591
Come on!

18
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,015
Hurry!

19
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,266
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:43,459
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,286
Why can't you just do as you're told?

22
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:13,882
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

23
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,190
You warm enough? Good girl.

24
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,921
If Dad were here,
he wouldn't make us go.

25
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,785
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war
was over and we wouldn't have to.

26
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,489
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

27
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,431
Promise me you'll look after the others.

28
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,020
I will, Mum.

29
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,296
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

30
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,089
Susan.

31
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,700
Be a big girl.

32
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:13,965
All right. Off you go.

33
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:26,144
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

34
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,743
Get off me!

35
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:32,722
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

36
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,601
Peter.

37
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:46,306
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

38
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:51,350
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

39
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:11,677
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

40
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,573
The professor knew we were coming.

41
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,715
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

42
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,343
Come on, hup!

43
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,857
And whoa. Whoa.

44
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,035
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

45
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,978
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

46
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,516
No, ma'am.

47
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,540
It's just us.

48
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:10,742
Small favors.

49
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:16,560
Come on.
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

50
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:34,252
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

51
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:38,720
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

52
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,679
There will no shoutin'.

53
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:44,800
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

54
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:48,250
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

55
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,836
And above all,

56
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:58,435
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

57
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:21,651
The sheets feel scratchy.

58
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:27,669
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

59
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:31,703
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

60
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,442
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

61
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,908
You saw outside.
This place is huge.

62
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,703
We can do whatever we want here.

63
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,579
Tomorrow's going to be great.

64
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,151
Really.

65
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:55,801
"Gastrovascular."

66
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,635
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

67
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,931
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

68
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,361
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

69
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,260
We could play hide and seek.

70
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,947
But we're already having so much fun.

71
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,937
Come on, Peter, please.

72
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,058
Pretty please?

73
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:27,745
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

74
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,269
...five, six, seven, eight,

75
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,769
nine, ten, eleven...

76
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,687
...24, 25, 26...

77
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,750
I was here first!

78
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:28,311
Were you hiding from me?

79
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,394
No.

80
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,048
Uh, well...

81
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,345
I just... I...

82
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,806
No. No. I-I-I just...

83
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,460
I was just, um...
I didn't want to scare you.

84
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:52,412
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

85
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,933
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

86
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,356
And what about you?

87
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,660
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

88
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:05,434
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

89
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:10,025
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

90
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,573
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

91
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,698
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

92
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:23,669
Yes, but you are in fact human.

93
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:27,136
Yes, of course.

94
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,274
What are you doing here?

95
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,812
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

96
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:35,994
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

97
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,714
Narnia? What's that?

98
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:41,977
Well, dear girl,
you're in it.

99
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,767
Everything from the lamppost

100
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:48,469
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

101
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,763
every stick and stone you see,

102
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,511
every icicle is Narnia.

103
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,747
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

104
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:02,719
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

105
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:06,298
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

106
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:10,402
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

107
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:18,176
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

108
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,774
I... I don't know.

109
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:24,447
People do it when they meet each other.

110
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:38,749
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

111
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,773
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

112
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:46,585
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

113
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:49,047
Well, thank you very much, but I...

114
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:52,625
I probably should be getting back.

115
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:57,077
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

116
00:17:57,114 --> 00:18:00,683
with toast and tea and cakes.

117
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:05,000
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

118
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,425
- I don't know.
- Come on.

119
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,224
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

120
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,108
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

121
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:18,860
If you have sardines.

122
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,015
By the bucketload.

123
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,943
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

124
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,096
Well, here we are.

125
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,687
Come along.

126
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,297
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

127
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,179
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

128
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,886
Now, that... that is my father.

129
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:21,772
He has a nice face.

130
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,429
He looks a lot like you.

131
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,635
No.

132
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:29,832
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

133
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:33,412
My father's fighting in the war.

134
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:38,323
My father went away to war too.

135
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:42,692
But that was a long, long time ago.

136
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,953
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

137
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:51,639
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

138
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,186
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

139
00:19:55,222 --> 00:20:00,334
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

140
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,577
What? No presents for a hundred years?

141
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,880
Always winter, never Christmas.

142
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:09,875
It's been a long winter.

143
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:14,470
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

144
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,568
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

145
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:22,303
and, you know, we never got tired.

146
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,451
And music. Oh, such music!

147
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,431
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

148
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:35,284
Oh! Yes, please.

149
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:42,602
Now, are you familiar

150
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:46,481
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

151
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,699
Well, that's good.

152
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:54,241
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

153
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,316
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

154
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,041
I'm such a terrible faun.

155
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:31,317
Oh, no.

156
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:34,476
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

157
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:38,251
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

158
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:43,781
You can't have done
anything that bad.

159
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,700
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

160
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,483
It's something I am doing.

161
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,296
What are you doing?

162
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,459
I'm kidnapping you.

163
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:58,756
It was the White Witch.

164
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,849
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

165
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:03,644
She gave orders.

166
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:06,722
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

167
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,153
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

168
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,504
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

169
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,505
I thought you were my friend.

170
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,421
Now. She may already know you're here.

171
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,197
The woods are full of her spies.

172
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,994
Even some of the trees are on her side.

173
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:43,417
Can you find your way back from here?

174
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,860
- I think so.
- All right.

175
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:53,875
Will you be all right?

176
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:00,878
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

177
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,732
Here.

178
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:11,422
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

179
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,116
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

180
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:19,753
I am glad to have met you.

181
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,463
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

182
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,066
Now go.

183
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:28,052
Go!

184
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,382
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

185
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,271
Shut up! He's coming!

186
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:55,088
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

187
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,917
Weren't you wondering where I was?

188
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,909
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

189
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,297
Does this mean I win?

190
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:04,195
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

191
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,768
I've been gone for hours.

192
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,418
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

193
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:28,759
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

194
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:35,929
But I wasn't imagining!

195
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,773
That's enough, Lucy.

196
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,603
I wouldn't lie about this!

197
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,517
Well, I believe you.

198
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,158
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

199
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:48,147
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

200
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,581
Will you just stop?

201
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:52,786
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

202
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:55,811
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

203
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:59,323
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

204
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:05,599
Well, that was nicely handled.

205
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:12,249
But... it really was there.

206
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,118
Susan's right, Lucy.

207
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:17,100
That's enough.

208
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:54,244
Lucy.

209
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:57,269
Where are you?

210
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,111
Boo!

211
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:09,775
Lucy.

212
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:14,116
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

213
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:21,901
Lucy?

214
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:29,537
Lucy?

215
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,117
Lucy!

216
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,745
Lucy.

217
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,593
Where are you?

218
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,127
Lucy.

219
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,576
I think I believe you now.

220
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,231
Lucy.

221
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,930
Lucy?

222
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:20,175
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

223
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:22,573
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

224
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,154
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

225
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,493
I didn't know!

226
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,649
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

227
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,612
What is your name, Son of Adam?

228
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:46,413
Uh, Edmund.

229
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,049
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

230
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,434
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

231
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:58,509
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

232
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,880
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

233
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,439
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

234
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:08,143
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

235
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:13,197
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

236
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:31,718
Now, how about something hot to drink?

237
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:36,447
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

238
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,435
Your drink, sire.

239
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,648
How did you do that?

240
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,952
I can make anything you like.

241
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,487
Can you make me taller?

242
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,242
Anything you'd like to eat.

243
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,923
Turkish delight?

244
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,497
Edmund?

245
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:41,396
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

246
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,449
Why?

247
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,578
They're nothing special.

248
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:53,583
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

249
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:58,014
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

250
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:00,398
And you are exactly the sort of boy

251
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:06,008
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

252
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,513
Maybe even King.

253
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,213
Really?

254
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,569
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

255
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,463
Oh.

256
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:19,773
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

257
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,558
No! No, no.

258
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:26,348
But a king needs servants.

259
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:30,170
I guess I could bring 'em.

260
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:37,264
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

261
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:40,526
My house is right between them.

262
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:42,359
You'd love it there, Edmund.

263
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:47,055
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

264
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:50,993
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

265
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:55,132
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

266
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:59,338
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

267
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,257
I hope so, Your Majesty.

268
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:07,285
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

269
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,902
Edmund?

270
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,109
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

271
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,108
Isn't it wonderful?

272
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:32,716
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

273
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:37,033
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

274
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,347
The White Witch?

275
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:43,607
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

276
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,644
Are you all right? You look awful.

277
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:51,568
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

278
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:54,799
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

279
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,191
This way.

280
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:02,434
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

281
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,409
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

282
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:06,872
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

283
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,215
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

284
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,080
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

285
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:16,681
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

286
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:22,623
You... You saw the faun?

287
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:29,644
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

288
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,539
He...

289
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,073
What were you doing, Edmund?

290
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,462
I was just playing along.

291
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,884
I'm sorry, Peter.

292
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,113
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

293
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:50,137
but you know what little children
are like these days.

294
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:54,862
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

295
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,536
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

296
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:23,091
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

297
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,641
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

298
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,361
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

299
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:32,389
Come along, dear.

300
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:45,865
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

301
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,792
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

302
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:51,893
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

303
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,144
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,280
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

305
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:58,899
It's nothing.

306
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:01,774
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

307
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,098
She thinks she's found a magical land.

308
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:08,849
In the upstairs wardrobe.

309
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,527
What did you say?

310
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:17,043
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

311
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:20,210
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

312
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:22,781
She won't stop going on about it.

313
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,946
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

314
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,270
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

315
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,735
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

316
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:34,696
But of course not.

317
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:36,768
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

318
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,645
What do they teach in schools
these days?

319
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,246
Edmund said they were only pretending.

320
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,557
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

321
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:48,035
No. This would be the first time.

322
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,906
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

323
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:54,588
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

324
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:58,547
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

325
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,976
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

326
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,760
You might just try acting like one.

327
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:14,491
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

328
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,950
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

329
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,839
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

330
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:25,150
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

331
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:29,777
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

332
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:32,253
It's not like there isn't air inside.

333
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,582
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

334
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:56,352
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

335
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,781
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

336
00:38:58,818 --> 00:38:59,999
Come on!

337
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,015
No, no, back, back, back!

338
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:39,810
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

339
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:53,545
Get back!

340
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,538
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

341
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,494
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

342
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:15,273
lmpossible.

343
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,762
Don't worry.

344
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:20,994
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

345
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:24,952
I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

346
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,294
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

347
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:32,318
- But that might!
- Oh!

348
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:42,707
Ow!

349
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,919
Stop it!

350
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:47,936
You little liar.

351
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:51,759
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

352
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,880
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

353
00:40:57,982 --> 00:40:59,025
That's all right.

354
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,747
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

355
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:04,496
Oh, very funny.

356
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:05,790
Maybe we should go back.

357
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:08,592
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

358
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,865
I think Lucy should decide.

359
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:15,643
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

360
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:18,517
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

361
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:22,744
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

362
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:24,390
No.

363
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:29,404
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

364
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:33,313
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

365
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:36,466
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

366
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:39,485
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

367
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:27,684
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

368
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,453
Lu?

369
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:35,411
Lucy!

370
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,940
Who would do something like this?

371
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:17,009
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

372
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:21,130
with High Treason
against Her lmperial Majesty,

373
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:24,069
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

374
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:27,744
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

375
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:30,888
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

376
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:33,935
Long Live the Queen."

377
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,246
All right.
Now we really should go back.

378
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:40,191
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

379
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:42,223
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

380
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:46,669
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

381
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:49,415
I'm the human.

382
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,789
She must have found out
he helped me.

383
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,021
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

384
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:58,662
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

385
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,201
Why?

386
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:02,765
I mean, he's a criminal.

387
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:11,012
Did that bird just "psst" us?

388
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,530
It... It's a beaver.

389
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:04,295
Here, boy.

390
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:06,234
Here, boy.

391
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:13,690
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

392
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:16,588
Sorry.

393
00:45:17,577 --> 00:45:19,295
Lucy Pevensie?

394
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:25,585
Yes?

395
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:37,106
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

396
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,336
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

397
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:41,520
Is he all right?

398
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,313
Further in.

399
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,657
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

400
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:51,866
How do we know we can trust him?

401
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:54,431
He said he knows the faun.

402
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:58,650
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

403
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,013
Everything all right?

404
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:02,699
Yes. We were just talking.

405
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,736
That's better left
for safer quarters.

406
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:08,885
He means the trees.

407
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,046
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

408
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:44,493
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

409
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:45,893
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

410
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,634
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

411
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,464
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

412
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,242
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

413
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,222
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

414
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:01,344
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

415
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,060
Oh!

416
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,308
Well, those aren't badgers.

417
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:10,034
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

418
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:14,396
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

419
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:16,980
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

420
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,902
Oh, come inside,

421
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,459
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

422
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:24,449
and some civilized company.

423
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:28,050
Now, careful. Watch your step.

424
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:29,432
Excuse the mess.

425
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:32,565
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

426
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,617
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

427
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,658
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

428
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:49,894
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

429
00:47:50,082 --> 00:47:53,533
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

430
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:54,916
Fish 'n' chips?

431
00:47:56,797 --> 00:48:00,807
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

432
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:03,242
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

433
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,690
Aslan is on the move.

434
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:16,302
Who's Aslan?

435
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:19,051
Who's Aslan?

436
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:21,502
You cheeky little blighter.

437
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:24,838
What?

438
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:31,057
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

439
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:33,303
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

440
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:37,319
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

441
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:41,467
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

442
00:48:41,664 --> 00:48:44,111
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

443
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,055
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

444
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:49,879
They don't even know about the prophecy!

445
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:53,197
- Well, then...
- Look.

446
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:55,880
Aslan's return,

447
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:59,213
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

448
00:48:59,512 --> 00:49:01,310
it's all happening because of you!

449
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:04,916
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

450
00:49:05,374 --> 00:49:08,799
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

451
00:49:09,452 --> 00:49:11,684
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

452
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:14,628
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

453
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,545
the evil time will be over and done."

454
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:20,294
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

455
00:49:20,593 --> 00:49:22,200
You're kinda missin' the point!

456
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,303
It has long been foretold

457
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:28,371
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

458
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:33,043
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

459
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:37,247
And you think we're the ones?

460
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,243
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

461
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:42,860
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

462
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:45,047
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

463
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,887
I think you've made a mistake.

464
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:51,692
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

465
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,158
Thank you for your hospitality.

466
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:01,593
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

467
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:05,677
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

468
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:06,883
It's out of our hands.

469
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,353
I'm sorry,

470
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:13,231
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

471
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,366
Ed?

472
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,612
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

473
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:25,567
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

474
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:53,129
Hurry!

475
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,968
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

476
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:19,210
No!

477
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,783
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

478
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,026
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

479
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:27,222
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

480
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:30,952
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

481
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:32,887
To kill you!

482
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,868
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

483
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,001
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

484
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:51,514
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know what would happen.

485
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:54,007
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

486
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:55,180
Stop it!

487
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:59,716
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

488
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:03,667
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

489
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:06,536
Then take us to him.

490
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:19,815
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

491
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:22,282
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

492
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,130
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

493
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:27,012
I'm a Son of Adam!

494
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:32,514
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

495
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:36,108
Or else, not so fortunate.

496
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,973
Right this way.

497
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:04,808
Wait here.

498
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:45,279
Like it?

499
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:50,864
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,846
I thought you might.

501
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,688
Tell me, Edmund...

502
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,344
Are your sisters deaf?

503
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:04,817
No.

504
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:08,150
And your brother, is he...

505
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:11,937
...unintelligent?

506
00:55:12,764 --> 00:55:14,864
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

507
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:18,474
Then how dare you come alone?!

508
00:55:18,745 --> 00:55:21,513
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

509
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:24,397
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

510
00:55:24,543 --> 00:55:26,101
I did bring them halfway.

511
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:28,879
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

512
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:37,686
Well.

513
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:41,774
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

514
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:46,974
Well, I was wondering,

515
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:52,693
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

516
00:55:57,418 --> 00:55:59,565
Our guest is hungry.

517
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:10,429
This way for your num-nums.

518
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:15,457
Maugrim?

519
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:19,451
You know what to do.

520
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:46,967
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

521
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,339
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

522
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,667
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

523
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,325
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

524
00:56:57,362 --> 00:56:58,879
I'm cranky now!

525
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:02,581
Take them.

526
00:57:05,854 --> 00:57:09,460
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

527
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:25,809
Hurry.

528
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:44,086
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

529
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:46,638
You told me
it led to your mum's!

530
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:49,225
Lucy!

531
00:57:50,322 --> 00:57:51,852
They're in the tunnel.

532
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:55,158
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

533
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:58,218
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

534
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:08,519
You should have brought a map!

535
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,829
There wasn't room next to the jam.

536
00:58:18,554 --> 00:58:21,092
Come on, Lucy!

537
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:42,179
I'm so sorry, dear.

538
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,266
He was my best mate.

539
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:56,289
What happened here?

540
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:59,405
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

541
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:03,488
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

542
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:06,442
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

543
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:10,271
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

544
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:12,537
An unfortunate family resemblance.

545
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:16,201
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

546
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:19,340
What did you have in mind?

547
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:28,699
Greetings, gents.

548
00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:32,653
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

549
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:35,789
I know where your allegiance lies.

550
00:59:35,957 --> 00:59:37,451
We're looking for some humans.

551
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:41,368
Humans? Here in Narnia?

552
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:44,234
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

553
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:48,163
Your reward is your life.

554
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,955
It's not much,

555
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:53,298
but still.

556
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:55,723
Where are the fugitives?

557
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:05,680
North. They ran north.

558
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,593
Smell them out.

559
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,227
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

560
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:26,837
Are you all right?

561
01:00:26,963 --> 01:00:30,225
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

562
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:34,616
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

563
01:00:34,652 --> 01:00:36,145
Worst day of the year.

564
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:39,136
Thank you for your kindness,

565
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,135
but that's all the cure I have time for.

566
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:41,934
You're leaving?

567
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:45,847
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

568
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,400
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

569
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,159
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

570
01:00:53,404 --> 01:00:56,043
Like everything we've ever heard.

571
01:00:56,105 --> 01:00:59,789
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

572
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:02,428
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

573
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:05,115
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

574
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:07,767
We can't go to war without you.

575
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:15,800
We just want our brother back.

576
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:41,965
If...

577
01:01:43,336 --> 01:01:45,443
If you're not going to eat that...

578
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:54,203
I'd get up, but...

579
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:57,015
...but my legs.

580
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,176
Mr. Tumnus.

581
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,838
What's left of him.

582
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:23,374
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

583
01:02:25,457 --> 01:02:27,687
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

584
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:34,404
Is your sister all right?

585
01:02:36,445 --> 01:02:38,574
Is she safe?

586
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:44,942
I don't know.

587
01:02:50,998 --> 01:02:55,107
My police tore that dam apart.

588
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:59,689
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

589
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:06,122
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

590
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:09,866
Then you're of no further use to me.

591
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:14,385
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

592
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,996
Aslan?

593
01:03:20,918 --> 01:03:22,450
Where?

594
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,457
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

595
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:30,143
He can't be expected
to know anything.

596
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,353
I said... where is Aslan?

597
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:42,001
I... I don't know.

598
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:44,603
I left before they said anything.

599
01:03:46,971 --> 01:03:49,095
I wanted to see you!

600
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:53,408
Guard!

601
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:55,969
Your Majesty.

602
01:03:57,737 --> 01:03:59,940
Release the faun.

603
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,984
Do you know why you're here, faun?

604
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,907
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

605
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:24,492
You're here...

606
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:29,606
...because he turned you in.

607
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:33,087
For sweeties.

608
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:42,507
Take him upstairs.

609
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,659
And ready my sleigh.

610
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,800
Edmund misses his family.

611
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:19,355
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

612
01:05:19,576 --> 01:05:22,422
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

613
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,706
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

614
01:05:29,823 --> 01:05:33,246
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

615
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,179
Did you expect it to be small?

616
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:37,984
Smaller.

617
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:58,049
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

618
01:06:33,238 --> 01:06:36,718
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

619
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:40,864
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

620
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:44,200
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

621
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:46,652
Hurry up! Come on!

622
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:50,576
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

623
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,162
- Run! Run!
- Run!

624
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,276
Hurry!

625
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,956
Inside!

626
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,927
Dive! Dive!

627
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:30,050
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

628
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:02,156
Maybe she's gone.

629
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:04,453
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

630
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:07,078
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

631
01:08:07,674 --> 01:08:09,291
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

632
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:11,574
Thanks, sweetheart.

633
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,198
Come out! Come out!

634
01:08:28,386 --> 01:08:31,485
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

635
01:08:53,364 --> 01:08:55,083
Merry Christmas, sir.

636
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,703
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

637
01:08:59,828 --> 01:09:03,701
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

638
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:07,361
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

639
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:13,084
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

640
01:09:13,263 --> 01:09:15,889
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

641
01:09:16,055 --> 01:09:18,929
No. For a long time.

642
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,567
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

643
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:26,267
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

644
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:30,861
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

645
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,455
Presents!

646
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:44,561
The juice of the fire-flower.

647
01:09:44,921 --> 01:09:48,878
One drop will cure any injury.

648
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,008
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

649
01:09:56,206 --> 01:09:57,892
Thank you, sir,

650
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:01,409
but I think I could be brave enough.

651
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:03,714
I'm sure you could.

652
01:10:04,264 --> 01:10:07,473
But battles are ugly affairs.

653
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:15,752
Susan.

654
01:10:19,134 --> 01:10:23,310
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

655
01:10:24,737 --> 01:10:28,101
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

656
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:32,615
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

657
01:10:32,766 --> 01:10:36,141
blow on this
and wherever you are,

658
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:39,945
help will come.

659
01:10:40,155 --> 01:10:41,584
Thanks.

660
01:10:42,387 --> 01:10:44,178
Peter.

661
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:49,150
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

662
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:59,371
Thank you, sir.

663
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:02,756
These are tools, not toys.

664
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:05,785
Bear them well and wisely.

665
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,970
Now, I must be off.

666
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,268
Winter is almost over,

667
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:17,170
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

668
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:22,806
Long live Aslan!

669
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:27,211
And Merry Christmas!

670
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:31,813
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

671
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,492
Told you he was real.

672
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:42,500
He said winter was almost over.

673
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,430
You know what that means.

674
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,581
No more ice.

675
01:11:58,737 --> 01:12:01,986
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

676
01:12:02,203 --> 01:12:04,502
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

677
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,701
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

678
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:09,782
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

679
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:13,632
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

680
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,490
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

681
01:12:50,807 --> 01:12:52,627
Maybe you should.

682
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:02,275
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

683
01:13:02,473 --> 01:13:04,881
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

684
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:06,793
Especially with your cooking.

685
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,293
If Mum knew what we were doing...

686
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,072
Mum's not here.

687
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,351
Oh, no!

688
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:35,201
Run!

689
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:40,348
Hurry!

690
01:13:51,715 --> 01:13:53,104
- No!
- Peter!

691
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:56,110
Put that down, boy.

692
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:59,999
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

693
01:14:00,085 --> 01:14:01,442
Run him through!

694
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:05,718
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

695
01:14:05,932 --> 01:14:08,103
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

696
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,117
Smart girl.

697
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:13,599
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

698
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,904
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

699
01:14:17,096 --> 01:14:20,533
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

700
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:23,279
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

701
01:14:23,442 --> 01:14:26,877
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

702
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,561
No, Peter!
Narnia needs you!

703
01:14:29,778 --> 01:14:31,781
Gut him while you still have a chance!

704
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:36,275
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

705
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:37,853
And neither will the river.

706
01:14:39,481 --> 01:14:40,852
Peter!

707
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:49,890
Hold onto me!

708
01:15:51,561 --> 01:15:52,173
Lovely.

709
01:16:00,963 --> 01:16:02,123
What have you done?

710
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:06,432
Lucy!

711
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:10,405
Lucy!

712
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:17,189
Has anyone seen my coat?

713
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:25,335
Don't you worry, dear.

714
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,684
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

715
01:16:29,386 --> 01:16:33,524
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

716
01:17:08,094 --> 01:17:10,792
It's so warm out.

717
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,796
I'll go and check the sleigh.

718
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,384
Your Majesty.

719
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:22,645
We found the traitor.

720
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:25,340
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

721
01:17:26,012 --> 01:17:28,461
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

722
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,076
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

723
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,725
Perhaps you can help me now.

724
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:37,810
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

725
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:41,809
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

726
01:17:50,372 --> 01:17:53,276
Where are the humans headed?

727
01:17:57,194 --> 01:18:01,963
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

728
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:04,266
and that Aslan had an army there.

729
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:07,130
An army?

730
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,378
Thank you, Edmund.

731
01:18:14,915 --> 01:18:18,527
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

732
01:18:20,182 --> 01:18:23,317
...before he dies.
- No!

733
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:36,132
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

734
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:37,871
Mine...

735
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:42,580
...or theirs.

736
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:51,294
Go on ahead.
Gather the faithful.

737
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,639
If it's a war Aslan wants...

738
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,310
...it's a war he shall get.

739
01:20:00,486 --> 01:20:02,233
Why are they all staring at us?

740
01:20:02,946 --> 01:20:05,831
Maybe they think you look funny.

741
01:20:10,574 --> 01:20:13,817
Oi, stop your fussing.
You look lovely.

742
01:20:32,312 --> 01:20:34,778
We have come to see Aslan.

743
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,726
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

744
01:21:21,992 --> 01:21:25,775
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

745
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,230
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

746
01:21:29,382 --> 01:21:31,956
But where is the fourth?

747
01:21:33,114 --> 01:21:34,692
That's why we're here, sir.

748
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:37,507
We need your help.

749
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,184
We had a little trouble along the way.

750
01:21:41,506 --> 01:21:43,182
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

751
01:21:43,313 --> 01:21:46,163
Captured? How could this happen?

752
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:52,276
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

753
01:21:52,406 --> 01:21:55,510
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

754
01:21:56,327 --> 01:21:58,170
I'm sure there's an explanation.

755
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:02,587
It's my fault, really.

756
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:06,534
I was too hard on him.

757
01:22:10,683 --> 01:22:12,863
We all were.

758
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:14,965
Sir, he's our brother.

759
01:22:15,044 --> 01:22:17,042
I know, dear one.

760
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,954
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

761
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,083
This may be harder than you think.

762
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:35,630
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

763
01:22:36,614 --> 01:22:40,321
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

764
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:43,988
You doubt the prophecy?

765
01:22:44,045 --> 01:22:47,579
No. That's just it.

766
01:22:48,841 --> 01:22:51,646
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

767
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,574
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

768
01:22:56,129 --> 01:23:00,441
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

769
01:23:03,129 --> 01:23:06,760
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

770
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:10,602
more powerful than any of us,
that rules over all of Narnia.

771
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,971
It defines right from wrong,

772
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,968
and governs all our destinies.

773
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:19,815
Yours... and mine.

774
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:21,632
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

775
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,605
You've brought them safely this far.

776
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:26,817
Not all of them.

777
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:30,723
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

778
01:23:31,141 --> 01:23:34,398
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

779
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:39,023
I, too, want my family safe.

780
01:23:41,867 --> 01:23:45,769
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

781
01:23:45,982 --> 01:23:48,989
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

782
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:55,317
Special treatment for the special boy!

783
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,888
Isn't that what you wanted?

784
01:24:01,944 --> 01:24:03,386
You look like Mum.

785
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:07,028
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

786
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,191
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

787
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:16,086
If we ever get back.

788
01:24:19,622 --> 01:24:21,458
I'm sorry I'm like that.

789
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:26,840
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

790
01:24:27,043 --> 01:24:30,497
Yes. Before you got boring.

791
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:32,661
Oh, really?

792
01:24:46,006 --> 01:24:47,640
Please don't try to run.

793
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:51,374
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

794
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:57,402
Susan!

795
01:25:07,412 --> 01:25:08,799
Get back!

796
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:10,967
Peter! Ah!

797
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:14,406
Come on.

798
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:18,348
We've already been through this before.

799
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:21,373
We both know you haven't got it in you.

800
01:25:21,475 --> 01:25:23,569
Peter! Watch out!

801
01:25:32,588 --> 01:25:36,894
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

802
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:40,642
You may think you're a king,

803
01:25:40,823 --> 01:25:42,778
but you're going to die...

804
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:44,794
...like a dog!
- Look out!

805
01:25:45,714 --> 01:25:46,811
Peter!

806
01:26:04,771 --> 01:26:05,820
After him.

807
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:09,376
He'll lead you to Edmund.

808
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:15,218
Peter.

809
01:26:16,035 --> 01:26:17,721
Clean your sword.

810
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:26,613
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

811
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:29,880
Knight of Narnia.

812
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:57,794
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

813
01:26:58,131 --> 01:27:00,726
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

814
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:11,455
The prisoner!

815
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:42,446
You're not
going to kill me?

816
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:47,311
Not yet.

817
01:27:50,981 --> 01:27:53,174
We have work to do.

818
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:25,863
Edmund!

819
01:28:58,327 --> 01:29:00,002
What's done is done.

820
01:29:00,641 --> 01:29:04,326
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

821
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:15,109
Hello.

822
01:29:29,268 --> 01:29:31,742
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

823
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:34,465
Get some sleep.

824
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:44,216
And Edmund...

825
01:29:46,869 --> 01:29:49,992
...try not to wander off.

826
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:04,559
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

827
01:30:06,221 --> 01:30:08,707
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

828
01:30:09,346 --> 01:30:10,655
We're going home?

829
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:13,099
You are.

830
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,176
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

831
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:20,584
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

832
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:22,151
But they need us.

833
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,718
All four of us.

834
01:30:26,896 --> 01:30:28,220
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

835
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:30,842
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

836
01:30:31,978 --> 01:30:33,893
Which is why we have to stay.

837
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:41,164
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

838
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:45,476
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

839
01:30:53,544 --> 01:30:55,464
I suppose that's it then.

840
01:30:57,286 --> 01:30:58,826
Where are you going?

841
01:31:00,866 --> 01:31:03,441
To get in some practice.

842
01:31:26,495 --> 01:31:29,548
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

843
01:31:29,754 --> 01:31:31,315
- En garde!
- Now block.

844
01:31:32,999 --> 01:31:35,933
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

845
01:31:37,384 --> 01:31:38,940
Whoa, horsie!

846
01:31:39,302 --> 01:31:41,875
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

847
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:43,721
Sorry.

848
01:31:43,866 --> 01:31:46,483
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

849
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,263
She's on her way here.

850
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:54,290
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

851
01:31:55,084 --> 01:31:58,270
Empress of the Lone Islands!

852
01:32:25,718 --> 01:32:28,736
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

853
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:34,741
His offense was not against you.

854
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:38,476
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

855
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:41,358
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

856
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,410
I was there when it was written.

857
01:32:45,849 --> 01:32:50,454
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

858
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:53,634
His blood is my property.

859
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:56,425
Try and take him then.

860
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:03,478
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

861
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,189
...little King?

862
01:33:09,246 --> 01:33:12,747
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

863
01:33:13,581 --> 01:33:16,782
all of Narnia will be overturned

864
01:33:17,107 --> 01:33:19,907
and perish in fire and water.

865
01:33:20,086 --> 01:33:22,849
That boy will die

866
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:24,568
on the Stone Table...

867
01:33:28,421 --> 01:33:30,899
...as is tradition.

868
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,433
You dare not refuse me.

869
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:37,651
Enough.

870
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:43,188
I shall talk with you alone.

871
01:34:35,889 --> 01:34:39,111
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

872
01:34:41,203 --> 01:34:43,603
How do I know your promise will be kept?

873
01:35:37,056 --> 01:35:40,347
- Susan!
- Mm?

874
01:36:29,252 --> 01:36:31,940
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

875
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,522
We couldn't sleep.

876
01:36:38,138 --> 01:36:39,479
Please, Aslan.

877
01:36:40,964 --> 01:36:42,905
Couldn't we come with you?

878
01:36:43,284 --> 01:36:45,811
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

879
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:49,152
Thank you.

880
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,559
It is time.

881
01:37:15,274 --> 01:37:18,992
From here, I must go on alone.

882
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:19,702
But Aslan...

883
01:37:19,903 --> 01:37:24,355
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

884
01:37:24,594 --> 01:37:25,614
Thank you, Susan.

885
01:37:26,317 --> 01:37:28,268
Thank you, Lucy.

886
01:37:28,794 --> 01:37:30,552
And farewell.

887
01:38:35,983 --> 01:38:40,305
Behold. The great lion.

888
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:07,514
Do you want some milk?

889
01:39:08,887 --> 01:39:10,817
Why doesn't he fight back?

890
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:13,609
Bind him!

891
01:39:23,688 --> 01:39:24,829
Wait!

892
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:28,785
Let him first be shaved.

893
01:39:50,373 --> 01:39:52,770
Bring him to me.

894
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:54,753
You know, Aslan,

895
01:40:56,126 --> 01:40:58,199
I'm a little disappointed in you.

896
01:41:00,294 --> 01:41:04,338
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

897
01:41:07,528 --> 01:41:10,120
You are giving me your life

898
01:41:10,246 --> 01:41:12,737
and saving no one.

899
01:41:15,064 --> 01:41:17,157
So much for love.

900
01:41:25,939 --> 01:41:27,125
Tonight...

901
01:41:29,197 --> 01:41:34,181
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

902
01:41:37,044 --> 01:41:38,863
But tomorrow,

903
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:44,784
we will take Narnia

904
01:41:45,028 --> 01:41:50,235
forever!

905
01:41:54,186 --> 01:41:55,719
In that knowledge,

906
01:41:56,966 --> 01:41:58,269
despair...

907
01:42:08,804 --> 01:42:12,386
...and die!

908
01:42:29,661 --> 01:42:31,563
The Great Cat...

909
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:34,782
...is dead!

910
01:42:37,925 --> 01:42:39,187
General.

911
01:42:40,143 --> 01:42:42,325
Prepare your troops for battle.

912
01:42:46,048 --> 01:42:48,135
However short it may be.

913
01:43:36,827 --> 01:43:38,444
It's too late.

914
01:43:40,192 --> 01:43:42,008
He's gone.

915
01:44:00,993 --> 01:44:03,809
He must have known what he was doing.

916
01:44:37,315 --> 01:44:40,675
Get away! Get away, all of you!

917
01:44:41,444 --> 01:44:44,447
No. Look.

918
01:45:04,879 --> 01:45:06,696
We have to tell the others.

919
01:45:07,555 --> 01:45:11,209
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

920
01:45:11,456 --> 01:45:13,060
They need to know.

921
01:45:20,078 --> 01:45:22,124
The trees.

922
01:46:06,311 --> 01:46:08,146
Be still, my Princes.

923
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:13,475
I bring grave news from your sisters.

924
01:46:28,398 --> 01:46:29,890
She's right.

925
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,446
He's gone.

926
01:46:41,081 --> 01:46:43,136
Then you'll have to lead us.

927
01:46:45,278 --> 01:46:50,529
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

928
01:46:50,588 --> 01:46:53,540
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

929
01:46:57,123 --> 01:46:59,130
And so do I.

930
01:47:06,303 --> 01:47:10,408
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

931
01:47:55,978 --> 01:47:59,927
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

932
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:02,053
Numbers do not win a battle.

933
01:48:02,257 --> 01:48:05,814
No. But I bet they help.

934
01:49:35,877 --> 01:49:37,996
I have no interest in prisoners.

935
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,261
Kill them all.

936
01:50:37,524 --> 01:50:40,351
Look to the sky!

937
01:51:07,147 --> 01:51:08,594
Are you with me?

938
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:11,926
To the death.

939
01:51:15,112 --> 01:51:20,394
For Narnia and for Aslan!

940
01:51:23,542 --> 01:51:24,314
Go!

941
01:51:25,862 --> 01:51:29,408
Go! For Aslan!

942
01:53:01,049 --> 01:53:02,604
We should go.

943
01:53:08,233 --> 01:53:10,226
I'm so cold.

944
01:53:36,302 --> 01:53:37,848
Susan!

945
01:53:54,528 --> 01:53:55,721
Where's Aslan?

946
01:53:57,757 --> 01:53:59,440
What have they done?

947
01:54:09,602 --> 01:54:11,839
Aslan!

948
01:54:19,651 --> 01:54:22,337
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

949
01:54:22,538 --> 01:54:25,327
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

950
01:54:25,798 --> 01:54:28,817
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

951
01:54:29,009 --> 01:54:32,037
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

952
01:54:32,225 --> 01:54:34,208
is killed in a traitor's stead,

953
01:54:34,864 --> 01:54:36,631
the Stone Table will crack

954
01:54:37,412 --> 01:54:41,094
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

955
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:43,461
We sent the news that you were dead.

956
01:54:43,968 --> 01:54:46,102
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

957
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:47,323
We have to help them.

958
01:54:47,835 --> 01:54:51,377
We will, dear one, but not alone.

959
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,638
Climb on my back.

960
01:54:53,864 --> 01:54:56,956
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

961
01:54:57,145 --> 01:54:59,302
And you may want to cover your ears.

962
01:55:19,695 --> 01:55:21,575
Fire!

963
01:55:41,408 --> 01:55:43,469
Yes!

964
01:55:55,676 --> 01:55:59,091
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

965
01:56:00,068 --> 01:56:02,722
That's the signal. Come on!

966
01:56:10,292 --> 01:56:11,708
Where are we going?

967
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,808
Hang on!

968
01:56:25,044 --> 01:56:26,207
Fall back!

969
01:57:06,105 --> 01:57:08,108
Stop!

970
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:22,048
Susan, this is...

971
01:59:22,225 --> 01:59:23,762
Mr. Tumnus!

972
01:59:25,112 --> 01:59:28,440
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

973
01:59:28,652 --> 01:59:31,601
Peter will need everyone we can find.

974
01:59:58,089 --> 02:00:00,574
Edmund! There's too many!

975
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:02,344
Get out of here!

976
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:05,296
Get the girls and get them home!

977
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,080
You heard him! Let's go!

978
02:00:29,966 --> 02:00:31,390
Peter said get out of here!

979
02:00:31,543 --> 02:00:33,142
Peter's not king yet.

980
02:02:10,339 --> 02:02:12,002
Impossible!

981
02:03:26,506 --> 02:03:28,443
It is finished.

982
02:03:29,614 --> 02:03:31,022
- Peter!
- Peter!

983
02:03:37,138 --> 02:03:38,963
Where's Edmund?

984
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:52,687
Edmund!

985
02:04:45,352 --> 02:04:48,058
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

986
02:06:23,461 --> 02:06:26,046
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

987
02:06:26,315 --> 02:06:30,351
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

988
02:06:55,491 --> 02:06:57,666
To the great Western Wood,

989
02:06:57,970 --> 02:07:02,167
King Edmund the Just.

990
02:07:03,494 --> 02:07:06,014
To the radiant Southern Sun,

991
02:07:07,508 --> 02:07:11,518
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

992
02:07:12,289 --> 02:07:15,577
And to the clear Northern Sky,

993
02:07:16,122 --> 02:07:18,255
I give you King Peter,

994
02:07:19,314 --> 02:07:21,402
the Magnificent.

995
02:07:25,459 --> 02:07:27,797
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

996
02:07:28,044 --> 02:07:30,934
always a King or Queen.

997
02:07:31,515 --> 02:07:33,369
May your wisdom grace us

998
02:07:33,490 --> 02:07:36,295
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

999
02:07:37,025 --> 02:07:38,763
Long live King Peter!

1000
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:41,237
Long live King Edmund!

1001
02:07:42,243 --> 02:07:44,136
Long live Queen Susan!

1002
02:07:44,617 --> 02:07:47,356
Long live Queen Lucy!

1003
02:08:11,946 --> 02:08:12,932
Don't worry.

1004
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:17,624
We'll see him again.

1005
02:08:17,801 --> 02:08:20,050
- When?
- In time.

1006
02:08:21,484 --> 02:08:26,114
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1007
02:08:27,728 --> 02:08:29,533
But you mustn't press him.

1008
02:08:30,808 --> 02:08:34,054
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1009
02:08:34,257 --> 02:08:35,698
No.

1010
02:08:36,374 --> 02:08:38,531
But he is good.

1011
02:08:39,995 --> 02:08:41,063
Here.

1012
02:08:42,152 --> 02:08:45,370
You need it more than I do.

1013
02:09:40,493 --> 02:09:41,708
Are you all right, Philip?

1014
02:09:42,899 --> 02:09:44,949
I'm not as young as I once was.

1015
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:48,597
Come on, Ed.

1016
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:53,078
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1017
02:09:53,236 --> 02:09:55,565
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1018
02:09:55,742 --> 02:09:57,508
I'll get the stag myself."

1019
02:10:03,034 --> 02:10:04,987
What's this?

1020
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,240
It seems familiar.

1021
02:10:15,026 --> 02:10:17,240
As if from a dream.

1022
02:10:17,316 --> 02:10:18,924
Or a dream of a dream.

1023
02:10:22,717 --> 02:10:24,877
Spare Oom.

1024
02:10:27,588 --> 02:10:29,583
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1025
02:10:31,827 --> 02:10:33,633
- Lu?
- Come on!

1026
02:10:45,381 --> 02:10:46,650
These aren't branches.

1027
02:10:49,292 --> 02:10:52,505
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1028
02:10:52,704 --> 02:10:54,300
Peter, move off!

1029
02:10:54,735 --> 02:10:56,861
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1030
02:10:57,059 --> 02:10:58,684
I'm not on your toe!

1031
02:11:16,749 --> 02:11:18,623
There you are.

1032
02:11:21,271 --> 02:11:23,666
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1033
02:11:25,152 --> 02:11:28,332
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1034
02:11:34,188 --> 02:11:36,135
Try me.

1035
02:12:38,972 --> 02:12:41,180
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1036
02:12:44,292 --> 02:12:48,293
You see... I've already tried.

1037
02:12:51,217 --> 02:12:52,770
Will we ever go back?

1038
02:12:53,518 --> 02:12:54,751
Oh, I expect so.

1039
02:12:56,255 --> 02:12:59,053
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1040
02:13:01,524 --> 02:13:03,271
All the same...

1041
02:13:03,313 --> 02:13:05,062
best to keep your eyes open.
