Hey, Lucy Liu, come here.

36
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,368
This is my boy, Danny.

37
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,196
- You mind taking him for a good time?
- What? No.

38
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,763
- Don't be a pussy.
- No, I'm fine.

39
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,591
- Let's go.

00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,015
What did Daddy do to you?

45
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,234
Come on, you can tell me.

46
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,284
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

47
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,939
Who wants to let me
give them a dance?

48
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,550
- You want a dance?
- No, thank you.

49
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,860
Hello. How you doing?

50
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,080
Back off, bitch.

51
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,652
So, minus 40% is $287.

52
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:13,871
Minus $160.

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,524
You said it was $130.

54
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,265
Well, you got here after five,
didn't you?

55
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,534
Bye, new girl.

56
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,188
Is he bothering you?

57
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,277
Listen, he bothers you,
you got my number, right?

58
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:31,149
You need anything,
you call me.

59
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:33,891
Someone to talk to.
Coke. Anything.

60
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,155
You wanna keep working
that VIP. All right?

61
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,767
All right.

62
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,726
I love the recently-divorced.

63
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,252
I made everything I need to.

64
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,949
Oh, my God.
That couple that I was dancing for,

65
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,386
they were generous,
but his breath was, like, hot.

66
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:56,087
Hey there, sexy,
how you doing?

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,918
Figure she loses a
husband, she's gotta get surgery...

68
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,181
She got hit by a stick.
Does that count as surgery?

69
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,183
She looks like
she was sucking on a lemon.

70
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,592
All right, Grandma.
I gotta go.

71
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,551
Did you get something to eat?

72
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,596
I'm gonna eat
at the diner, okay?

73
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,859
What happened
to your necklace?

74
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:32,036
It's fine, Dorothy.

75
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,955
- Here.
- No, you keep it.

76
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,653
What do I need it for?
Come on.

77
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,395
You take
such good care of me.

78
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,268
I'll see you later, okay?

79
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,072

Yeah.

99
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,668
Where's your coat?

100
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:51,626
I left it inside.

101
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,194
Yeah? Climb in my fur.

00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,418
- Freeze out here.
- I know.

105
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,645
So, is Justice,
like, really a model?

106
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,649
Yeah, she'd like to think so.

107
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:20,264
I mean, some of the girls have been
in, like, Playboy, Hustler.

108
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:23,397
I was a centerfold once.

109
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:24,833
No way.

110
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:27,053
'93.

111
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:28,968
- No fucking way.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,187
Oh, my God.

113
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,581
Back when Stevie Wonder
came in.

114
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,671
What the fuck did Stevie
Wonder come to the club for?

115
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,414
Casey had him
in the Champagne Room.

116
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,937
Swears to God he isn't blind.

117
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,287
Wow.

118
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:49,945
How come you're so good?

119
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,688
I see you with
every single kinda guy, and...

120
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,257
I don't know, it's like you
have 'em all figured out.

121
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,651
I guess
I'm just a people person.

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,309
You know? It's easier if you think of them
as, like, your rich friends, you know?

123
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,311
Some of them are not so bad.

124
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,531
Where else you dance?

125
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,751
I was at Sin City...

126
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,144
- for way too long.
- Mmm.

127
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:19,453
Then I heard some boiler room guys saying
how all the money was in the city, so...

128
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,499
So, you followed
the green brick road?

129
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,979
- Yup.
- So far so good?

130
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,112
I mean, it's okay.

131
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,331
Get out.

132
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,420
I mean,
you must be cleaning up.

133
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:30,943
You're new.

134
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,858
You're fucking gorgeous.

135
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,251
You're Asian.

136
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,644
It's like a triple threat.

137
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:39,386
But I'm not that good.

138
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:41,649
I mean, if I...

139
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,264
Maybe if you, like, I don't
know, showed me moves.

140
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:54,183
Maybe we could work together.

141
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:55,794
You know?

142
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,276
I could give you
a crash course in this place.

143
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,322
Introduce you
to some of my regulars.

144
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,848
It's just mostly Wall Street guys
looking to spend money on pretty girls.

145
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,508
What do you think of that?

146
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:18,730
- Yeah, that would be cool.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,777
So, it was Ramona's
idea that you two work together?

148
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,475
Yes, that's right.

149
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,695
And at this point,
everything was aboveboard.

150
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,132
I mean,
I thought she was nice.

151
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,789
And when would you say that
things got out of control?

152
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,884
Ramona was always in control.

153
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:45,713
Front hook.

154
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:47,933
Ankle hook. Yup.

155
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:49,891
Knee hook.

156
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,371
Hold on with that knee.

157
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,807
Okay.

158
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:54,809
From here,
you could do the carousel.

159
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,942
Put your head back.

160
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,987
Come down.

161
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,600
You can do Peter Pan.

162
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:05,080
Knee hook.

163
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,255
Just spin.

164
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,781
Jesus Christ.

165
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,609
Then you can go
into a fairy sit.

166
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:13,741
Oh.

167
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,613
Stag.

168
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,702
- That's pretty.
- Reverse stag.

169
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:19,181
That's pretty too.

170
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:20,400
Scissor sit.

171
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,143
Table top.

172
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,536
I can't do that.

173
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,451
You can do that.
You're gonna do that.

174
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,366
A climb.

175
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:34,240
What if you don't have muscles
to do that?

176
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:36,198
- You have muscles to do this.
- I don't have any.

177
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:37,896
Every girl
has muscles to do this.

178
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,115
You could do this one,
this is a martini.

179
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,031
Fireman down.

180
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,472
Boom.

181
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:51,257
- That's... pretty good.
- Ready?

182
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,563
Push it, baby.

183
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:54,391
You go.

184
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,829
- There you go. Just point your toes.
- Okay.

185
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,134
There you go.
Hold yourself up.

186
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,353
I'm trying.

187
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,748
Try laying flat across.
Do a tabletop.

188
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:06,359
They all love seeing that.
Makes you look strong.

189
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,578
Okay.

190
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,583
- There you go. Yes. Okay.
- Yeah?

191
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,368
- This does hurt my vagina.
- Can you grab your foot?

192
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,631
There you go.

193
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,241
- This doesn't look sexy.
- You know what?

194
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,634
- Thumb up your butt, almost.
- Thumb up my butt?

195
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:21,940
- You know how to do that.
- How do I...

196
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:23,550
- Put your head back.
- I'm gonna fall.

197
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:25,247
You're not gonna fall.
Straighten your legs out.

198
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,510
- Both of them?
- Point your toes.

199
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,338
Yes! Yeah, point your toe.

200
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:31,340
Oh, my God.

201
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,087
We gotta get you outta those
training pumps into a good shoe.

202
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,959
I know.
It's hard for me to balance.

203
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,875
No. It's easier in these.

204
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,399
Hey, you know Diamond
from the Bronx, right?

205
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,228
What's up, baby-boogie-down-
fucking-Bronx-bitch?

206
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,361
Come on, she's gonna help you.

207
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:53,493
- You're gonna help me?
- You're gonna help us out right now.

208
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,451
- Get in the chair.
- Okay.

209
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,974
Get in the chair.

210
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,411
You're gonna help her learn
how to do a real dance.

211
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:00,544
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay. I'm good with that.

212
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,763
- Okay.
- Come on. Show me what the fuck you got.

213
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:06,811
There, that's good.

214
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,117
I really just go like that.

215
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,424
- No, wait. Wait.
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

216
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,557
- I'm trying to grind his dick.
- Arch your back more.

217
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,907
Oh, my. Move your hair,
look at me or something.

218
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,649
- Push your butt out.
- No. I know I'm hopeless.

219
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:20,128
No, look, that's it.

220
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,348
You don't have to be
the best dancer.

221
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:25,873
You just have to make their eyes
move just one inch. Come here.

222
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,179
- What do you mean?
- Let me tell you something.

223
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:28,180
- Show her.
- Okay.

224
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,747
Watch and learn.

225
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,488
- You fucking sit there.
- Sit, ma. Come on.

226
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,360
You drain the clock and not
the motherfucking cock,

227
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,753
you know what I'm saying?

228
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:37,494
And you just go slow.
Right there.

229
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,843
- Slow.
- And you look at them.

230
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,192
- Super slow.
- Uh-huh.

231
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,933
- Slower.
- A little slower.

232
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,674
- Slower.
- Sexier.

233
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,240
- Yes.
- And look back at it.

234
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,722
Oh, yeah. They love that.
The slower the better.

235
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,289
Like a motherfucking sloth.

236
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,812
- That's $20 right there.
- Slow.

237
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,771
Remember, drain the clock,
not the cock.

238
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,642
- Drain the clock, not the cock.
- That's it.

239
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,427
Come on, now you look
like you're taking a shit.

240
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,476
You can't deny she got it.
We gonna make some money tonight.

241
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,304
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

242
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,088
I said: "Are we gonna make
some fucking money tonight?"

243
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,829
Yeah!

244
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:11,571
Tracey, have you met Destiny?

245
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,051
No. Hey.
You're from Queens, right?

246
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:14,531
Yeah, Kew Gardens.

247
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,184
- Okay, I'm from Briarwood.
- Cool. Yeah.

248
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,838
Yeah.

249
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:18,883
And this is Star.

250
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:19,971
Hi.

251
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,538
And you've gotta meet Liz.

252
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,757
Liz. Liz!

253
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,629
She playin' a song
for Jackie's new titties.

254
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:28,066
- They're double-Ds!
- Jackie got new titties?

255
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,111
Yeah! New titties!

256
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,984
- It's this new gummy-bear technology.
- Yes! Who did these?

257
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:34,376
- Dr. Bobby.
- These are good.

258
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:35,464
Isn't he amazing?

259
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,031
Thank God for Dr. Bobby.

260
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:40,208
And this is Mercedes.
This my baby.

261
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,297
Hi. Nice to meet you.

262
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,690
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Destiny.

263
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:44,778
Tracey.

264
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,171
Your boyfriend's here.

265
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,955
- What? Girl, again?
- And he's crying.

266
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,478
Crying?

267
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:51,045
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah, hon.

268
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,699
What? Girl, what's going on
with Rodrigo?

269
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,701
Girl, I don't know. He's
just been so jealous lately.

270
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,311
- "Lately"?
- Yeah.

271
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:58,357
You can't let him drop
you off. You know that.

272
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,054
I know.
But, like, you know how it is.

273
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,753
- At first, he liked this shit.
- Of course he did.

274
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,711
'Cause you wanna know why?

275
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:07,018
These motherfuckers think that
it's so fun to date a stripper

276
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:10,935
'cause it's like, "We move, and we fuck.
And we fuck the best. It's the shit."

277
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:14,068
And then, when they realize
that we work six nights a week,

278
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,680
last shit we wanna see
is their damn dicks.

279
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,464
Okay!

280
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:21,946
I just wanna chill on my couch
in some feetie pajamas

281
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,733
with my nigga, ice cream, no makeup,
and for damn sure not with these on.

282
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,998
Wait. I just make my boyfriend
masturbate beside me.

283
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,174
- What?
- Is that weird?

284
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,612
Shit. I haven't had sex
in two years.

285
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,135
- Oh, baby.
- Two years?

286
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,354
Well, I have a boyfriend.

287
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:40,529
Since when?

288
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:41,705
Since now.

289
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,753
He don't bother me.
He don't get jealous.

290
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,408
The only time he complain is when I
don't change the batteries, bitch.

291
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,499
Too bad he ain't got no money.

292
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,544
Well, bitch, I can't
have everything, can I?

293
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,026
Hey, ladies,
who wants cake?

294
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,420
Aww.

295
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:02,900
Ma, what are you doing to us?

296
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,728
You can't keep doing
this to us.

297
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,339
It's a little motivation
for my babies.

298
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Trying to make some extra tips.

299
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,170
- I wanna have a tiny, tiny little sliver.
- Teeny, teeny.

300
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,433
But only 'cause I know
you made it with love.

301
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,522
Go crazy. Get a big piece.

302
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,393
Everybody have a piece
of the fucking cake.

303
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:19,917
- Let me get my Tupperware.
- I don't want that cake.

304
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,179
Eat it.

305
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,835
Hey. You an investor
in this place?

306
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,314
No.

307
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,664
Then quit putting money
back into it.

308
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,143
Let the guys get fucked up.

309
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,147
First get 'em a single,
then a double, then a triple,

310
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,715
then go back to a double,
and then a single.

311
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,022
You want 'em drunk enough
to get their credit card,

312
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:39,893
but sober enough
to sign the check.

313
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,157
Lenny, give us a beat.

314
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:44,637
You got it, gorgeous.

00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,295

322
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,959
According to Ramona,

323
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,874
there were three tiers
of Wall Street guys.

324
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:08,139
The guys at the bottom, they don't
do anything dirty to make money.

325
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:10,271
So, most of them
don't have any.

326
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,187
But if they do, you can
milk 'em for every penny.

327
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,844
♪ I, I get it ♪

328
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,456
You know,
maybe they're in a loveless marriage.

329
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,025
Or maybe they're single
and feeling dejected.

330
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,682
Either way, you can string 'em
along without getting physical.

331
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,642
Chuck here pays for my
apartment on the Upper East Side

332
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,688
and I've never even sniffed
his dick.

333
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,913
The guys in the middle,
they'll get their hands a little dirty.

334
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,741
But they have their limits.

335
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,092
Don't tase me, bro.

336
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:51,617
They dabble in greed.
But they never cross a certain line.

337
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:54,054
Or maybe
they're not as good at it.

338
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:56,622
That's why they all share
a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill.

339
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,061
But then there's
the motherfuckers on top.

340
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,541
You're a dickwad,
fucking pussy.

341
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:06,501
CEOs, CFOs,
investment bankers,

342
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:10,244
corporate raiders,
hedge funders, ax murderers.

343
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:13,552
Found footage.
You like it? Take a look.

344
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:16,598
Look familiar?
Too close to home, mama?

345
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,905
Coming straight from
the crime scene into the club.

346
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,778
But not through the front.
Oh, no.

347
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,910
These guys, they don't wanna
be written about on page six.

348
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:26,957
They come through the back.

349
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:30,003
They take the private elevator
to the one room without cameras.

350
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,136
How you feeling today?

351
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,268
Oh. Feel a lot better now.

352
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,096
- Make some money?
- Oh, yeah.

353
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:41,319
And they don't leave till they
spend $10,000, $15,000 in one night.

354
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,502
They can be degrading,
possessive, aggressive, violent.

355
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,200
And they never get
in any trouble.

356
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,377
Because everyone's willing
to cover their tracks.

357
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,425
'Cause deep down
they all want what they got.

358
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,342
They all wanna be on top...
where there are no consequences.

359
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,128
♪ I saw you ♪

360
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:12,219
You're just another deal to them.
And that's all they are to you.

361
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:20,227
♪ In a mist of a dream ♪

362
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:29,541

363
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:31,891
It's business.

364
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,981
And it's a more honest transaction
than anything else they did that day.

365
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:37,462

366
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:54,696

00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:03,270

All you have to do is figure
out who you're dealing with.

371
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,898
And then play them
at their level.

372
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,341
I'm gonna do that.

373
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,696
Let me help you.

374
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,568
I got it.

375
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,396
Hold on. Wait. You gotta
spread it out a little bit.

376
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,007
I did.

377
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,791
I gotta get a bigger boot.

378
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,924
Oh, my God. Wait.

379
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,100
- 'Kay, hold on.
- Wait, yeah, you got it.

380
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,579
I got it!

381
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:52,972
She wasn't in it
to make friends.

382
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:55,453
- Yay!
- It just happened.

383
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:08,640
- This is fucking hot.
- It's perfect.

384
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:11,208
- 'Cause it's classy. And I just wanna...
- No. I love it. It's perfect.

385
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:12,905
But do you think it's too big?

386
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,473
Are you kidding me?
A bag can never be too big.

387
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,257
Come on, let's ring you up.

388
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,177
What are you looking at?
Ring it up.

389
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,049
Thank you.

390
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:27,528
There you go, baby.

391
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:37,843
Okay.

392
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,892
Ta-da! I'm designing
my own swim-line.

393
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:46,330
- You made these?
- Uh-huh.

394
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,549
I like to use
a lot of mixed media.

395
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:50,899
So I, like,
find leather pieces,

396
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:53,902
and then I get little chains
and make belts out of them.

397
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,427
And this right here,
these are epaulets.

398
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:58,559
That's French for
"little shoulders."

399
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,605
You know, a lot of people are
afraid to wear denim in the ocean,

400
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,912
but I swear that these get more
comfortable when they're wet.

401
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:05,436
Specifically salt water.

402
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,264
Here. Try these on.

403
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:13,531
It's gonna take some time for me
to save up the money for my label,

404
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,708
but I do have a client
who's a graphic designer,

405
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:18,318
and he mocked-up
this logo for me.

406
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,321
"Swimona."

407
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,454
It's catchy, right?

408
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:25,064
Did you go to school for this?

409
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,718
Yep. Thirteen credits
away from graduating.

410
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,025
Oh, my God.
Those look amazing on you.

411
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,417
- Yeah.
- So hot.

412
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,116
Bear Cub, is that you?

413
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:34,682
Mom?

414
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:36,162
Oh, yes.

415
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,208
Hi, my gorgeous girl.

416
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,645
Hi. How's my little genius?

417
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,951
How's that big,
beautiful brain of yours?

418
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:47,782
Juliet, this is Mommy's
friend, Dorothy. Say hi.

419
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,436
Hi.

420
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,524
- Oh, yeah. She's always so shy...
- Hi.

421
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,048
Unless it's a cute boy.

422
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,614
I'll take it from here,
Manuela.

423
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,834
Ay, gracias, señora.

424
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:58,271
Goodbye, Juju.
Te quiero mucho.

425
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,144
What do you want
for dinner, baby?

426
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:04,016
I don't wanna be dependent
on anybody.

427
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,539
Like, ever.

428
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,411
You know?

429
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:12,024
I just wanna be able to take care of
my grandma for the rest of her life.

430
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,201
Maybe go shopping
every once in a while.

431
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,335
Yeah. That's how I feel.

432
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:21,468
I just want my daughter to be able
to do whatever she wants, you know?

433
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,341
Go to whatever school
she wants, or not.

434
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:27,561
If that's what she wants.

435
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,651
I swear,
I'd do anything for this kid.

436
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,002
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

437
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,311
Well, that would explain
my mother.

438
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:42,402
Hmm.

439
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,802
Is that how
you would describe her?

440
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,326
My mother?

441
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,719
I mean Ramona.

442
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,422
How much of this
is going into the article?

443
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,122
- Oh, I...
- It's just, I really hope

444
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,256
it's not some story about all
strippers being thieves or whatever.

445
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:12,171
- Not at all.
- 'Cause they're not.

446
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,521
And it's things like this
that add to a stigma,

447
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:16,610
and I don't wanna
perpetuate anything.

448
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,830
- Of course.
- You gotta understand.

449
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,614
I was making
an honest living then.

450
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:22,007
Everything was good.

451
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,053
Everybody was happy.
Everybody was making money.

452
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,361
- Beautiful couch.
- I know.

453
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:30,233
- That's your window.
- I got my own place in the city.

454
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,105
That's your floor. Your living room.
That's your floor.

455
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,542
Yes. And, of course...

456
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:37,153
my vagina.

457
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,852
I helped my grandma
get out of debt.

458
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,597
And Ramona inspired me
to go back to school.

459
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:47,641
Wow!

460
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:52,690
I'm sorry. It's just your
penmanship is really remarkable.

461
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,909
I'm Stephen.

462
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,433
You know, I just got
a vest just like that.

463
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:58,217
- Do you?
- Yeah. I think it's really chic.

464
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,002
I'm really blown away
by your penmanship.

465
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:02,961
Seriously.
You could be a font.

466
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,354
Thanks.

467
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,007
Did you know
that they do that?

468
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,879
- No.
- They do.

469
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:13,101
They take your handwriting
and they make it into a font.

470
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:18,977
And then put it into your computer so
you can type with your own handwriting.

471
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:20,761
But I don't have a computer.

472
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:24,200
- Oh! Right.
- I know.

473
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:28,769
I mean, I guess that's why my
handwriting's so good, right?

474
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:34,514
Right. Right. Yes.

475
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:43,741
2007 was the fucking best.

476
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,832
Sup, bro? You good?

477
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:52,315
Yo. Come here.

478
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,579
Hey.

479
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:56,971
What's going on?
What's your name?

480
00:26:57,668 --> 00:26:59,104
I'm Destiny.

481
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,193
- Destiny, I'm Johnny. Sup?
- Nice to meet you.

482
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,673
It's nice to meet you.

483
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:06,067
Fucking unbelievable.

484
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:07,678
- Where'd that necklace come from?
- Do you fucking hear yourself?

485
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,766
Hey! Come here.

486
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,420
Welcome to my family.

487
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,161
I'm Kim Kardashian.

488
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,512
The princess
is in the building!

489
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:20,386
I made more money that
year than a goddamn brain surgeon.

490
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,478
And, sure, some days sucked.
Like any other job.

491
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:27,698
But other days...

492
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,483
What do you think?

493
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:34,270
If I could fuck a car...

494
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,708
- I'd fuck this car.
- This is fucking it.

495
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,275
This is fucking it.

496
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,233
- Stick with me, baby.
- Yeah, let's do it.

497
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,974
What? Yes!

498
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,541
Oh, shit.

499
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:46,760
That's my motherfucking song
right there.

500
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,677
Girl.

501
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:54,072

00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:40,858
I'm gonna get you some food
when I get off.

519
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:44,296
I'm gonna rub your back,
give you some pussy, go to bed.

520
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,993
All right? I'll see you.

521
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,647
Everybody has a job in here.

522
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,215
The bouncers, the house mom,
everybody but you.

523
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:54,132
All you do is get your fucking dick sucked
by the new bitches, rude fucking idiots!

524
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,612

Usher, baby.

552
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:42,066
And for one last moment...
everything was so glamorous and cool.

553
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,466
We begin our coverage tonight
of what's been called

554
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,817
"the worst financial crisis
in modern times."

555
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:58,299
Certainly, the largest financial
disaster in decades in this country,

556
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:01,564
and, perhaps,
the end of an era in American business.

557
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:05,916
Some of the biggest names in
American business are, tonight, gone,

558
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,266
along with a lot of money
and a lot of jobs.

559
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,616
The crash put
everybody out of business.

560
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,662
But I had other things
on my mind.

561
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,838
How am I gonna make money?

562
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:17,797
...lost
504 points on the day's trading.

563
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:19,495
I'll take care of you.

564
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:21,975
Des, look at me. Look at me.

565
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,760
I promise.

566
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:25,544
I'll take care of you.

567
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,027
If he's a boy,
we'll name him Johnny.

568
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,812
I hope it's a boy.

569
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:42,343
After I stopped
working, I lost touch with Ramona.

570
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:46,565
That's just what happens
when you have a kid.

571
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,351
- Get out!
- Stick to it this time then.

572
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:52,789
- Stick to it this time.
- I will! Get the fuck away from me.

573
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:54,617
Go. Leave. We don't need you.

574
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,227
- Remember you said this.
- Get the fuck out.

575
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,881
It's what you wanted.
This is what you wanted.

576
00:31:58,055 --> 00:31:59,535
I don't give a shit!

577
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,058
This is the last fucking time
I'm doing this.

578
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:08,195
Hi, baby. It's okay. Shh.

579
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:12,460
Shh.

580
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,994
Hello?

581
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:26,736
Hey, Stephen. It's Destiny.

582
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,349
D... Destiny. Wh... Uh...

583
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,265
- Wow.
- Yeah.

584
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,354
Time flies, right?

585
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,531
Uh...
Where are you?

586
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:42,665
Well, you know,
I just got back to the city.

587
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,537
Um, I moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

588
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:48,845
- But I've missed the seasons.
- I'm just gonna take this downstairs.

589
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:51,282
And I really missed you.

590
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,720
Are you still there?

591
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:56,679
Yes, uh, I'm still here.

592
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,855
Um, I'm ju...

593
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:00,726
Do you, uh...

594
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,510
Do you need to get that?

595
00:33:02,902 --> 00:33:03,947
What?

596
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:05,949
Do you need to help the baby?

597
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,430
No, that's my friend's baby.
I'm just watching it.

598
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,258
Listen, I really didn't mean
to bother you.

599
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,217
I mean, if you're not happy
to hear from me,

600
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,828
- I can call somebody else.
- No, no. I'm happy.

601
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:19,092
I just wish that you
had called sooner.

602
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,355
Fatima came back.

603
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,619
Who?

604
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,403
My fiancée.

605
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:27,753
I mean... my wife.

606
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:31,061
My fiancée became my wife.

607
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,889
Right. Yeah.
I know, that's how it happens.

608
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,499
- Okay. Bye, Stephen.
- If you...

609
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,558
So, your last job was in 2008?

610
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:53,431
Yes. But it's not like I was...

611
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,302
I mean, I had a baby.

612
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,174
So, I was busy doing that.

613
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,481
A year of waitressing.

614
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,006
Did you graduate high school?

615
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:06,183
Oh, I see here
you got your GED.

616
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,101
Five years
at Sin City Cabaret.

617
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:14,800
- What did you do there, exactly?
- Bartending, mostly.

618
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,412
And what about at Moves?

619
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:19,718
Bartending, mostly.

620
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:23,722
So you really don't have
any retail experience.

621
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,463
No, not yet.

622
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,683
But that's why I'd really like
to get retail experience

623
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,206
because then I would have it.

624
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:33,514
We're really looking for
someone with retail experience.

625
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:39,172
Well, how am I supposed to get retail
experience without retail experience?

626
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,566
I mean, I sold beer.
What's the difference?

627
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,967
Baby, come here.

628
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:52,969
Did Nana fall asleep?

629
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,058
There we go.

630
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:57,147
Are you okay?

631
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:20,910
You're in my seat.

632
00:35:21,562 --> 00:35:22,563
I'm so sorry.

633
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:30,876
You're so pretty.

634
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:47,371
Another Red Bull?

635
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,677
Mom!

636
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,898
Hey! Welcome back, sweetie.

637
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,595
- They have you up front now?
- Yup.

638
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,293
What the hell happened
to this place?

639
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:57,773
2008 happened.

640
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,470
The guys
don't wanna spend money.

641
00:35:59,644 --> 00:36:01,472
The girls
don't wanna share tips.

642
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:04,170
Management has taken the cameras
out of the Champagne Room.

643
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,869
And I'm up front
in customer service.

644
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:08,871
Yes, I see you. Hello.

645
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,046
Another Red Bull?

646
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,222
Who are these girls?

647
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:13,919
Russians, mostly.

648
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
They look like models.

649
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,968
They're giving blow jobs
for $300 a pop.

650
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,386
Yeah? What else you got?

651
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:51,783
Come on. Don't be a tease.
Are you a tease?

652
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,003
Feel how hard you make me.

653
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,963
We're not supposed to do that.

654
00:36:58,137 --> 00:36:59,530
Oh, come on. Just stroke it.

655
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:02,489
I'll give you $100.

656
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:05,971
A hundred. One hundred.

657
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:07,973
Please.

658
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,063
Here.

659
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:12,978
Three hundred.

660
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,719
Pretty please.

661
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,590
Just for a minute. Come on.

662
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,593
Hey. We'll make
each other feel good.

663
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:34,434
All right.

664
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:44,488
When I got off the floor,
I saw that he gave me three 20s.

665
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:55,629
You don't have to believe me.

666
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,155
I'm used to people
not believing me.

667
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:05,639
I just wanted to tell you so that you
know where my head was at when I saw her.

668
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:27,618
Whoa.

669
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,104
- Oh, my God.
- There's no way.

670
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:38,237
Oh, my God,
she's fucking gorgeous.

671
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:40,718
Of course.

672
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:41,937
How old is she now?

673
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,503
Two and a half.

674
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,767
There's nothing like it,
is there?

675
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,597
Juliet still lets me sleep
in her bed.

676
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:52,599
But I just know she's gonna
throw me out any day now.

677
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,345
I missed you, you know that?

678
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,174
I missed you, too.

679
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,005
Where'd you go, baby?

680
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:14,926
What happened with Johnny?

681
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:22,629
Why didn't you call me?

682
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,590
You know that you and Lily can
always stay with me and Juju.

683
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,506
You know that.
No, don't do that. Come on.

684
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,290
No. Don't do that thing.

685
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,032
Don't do that.

686
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,079
It's me.

687
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,212
Hey.

688
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:44,390
You remember
what we were like back then?

689
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,958
Remember?

690
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,829
We were like
fucking hurricanes.

691
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,614
Weren't we?

692
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,490
I just need to make money
right now, though, you know?

693
00:39:57,664 --> 00:40:00,276
I just wanna, like, be independent.
Not need anybody.

694
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,973
Just me and Lily. That's it.

695
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,846
She told me
what happened after the crash.

696
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:12,549
With half of Wall Street unemployed,
the club wasn't far behind.

697
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:18,033
Mercedes got Ramona
a job in fashion.

698
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:20,165
I can't believe
he got arrested.

699
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,298
What am I supposed to do now?
I can't afford no lawyer.

700
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:24,430
I can barely afford
his half of the rent.

701
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:29,087
It's almost enough to make me
just call off the wedding.

702
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,610
Well?

703
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,179
I mean, come on, Sadie.
And you know I love Dragon.

704
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:37,139
But do you really wanna marry someone
who's probably going to prison?

705
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:39,880
I don't know.

706
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,709
Three to five
is a big commitment.

707
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,628
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, what's up?

708
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:51,936
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if I ducked out early on Fridays

709
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,372
to pick up my kid from school.

710
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:55,331
She has half days
for the rest of the year.

711
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:57,507
Rest of the year? No.

712
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,814
No, no. No, the rest
of the school year.

713
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,127
No.

714
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,216
Well, what if I got somebody
to cover my shift?

715
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,479
- Mercedes said that she could probably...
- Oh, my God. Come on.

716
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:15,873
Took me forever to figure out
everyone's stupid schedules.

717
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:17,657
- I know, Mark. But...
- I mean, really?

718
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:20,269
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't for my kid. Okay?

719
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,054
She's going through
this difficult time at school.

720
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:24,403
She's at that difficult age.

721
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:25,622
Am I the father?

722
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,930
- What?
- Am I the father?

723
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:34,021
No.

724
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:36,067
'Kay. Then why
should I give a shit? Right?

725
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,071
Don't she got a babysitter
or a nanny or something?

726
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:43,161
I can't afford that.

727
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,381
Well, you know, if you
were putting in more hours

728
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:47,600
instead of racing outta here
all the time...

729
00:41:47,774 --> 00:41:49,733
Right? More hours, more money.

730
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,388
More money, a babysitter.
Problem solved.

731
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:55,130
Craig's got two kids.

732
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,436
You don't see him rushing home every
time someone's got a nosebleed.

733
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,178
He's here, he's doing his shifts.
I can't do it.

00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:06,793

Yeah.

There you go.

743
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:51,925
Gonna have to dig this thing out
of there later, but...

744
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,275
Where'd you learn that?

745
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:56,234
Just some old...

746
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,194
What? Don't you have sisters?

747
00:43:04,677 --> 00:43:07,289
No, my brothers
don't talk to me anymore.

748
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:13,338
I told my mom and dad that I worked here,
and they kicked me out of the house.

749
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,392
Wanna go fishing?

750
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,525
What's fishing?

751
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,270
Since the crash,
the club needs customers.

752
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,229
All we gotta do
is reel 'em in.

753
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,102
Look,
anyone can own one nice suit.

754
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:43,455
You wanna look at their shoes,
their watches, briefcases...

755
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,110
their wedding rings.

756
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:48,504
Always look for
a wedding ring.

757
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:51,158
Jimmy,
another Glenmorangie.

758
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:54,510
Once you got 'em on the
hook, that's when we get the net.

759
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,425
Bring out the flavor.

760
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,992
Spencer,
these are my co-workers.

761
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:02,387
What are we cheersing today?

762
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:03,997
To life. Cheers. Whoo!

763
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:05,521
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

764
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,963
- Ho-ho. What do we got there?
- You want some of that?

765
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:14,573
A little
Colombian marching powder?

766
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:16,271
Let me show you how it's done.

767
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,751
There you go.

768
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:20,362
You know what we should do?
We should go to a club.

769
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,015
We should go
to the strip club.

770
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:24,017
I don't know.
I don't know.

771
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,976
- Come on.
- It's naughty.

772
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,239
Tomorrow we'll be
at our desks at 9 a.m.,

773
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:30,676
regretting the moment that we could've
gone to a strip club together.

774
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,374
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

775
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:33,462
I'm in.

776
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:37,204
Then we
steer him to the club...

777
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:39,294
- Need a ride, baby?
- Oh, yes, I do.

778
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:42,297
Get in.

779
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:48,128
...where we've negotiated
ourselves a percentage of his spending.

780
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:52,568
And then we run up his credit
card as far as we can push it.

781
00:44:54,396 --> 00:44:55,440
Easy breezy.

782
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,747
Another round.

783
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,583
- Yaas.
- Yaas. Yeah!

784
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,151
No problem.

785
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:12,762
There we go.

786
00:45:12,936 --> 00:45:14,067
- No problem.
- No problem.

787
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:14,938
Okay, you got this.

788
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,070
- Hey!
- Yeah, Spencer.

789
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:18,985
Tell the nice man
where you live.

790
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:20,204
New York!

791
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,380
Little more specific, baby.

792
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,773
Fifth Avenue.

793
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:24,948
Close enough.

794
00:45:26,384 --> 00:45:27,429
Hey.

795
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:28,386
- Bye, Spencer!
- Goodbye!

796
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,866
- Bye!
- Bye!

797
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,740
But like Ramona said,

798
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:36,699
"Going fishing doesn't mean
you catch a marlin."

799
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:43,923
And some of the guys
didn't want to party.

800
00:45:44,097 --> 00:45:45,795
Oh, no. No, thank you.

801
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:47,536
Come on. You don't...

802
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,059
- Are you sure? Come on.
- I'm very sure. Thank you.

803
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,713
You don't wanna see me
after a couple of those.

804
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:52,149
Oh, boy.

805
00:45:52,323 --> 00:45:53,672
And some of them caught on.

806
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,935
- I can't, but this was fun.
- What? Wait.

807
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,419
Fuck.

808
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,508
What do we do now?

809
00:46:03,682 --> 00:46:05,423
I'm supposed to get Dragon
a new lawyer.

810
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,469
But I can't
fucking afford it now.

811
00:46:10,994 --> 00:46:12,212
I can't move back home.

812
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:15,259
I guess it's back to the pole.

813
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:19,742
Sorry, Annabelle.
We'll get through it.

814
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,961
That's when Ramona
came up with her special recipe.

815
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:24,790
Are you serious?

816
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:27,271
It's barely any different
than what we're doing now.

817
00:46:27,445 --> 00:46:29,229
It's just a shortcut.

818
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:30,579
A sure thing.

819
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,408
- What if someone gets hurt?
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

820
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,540
The worst is
they'll have a bad hangover.

821
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:37,673
- What if somebody calls the cops?
- And says what?

822
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:41,241
"I spent $5,000
at a strip club. Send help"?

823
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,897
No. They won't even know what happened
until they check their bank account.

824
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,116
I think I'm gonna throw up.

825
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,510
Look, we're not
the only ones doing this.

826
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,469
How do you think the club
stayed in business post-2008?

827
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:54,037
It's a side hustle.

828
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:56,779
Everybody's had to
get creative, baby.

829
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:01,392
I know a girl in Queens
who did it.

830
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,002
Did she get caught?

831
00:47:03,176 --> 00:47:04,482
No.

832
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,962
She sent her two kids
to college.

833
00:47:06,136 --> 00:47:07,833
And now she lives in Miami.
Opened up a nail salon.

834
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:09,008
Exactly.

835
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:14,579
What do you think?

836
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:18,148
What is it?

837
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:21,151
It's ketamine and MDMA.

838
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:24,415
The ketamine wipes their memory,
the MDMA makes 'em happy.

839
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,286
How many times
have you done it?

840
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,985
Three times.
Including tonight.

841
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,421
Works every time.

842
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,164
We made five grand tonight,
split three ways.

843
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:39,082
Could make it four.

844
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,998
Be like old times.

845
00:47:47,046 --> 00:47:51,007
Look, baby, we gotta start thinking
like these Wall Street guys.

846
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,400
You see what they did
to this country?

847
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:56,099
They stole from everybody.

848
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,144
Hardworking people
lost everything.

849
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,147
And not one of
these douchebags went to jail.

850
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:02,801
Not one.

851
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:04,455
Is that fair?

852
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,458
You ever think about
when they come into the club?

853
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:08,720
That's stolen money.

854
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,506
That's what's paying for
their blow jobs.

855
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,769
The fucking firefighters'
retirement fund.

856
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:15,771
Fuck these guys.

857
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:25,041
Look, we can't dance forever.

858
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,479
What are you gonna do?
Go back to minimum wage?

859
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,744
No, baby, this game is rigged.

860
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,879
And it does not reward people
who play by the rules.

861
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:39,795
You either gotta stand in
the corner or get in the ring.

862
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:44,713
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

863
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:45,888
Me either.

864
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,151
All right?

865
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:50,414
They would do this anyway.

866
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:53,591
We're just helping them do it.

867
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,812
Nobody gets hurt.

868
00:48:58,378 --> 00:48:59,379
Nobody gets hurt.

869
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,121
So...

870
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:04,950
are you in?

871
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,522
Well, it's getting late.

872
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:14,003
Oh, it is? What a shame.

873
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:16,571
So, you gotta get up
early tomorrow, or...

874
00:49:17,397 --> 00:49:19,835
Let's get another drink. Hmm?

875
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:23,447
Hey, these are my sisters.

876
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,800
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi!

877
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,194
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

878
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,499
- Hi.
- Ramona.

879
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:33,805
- I'm Gary.
- Gary, nice to meet you.

880
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,154
- Nice to meet you.
- Annabelle.

881
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:36,852
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Isn't he so cute?

882
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:38,114
Yes.

883
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:39,898
- I'm Destiny.
- Hi, Destiny.

884
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,466
Can I have three shots?

885
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,555
You know who he looks like,
don't you?

886
00:49:44,729 --> 00:49:46,209
He looks like Tom Cruise.
Right?

887
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,167
- No, no. I'm thinking more smooth.
- Tom Cruise.

888
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,734
- It's the hair.
- Tom Cruise? I don't know about that.

889
00:49:49,908 --> 00:49:51,127
I know!

890
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:52,258
- No.
- It's your smile.

891
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:53,956
It is.

892
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,131
- It's really good.
- A mini Bob Saget.

893
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:56,306
- Getting more Sonny.
- Yeah!

894
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,873
Sonny Bono?

895
00:49:58,047 --> 00:49:59,309
He's got
the twinkle in his eye.

896
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:00,223
- I know!
- Here we go, guys.

897
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,877
This wine yours?

898
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:03,487
- Yes, that's it. No, this is mine.
- Okay, cool.

899
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:04,967
- All right, thanks.
- Shots, ladies?

900
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:06,185
- Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

901
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,534
You guys are sisters?

902
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:09,145
Yeah. Same dad,
different moms.

903
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:10,233
To sisters!

904
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,017
To sisters.

905
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:13,453
To sisters.

906
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:31,471
Just put him here right now.

907
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:33,169
He dead?

908
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,737
- Oh, shit. We going to jail.
- Damn. -

909
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,695
- Oh, my God.
- Help her.

910
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,523
- Oh, my God.
- Does this always happen?

911
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:41,394
No.

912
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:42,918
- Did we give him too much?
- I don't know.

913
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:45,572
Gary. Gary. Baby.

914
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:47,487
Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary.

915
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:49,707
- Gary.
- Oh, Gary.

916
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,448
- Open your eyes.
- We love you, Gary.

917
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:53,102
- Gary! Wake up, Gary.
- Fuck.

918
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:54,669
Open your eyes, baby.

919
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,409
- Wake up, Gary! Wake up!
- Open your eyes.

920
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,064
There you go.

921
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:00,500
What was that, Gary?

922
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,851
- Another round, Gary?
- What are we gonna do?

923
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:05,462
What do you want?
Isn't this fun?

924
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:08,465
- Uh.
- That's it, baby.

925
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:09,640
That's it, Gary.

926
00:51:09,814 --> 00:51:10,989
Come on. Yeah, Gary.

927
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:12,861
That's it, baby. Get it.

928
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:14,732
- There you go.
- Come on.

929
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:15,820
This one right here?
There you go.

930
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:18,431
- You can do it.
- Come on. Come on.

931
00:51:18,605 --> 00:51:19,824
What do you want, baby?

932
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,391
Which one is it? That one?

933
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,001
You need help?

934
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,701
This one? That pretty
gold one right here?

935
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,790
That's the one?

936
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,750
Wow. Oh, my...

937
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,545
To Gary!

938
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,721
Yes!

939
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:53,162
The worst are the guys who go to
the bathroom and put on a condom,

940
00:51:53,336 --> 00:51:57,296
and then you know
you got to grind it out.

941
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,689
So disgusting.

942
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:00,647
We don't have to go back.
Do we?

943
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,433
- Do we have to go back?
- No, baby. Your dancing days are over.

944
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,130
- Yeah?
- You guys,

945
00:52:05,304 --> 00:52:07,480
- I can pay off my grandma's house.
- Yeah!

946
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,961
- I'm getting myself a new engagement ring.
- That's so sweet.

947
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:12,703
And Dragon's ass can stay in
jail for a few more weeks.

948
00:52:12,877 --> 00:52:14,705
Or a month. Or a year.

949
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:16,402
- To Gary.
- To Gary!

950
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:17,664
- To Gary.
- I love Gary.

951
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,057
- God bless Gary.
- To Gary.

952
00:52:19,231 --> 00:52:20,189
- I love you, Gary!
- To Gary.

953
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:22,017
- I love you, Gary.
- Mom?

954
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,193
Hi, baby.

955
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:26,543
Hi, what happened?
Who woke you up?

956
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:28,675
Who was it?
Some crazy lady woke you up?

957
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:29,894
What happened?

958
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:33,811
You guys are my real sisters.

959
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,770
- I love you like you're my sisters.
- Yeah. Sisters.

960
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,075
- I love you.
- I love you.

961
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:38,294
Love you.

962
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:40,905
- You know I love you though.
- Yes.

963
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:41,993
We are a family now.

964
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:42,907
Yeah.

965
00:52:43,603 --> 00:52:45,388
A family with money!

966
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,433
Yeah!

967
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,698
What are we gonna do? We're gonna
go shopping tomorrow? Yes, we are!

968
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:59,271
Hit the Electric Slide.

969
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:02,666
Okay. I know it sounds bad
to say that we were drugging people.

970
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,757
But you gotta understand,
in our world, this was normal.

971
00:53:06,931 --> 00:53:10,108
I mean, half these guys are
mainlining coke on their way to work.

972
00:53:10,282 --> 00:53:12,763
But we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible.

973
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:15,287
So, I suggested
that we tweak the recipe.

974
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:18,508
So, what do you think?
Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine?

975
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:23,730
That sounds good.

976
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:27,169
Do we turn the liquid into a powder?
Or do we turn the powder into a liquid?

977
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,138
It's hot.

978
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:47,754
Eh, eh, eh.

979
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,352
Let's try it in the oven.

980
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,748
Mm-hmm.

981
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:27,838
Yes.

982
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,755
How much?

983
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,367
Just a sprinkle.

984
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,156
You know, I'm still not sure
about strangers.

985
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:44,159
Well, that's the beauty of it,
baby, they're strangers.

986
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:48,467
Yeah, but I don't wanna slip it to
anybody who's not already on something.

987
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:51,035
We gotta know that
these guys like to party.

988
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:52,602
And that they've got money.

989
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,213
Enough not to care
if some of it's missing.

990
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,476
With strangers,
it's unpredictable.

991
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,174
No guarantees.

992
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:02,177
So, we called up
some old friends.

993
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,051
Okay.

994
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:09,184
David, is that you?

995
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:11,534
It's Ramona.

996
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,231
Get some.

997
00:55:13,405 --> 00:55:14,580
Well, I can send you
a picture to jog your memory.

998
00:55:14,754 --> 00:55:16,452
Okay, I'll send it right now.

999
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:19,324
Come on.
Come on, give it to me.

1000
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:22,110
No. Turn around.
You know what they want.

1001
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:23,807
- You're into that good time.
- It's a sure thing.

1002
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:25,722
That's good.
That's a good angle.

1003
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:28,551
- My baby.
- Now we wait.

1004
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:30,422
You killed it.

1005
00:55:32,772 --> 00:55:34,426
Uh...

1006
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:37,690
This was too fucking easy.

1007
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,650
Hi, David.

1008
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:42,521
Yeah, I can bring
some of my friends.

1009
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,178
David, these are my sisters.

1010
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:51,878
Hi.

1011
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,532
Annabelle.

1012
00:55:53,706 --> 00:55:55,056
- David. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1013
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,014
- David.
- David. Nice to meet you.

1014
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,711
Mercedes. Like the car.

1015
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,583
Mercedes, how are you?

1016
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,019
- We should get some drinks.
- Ooh, yes.

1017
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,847

1018
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:06,284

Hey!

1027
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:32,267
You okay?

1028

Whoop Whoop! Whoop!

1032
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:57,335
Too much, bitch.

1033
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:05,256
Let me see,
let's do number four.

1034
00:57:06,692 --> 00:57:11,349
It says, "The brain evaluates
data collected from weather..."

1035
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:12,568
Mercedes.

1036
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:13,786
So good to see you.

1037
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,701
Dragon's gonna be okay.

1038
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,543
Maybe one of 'em would call
and complain, but we could handle it.

1039
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:34,459
What are you talking about?
You had an amazing time.

1040
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,895
You were so happy.

1041
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,636
You kept tipping everybody,
remember?

1042
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,377
Ramona could always handle it.

1043
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:42,163
What are you gonna do?
Call the police?

1044
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:44,817
You really gonna tell your wife
and the police what you did?

1045
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:47,298
You think that's worth
whatever amount you're missing?

1046
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,866
No, you went out.
You had an epic night.

1047
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,476
It costs money.

1048
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:53,478
Why should it cost you
any more than that?

1049
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:55,393
Too cute.

1050
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,396
We treated it like a business.

1051
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,312
So, we'll have Annabelle meet J.P.
Morgan and Mercedes meet Wells Fargo.

1052
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,793
Mercedes met Wells Fargo
last time.

1053
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:06,012
How much did we
charge last time?

1054
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:08,885
$5,000 on his American Express
and $2,000 on his corporate card.

1055
00:58:10,147 --> 00:58:11,801
Does he have
any airline miles?

1056
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:13,846
- Let's check.
- Worth a look.

1057
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:15,718
We invested in ourselves.

1058
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,720
- Yes.
- Ooh.

1059
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,287
The dolls are here!

1060
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:20,766
Do I look expensive?

1061
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,725
You look very expensive.
And baby got back.

1062
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,683
That dress is hugging you
in all the right places.

1063
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:26,381
We expanded our clientele.

1064
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:28,165
What did you say
that you did again?

1065
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,471
I am an architect.

1066
00:58:29,645 --> 00:58:31,429
Oh.

1067
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:35,520
- No wonder your hands are so... nice.
- Strong hands.

1068
00:58:35,694 --> 00:58:38,306
But the bigger the bank
account, the greater the expectations.

1069
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,395
Let's go fuck in the bathroom.

1070
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:43,093
Uh, my sisters are gonna
be here in a couple minutes.

1071
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:44,877
Let's just wait
for them, okay?

1072
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:46,792
All right. Tick tock.

1073
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:48,403
The guys were getting
more and more aggressive,

1074
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:50,318
and the four of us
could only take on so much.

1075
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,406
So, that's when I said...

1076
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,972
We need to be outsourcing.

1077
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,411
Let's put an ad in Craigslist.

1078
00:58:57,063 --> 00:58:58,717
So, we put an ad
in Craigslist.

1079
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:05,333
Does anybody have
any allergies?

1080
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,118
And by this, I mean
really serious allergies.

1081
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:10,990
Like, life-threatening
allergies. Yeah?

1082
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:12,601
I have asthma.

1083
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:14,385
- All right.
- I don't like feet.

1084
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,605
You have a foot allergy?

1085
00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:20,217
No. I'm just saying if a foot
goes near my face, I'll shut down.

1086
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,393
- I don't mind feet.
- Okay.

1087
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:26,615
Now, we're gonna work on our fake
sniffing and our fake drinking.

1088
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:29,183
- Where were you?
- They had an Orange Julius.

1089
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,837
All right. That's good.
That's better with the nail.

1090
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:33,143
What's Coco doing here?

1091
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:34,927
We said no junkies
and no criminals.

1092
00:59:35,101 --> 00:59:36,364
So?

1093
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:38,279
So, she's a junkie
and a criminal.

1094
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,498
- People change.
- I'm not entirely convinced.

1095
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,588
Hon, you're not...

1096
00:59:43,893 --> 00:59:46,461
Fine. But I promised
I'd buy her lunch.

1097
00:59:48,114 --> 00:59:49,507
Oh!

1098
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:52,031
Who is this? What are you
doing at the mall?

1099
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:53,424
This is Mr. Bruce.

1100
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,861
Mr. Brucey!

1101
00:59:56,035 --> 00:59:57,907
I take him everywhere with me.
I hope that's not a problem.

1102
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:00,126
Not at all. Not at all.

1103
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,933
Oh, my God! Hi!

1104
01:00:24,107 --> 01:00:26,196
- Look at these fucking bags, bitch.
- Let me see!

1105
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,980
- Take this bag in, bitch.
- Yes!

1106
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:30,113
No drinking, no drugs.

1107
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:32,637

Well, you always said
you wanted real pearls.

1179
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:48,589
Did you go to the bottom
of the ocean for this?

1180
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:49,938
Yeah. Something like that.

No.

1202
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,679

Okay.
I have something for you.

1205
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:43,861
- Do I get the big one?
- Yes, I chose this just for you.

1206
01:05:45,036 --> 01:05:46,429
Okay.

1207
01:05:46,603 --> 01:05:47,909
- Wow, it's heavy.
- Yeah.

1208
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:51,434
Okay. What do we got?

1209
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,088
- Open it up.
- It's a big one.

1210
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:55,786
Oh, my Lord.

1211
01:05:58,702 --> 01:05:59,747
What was it?

1212
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:01,575
- Chinchilla.
- Oh, my God.

1213
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:05,317
Oh, my God!

1214
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:07,276
Yes.

1215
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:09,147
You're the best.

1216
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,412
I'm so proud of you.

1217
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,634
- We don't need anybody else, do we?
- Mm-mm.

1218
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,244
- Nobody.
- No.

1219
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:20,855
We're the untouchables.

1220
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:22,334
Like Kobe and Shaq.

1221
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,815
Who gets to be Kobe?

1222
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:26,425
- I'm Kobe. You're Shaq.
- I'm the Kobe.

1223
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,602
- No. I don't wanna be Shaq.
- No.

1224
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,778
How are you Kobe when there can
only be one Kobe? And I'm the Kobe!

1225
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:32,475
- Double Kobe!
- I'm the Kobe!

1226
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:34,956
Okay, everybody.

1227
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,697
Come on. Get on top of
each other. Get together.

1228
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:38,873
Come on.

1229
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:40,701
Get close. Get cozy.

1230
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,441
- I wanna get in the middle.
- In, in.

1231
01:06:42,616 --> 01:06:45,923
Now say money!

1232
01:06:46,097 --> 01:06:47,142
Money!

1233
01:06:50,058 --> 01:06:53,191
And, God, thank you for
everything that you've given us.

1234
01:06:53,365 --> 01:06:54,889
This delicious food.

1235
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,674
My new Louboutins.

1236
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:59,937
And... for this family.

1237
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,244
My sisters.

1238
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,594
We are so blessed.

1239
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:06,596
Amen.

1240
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:09,904
- Amen.
- Amen.

1241
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:18,695
Try some of this pork, baby.

1242
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:28,574
I don't usually get
nervous around these types.

1243
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:30,315
No, you're good.

1244
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:31,926
No, they come
into the club all the time.

1245
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,667
But I had a crush on this guy
since I was 15.

1246
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,408
So, I was like, "Oh, my God."
And suddenly, he's there.

1247
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:38,280
Nan, do you know who he is?

1248
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,064
You know. You must've
seen him in Us Weekly.

1249
01:07:40,238 --> 01:07:42,023
She knows who he is.
Nan, you know who he is.

1250
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:43,502
The guy from the movies.

1251
01:07:43,677 --> 01:07:44,982
I've seen him.

1252
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:46,767
He's very good-looking.

1253
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:49,117
Yeah!

1254
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,814
Well, let me tell you something: he's
even more good-looking in person.

1255
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:52,424
I am telling you.

1256
01:07:52,598 --> 01:07:55,210
Anyway, so he picks me up
in this white Porsche.

1257
01:07:55,384 --> 01:07:56,777
- No way.
- Yeah.

1258
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:58,604
And all he tells me
is to wear a hat.

1259
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:01,129
- Fucking Kentucky Derby.
- Yes! That's what I thought!

1260
01:08:01,303 --> 01:08:03,131
- That's what it was, right?
- That's what I thought.

1261
01:08:03,305 --> 01:08:04,828
That's what I thought.

1262
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:06,612
But then, all of a sudden,
we're at the airport.

1263
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:08,571
We're boarding
this private jet

1264
01:08:08,745 --> 01:08:10,051
- to Monaco.
- Oh, my God.

1265
01:08:10,225 --> 01:08:12,227
There was champagne,
lobster, a butler.

1266
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:15,926
And I just didn't have the heart
to tell him, like, I hate flying.

1267
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:21,802
So, there I am in this gorgeous marble
bathroom, 10,000 feet in the air,

1268
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,325
vomiting lobster
and champagne.

1269
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,459
Sit here, baby. You know,
Annabelle can vomit on cue.

1270
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:30,027
- It's one of her many gifts.
- It's not intentional.

1271
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,029
- -
You're so good though, baby.

1272
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:35,641
So, thank God,
finally, this plane lands.

1273
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:40,734
And we proceed to have three of the most
amazing hours I have ever had in my life.

1274
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,693
Until the paparazzi shows up,
ruins everything.

1275
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:44,999
And I have to say:

1276
01:08:45,826 --> 01:08:48,219
That's the end of the PG-13
version of this story.

1277
01:08:48,393 --> 01:08:50,700
- Ooh!
- Oh, no. You gotta give us more. Come on.

1278
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,397
Details, please. Tease, baby.

1279
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:55,618
I once danced
with Frankie Valli.

1280
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,794
What? Nana.

1281
01:08:58,186 --> 01:09:01,493
- Did... Did you know this?
- No. What?

1282
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:03,582
It was before he got married.

1283
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:05,323
The second time.

1284
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:07,021
I don't know, Nan.

1285
01:09:07,195 --> 01:09:09,675
I don't know about that.
Are you sure?

1286
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,068
Pretty sure.

1287
01:09:11,242 --> 01:09:12,940
You're not really sure.

1288
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:15,464
My God, this woman
is my spirit animal!

1289
01:09:30,305 --> 01:09:32,437
♪ Rag doll, ooh ♪

1290
01:09:36,528 --> 01:09:37,529
Okay, Nan.

1291
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:40,445
All right. Tell the truth.

1292
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:45,146
Frankie Valli shows up on your
doorstep on your wedding day.

1293
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,366
And he says,
"Me or your husband."

1294
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,151
What do you say?

1295
01:09:51,413 --> 01:09:52,849
"Which car do you drive?"

1296
01:09:54,546 --> 01:09:56,244
How have we not met sooner?

1297
01:09:56,722 --> 01:09:58,202
How have we not met sooner?

1298
01:09:58,376 --> 01:09:59,943
How have we not met sooner?

1299
01:10:00,465 --> 01:10:01,771
Oh, my God.

1300
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,432
So, getting back
to the drugging.

1301
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:14,262
Is that
what you're hung up on?

1302
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,046
It's hard not to be.

1303
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,834
What'd you say
your name was again?

1304
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:22,792
Elizabeth.

1305
01:10:22,966 --> 01:10:24,750
And did you grow up
with money, Elizabeth?

1306
01:10:25,926 --> 01:10:28,232
We were... comfortable.

1307
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:29,799
So, what did your parents do?

1308
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:30,887
My dad was a journalist.

1309
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,671
My mom's a psychiatrist.

1310
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:34,760
And where'd you go to school?

1311
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,676
Brown. For undergrad.

1312
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:39,940
What would you do for $1,000?

1313
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:45,771
Of course, the answer is gonna depend on
what you already have and what you need.

1314
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:48,905
- So, the...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1315
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,428
I don't think I should
even talk to you anymore.

1316
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:54,824
It's just, I don't know you.

1317
01:10:54,998 --> 01:10:58,045
And I'm sorry, these girls are
just like my sisters, so...

1318
01:10:58,697 --> 01:11:00,612
That's okay. I understand.

1319
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:03,702
Ramona said the same thing.

1320
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:06,618
You talked to Ramona?

1321
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:07,837
Yeah.

1322
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:09,970
When?

1323
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:11,232
Yesterday.

1324
01:11:11,406 --> 01:11:12,320
Where?

1325
01:11:12,494 --> 01:11:13,669
I went to her work.

1326
01:11:18,326 --> 01:11:19,327
What?

1327
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:23,026
Oh, nothing. It's just...

1328
01:11:24,245 --> 01:11:26,551
the idea of Ramona Vega
trying to go straight.

1329
01:11:26,725 --> 01:11:27,857
That's like...

1330
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,821
Well, I mean, if you talked to her,
what do you need to talk to me for?

1331
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,565
I was just hoping that you could
fill in some of the blanks.

1332
01:11:41,349 --> 01:11:42,437
"Blanks"?

1333
01:11:45,788 --> 01:11:46,658
Okay.

1334
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:48,356
Where was I?

1335
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:56,364
Fucking copycats.

1336
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,065
Look, I don't think
we need 'em anymore.

1337
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,240
Need who?

1338
01:12:03,806 --> 01:12:04,894
The club.

1339
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:09,159
Why should we split anything
when we can have it all?

1340
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:14,904
After she cut out the club,
we had to meet our clients in hotel rooms.

1341
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:17,167
- Or in their homes upstate.
- Where the fuck are they?

1342
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:18,821
Annabelle's feeling
grossed-out lately.

1343
01:12:18,995 --> 01:12:20,562
A lot of the girls
stopped showing up.

1344
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:22,868
And what about Mercedes?
Is she feeling "grossed-out"?

1345
01:12:23,043 --> 01:12:26,002
We can't keep giving them their cut if
they're not showing up for weeks on end.

1346
01:12:28,396 --> 01:12:30,398
We need a bigger crew.
I'm gonna call Coco.

1347
01:12:30,572 --> 01:12:32,443
No! She's a junkie.

1348
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,750
Fine.
What about Georgia?

1349
01:12:34,924 --> 01:12:36,143
She just got out of jail.

1350
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:37,100
Trixie?

1351
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,493
She's still in jail.

1352
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:41,278
Ramona,
quit bringing home strays.

1353
01:12:41,452 --> 01:12:44,107
We're breaking the law here.
We don't wanna work with criminals.

1354
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,023
I didn't know how much I love
red hair until I saw you standing there.

1355
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:49,721
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- So amazing.

1356
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:51,071
- I wish it was natural.
- I might dye my hair.

1357
01:12:51,245 --> 01:12:53,508
Hey, Dorothy. This is Dawn.

1358
01:12:53,682 --> 01:12:55,075
Hi.

1359
01:12:56,859 --> 01:12:58,600
♪ Pretty as
A midsummer's morn ♪

1360
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:02,647
♪ They call her Dawn ♪

1361
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:04,562
As soon as I saw her, I said,

1362
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:08,392
"Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
You have to join us."

1363
01:13:08,566 --> 01:13:10,481
And she said... Tell 'em what you said.

1364
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:13,354
I said, "What is it?
Like, a cult?"

1365
01:13:17,706 --> 01:13:21,014
It kinda is
a cult. A little bit.

1366
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,407
It's like, if we're a
team, and we're making money,

1367
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:25,670
and we're winning games,

1368
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:28,456
do you suddenly start trading
players and bringing in new people?

1369
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,544
No, right?

1370
01:13:29,718 --> 01:13:31,372
Think I'm gonna buy these.

1371
01:13:31,546 --> 01:13:32,982
Where the fuck is she?

1372
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:34,636
Relax. She's a pro.

1373
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:39,989
Two-four-three-seven.

1374
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:43,297
Two-four-three-seven.

1375
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:45,255
Two-four-three-seven.

1376
01:13:45,908 --> 01:13:47,910
Two-four-three-seven.

1377
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:51,392
Three-seven.

1378
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:56,266
Yeah.
We can meet at five or six.

1379
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,573
No, six is good.
Six is good.

1380
01:13:58,964 --> 01:13:59,965
You want five?

1381
01:14:00,488 --> 01:14:01,663
- Make a decision.
- Two-four...

1382
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,795
You've got three seconds.
One, two...

1383
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,015
Yeah,
I'm gonna fucking get these!

1384
01:14:06,711 --> 01:14:08,626
Size 8, please, ho.

1385
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:11,847
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Six o' clock or seven?

1386
01:14:12,021 --> 01:14:13,762
Two-four-three-seven.

1387
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,592
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Hurry the fuck up.

1388
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:19,942
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Jesus fucking Christ. Come on!

1389
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:22,727
Um, two-four-three-seven.

1390
01:14:23,467 --> 01:14:24,468
Good girl.

1391
01:14:25,078 --> 01:14:26,470
I got you.

1392
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:29,647
Told you she was a pro.

1393
01:14:29,821 --> 01:14:31,345
Dawn was no pro.

1394
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:33,956
She was a cokehead. A felon.

1395
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:37,612
- She was reckless and sloppy. And stupid.
- With the blue tie?

1396
01:14:37,786 --> 01:14:40,180
- She was out of control.
- I don't know. I've never seen him.

1397
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:43,444
Ramona didn't care, as long as
she was making money.

1398
01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:44,880
What's my credit limit, again?

1399
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,925
$50,000?

1400
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,060
Let's do it for the full 50.

1401
01:14:51,713 --> 01:14:53,323
We're never gonna
see him again.

1402
01:14:53,715 --> 01:14:54,672
Who cares?

1403
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:57,240
Yes. Thank you.

1404
01:14:57,414 --> 01:15:00,025
It wasn't long before
she burned through our regulars,

1405
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,506
which left us with
unpredictable strangers.

1406
01:15:03,594 --> 01:15:05,292
- Where is he?
- Out back.

1407
01:15:08,947 --> 01:15:10,427
What the fuck happened?

1408
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:11,733
He said
he could dive off the roof.

1409
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,430
And I said he couldn't.

1410
01:15:13,604 --> 01:15:15,302
Well, you were right.
Where's Georgia?

1411
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:17,086
She took off.

1412
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,132
Where the fuck is Ramona?
This is her client!

1413
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,611
I couldn't get in contact
with her.

1414
01:15:22,178 --> 01:15:23,614
My God.

1415
01:15:23,788 --> 01:15:24,876
All right. Come on.
Help me get his legs.

1416
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,269
I... Is he dead?

1417
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:27,575
Not yet.

1418
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:29,403
We're not gonna kill him,
are we?

1419
01:15:29,577 --> 01:15:30,969
No, we're gonna take him to the hospital.
Come on. Help me.

1420
01:15:31,144 --> 01:15:33,929
- Okay.
- Help me get him. Lift.

1421
01:15:34,103 --> 01:15:35,365
What the fuck?

1422
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:38,542
- You can do it. Come on.
- No, no, no.

1423
01:15:40,109 --> 01:15:41,110
Get the door!

1424
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:47,116
I got him.
I got him.

1425
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:50,293
Okay. You gotta help me with his torso.
Come on. Careful. Careful.

1426
01:15:50,685 --> 01:15:52,295
- Ready? -
Don't scratch his booty.

1427
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:54,036
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

1428
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:55,516
Fuck!

1429
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:01,261
God, I'm sorry.

1430
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:03,828
Okay. Call Ramona and don't
stop calling till you get her.

1431
01:16:04,002 --> 01:16:06,440
- Okay.
- I'm gonna fucking kill her.

1432
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:10,618
Has she texted back yet?

1433
01:16:11,053 --> 01:16:12,185
No.

1434
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,708
Can't believe her.

1435
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:16,580
Hey, slow down. Five-O.

1436
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:23,761
Oh, shit!

1437
01:16:25,937 --> 01:16:27,461
Guys. You guys!

1438
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:29,680
- I'm sorry.
- Just chill.

1439
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:32,161
- Stay cool.
- I am.

1440
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:35,991
Oh, my God.

1441
01:16:55,663 --> 01:16:57,360
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- No, that's fine.

1442
01:16:58,448 --> 01:16:59,928
I don't know
why that happens.

1443
01:17:10,504 --> 01:17:11,896
Mercedes, come on. Help me.

1444
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:14,247
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1445
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,031
Jesus Christ.

1446
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:17,685
- Help me get him out.
- Where are you taking him?

1447
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:19,164
We're gonna take him inside.

1448
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:20,209
I thought we was
just gonna leave him here.

1449
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:21,558
We can't just leave him.

1450
01:17:21,732 --> 01:17:22,690
I'm not going inside.

1451
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:23,865
Mercedes, this is a business.

1452
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,083
No!

1453
01:17:26,694 --> 01:17:27,869
Mercedes!

1454
01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:32,177
Oh, fuck!

1455
01:17:32,352 --> 01:17:33,396
Help, please!

1456
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,659
Help! Help!

1457
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:36,921
- Help!
- Here they are.

1458
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:38,706
Please, help my husband.

1459
01:17:40,185 --> 01:17:41,796
Help my husband!

1460
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,928
- All right...
- I'm gonna flip on three.

1461
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:45,626
Please hurry!

1462
01:17:49,978 --> 01:17:51,501
I'll be right back. Come on.

1463
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,517
Lily!

1464
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:10,477
Lily!

1465
01:18:11,782 --> 01:18:14,089
- Monica!
- Are you still here?

1466
01:18:15,308 --> 01:18:16,221
Lily!

1467
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:17,440
Fuck.

1468
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:48,253
Come on.

1469
01:18:51,474 --> 01:18:52,910
Oh, my God.

1470
01:18:53,215 --> 01:18:54,695
- There's Mommy.
- I'm so sorry.

1471
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:56,305
- Hi, baby.
- Hi!

1472
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:57,872
you were stealing money.

1473
01:18:58,046 --> 01:18:59,656
That's funny.

1474
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:01,310
- Hey. The babysitter had to go home.
- Funny.

1475
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:03,094
But we had ourselves
a fun sleepover, didn't we?

1476
01:19:03,268 --> 01:19:04,705
- Oh, yeah? I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1477
01:19:04,879 --> 01:19:06,271
Come on, Lily. Here we go.

1478
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:10,319
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, I got her, Amy. Thanks.

1479
01:19:12,277 --> 01:19:13,670
Sweetie, we're almost there.

1480
01:19:35,126 --> 01:19:37,651
Why are we walking
so fast, Mommy?

1481
01:19:52,274 --> 01:19:53,841
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye. Be good.

1482
01:20:03,938 --> 01:20:06,549
So where was Ramona
when I needed her?

1483
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:09,770
Bailing out Dawn again.

1484
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:12,250
Are you kidding me?
Let me buy you lunch, baby.

1485
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:14,252
- Yeah? You're so good to me.
- Yes, of course.

1486
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:25,394
- Don't ever fucking call me again.
- Baby.

1487
01:20:41,497 --> 01:20:45,153
Come Friday, we're looking at sunny
skies with a high of 78 degrees.

1488
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:48,286
On the weekend,
we got scattered showers...

1489
01:21:05,347 --> 01:21:07,218
I'm sorry
I wasn't there, baby.

1490
01:21:17,446 --> 01:21:18,491
I know.

1491
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:30,720
I don't wanna go home.

1492
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,116
Do you and Lily
wanna stay with us?

1493
01:21:36,944 --> 01:21:37,945
Yeah.

1494
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:39,468
Okay.

1495
01:21:43,994 --> 01:21:48,172
You know, I'm supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me.

1496
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:50,610
I mean,
take your mind off things.

1497
01:21:53,003 --> 01:21:54,788
Ain't no pressure,
just, you know...

1498
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,487
If you need the money.

1499
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:03,013
Could be a big one.

1500
01:22:05,363 --> 01:22:07,061
I knew it had to stop.

1501
01:22:08,453 --> 01:22:11,500
I kept thinking that there
was, like, this magic number.

1502
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:15,156
You know,
if I could save enough money,

1503
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,114
I could start clean.

1504
01:22:18,246 --> 01:22:19,247
Just me and Lily.

1505
01:22:21,162 --> 01:22:24,469
Maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody.

1506
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:26,994
Is that what happened
with Doug ♪♪♪♪?

1507
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:30,954
Uh...

1508
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:32,565
I don't really remember
a Doug ♪♪♪♪.

1509
01:22:33,435 --> 01:22:35,524
- Ramona said...
- Well, Ramona's a liar.

1510
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,876
She'll say anything
to make herself look better.

1511
01:22:40,442 --> 01:22:42,226
I mean,
what did she say about me?

1512
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,924
I'm sure she had a lot to say.

1513
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:45,882
What'd she say?

1514
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,624
She said you had
a tough time growing up

1515
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,757
and that you spent
a lot of time alone.

1516
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,195
You got into fights and...

1517
01:22:55,936 --> 01:22:58,155
had some bad boyfriends.

1518
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:00,767
Okay. What else?

1519
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:07,600
That your parents were immigrants,
and that when your father left,

1520
01:23:08,252 --> 01:23:10,820
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents' house.

1521
01:23:12,735 --> 01:23:13,736
And never came back.

1522
01:23:15,912 --> 01:23:16,913
Is that true?

1523
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:25,835
I mean, I thought that she was
just taking a break, you know?

1524
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:32,276
I thought that, you know,
sometimes moms need a break.

1525
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:36,498
Why would she tell you all that?

1526
01:23:37,673 --> 01:23:40,981
I think she just wanted me
to understand that, for you,

1527
01:23:41,155 --> 01:23:43,200
this wasn't about revenge.

1528
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:47,335
You were just trying
to make friends.

1529
01:23:53,036 --> 01:23:54,168
Destiny.

1530
01:23:56,649 --> 01:23:59,260
I know I'm supposed to think
that what you did was terrible

1531
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,001
and that these guys
didn't deserve it.

1532
01:24:02,089 --> 01:24:05,266
But to tell you the truth,
I don't feel sorry for them.

1533
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:08,182
Well, I feel sorry for them.

1534
01:24:13,187 --> 01:24:15,145
You know,
I keep having this nightmare.

1535
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:19,106
Right? Where, like, I'm in
the back seat of this car.

1536
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,324
This moving car.

1537
01:24:21,282 --> 01:24:25,460
And I realize that nobody
is driving the car.

1538
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:30,595
And I have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it, and I go there,

1539
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:34,251
and no matter what I do,
I can't get a grip on it.

1540
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:36,297
And I can't, like, stop it.

1541
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:39,648
And then I wake up.

1542
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,088
What happened
between you and Ramona?

1543
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:48,396
Why aren't you
talking anymore?

1544
01:25:38,011 --> 01:25:39,273
Hello?

1545
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:41,666
So Ramona met Doug years ago.

1546
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,061
Doug's friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam

1547
01:25:45,235 --> 01:25:46,933
after a few
devastating events.

1548
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:48,499
I don't know
that it is gonna be okay.

1549
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:51,764
How could it get worse?

1550
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,723
Which included his
house being destroyed by a fire.

1551
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:00,033
And separating from
the mother of his young son.

1552
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:04,994
She never really wanted
to have kids, you know?

1553
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:09,172
So, I think when we found out
he was autistic,

1554
01:26:09,346 --> 01:26:12,175
I think she just
couldn't handle it, you know?

1555
01:26:12,654 --> 01:26:13,698
He was nice.

1556
01:26:14,264 --> 01:26:17,050
We talked about our kids.
We talked about our exes.

1557
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,356
- We had a heart-to-heart.
- Drinks!

1558
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,925
Here we go.
That one's for you.

1559
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:24,361
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1560
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:26,015
So, what happened to Doug?

1561
01:26:27,756 --> 01:26:30,498
So, what I miss?
What are we doing tonight?

1562
01:26:31,499 --> 01:26:32,848
Um...

1563
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,110
Uh...

1564
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:37,200
The room was round.

1565
01:26:40,247 --> 01:26:42,640
There was a table.

1566
01:26:45,252 --> 01:26:47,254
They maxed out
my corporate card...

1567
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:51,954
so my company launched
an internal investigation,

1568
01:26:52,563 --> 01:26:54,130
and I was fired.

1569
01:26:54,522 --> 01:26:56,829
Can you please just
credit back my debit card?

1570
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,874
My mortgage payment's
on there.

1571
01:26:59,527 --> 01:27:01,877
What are you talking about?
You were having a great time.

1572
01:27:03,444 --> 01:27:05,098
Why are you doing this to me?

1573
01:27:05,576 --> 01:27:10,277
Please, I have nothing.
I can't...

1574
01:27:10,451 --> 01:27:13,019
I can't afford to not pay
my mortgage.

1575
01:27:15,325 --> 01:27:16,326
My s...

1576
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:18,067
My son...

1577
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:21,157
I'm really sorry.

1578
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:23,507
Put the phone down, Destiny.

1579
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:28,991
- Put it away.
- Just give me a second.

1580
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:30,645
Don't. What the...

1581
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:32,995
- Gimme the phone.
- Get off of me!

1582
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:34,997
- Hey!
- Stop!

1583
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:38,609
- If we don't do it, someone else will.
- Get off of me.

1584
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:40,742
Gimme that fucking phone.

1585
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:45,616
Ungrateful little bitch.

1586
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,564
Precinct.

1587
01:28:20,738 --> 01:28:22,088
Yes, hello. I...

1588
01:28:22,262 --> 01:28:24,394
I went to a strip club
and I was drugged.

1589
01:28:33,055 --> 01:28:34,448
Precinct.

1590
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:35,666
I was drugged,
and I have proof.

1591
01:28:37,538 --> 01:28:38,539
It was weird.

1592
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:39,932
It was real weird.

1593
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,846
If it hadn't been
for the tape,

1594
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:43,848
I would've been like, "Dude,
you're fucking full of shit."

1595
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:46,634
Please.
I just wanna know what happened to me.

1596
01:28:46,808 --> 01:28:49,028
Um...

1597
01:28:49,202 --> 01:28:51,247
You were fleeced, that's all.

1598
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:53,249
By who?

1599
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:56,905
Um... Well,
we're, like, a little gang.

1600
01:28:57,775 --> 01:28:59,212
You were just a target.

1601
01:28:59,386 --> 01:29:01,214
We just gave you
a little sprinkle.

1602
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,042
I'll tell you everything.

1603
01:29:03,216 --> 01:29:05,261
I'll tell you everything
I know, I promise.

1604
01:29:05,435 --> 01:29:07,002
I know a lot. I really...

1605
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:09,309
I'll tell you everything.
I just don't wanna go back.

1606
01:29:09,483 --> 01:29:10,919
So, was there a sting?

1607
01:29:11,093 --> 01:29:12,138
One, two. One, two.

1608
01:29:12,312 --> 01:29:14,009
Hello, police.
Can you hear me?

1609
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:15,750
I'm about to open the door.

1610
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,448
- Hey, did you bring the drugs?
- Shh.

1611
01:29:18,622 --> 01:29:20,320
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

1612
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,108
Look, like,
I don't think that he likes me.

1613
01:29:26,282 --> 01:29:28,806
So, I don't know,
I think one of you is gonna have to do it.

1614
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:30,156
Are you high?

1615
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,070
- What?
- Give her a break.

1616
01:29:31,244 --> 01:29:33,333
No. Me?

1617
01:29:33,507 --> 01:29:35,988
No, no. No. No. I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

1618
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,728
That's just... it's not me.

1619
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:40,731
- Hey, hey, ladies.
- Hey.

1620
01:29:40,905 --> 01:29:42,690
Christmas come early.

1621
01:29:42,864 --> 01:29:44,735
Hey, these are my friends
that I told you about.

1622
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:46,694
- Hi, friends.
- This is Ramona.

1623
01:29:46,868 --> 01:29:48,565
- Ramona. Hi.
- Ramona. Hi.

1624
01:29:48,739 --> 01:29:50,437
- This is...
- And I'm Rhonda.

1625
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:52,395
- Rhonda. You are both very attractive.
- Rhonda. Yeah.

1626
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:54,006
Thank you.

1627
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,444
Okay. Why don't you
take a seat right here.

1628
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,142
We're gonna fix you a drink.

1629
01:30:00,316 --> 01:30:02,710
- So, you stay there, okay?
- You get one too. Shots? I don't know.

1630
01:30:02,884 --> 01:30:03,885
We'll see about that.

1631
01:30:13,329 --> 01:30:16,245
Just a second. Hmm.

1632
01:30:16,419 --> 01:30:18,117
Hope you're thirsty.

1633
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:25,689
- Do it.
- No, just go ahead.

1634
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:27,778
Go on.

1635
01:30:28,779 --> 01:30:30,520
You found him. Go ahead.

1636
01:30:36,526 --> 01:30:37,875
Hi.

1637
01:30:38,746 --> 01:30:39,747
Here you go.

1638
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:42,228
Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte.

1639
01:30:44,186 --> 01:30:45,231
So, who's excited?

1640
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,972
I'm telling you,
it's the same fucking car.

1641
01:30:48,147 --> 01:30:50,062
You're being paranoid.

1642
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:52,368
No, I saw the same fucking Buick
parked outside the Gansevoort.

1643
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:54,675
It's not a Buick.

1644
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:57,417
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's been following us for 20 minutes.

1645
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:00,246
- Dawn was setting us up back there.
- Dawn?

1646
01:31:01,377 --> 01:31:03,292
Now I know you're paranoid.

1647
01:31:03,466 --> 01:31:05,860
You really think that she wouldn't
sell you out to save herself?

1648
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:08,732
So, there was a sting?

1649
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:13,563
We cannot comment on that
at this time.

1650
01:31:13,737 --> 01:31:16,175
But what we can tell you

1651
01:31:16,349 --> 01:31:18,916
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd.

1652
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:21,528
Why?

1653
01:31:21,702 --> 01:31:24,226
I guess men don't wanna admit
what happened to them, you know?

1654
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,272
Being victimized by a woman.

1655
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,057
So, we did some investigating,

1656
01:31:29,231 --> 01:31:30,450
and we found
the Connecticut architect

1657
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:33,670
who Moves said
failed to pay a $135,000 bill

1658
01:31:33,844 --> 01:31:36,195
he racked up during
four visits to the club.

1659
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:38,980
"For a night of pleasure
he can't even remember."

1660
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,069
What a boob.

1661
01:31:41,243 --> 01:31:42,984
"And went back
three more times"?

1662
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:46,248
I guess he must've liked it.

1663
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:49,643
You know,
when you look at it out of context,

1664
01:31:49,817 --> 01:31:50,905
it seems like
he's making it up.

1665
01:31:51,079 --> 01:31:52,733
You're a family girl?

1666
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,604
You look like my brother.

1667
01:31:54,778 --> 01:31:55,692
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1668
01:31:55,866 --> 01:31:57,303
- You like that?
- No.

1669
01:31:57,477 --> 01:31:59,479
Why I'm here. I mean,
it's not about the money.

1670
01:31:59,653 --> 01:32:02,221
It's about the next guy
this happens to,

1671
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:04,614
and, like, I gotta
do something to stop that.

1672
01:32:04,788 --> 01:32:08,052
But when you put it
together with Doug, it all added up.

1673
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:10,403
Peter.
Peter, these are my sisters.

1674
01:32:12,144 --> 01:32:14,146
Oh, yes!

1675
01:32:15,538 --> 01:32:16,626
Scary, isn't it?

1676
01:32:18,454 --> 01:32:20,891
I mean, we got so spooked,
none of us went back to the club anymore.

- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

1733
01:35:09,277 --> 01:35:11,279
Which one
of you is the ringleader?

1734
01:35:15,457 --> 01:35:16,893
This is unbelievable.

1735
01:35:17,067 --> 01:35:18,199
You guys are really something,
you know that?

1736
01:35:18,373 --> 01:35:19,461
Does Tony know about this?

1737
01:35:19,635 --> 01:35:20,984
Take a seat, Miss Vega.

1738
01:35:21,811 --> 01:35:22,856
This is crazy.

1739
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:24,597
We didn't do anything wrong.

1740
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:27,600
You know, Tony wouldn't let this happen.
I'm gonna text him.

1741
01:35:27,774 --> 01:35:29,166
Who gave her her phone back?

1742
01:35:29,341 --> 01:35:31,517
Think about your daughter.

1743
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:35,085
You're facing
felony charges here.

1744
01:35:36,086 --> 01:35:38,175
You really wanna go down
for someone else?

1745
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:42,571
Come on. You want Lily
to grow up without her mother?

1746
01:35:43,659 --> 01:35:45,574
You think
these girls are your friends?

1747
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:48,185
You don't think
they're gonna rat you out?

1748
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:50,797
Think about your daughter.

1749
01:35:51,972 --> 01:35:53,713
Mercedes is probably gonna use
Dragon's lawyer.

1750
01:35:53,887 --> 01:35:55,976
So, you, me and Annabelle
should probably lawyer up.

1751
01:35:57,064 --> 01:35:59,675
Do we know any lawyers from the club?
That guy, Jeremy? Or maybe Anton?

1752
01:35:59,849 --> 01:36:00,937
I took the deal.

1753
01:36:06,813 --> 01:36:07,944
You did?

1754
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:17,345
Have I taught you
fucking nothing?

1755
01:36:22,437 --> 01:36:25,048
You fucking idiot!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1756
01:36:26,136 --> 01:36:27,224
Why would you do that?

1757
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:28,661
For Lily.

1758
01:36:40,455 --> 01:36:44,372
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1759
01:36:51,858 --> 01:36:53,425
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

1760
01:37:06,829 --> 01:37:08,091
I'm sorry.

1761
01:37:12,574 --> 01:37:14,446
We were fucking hurricanes,
weren't we?

1762
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:15,708
Yeah.

1763
01:37:34,944 --> 01:37:36,772
- Hello?
- Hi. Um...

1764
01:37:36,946 --> 01:37:38,644
Hi, Elizabeth. It's Destiny.

1765
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:41,124
Hey, Destiny. How are you?

1766
01:37:41,298 --> 01:37:42,735
I'm good. I'm really good.

1767
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:44,867
Lily's great. Um...

1768
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:48,175
Oh, I put the house up for sale.
We're moving back to Queens.

1769
01:37:48,349 --> 01:37:50,438
You know, I've been making
a ton of new friends.

1770
01:37:50,612 --> 01:37:52,919
And, oh, I met this guy who...

1771
01:37:53,093 --> 01:37:55,922
He's gonna help me get
a job in pharmaceuticals.

1772
01:37:56,096 --> 01:37:57,750
So I'm really excited
about that.

1773
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:02,929
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

1774
01:38:03,582 --> 01:38:05,497
So, I was just reading
the article again,

1775
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:10,197
and maybe the reason
why we did what we did

1776
01:38:10,371 --> 01:38:13,592
is because hurt people
hurt people, you know?

1777
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:16,682
Yeah. No, I understand.

1778
01:38:20,947 --> 01:38:22,818
So, have you talked
to Ramona lately?

1779
01:38:23,906 --> 01:38:25,865
No, just that one time.

1780
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:28,998
- Have you?
- No.

1781
01:38:30,086 --> 01:38:31,435
Um...

1782
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,135
Can I just ask you...

1783
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,183
Like, what else
did she say about me?

1784
01:38:40,793 --> 01:38:42,925
So, I used to live
in the Bronx back then.

1785
01:38:43,099 --> 01:38:46,755
But I was seeing this guy who had a
walk-up right next to where I stripped.

1786
01:38:46,929 --> 01:38:49,453
So, I was staying at his
place, like, every night.

1787
01:38:49,628 --> 01:38:52,892
But one morning, I go back to my
place, and the door's wide open.

1788
01:38:53,066 --> 01:38:55,590
And I was freaked out, you know?
I was like, "Oh, my God. All my stuff."

1789
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:59,463
All my valuable stuff is in this
place that I'm not even sleeping in."

1790
01:38:59,638 --> 01:39:01,944
So, now I just carry everything
with me everywhere I go.

1791
01:39:02,423 --> 01:39:03,424
Let me show you.

1792
01:39:04,947 --> 01:39:05,948
Let's see.

1793
01:39:06,819 --> 01:39:07,863
This.

1794
01:39:09,648 --> 01:39:11,998
This is a patch from my grandpa's uniform.
He was in the navy.

1795
01:39:13,173 --> 01:39:14,478
Oh!

1796
01:39:14,653 --> 01:39:17,786
This is my...
my grandma's wedding ring.

1797
01:39:18,265 --> 01:39:20,572
Isn't that pretty?
And this one was my mother's.

1798
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:23,270
It's the three birthstones
of me and my sisters.

1799
01:39:23,444 --> 01:39:26,055
The ruby's me.
I was a July baby.

1800
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,929
I have two sisters. One lives in
Arizona, the other one lives in Texas.

1801
01:39:30,103 --> 01:39:34,020
We try to get together once a year,
but with the kids, it's impossible.

1802
01:39:34,194 --> 01:39:35,282
Do you have kids?

1803
01:39:35,587 --> 01:39:36,805
Not yet.

1804
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:37,980
Well, don't worry.
You're young.

1805
01:39:38,154 --> 01:39:39,939
And you have amazing skin.

1806
01:39:42,506 --> 01:39:43,638
Is that you?

1807
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:47,555
That's me.
I was 15.

1808
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:51,603
A senior
had asked me to the prom.

1809
01:39:52,255 --> 01:39:53,605
I look terrified.

1810
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:54,954
I like the dress, though.

1811
01:39:56,346 --> 01:39:59,001
And this here,
this is Dorothy.

1812
01:39:59,523 --> 01:40:01,177
Wasn't she the cutest?

1813
01:40:03,049 --> 01:40:04,354
Who could leave that baby?

1814
01:40:07,183 --> 01:40:08,750
You know, we used to say,

1815
01:40:09,055 --> 01:40:12,014
"If only we had known
each other back then."

1816
01:40:12,188 --> 01:40:13,189
You know?

1817
01:40:15,844 --> 01:40:19,674
Maybe we could've...
looked out for one another.

1818
01:40:21,197 --> 01:40:23,330
Maybe our lives
would've been different.

1819
01:40:24,723 --> 01:40:25,767
You know?

1820
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:29,771
Or maybe it would've
just been the same.

1821
01:40:30,729 --> 01:40:31,773
Who knows?

1822
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:35,124
But I like to keep her
with me.

1823
01:40:51,401 --> 01:40:52,968
What else you wanna know?

1824
01:41:22,781 --> 01:41:24,696
You should
give her a call, Destiny.

1825
01:41:27,002 --> 01:41:28,830
Yeah.

1826
01:42:07,086 --> 01:42:08,565
Look, there's nothing
I can really say

1827
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:11,046
to make sense
of what went down.

1828
01:42:12,047 --> 01:42:13,353
But everybody's hustling.

1829
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:16,051
This city...

1830
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:19,620
Fuck, this whole country
is a strip club.

1831
01:42:22,057 --> 01:42:26,061
You got people tossing the money...
and people doing the dance.

1832
01:42:32,415 --> 01:42:34,940
One last time, everybody,
let's hear it for our girls!

1833
01:42:35,114 --> 01:42:36,506
- Hit it!
- Okay?

1834
01:42:39,509 --> 01:42:40,989
Whoo!

1835
01:42:46,429 --> 01:42:47,517
Oh!

1836
01:42:48,605 --> 01:42:50,172
Whoo!

1837
01:42:55,482 --> 01:42:58,790
One, two, three, four!
Go. Go. Go.

1838
01:43:11,803 --> 01:43:12,978
That's it, folks.

1839
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:15,981
It was fun while it lasted.

1840
01:43:21,116 --> 01:43:23,118
See me on your way out,

1841
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:25,991
I'll be selling excuses for why
there's glitter on your pants.

1842
01:43:34,477 --> 01:43:36,871
We got a lot of ladies
in the house tonight.

1843
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,918
Must be a bachelorette party
going on.

1844
01:43:44,748 --> 01:43:46,838
There is no flash photography
here at Moves.

1845
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,710
In fact
no flashing of any kind.

1846
01:43:57,892 --> 01:43:59,328
It's time to go home
gentleman.

1847
01:43:59,502 --> 01:44:01,853
The girls are not coming
back out.

1848
01:44:08,729 --> 01:44:12,080
On behalf of Moves, make sure
you tip your waitresses,

1849
01:44:12,254 --> 01:44:13,995
and get home safe.

1850
01:44:17,694 --> 01:44:19,435
Good night everybody.

1851
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:21,524
I'm sure I will see you again.

1852
01:44:21,785 --> 01:44:23,004
Real soon.

1853
01:44:23,028 --> 01:44:28,028
