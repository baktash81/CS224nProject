1
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,513
Didn't you got the clothes
I've sent you?

2
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,273
Were they too big?

3
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,473
I'm okay like this.

4
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,715
If you want to we can go shopping.
Buy something else

5
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,989
If you want to.

6
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,432
Had a good trip?
- I do not like flying.

7
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,916
-Have you been living here long?
- Ten years.

8
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,039
I came here for my masters.
I met Luc and got married ...

9
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,271
... and I got a job here.

10
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,188
That's how life is.

11
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,711
And this is my palace.

12
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,150
There's the kitchen
in front, the living room.

13
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,151
There in the corner is Luc's desk.

14
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,596
It's a bit messy.
That's how he is.

15
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,671
You'll learn his ways.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,835
I work in the living room
The bedrooms are upstairs.

17
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,832
Want to see your room?

18
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,316
Ok?
It has its own bathroom.

19
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,235
I have to go get the kids
I'll be away for half an hour.

20
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,597
Can I leave you alone?
See you soon.

21
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm glad you're here.

22
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,956
You can take a look around the house
if you want.

23
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,349
Excuse me.

24
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,998
I didn't know that ...

25
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,751
I'm Juliette.

26
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,957
Excuse me.

27
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,912
Come on darling open the door.
Can you see I'm holding Lia ?

28
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,233
Aunt Juliette will stay with us for ever?
- Not for ever. Just for a while.

29
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,591
Be nice to her, OK?
She is tired. Leave her alone.

30
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,557
Hi, auntie.

31
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,951
Here are my Princesses. This is Cli lis,
but everyone calls her Little Lili.

32
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,918
And  this is miss Emilia.
Will you smile for Juliette honey?

33
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,310
Want to see my room?
- Oh no don't start!

34
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,438
Quick to the kitchen. It is tea time.
Take your sister too.

35
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,519
Have you looked around?
- Yes.

36
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,319
In the library
there was an old man.

37
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,233
Oh, don't worry.
That's Lucs father.

38
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,029
Grandpa Paul has lost his tongue.
- Little Lili!

39
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,793
He has brain damage
and can't talk.

40
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,077
He reads the entire day.
He is adorable.

41
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,154
Have you ever been in Lorraine?
- No. Never.

42
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,671
Everybody thinks it's Germany. It's freezing.
- Yes it's always freezing.

43
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,037
Not always.
- Eat your food, ok?

44
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,599
were you born here?

45
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,829
Yeah, but  my Dad is from Poland
he came here after the war.

46
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,917
Luc's mother is Russian, his wife
English and his children French-Asian.

47
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,395
A real-Benetton family.

48
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,758
Mama, you have no accent,
but auntie has a bit.

49
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,118
She has lived in England longer.
- Where is the pitcher?

50
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,831
Katrina dropped it. I didn't buy
a new one. She's the charwoman.

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,231
She comes on Thursdays.
Watch out, she destroys everything.

52
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,190
That is why we call her Katrina.
Actually she is called Marie-Paule.

53
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,471
Lea said you did research at the CNRS.
- You don't have to be so formal you too.

54
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,519
-Papa is a lexicographer.
- Lexicographer, darling.

55
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,911
We create an interactive dictionary
that can be reactivated.

56
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,312
You must be activated. Three
letters in 7 years. The Academy is faster.

57
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,473
Do not. Otherwise you go to bed.
- Compare what is comparable please.

58
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,310
Why didn't I meet you earlier auntie?

59
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,231
Because I was travelling.

60
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,789
A very long journey.

61
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,310
Want some more?
- No, thank you.

62
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,471
You don't like it?
- Yes. But ...

63
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,835
Where were you travelling exactly?
- Enough questions already.

64
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,271
You leave your aunt alone
and you finish your meal.

65
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,195
How long do you think she'll stay?
- No idea. As long as necessary.

66
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,909
A couple of weeks, or months.
You have any objections?

67
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,996
Frankly, yes.

68
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,799
She may be your sister, but ...
- But what?

69
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,677
You heard Little Lili' questions .
- So what?

70
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,110
The travelling excuse will not last long.
- As long as it lasts. We'll see.

71
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,714
We'll see. We'll see.
What will we do?

72
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,838
What will you say?
The truth?

73
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,993
I don 't know.
Leave me alone.

74
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,631
It's our first night.
I just found my sister again.

75
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,993
You don't know what that
means to me.

76
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,958
I just got her back.
- But you barely know her.

77
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,317
You're the last time but
a few hours visited.

78
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,036
You were just a teenager when she ...
- Shut your mouth.

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,638
I shut up.

80
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,391
I shut up.

81
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,475
But think about us a bit as well.

82
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,631
Look there are petals.

83
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,355
Hurry up, we're  late.
- As always.

84
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,277
What have you done? What now?
Emilia, you have to change clothes.

85
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,678
Eat quickly, Little Lili,
we are too late.

86
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,356
Even more yoghurt.
- Bye, Grandpa.

87
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,758
You never eat breakfast?

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,230
It depends.
- Me, I'm never hungry.

89
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,996
Ever since I was very little.
Mama always nags about it .

90
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,792
Did you know me
when I was little?

91
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,759
Yes, of course.
- When I just came from Vietnam?

92
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,997
I do not believe you.
Your nose is longer.

93
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,389
Daddy.

94
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,632
Did you have a good sleep?
- Very good, thanks.

95
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,990
You're not coming?
- Bye, auntie.

96
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,749
You have new lunch coupons.
- I know.

97
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,713
Your gym clothes are in your bag.
Ok?

98
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,632
And make sure you don't lose them today.

99
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,677
Mama?
- What is it?

100
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,991
Aunt is a bit strange, no?
- Why do you say that?

101
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
I do not know. She says almost nothing.

102
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,269
You should give her time to get used to us.

103
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,954
have a nice day. Go ahead.

104
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,830
And look if you can find your pink beret.
- I will. Bye mom.

105
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,713
You okay?

106
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,630
Really?
- Yes.

107
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,796
The police station
is close to the university.

108
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,272
We can meet after my lesson.
There is a pub across the street.

109
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,193
Ok.

110
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,878
You know what they want from you?

111
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,432
I need to present myself there
once a week.

112
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,508
And nobody came to visit you there?

113
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,472
I mean ...
There were people visiting?

114
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,115
Volunteers. At the beginning.

115
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,031
Do you blame me?
- For what?

116
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,316
For not coming.

117
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,268
But at first, I wrote to you.
- Oh, yeah? I received nothing.

118
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,828
One evening daddy saw me.
He and Mom were furious at me.

119
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,550
He forbid me to write again.

120
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,835
She said that you no longer existed.

121
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,038
But I was still so small, you know.

122
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,034
I wanted to tell you that ...
- What?

123
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,198
It was social services that
contacted you. Not me.

124
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,636
I've never asked anyone for nothing.

125
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,075
They did the right thing.

126
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,551
They did right.

127
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,035
You have a beautiful name. I do not like
my name. Fontaine is beautiful.

128
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,352
I always liked those.
Water, rivers, streams.

129
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,912
The Orinoco.
Do you know the Orinoco?

130
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,197
Nowadays fountains are scarce.

131
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,359
Even in villages.
Have you notice that?

132
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,193
Really.

133
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,949
The mayors transform them.
They fill them with earth.

134
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,112
They plant flowers.
Of those rotten geraniums.

135
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,477
As if people don't like
the sound of water!

136
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,438
I will not keep you long.

137
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,309
You have to come sign in.
So you sign ...

138
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,198
Did you find a job?

139
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,196
Not yet. I am searching for employment.

140
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
A house?
- I live with my sister.

141
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,471
That is important.
Family is important. You 're lucky.

142
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,712
Loneliness is not good
for a man.

143
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,994
But I am not going to talk about my life.
See you in two weeks.

144
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,879
Should I sign something?
- Oh, yes.

145
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,109
There.
- There?

146
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,430
Thank you.

147
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,990
It is not true! He again.

148
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,755
One of your many lovers?
- He is Bamakal.

149
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,355
Prosper Napoleon Bamakal.
Son of a prince with blue blood.

150
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,988
Enrolled in the first year
for the third time

151
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,789
I'm starting to like him. I try to explain
but he will not understand.

152
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,871
I've had him all year.

153
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,953
Are you leaving?
- yes I'm done.

154
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,631
Did you finished correcting the papers?
- I have like ten left.

155
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,032
You 're lucky. I have not yet begun.
When I see the stack, I give up.

156
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,155
The school board wants us to have them
done by the 18th.

157
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,072
The supervisor. The supervisor.

158
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,720
Did you decided about that symposium?
- I don 't know. We shall see.

159
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,511
Didn't we agreed to meet
at the cafe?

160
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,159
It didn't took me long.

161
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,470
Michel, this is Juliette, my sister.
This is Michel, a colleague.

162
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,190
You've never told me you
had a sister. And such  a beautiful one.

163
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,919
Never mind him. Michel, is an
expert in love letters.

164
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,672
Even though that's a bit misleading.

165
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,637
What are you doing on the 26th?
- Why?

166
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,109
I'll throw a dinner
with Samir and Kasha.

167
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,078
I think I can make it. I'll let you know.
- Great.

168
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,076
And do not forget the papers.

169
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,750
Should we go shopping?

170
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,674
Is it good?

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,634
Do you remember  Chez Bouchard's
in Rouen?

172
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,475
This place reminds me of it.

173
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,919
I was taking you there on Wednesday's
after dance classes.

174
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,471
The lesson at Stabush's mother.
- Yes, the fat Mrs Stabush.

175
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,598
She could no longer dance,
she was so fat.

176
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,195
And she had a moustache.

177
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,071
We were all a bit scared of her.

178
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,473
I would finish classes and we'd go
Chez Bouchard to drink tea.

179
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,035
You always eat that cake.

180
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,513
I can't really remember.

181
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,917
You were seven or eight.
The place was full of elderly ladies.

182
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,118
I don't remember it.
I don't know why.

183
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,758
Why don't I remember it?
- Please, stop.

184
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,434
It is normal.
You were still very young.

185
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,592
Yet it is strange
not being able to remember.

186
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,277
You can't come in. This is my room.
You'll show her your room later.

187
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,952
Little sisters! They're difficult.
Mom used to leave you in peace?

188
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,592
It went well.
- Then you 're lucky.

189
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,710
Is mom your real sister?
- Of course.

190
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,112
Are you also the daughter
of Grandma Lizbeth ?

191
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,674
Look, that's the dolls cemetery.

192
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,671
I do not like dolls. When they
give me one, I bury her.

193
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,396
My PC. I play DVDs here
and type my papers.

194
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,515
That I made for Mother's Day.

195
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,117
Katrina destroyed it.
She says she didn't but she's lying.

196
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,793
That's my secret book.

197
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,988
Actually, not really secret,
because I leave it all over the place.

198
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,438
I write poems in there.
Should I read you one?

199
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,836
No.

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,117
Please, auntie.
- No. I said 'no'.

201
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,033
You are lucky. You've got a sister,
your family, and a house.

202
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,079
It's true. Most people
released have nothing.

203
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,515
They don't know
where they should go.

204
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,513
If they were married
they are now separated.

205
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,752
I was already separated.
- Yes. I read   about it.

206
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,549
You had a good work training
in prison.

207
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,756
Secretaries are always needed.

208
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,515
And are you up to date with the computer?
- Yes, I think so.

209
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,557
Good. Then it will be easy.

210
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,349
I made appointment for you
at this company.

211
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,478
Ask for Mr. Dupuis.
He knows about you.

212
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,232
We will see each other regularly.

213
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,234
And if you have questions or problems,
call me.

214
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,389
Ok.

215
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,352
Then I should  go. You are not alone
and it's only two of us working cases.

216
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,510
Your sister has a nice house.

217
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,359
Goodbye.

218
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,393
Was she the probation officer?
- Yes.

219
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,028
Is she nice?
- Yes.

220
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,677
People poking around in your life
always seem nice.

221
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,594
That is true. We have also
experience with adoption.

222
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,078
So many conversations, counsels
psychologists.

223
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,360
A doctor made Luc strip in his
underwear and walk back and forth.

224
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,715
I thought he would
grab him by the throat .

225
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,192
He was not so happy
with all those interrogations.

226
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,714
Shall we have a cup of tea?
- Yes.

227
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,711
It took almost two years with
Little Lili, slightly less with Emilia.

228
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,156
The first time we went
three months to Vietnam.

229
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,438
We fell in love with the country
we wanted to stay longer.

230
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,596
We were lucky to get Little Lili
to the hotel immediately.

231
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,797
Then it was so slow,
so many formalities.

232
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,951
Ms?
- Yes, Marie-Paule?

233
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,592
Shall I start ironing?
- No, do the doors first.

234
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,670
Thank you.

235
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,112
How old was Little Lili?

236
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,034
Two years old, but she looked
much younger.

237
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,394
Did you meet her mother?
- No, but I have all her details.

238
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,033
It was important for us. We did not want
her not to be able to find her later.

239
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,275
But for Emilia it wasn't possible.

240
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,198
She won 't never know
who her mom was

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,831
Sometimes it is better not to know.

242
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,197
It was you or Luc
that could not have children?

243
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,119
Neither of us.
We both can have children

244
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,116
But I  did not want
a child in my belly.

245
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,710
It's because of me.

246
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,430
Of  what I did.

247
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,638
I didn't try
to understand.

248
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,392
I'm going to smoke in the garden.

249
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,950
It is not my problem.
You are paid to deliver.

250
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,712
Yes. Goodbye.

251
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,830
Well. Now to you.

252
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,192
I'll get straight to business.
This is not charity.

253
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,955
I want skilled workers.
I don't care about anything else.

254
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,870
What's her name again?
Mrs Balboukian ...

255
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,511
... said that you can work with Excel,
DTP and all that.

256
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,557
Yes I can.

257
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,751
And you are half English.
- Right.

258
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,759
And I speak Spanish.

259
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,232
Spanish is not important.
But there are often documents in English.

260
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,674
Monsieur Dupuis, Raymond is waiting.
- Later.

261
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,194
How long were you in prison?
- Fifteen.

262
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,113
Fifteen years.

263
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,748
Fifteen years? Is not that ...

264
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,632
You must have done something
really big to get you committed for so long.
committed.

265
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,552
What have you done?

266
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
For such a sentence
you must have murdered someone.

267
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,438
Whom have you killed?

268
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,557
Your husband? A lover?
The other woman? Who?

269
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,517
I'm talking to you.
Whom did you kill?

270
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,239
My son.

271
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,073
My six years old son.

272
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,678
Get the hell out.

273
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,437
You hear me? Get out of here.

274
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,829
It's nice.

275
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,076
It suits you fine.
- Thank you.

276
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,077
Will I see you tonight?
- No, I'm tired.

277
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,992
I'm really tired.

278
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,834
Are you sure?

279
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,198
Excuse me.
- Go, go ahead.

280
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,752
Do you want my picture?

281
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,078
Have we met?
- I don't think so.

282
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,436
What do you want from me?
- I wasn't really looking at you

283
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,755
Nonsense.
You were staring at me.

284
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,878
Are you looking for a man?

285
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,917
So? Did you like it?

286
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,153
No, not at all.
But that's okay.

287
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,313
Honey. Want a cookie?

288
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,719
Sit down. Let your dragon drink.

289
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,952
Are you okay, Juliette?

290
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,269
Aunt, look. The monkeys.
Sometimes they spit on people.

291
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,631
It's not good they're caged
they have done nothing.

292
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,588
Prisons are for bad people.
- Come on, let's go.

293
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,230
What did I do?
- Nothing. Come, we must go home.

294
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,277
Do not be ridiculous.

295
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,758
What do you think I was asleep
all this time...

296
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,515
and suddenly the fairy godmother lea
woke me up?

297
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,556
It's easy for you not to look back.

298
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,597
Auxerre  wins Sochaux 3-2,
Lens, Lille is 2-2.

299
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,149
Monaco is winning Bordeaux
with 2-1.

300
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,276
Saint-Etienne beat Marseille
with 3-0.

301
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,228
PSG was beaten by Nancy, 3-1.

302
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,914
PSG is fucked.

303
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,953
What are you doing?

304
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,069
Can't you see? I peel potatoes.
- Very funny.

305
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,869
Michel will not be amused.
3-1!

306
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,712
The kids are asleep?

307
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,634
Yes. They were running around all day.
They were dead tired.

308
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,513
And your sister?

309
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,240
What about my sister?
Is she sound asleep?

310
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,233
No ... I do not know what are you...

311
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,399
Talking?
- Yes, we talk.

312
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,510
So have you asked her yet?
- About what?

313
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,756
Why.
Why she did it.

314
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,512
You're not thinking right.
You're not serious.

315
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,671
What do you talk about then?

316
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,037
Sisters talk about things.
It is not for you.

317
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,236
You want me out of this?
- No.

318
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,073
But you say nothing.
- What do you want me to say?

319
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,717
Something like this takes time.
It is not easy.

320
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,514
My sister was dead to my parents.
You don't know how this is.

321
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,276
She is suddenly in my life
again. Everything happened ...

322
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,192
Damn. I don't want to talk about it.

323
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,315
And your father agrees with me.
Right Grandpa Paul?

324
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,029
There is no greater Nancy  supporter
than my dad.

325
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,876
Tell them that this is the last.
Watch out, that plate is glued.

326
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,598
Katrina?
- Yes.

327
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,079
Okay off to bed.

328
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,473
The last one.

329
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,716
Michel, it is a scandal ...

330
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,351
... that you live in Lorraine and you
support a team that is 3/4 mad of  Brazilians.

331
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,919
Three quarters?
- Three quarters.

332
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,674
There are only two Brazilians
in PSG.

333
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,400
Take your glasses with you.
- You're boring Juliette.

334
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,838
Nope. I love football.
I've played himself in the past.

335
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,514
Really?
- yes, you don't remember?

336
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,514
The perfect woman. Beautiful, intelligent.
And also likes football.

337
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,070
But I can't stand supporters.
- Take that!

338
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,753
Please, Samir.

339
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,514
An Iraqi surgeon,
paid by Al Qaeda ...

340
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,638
... that has slaughtered many in surgery,
will not make fun of me!

341
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,473
You know what that Iraqi will say?
- That's enough guys.

342
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,756
You'll play football on Sunday?
- No I can't.

343
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,994
He has too many papers to correct.
- that will be the third week.

344
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,470
Yes the third week that 200
exam papers are waiting on my desk.

345
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,437
Come now. Come on.

346
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,832
You always play together?
- We try to.

347
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,834
Sometimes there are ten of us,
sometimes 40. can you imagine?

348
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,753
You should come watch.
- Why not?

349
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,720
You like it here at Nancy?
- Yes.

350
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,348
Lea said you lived south for years.
- That's right.

351
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,469
Where?
- In Carcassonne.

352
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,474
It's beautiful. The Montagne Noire,
Toulouse nearby.

353
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,189
Are you from Paris?
- Yes, but it's exhausting. Too many Parisians.

354
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,875
I'm going  there as little as possible.
It suits me well here.

355
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,435
Well you have some fossils as well,
but that's okay.

356
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,951
My colleagues made that for me.
- Not bad.

357
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,917
Funny, but it itches.

358
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,232
Really, it itches.
It is too small and it itches.

359
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,080
They made it for you
and you have to wear it.

360
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,313
Can I sit with you?

361
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,355
In prison, I had always
books next to my pillow.

362
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,796
The idea that I had them were
made me feel secure.

363
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,638
A kind of fortress wall.
On the other side, was the world.

364
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,956
A world without me.

365
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,674
That was doing all right without me.

366
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,038
Sylvie.

367
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,988
I have read that so many times.

368
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,634
During the week I usually eat from cans.
Usually boiled beef or sausages with lentils.

369
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,911
I can't cook and I'm not interested
either. I eat in front the TV.

370
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,995
At weekends, I cook fresh vegetables.
Recommended by my doctor.

371
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,672
He is right. You can't
eat canned food every day.

372
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,633
If you say so.
And what about eggs?

373
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
Yes. But not every day.

374
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,471
That's good,
because I only eat them on Sunday.

375
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,069
That reminds me of when I was a kid.
A fried egg or a soft boiled egg in front of TV.

376
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,958
Would you like sugar?
- Sure. One, please.

377
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,514
Do you watch TV?
- No. It does not interest me.

378
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,069
I thought everybody in prison
are watching  TV.

379
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,757
Do not always believe what you hear.
Can I have a spoon?

380
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,598
I force myself to watch.

381
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,598
It's like a punishment .
- A punishment?

382
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,429
There is so much evil in all this.
Such evil.

383
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,438
A large pile of garbage ...

384
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,231
... that every night
gets presented to us.

385
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,071
And every night the heap's larger,
uglier. Closer to you.

386
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,514
Is everything okay with you?

387
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,756
We'll check, Mr Bamakale.
But  computers make no mistakes.

388
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,549
It made two last year miss.
Both concerning me.

389
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,794
The server is doing it now. So be patient.
And stop sending me notes every other day.

390
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,958
You'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment

391
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,399
You saved me.

392
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,669
I thought you were going straight home
- I wanted to talk to you.

393
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,879
Come on.

394
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,112
The tests showed
that he had metastases everywhere.

395
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,075
He died two months later.

396
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,671
When exactly?
- On March 4, 1999.

397
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,673
When we found out
I wanted to let you know.

398
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,513
I had this huge fight with Mom.

399
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,800
She went and told him and I
had to promise never to contact you.

400
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,632
He was crying.

401
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,270
He was hooked up to
dozens of tubes..

402
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,470
He ... He weighed just 50 kilos.

403
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,551
And I promised him.

404
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,111
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,799
Did you ever think of us
when you were there?

406
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,158
"There"?
"There" was a prison.

407
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,794
Do you know what a prison is?
I, your sister, I was in a prison.

408
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,554
She still lives in Beaufans?
- Mummy? No.

409
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,354
I had to find a home for her.

410
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,311
I brought her here.

411
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,554
Then four years after the death of Dad
she began to lose her memory.

412
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,358
Small things, but still.

413
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,910
Now, she doesn't
recognise anyone

414
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,832
When I go to see her, she thinks
I'm a nurse or a neighbour.

415
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,031
They never talked about me?

416
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,350
What did they tell other people?

417
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,675
Anybody who knew the family knew
better than to mention it.

418
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,798
And the new friends thought
I was their only daughter.

419
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,396
They thought that or
they were told that?

420
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,832
They were told that.

421
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,472
Parents!

422
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,873
And you?

423
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,109
They had brainwashed me.

424
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,711
Last week
I slept with a man.

425
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,869
What?

426
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,314
I've slept with a man.

427
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,754
With whom? Where?
- A guy from a cafe.

428
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,070
We went to a hotel.

429
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,831
Just like that?
- Yes, just like that.

430
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,914
It is difficult, aunt.
- Yes, but you have to learn.

431
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,593
Learning is difficult. Go ahead.

432
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,838
Yes, that's good.

433
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,871
I'll never get it right.
- Of course you will.

434
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,157
I used to play this with your Mummy.
- My Mummy?

435
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,631
My mum played piano?
I don't believe you.

436
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,874
They played very well.
And this piece we found funny.

437
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,272
Because it's called Fontaine like you?
I never saw Mummy play!

438
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,115
She won't let me play piano.
She wants me to learn the flute.

439
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,109
If she sees us, she'll be angry!
- No, she won't. Don't worry.

440
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
That is very good. Now alone.

441
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,591
You have all the qualifications
for the job.

442
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,838
But in your case
I can not decide alone.

443
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,673
The director of the hospital
will have to decide.

444
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,473
You see yourself as a secretary?

445
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,871
That's a strange question.

446
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,028
If he approves it, nobody here
must ever know that you were a doctor.

447
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,317
And especially that you...
You know what I mean.

448
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,035
Don't thank me,
I'm not doing it for you.

449
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,276
What did you want to do?
- I couldn't have become a doctor.

450
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,792
Our parents would have freaked, but
there was never any chance of that.

451
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,748
I was always more attracted
to literature and languages.

452
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,636
The day I told them, I could see
the relief on their faces.

453
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,630
When you were little you wanted
to be a "dancer-veterinarian".

454
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,956
You wouldn't believe
that it is difficult to combine both.

455
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,429
- hello there Lea!
-Hi Monsieur Lucien. How are you?

456
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,752
Fine. Aren't you going to introduce me?
- My sister Juliette. Monsieur Lucien.

457
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,999
Your sister?
- Yes, my sister.

458
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,549
I see. Hello.
- She's off limits, Monsieur Lucien.

459
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,188
I'll stay away from her. I promise.

460
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,878
He comes down here to try to chat up
women. He'll hit on anyone.

461
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,554
Does he ever get anywhere?
- You'd be surprised!

462
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,196
When's Mummy coming home?
- She's getting your sister from school.

463
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,839
And Auntie?

464
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,718
"Imperial arbitration"!
That's really a Parisian newspaper.

465
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,873
Are they together?
- I haven't a clue. Eat up!

466
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,758
Doesn't Auntie have a job?
- Why'd you ask?

467
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,199
No reason. I just thought she must
have a job because she's pretty old.

468
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,717
Well? What's her job?
- You ask her, smarty-pants.

469
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,031
Can't you see I'm trying to work?
- Work? What crap.

470
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,713
Give me a kiss.

471
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,199
No kiss.

472
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,156
No kiss, I said.

473
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,913
Well, that's just about everything.
Come back in a few weeks.

474
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,189
I'll call the hospital to see what's happening.
It would be the perfect job for you.

475
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,793
I'll
be in touch.

476
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,390
I was wondering... I read your file
and the notes on your trial...

477
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,156
You never said a word throughout the
investigation and the trial. Why?

478
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,228
You even refused to talk to the
psychologists.

479
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,949
Their report runs two lines.
"foreshadowing the choice of silence"

480
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,510
Psychological problems from the divorce,
murderer of her son ...

481
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,276
And you think I'm going to talk to you
now? Leave me alone.

482
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,795
It's been ages since you dropped by
the lab to pick me up.

483
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,520
Did you miss it?
- Yes. I like it when you surprise me.

484
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,070
Michel coughed his lungs off.
He could not  take it anymore.

485
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,639
How about a movie and then dinner?
- Sure.

486
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,639
Is there anything you really want to
see?

487
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,756
There's a Kurosawa at the Cameo.
- No way! Japanese films put me to sleep.

488
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,436
Well, they're probably still showing
The Shop Around The Corner.

489
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,990
But we'll be really late,
if you want to catch dinner.

490
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,752
It'll be fine.

491
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,189
Are you sure Katrina doesn't mind?
- What's Katrina got to do with anything?

492
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,716
She's looking after the girls, isn't she?
- No. I asked Juliette.

493
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,917
You asked your sister to look after them?
Have you lost your mind?

494
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,596
She killed her kid, remember!
That's insane!

495
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,630
That painting is called Grief.

496
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,995
You startled me.
- Hello.

497
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,639
Impressive, isn't it?

498
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,871
It's a whole universe.

499
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,992
Who's the artist?
- Emile Friant.

500
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,597
Famous when he was alive,
totally forgotten since then.

501
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,677
I'll show you another of his
that is my favorite.

502
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,071
The first time, I saw it,
it blew me away.

503
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,950
She looks exactly like a girl I
was in love in my 20's.

504
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,711
This is my revenge.
- Revenge?

505
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,030
She is trapped in the painting.
And I it can look at her whenever I want.

506
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,590
She can say a thing.

507
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,232
Lea is amazing. She's one of the best
specialists in France in her field.

508
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,791
But she doesn't have the killer
instinct. In our work, you have to.

509
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,556
Do you have it?
- Do I look like I do?

510
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,598
No idea

511
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,479
I don't know you well enough.
- No I'm not into that anymore..

512
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,677
You were?
What changed?

513
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,070
Nothing. Everything. Life.
Life changes us.

514
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,798
Life ...

515
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,273
Lea told me you're looking
for a job.
- Yes.

516
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,080
Yes, I had an interview for a
secretary's job at the hospital.

517
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,390
Secretary? That's what you do?

518
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,030
Yes. I mean, no. It's complicated.

519
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,069
In that case, I'll shut up.

520
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,994
You wanna go somewhere?
To drink to your health?

521
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,032
Or maybe to the health of the girl
in the museum, right?

522
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:02,118
You finished your dessert. Wash your teeth
and don't wake up your sister.

523
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,236
When is mom coming back?

524
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,478
After the meeting.

525
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,835
Late?
- I think so.

526
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,912
If you're nice
I'll come up for a kiss.

527
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,592
Come on, Grandpa.

528
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,678
Is it all right
with the bank?

529
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,117
The account yes,
but the check book ...

530
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,559
That I do not get till
I have no job.

531
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,029
Any news from the hospital?
- Nothing.

532
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,157
Don't worry.
I will not bother you for long.

533
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,755
I'll think of a solution.

534
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,673
No... I didn't mean ...
I ...

535
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,558
I want a story.

536
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,071
I come up, Peaches.

537
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,512
You should read it.

538
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,156
The old man in front of him
smiled ...

539
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,313
... and for a moment Badjii
saw in his face...

540
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,837
... the face of a boy
his age or a girl ...

541
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,752
... or an infant.

542
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,794
In the sky the stars
danced,

543
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,272
And the moon came up,
as the full belly of a woman.

544
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:28,522
Good day.

545
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:40,159
-You don't mind we meet here?
-Of course not.

546
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:42,997
I love cafés.

547
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,765
It's one of the things I missed
most in prison.

548
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:51,597
The atmosphere of cafés.
The smoke and buzz...

549
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:54,120
...of conversations.

550
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,722
-Is it raining outside?
-No, I've been swimming.

551
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:01,446
You swim?

552
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:03,878
Me too, but not in pools.

553
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:07,959
I told you about the Orinoco, yes?

554
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:10,324
Yes, the first time we met.

555
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:18,279
It's a huge river. Over 1,500
miles long. It never ends.

556
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:23,204
And it's powerful. Rapids, waterfalls-

557
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,360
-and flood plains...

558
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:30,317
-You've seen it for real?
-Not yet. It's a project of mine.

559
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,996
-What's keeping you?
-I have a young daughter.

560
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,927
She lives with her mother and
I don't see her very often.

561
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:41,285
Her mother moved away. And
my daughter has moved away, too.

562
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:51,486
You know, the Orinoco is a real
mystery. Several expeditions have set-

563
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:54,323
-out to find it. But none ever succeeded.

564
00:53:54,488 --> 00:54:00,040
They found small streams, but
not the real source.

565
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:03,477
-Am I boring you?
-Absolutely not.

566
00:54:03,648 --> 00:54:07,243
It's fascinating, isn't it?
We know everything nowadays-

567
00:54:07,408 --> 00:54:10,605
-but we can't find the
source of a river.

568
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:13,683
I've missed out on many things.

569
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:19,159
I signed and approved the papers.

570
00:54:19,808 --> 00:54:23,517
For the job at the hospital.
They asked for my opinion.

571
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:28,362
-Thanks.
-No problem.

572
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:32,766
-What do you drink?
-Coffee please.

573
00:54:32,928 --> 00:54:35,886
Coffee for the lady.
I'll have the same.

574
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:45,323
-Are we going soon?
-Patience, your highness.

575
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:49,197
Did you bring a sweater?
It can get cold out here.

576
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:10,164
Will you be OK? You have everything
you need? We'll be back tomorrow.

577
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,476
Damnit!

578
00:56:55,768 --> 00:56:58,282
You little devils!

579
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:07,043
Are you set? Another couple?

580
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,683
Natalie, use the same knife
for the pineapple.

581
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:36,242
Bedtime, kids.

582
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:59,727
I don't have to like Rohmer!
It's a free country.

583
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:04,325
How can you teach literature and
not understand Rohmer's movies?

584
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:10,358
Lea didn't say that. She just said
that she doesn't like them.

585
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:15,477
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
How do you explain Racine to your students?

586
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:19,042
That's irrelevant. What's Racine
got to do with anything?

587
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:21,518
Rohmer is the Racine
of the 20:th century.

588
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:25,726
But if you guys are too
stupid to see it...

589
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:30,245
Have some of this and chill. Next
you'll be telling us Stallone is Shakespeare.

590
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,801
Screw you! You don't care for
anything except soccer.

591
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:40,525
What about you, Juliette?
What do you think?

592
00:58:43,848 --> 00:58:48,842
Juliette says nothing.
Juliette looks at us and judge.

593
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:52,164
But who is Juliette?

594
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:54,882
A woman of mystery.

595
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:56,561
A spirit, a goblin...

596
00:58:56,728 --> 00:59:00,403
Screw you. You're a pain.
Get some fresh air!

597
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:05,479
Ladies and gents, pray silence!
I humbly propose a game.

598
00:59:06,968 --> 00:59:09,880
The winner will receive
my deepest consideration.

599
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:14,883
-You can shove your consideration!
-Thanks. And a kiss from Juliette.

600
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:16,999
Gerard, you can be such an ass.

601
00:59:17,168 --> 00:59:21,559
The game is to figure out why Lea hid
her delightful sister from us all this time.

602
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:23,760
Where was Juliette?

603
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:26,966
-What was Juliette doing?
-Knock it off!

604
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:30,519
Was Juliette on the other side of the
world? Was she not speaking to Lea?

605
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:33,122
-Cut it out Gerard.
-Was Juliette hidden in Switzerland?

606
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:36,724
-You're getting on our nerves!
-A lion tamer of a circus?

607
00:59:36,888 --> 00:59:40,483
A Mossad spy, an amnesiac?

608
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:43,845
-Answer us, Juliette! Answer us!
-Shut the fuck up Gerard!

609
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:49,036
Let Juliette speak! For once I
found myself an interesting heroine.

610
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,325
-You're an asshole.
-The truth...

611
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,446
Juliette disappears.
Juliette reappears. Juliette?

612
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:58,327
-Go to bed.
-Not before I know where Juliette was.

613
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:00,080
The beautiful Juliette.
Juliette! Juliette!

614
01:00:07,568 --> 01:00:11,117
I was in prison. Fifteen years.
I killed my son.

615
01:00:17,768 --> 01:00:21,204
That'll teach you, Gerard.

616
01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:27,647
Well done, Juliette.

617
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:32,640
-Now what, loudmouth?
-OK, she wins. I give up.

618
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,003
Sorry about him.

619
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:30,562
He's an ass when he's drunk.
But he's a good guy.

620
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,676
They all think you were joking.

621
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:38,800
But I...

622
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:41,883
I'm sure you weren't.

623
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:48,360
Before I got my job at the university
I taught in prison for ten years.

624
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:51,399
I rarely talk about it

625
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:57,238
I used to go in three times a week
And I'd come out three times a week.

626
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:03,597
That changed my whole life.
My whole way of looking at things.

627
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:05,281
People...

628
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:07,441
The Sky...

629
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,244
Passing time...

630
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:17,085
Everybody I met behind bars, it
seemed like they were just like me.

631
01:02:20,328 --> 01:02:23,957
They could have been me and
I could have been them.

632
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:27,644
It's a fine line sometimes.

633
01:02:53,248 --> 01:02:55,284
-Will you be okay?
-Yeah.

634
01:02:56,608 --> 01:02:58,519
Thanks for the ride.

635
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:02,566
Don't, please.

636
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,604
I'm still a long way away.

637
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:23,726
That's only true of Raskolnikov.

638
01:03:23,888 --> 01:03:27,597
You can't extend the notion of
redemptive guilt to humanity-

639
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:31,483
-in general and suggest that each
murder contains its own redemption.

640
01:03:31,648 --> 01:03:36,517
Yet the aim of the novelist is to
reconstitute the world.

641
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:39,203
Dostoyevsky is no exception.

642
01:03:39,368 --> 01:03:42,246
You know full well that the
narration in this novel is impersonal-

643
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:45,559
-but also incomplete. It's as if the
author refused to show a plain worldview-

644
01:03:45,728 --> 01:03:48,003
-because he knows that there are
numerous interpretations and motivations.

645
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:51,558
And numerous shades of truth.

646
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,638
-The first draft is in first person...
-So what?!

647
01:03:55,968 --> 01:03:59,199
The initial project was to portray
a single soul-

648
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:03,202
-that might give us an intimate,
universal insight of murderers.

649
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:07,156
You don't know what
you're talking about!

650
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:10,365
What do you know about murder
and murderers anyway?

651
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:14,726
And what did Dostoyevsky know about it
deep down?

652
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:17,163
Well? Nothing! Nada! Zilch!

653
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:20,287
Even masterpieces are
no more than hypotheses-

654
01:04:20,448 --> 01:04:24,361
-simplistic extrapolations that are nothing
compared to true life. Nothing. OK?

655
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:30,238
If you quit viewing books as a last word
on something, you'd spout less bullshit.

656
01:04:34,768 --> 01:04:37,646
I... I am terribly sorry. I apologize.
I don't know what...

657
01:04:41,488 --> 01:04:42,921
Excuse me.

658
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:56,481
-Good morning, I wondered if I -
-Not now! This is not the time!

659
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:18,920
Madame Cuvelle.

660
01:05:19,088 --> 01:05:22,364
Madame Gonzalo. Madame Fontaine
Madame replaces Seriani.

661
01:05:22,528 --> 01:05:24,644
Lovely. We'll see each other soon.

662
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:31,917
This is your desk. Your job is
essentially to type up medical reports-

663
01:05:32,088 --> 01:05:35,046
-and perhaps help out your colleagues
from time to time.

664
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:38,280
The trial period is three weeks.
The director will then decide.

665
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:41,281
I'll let you get settled in.

666
01:06:24,688 --> 01:06:27,441
Not too fast. Go on.

667
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:37,359
-"I've loved you so long"
-Mom, come play, mom!

668
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,679
Come on. Aunty said
you played very well.

669
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,597
-Come on.
-Behind the piano.

670
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:47,086
I'll play the right side.
Just like old times.

671
01:06:47,448 --> 01:06:49,404
-Here we go.
-Just a minute.

672
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:58,721
"At the fountain as I was
walking by, the water was so clear"-

673
01:06:58,888 --> 01:07:02,483
"That I want for a swim..."

674
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:06,084
"The water was so clear"-

675
01:07:06,248 --> 01:07:10,321
-"That I want for a swim"-

676
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:15,083
-"I've loved you so long"-

677
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:20,686
-"I can never forget you..."

678
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:25,727
Rubbish.

679
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:30,405
-Bravo, mom! Bravo aunt.
-It was a bit high.

680
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:31,967
It was not bad.

681
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:37,917
It's not easy meeting someone
new at my age. I dislike going out.

682
01:07:38,128 --> 01:07:40,084
And being a cop scares people off.

683
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:45,523
But I could be at Social Services, it'd be
the same really. A desk job.

684
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:49,958
This is where I met my wife.

685
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:53,638
They've redecorated, but
it's basically still the same.

686
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:56,720
-Where did you meet your husband?
-At college.

687
01:07:56,888 --> 01:07:58,241
He was a doctor, too?

688
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,798
No, he dropped out after two years.

689
01:08:01,968 --> 01:08:03,640
So what does he do?

690
01:08:04,968 --> 01:08:07,163
Should we really talk about him?

691
01:08:09,328 --> 01:08:12,604
When did you last see him?
-At the trial-

692
01:08:15,688 --> 01:08:18,248
-he testified against me.

693
01:08:19,648 --> 01:08:22,560
And he gave me an attitude.

694
01:08:24,528 --> 01:08:29,283
<i>Like my wife. Ever since, she's never...</i>

695
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:33,718
She sends my daughter here
by plane or train-

696
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:36,846
-with a label round her neck
like a parcel.

697
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:39,520
How's work?

698
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:43,802
-It feels strange.
-Aren't hospitals that?

699
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:47,161
No, it's not. It's...

700
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:52,360
I imagined lab tubes and
microscopes. It is more...

701
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,884
...the re-start, that
something fresh is starting.

702
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:00,480
I can't explain it very well.

703
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,604
You're doing fine.

704
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:07,441
-Nobody giving you any trouble?
-No...

705
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:14,767
By the way, I think I'll soon be...
You remember my Orinoco project...

706
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:21,559
After all this time, it's much
clearer in my mind now.

707
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:25,998
There's nothing that makes
it worth staying here for.

708
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:32,243
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

709
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:45,244
There, there.

710
01:09:45,408 --> 01:09:49,037
-What's that?
-That's an X.

711
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,519
And that?

712
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:57,601
You need to find that. It's a T.
Where is it? Here?

713
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:59,918
Nope. There?

714
01:10:02,528 --> 01:10:07,238
You idiot! I told you.
You never listen...

715
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:10,206
-Will you shut up? It hurts.
-What happened?

716
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:13,162
-Where does it hurt?
-In my shoulder.

717
01:10:19,808 --> 01:10:21,605
Your shoulder is dislocated.

718
01:10:22,888 --> 01:10:27,404
I'll put it back. It'll hurt but once
it's in, that's it.

719
01:10:29,608 --> 01:10:31,087
One, two, three.

720
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:33,002
Ready!

721
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:36,839
Feel better?

722
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:42,160
Yes... Yes... lots. What a trick.

723
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,245
Where'd you learn to do that, Auntie?

724
01:10:45,048 --> 01:10:49,246
-The scouts.
-The scouts? What's that?

725
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:51,444
I want to be a scout.

726
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:56,727
With the kids, it's hard to
keep up my research.

727
01:10:57,008 --> 01:11:00,080
I go to less conferences, I
publish less...

728
01:11:00,248 --> 01:11:04,958
But I like working here.
I get on with my colleagues.

729
01:11:05,648 --> 01:11:08,685
Michel, for example, is the kind of
guy who'll never let you down.

730
01:11:10,848 --> 01:11:13,920
-Has he always been single?
-Yes.

731
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:18,843
His wife died in a car accident.
We've known each other since.

732
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:22,048
He didn't tip me off.

733
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,927
I heard it by chance
from a secretary.

734
01:11:25,128 --> 01:11:27,084
He's actually pretty secretive.

735
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:31,120
Check that out! Look who
Monsieur Lucien has on his arm.

736
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:39,002
Wicked. There's always
hope when you're a guy.

737
01:11:42,608 --> 01:11:46,203
-Had you forgotten me?
-What's that?

738
01:11:48,808 --> 01:11:52,164
You forgot me all those years, didn't
you?

739
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:00,606
Open it.

740
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:04,125
Take one out.
It doesn't matter which.

741
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:15,562
That was the first thing
I did every morning.

742
01:12:15,728 --> 01:12:19,562
Write your name and the
number of days you'd been gone.

743
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:23,121
I suppose you could say it
only took a second-

744
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:26,366
-and it was just a few letters
and figures-

745
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:32,724
-but I thought about you so hard in
those few moments. Every day.

746
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:36,324
It was just us again.

747
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:55,637
Yes. Good morning, sir...

748
01:12:57,968 --> 01:12:59,765
I'll be right there.

749
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:08,158
It's called teamwork.

750
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:12,159
Even if you each have your
individual tasks to do-

751
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:17,802
-there has to be unity, team spirit.

752
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,959
We're not machines.

753
01:13:23,408 --> 01:13:26,798
Several of your co-workers
say you are cold and-

754
01:13:26,968 --> 01:13:30,040
-distant. You never talk to anyone.

755
01:13:30,568 --> 01:13:33,640
It's disappointing. Very
disappointing.

756
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,125
Does that mean I'm out of a job?

757
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,837
Of course not!

758
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:47,127
I didn't say that, did I?
Just don't forget you're on trial.

759
01:13:47,768 --> 01:13:49,645
Make an effort.

760
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:56,164
That's all I'm saying.
Try to be less... withdrawn.

761
01:13:56,328 --> 01:13:58,319
Open up a bit.

762
01:13:59,288 --> 01:14:03,679
Of course, I understand
that it's not...

763
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:05,921
Finally.

764
01:14:06,528 --> 01:14:10,521
-I mean, I understand but...
-What do you understand?

765
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:19,087
Okay, Little Lili, lights out now.

766
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:22,320
No, please! Leave it on!

767
01:14:22,648 --> 01:14:24,923
-Mum, I want to ask you something.
-Yes?

768
01:14:25,088 --> 01:14:29,127
When you and Auntie were little,
did you spend a lot of time together?

769
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:31,324
Quite a lot, yes.

770
01:14:31,488 --> 01:14:34,082
But Auntie Juliette was much older than you.

771
01:14:35,008 --> 01:14:38,000
-So she protected you?
-Against absolutely everything.

772
01:14:38,568 --> 01:14:40,320
So why did she stop one day?

773
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:46,603
Because I wasn't a little girl
anymore. Sleep now.

774
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:51,763
We all need protecting, don't we,
though? Even when we're grown up.

775
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:56,237
That's what your Dad's for.

776
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:58,365
Goodnight.

777
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:04,320
-You know, I really like Auntie Juliette.
-Me, too, sweetheart.

778
01:15:04,488 --> 01:15:08,481
-It's a shame she never had children.
-What makes you say that?

779
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:13,918
-I'd have liked to have some cousins.
-Go to sleep.

780
01:15:24,048 --> 01:15:25,640
Will you be back..?

781
01:15:27,968 --> 01:15:31,085
-Want to go for a walk?
-Your call, really.

782
01:15:49,288 --> 01:15:52,724
For two years, the only walking I got
to do was in a tiny-

783
01:15:52,888 --> 01:15:57,564
-triangular courtyard with big, high walls...

784
01:15:59,008 --> 01:16:02,762
I counted my steps.
Every step I took.

785
01:16:03,048 --> 01:16:06,245
And kept on counting later
when I was at Centrale.

786
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:12,326
The guards called me "Walker".
The other inmates called me Nobody.

787
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:15,719
I guess I always gave
the impression not to be Someone.

788
01:16:18,848 --> 01:16:21,487
Not so fast.

789
01:16:28,808 --> 01:16:31,880
There's a Giono novel that has a great
female character-

790
01:16:32,048 --> 01:16:35,120
-who's withdrawn into silence.
She calls herself Nobody.

791
01:16:35,288 --> 01:16:38,086
The main character falls
madly in love with her.

792
01:16:40,608 --> 01:16:43,202
Do you see the world
through books you've read?

793
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,438
Books have been a big help to me.

794
01:16:47,528 --> 01:16:50,406
Sometimes, they are better friends
than people, don't you find?

795
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,001
Breakfast.

796
01:16:57,688 --> 01:17:01,078
-Hey! That's mine!
-I'm terribly late. I gotta run.

797
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:03,239
I have a meeting that will
finish late.

798
01:17:03,408 --> 01:17:08,038
So do I. I won't be home either.
I told you about it.

799
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,678
-What about us?
-Katrina will look after you.

800
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:14,920
Katrina's away wreaking destruction
and havoc at her mother-in-law's.

801
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,807
-Papy Paul can look after us. Please?
-Maybe...

802
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:20,321
What?

803
01:17:21,488 --> 01:17:22,443
Maybe...

804
01:17:23,928 --> 01:17:28,285
Maybe... Juliette could look after
you. If she doesn't mind, of course.

805
01:17:28,928 --> 01:17:33,240
-No, it'd be a pleasure.
-Yes! Thank you, Auntie!

806
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:35,647
Thanks.

807
01:17:37,568 --> 01:17:38,887
Hi everybody.

808
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:44,807
Laurent Taskon, 11.
Frédéric Taskon, 6.

809
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:49,361
Cécile Tramelle, 18.
No way! Did she bribe you?

810
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:52,486
I'm using a new system
of bonus points. Female? Plus 3.

811
01:17:52,648 --> 01:17:55,685
Belly showing? Plus 2.
Thong showing? Plus 5.

812
01:17:55,848 --> 01:17:59,602
No bra? Plus 4.
Belly button pierced? Plus 1.

813
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:01,121
You slimeball!

814
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:05,361
I'll tell Juliette on you.
She was beginning to like you.

815
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:08,201
-She told you that?
-Perhaps.

816
01:18:08,368 --> 01:18:10,279
Seriously, what did she say?

817
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:13,485
Look at you! You're like
you're 15 years old!

818
01:18:13,728 --> 01:18:16,288
-Frédéric Trousseau, 8.
-C'mon, Léa, tell me!

819
01:18:16,448 --> 01:18:19,087
-Ludivine Trussi, 5.
-What were you talking about?

820
01:18:19,248 --> 01:18:22,877
Types. I'll tell you later.
Frédéric Trousseau, 8.

821
01:18:23,688 --> 01:18:25,565
Ludivine Trussi, 5.

822
01:18:46,328 --> 01:18:47,647
May I?

823
01:19:34,448 --> 01:19:35,927
How did it go? Are they asleep?

824
01:19:36,088 --> 01:19:39,239
-Like logs.
-I'm going to go to bed too. Luc home?

825
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:43,606
-Not yet.
-You're still coming tomorrow?

826
01:20:17,088 --> 01:20:21,161
-Hi, Mummy!
-I already said I don't need anything!

827
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:23,446
It's me, Mum.

828
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:27,647
I don't know you. If you don't
leave this minute, I'll call for help!

829
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:33,202
-Mum, it's me. Your daughter.
-Oh, I know who you are.

830
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:37,765
-I told you before, I don't need anything.
-I brought you some flowers.

831
01:20:37,928 --> 01:20:42,206
Don't think you'll get
round me like that!

832
01:20:42,448 --> 01:20:45,838
-Mum...
-Stop calling me that!

833
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,683
It's very annoying!
Don't just stand there, fetch a vase!

834
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:51,201
Go.

835
01:20:58,008 --> 01:21:00,203
Everything I have gets stolen here.

836
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:03,963
It's a funny job you do-

837
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:07,359
-pestering people all day.  Can't you
take your junk somewhere else?

838
01:21:09,808 --> 01:21:12,117
My darling Juliette...

839
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:14,882
Are you back from school already?

840
01:21:15,528 --> 01:21:18,804
Come and give me a big kiss!

841
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:22,239
Come and kiss your Mummy! Yes!

842
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:26,846
Come on, sweaty. What's wrong?

843
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,646
I am so happy to see you!

844
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:30,800
I am so happy!

845
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:34,279
They locked me up.

846
01:21:34,448 --> 01:21:36,200
I'm all alone here, you know.

847
01:21:36,648 --> 01:21:39,640
I'm all, all alone. Take
me home with you.

848
01:21:40,008 --> 01:21:42,727
Take me home, please.

849
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:53,446
What are you doing, pressing up
against me? You've got a nerve!

850
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:58,204
Get out of here now,
both of you! Go on! Out!

851
01:22:36,488 --> 01:22:40,322
-Michel? It's Juliette.
-How are you doing?

852
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:45,642
Fine. I'm in town. I thought
maybe we could meet up?

853
01:22:45,808 --> 01:22:49,596
I'm really sorry. I have a meeting
starting in half an hour and...

854
01:22:49,768 --> 01:22:54,683
After your meeting maybe? I can go
for a walk in the meantime.

855
01:22:54,848 --> 01:23:00,844
It'll probably drag on. And I promised
a friend I'd meet him afterwards.

856
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:03,602
-Another time, okay?
-Okay.

857
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:07,000
-Sorry to bother you. Bye.
-Bye, Juliette.

858
01:23:33,128 --> 01:23:34,527
Hello?

859
01:23:40,168 --> 01:23:41,806
Anyone home?

860
01:24:01,968 --> 01:24:04,687
Happy birthday to you!

861
01:24:11,408 --> 01:24:12,807
Congratulations!

862
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:20,687
Open it.

863
01:24:24,568 --> 01:24:26,047
Thanks.

864
01:24:29,808 --> 01:24:32,117
The worst thing, maybe, was the end-

865
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:37,485
-the last few weeks before it was over.

866
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:44,486
I started having nightmares.
Always the same one.

867
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:49,680
I had my suitcase. I stepped outside and
found myself in the middle of nowhere.

868
01:24:50,928 --> 01:24:54,238
There was nothing and nobody there.
Just emptiness.

869
01:24:58,488 --> 01:25:03,278
One day, they told me I had a visitor.

870
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:06,403
I thought it was a mistake.

871
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:10,646
It was the first time ever.

872
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:17,079
There was a young
woman waiting to see me.

873
01:25:18,248 --> 01:25:21,797
She sat there and she smiled.

874
01:25:24,128 --> 01:25:25,846
I recognized her.

875
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,436
It was Léa.

876
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:36,246
I listened to her without saying a word.

877
01:25:36,408 --> 01:25:39,764
She promised she'd come again.
But I didn't want that.

878
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:43,045
She belonged to a part
of my life that had died.

879
01:25:47,128 --> 01:25:51,087
Then, just before I went to sleep, I
thought back to when she was little.

880
01:25:53,488 --> 01:25:55,160
Little Lala.

881
01:25:56,688 --> 01:25:59,725
The gaps in her
teeth, her smile...

882
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:03,480
Her hand in mine.

883
01:26:13,008 --> 01:26:15,317
It was that little girl...

884
01:26:16,648 --> 01:26:19,208
...that made me come back.

885
01:26:33,608 --> 01:26:36,645
Luc wants to take a
trip to the mountains.

886
01:26:36,968 --> 01:26:39,687
Being fit for his stupid soccer
games is all that matters to him.

887
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:44,797
When I was little, I so
wanted to be like you.

888
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:47,167
And now..?

889
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,122
Know what I thought of last night?
The Green House at Hossegor.

890
01:26:54,288 --> 01:26:56,802
When was the last time we were there?

891
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:59,607
The year I broke my wrist?

892
01:27:00,368 --> 01:27:04,919
-I went back once more after that.
-I thought it had been knocked down.

893
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:08,156
Fifteen years ago,
it was still standing.

894
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:12,124
I took Pierre there.

895
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:26,758
-You look very beautiful, Auntie!
-Do you think so?

896
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:30,080
-These ones or these ones?
-The red ones.

897
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:33,921
After the restaurant,
which nightclub are you going to?

898
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:37,444
That's for us to know
and you to find out.

899
01:27:37,888 --> 01:27:40,197
-Are you ready?
-Absolutely.

900
01:27:43,648 --> 01:27:45,798
-Can you dance, Auntie?
-As a queen.

901
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,959
I'd love to come with you.

902
01:27:48,128 --> 01:27:51,325
You're still a bit on the
young side, cupcake.

903
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:54,082
I'm not a cupcake
and I'm eight years old!

904
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:57,126
Eight years old!
Eight years old!

905
01:27:57,288 --> 01:28:00,360
Be good. Don't give your father a
hard time. He looks exhausted already.

906
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:04,644
No clutter.

907
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:09,404
-Don't come home too late, will you?
-You can bank on it, sweety!

908
01:28:09,648 --> 01:28:12,765
Bye mom, bye aunt.

909
01:29:36,088 --> 01:29:37,441
Allow me.

910
01:29:43,528 --> 01:29:45,325
You can tell me anything.

911
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:48,840
You can talk to me...

912
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:56,044
I'm not other people.

913
01:29:57,568 --> 01:29:59,638
Juliette, I'm not other people.

914
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,608
Juliette Fontaine?

915
01:30:12,768 --> 01:30:14,087
Follow me.

916
01:30:29,888 --> 01:30:35,326
My name is Segral.
I'm your new probation officer-

917
01:30:35,488 --> 01:30:37,683
-replacing Inspector Fauré.

918
01:30:38,968 --> 01:30:40,765
Sign the bottom.

919
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,767
So he finally did it?
He went to see the Orinoco?

920
01:30:48,248 --> 01:30:51,877
If going to see the Orinoco means
blowing your brains out, then yeah.

921
01:30:52,048 --> 01:30:53,959
Ten days ago.

922
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:34,277
Juliette! We're going to the
clinic! Kaisha gave birth last night.

923
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:37,318
I'd rather stay here.

924
01:31:37,848 --> 01:31:40,157
-Really?
-Yes.

925
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:28,044
The Director wants to see you.
He asked me to tell you.

926
01:32:35,568 --> 01:32:38,480
That's too much sugar.
Two spoonfuls is enough.

927
01:32:41,368 --> 01:32:44,644
What have you done now?

928
01:32:44,808 --> 01:32:48,642
-Is that okay, Auntie?
That's perfect. Now, the butter.

929
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:51,922
No, Sun.

930
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:55,201
-Is there enough raspberries?
-Yes.

931
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:58,166
Let's butter the cups.

932
01:32:58,728 --> 01:33:02,687
There you are.
Good grief, it's a party?!

933
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:06,321
-Is everything alright?
-You tell him.

934
01:33:06,968 --> 01:33:08,162
What?

935
01:33:08,968 --> 01:33:13,758
-I got a full-time contract.
-That's great! That calls for a drink!

936
01:33:14,128 --> 01:33:17,006
Finally a researcher from
CNRS who knows something!

937
01:33:17,168 --> 01:33:18,920
-Hi everyone.
-Hi, loners.

938
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:20,999
I brought with me a whole
tribe of starving Iraqis!

939
01:33:21,168 --> 01:33:23,443
-Why are you here?
-Why not?

940
01:33:24,488 --> 01:33:28,037
-Suns little sister.
-My cute little one.

941
01:33:28,808 --> 01:33:32,403
-Have you seen her, baby?
-Come on, look at her.

942
01:33:32,648 --> 01:33:34,878
Wait, that is you.

943
01:33:35,248 --> 01:33:38,524
-Oh yeah?
-I'm you, as a little girl.

944
01:33:38,928 --> 01:33:40,919
We gave her a beard,
just like you.

945
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:44,000
-It's a miracle.
-She sleeps.

946
01:33:44,168 --> 01:33:46,363
-Did she take after me?
-Not very much no.

947
01:33:48,128 --> 01:33:52,758
Careful, don't burn yourself.

948
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:02,921
They've eaten well I see.

949
01:34:08,008 --> 01:34:09,282
What is it?,

950
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,007
Thanks.

951
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:30,558
Juliette? It's 8:30. If you want me
to give you a lift, now's the time.

952
01:34:30,728 --> 01:34:32,400
Coming!

953
01:34:52,608 --> 01:34:54,007
Mother.

954
01:34:57,728 --> 01:35:00,561
What was it this time, Marie-Paule?

955
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:03,879
A cat? The wind? The holy spirit?

956
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:05,641
What's that?

957
01:35:06,048 --> 01:35:08,243
Why?

958
01:35:10,368 --> 01:35:12,006
Where did you get this?

959
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,121
Where did you get this?

960
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:25,605
Marie-Paule, would you check
on Emelia please?

961
01:35:25,768 --> 01:35:27,167
Yes ma'am.

962
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:37,006
<i>A garden in the rain
Is peaceful and sad too</i>

963
01:35:37,168 --> 01:35:39,557
<i>Mummy, I feel the same
When I'm far from you</i>

964
01:35:39,728 --> 01:35:42,083
<i>Your smile lights up the sky
And makes me so happy</i>

965
01:35:42,248 --> 01:35:46,605
<i>If one day you must die, do it
after me. Your loving son, Pierre.</i>

966
01:35:58,728 --> 01:36:00,684
LABORATORY ANALYSIS
BIOLOGICAL MEDICINE

967
01:36:47,648 --> 01:36:52,039
-I have to go.
-No, stay.

968
01:37:04,688 --> 01:37:07,077
-Is something wrong?
-No, I'm fine.

969
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:08,966
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

970
01:37:13,448 --> 01:37:18,078
What is this? Where are those
studies conducted at?

971
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:20,125
-It's Lili, isn't it?
-No.

972
01:37:20,288 --> 01:37:22,358
-Do you swear?
-Yes, Samir.

973
01:37:22,528 --> 01:37:25,406
-Really?
-It's not about the girls.

974
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:30,526
You know him..

975
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:35,197
It's somebody who died.
A long time ago.

976
01:37:37,528 --> 01:37:39,519
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

977
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:42,479
-You sure?
-Yeah.

978
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:46,800
So why all the mystery?
And that's not your handwritings.

979
01:37:46,968 --> 01:37:50,199
I can't explain now.
Please, no questions.

980
01:37:50,368 --> 01:37:53,485
This is just very important
for me. Very, very important.

981
01:37:59,768 --> 01:38:03,602
I'll have to consult a colleague
whose field this is.

982
01:38:03,768 --> 01:38:08,364
All I can say for the moment is that
it doesn't look very good. Not at all.

983
01:38:08,528 --> 01:38:11,964
-I'll call you as soon as I know.
-Good.

984
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:24,403
They're still here, you know.

985
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:30,476
In the end, war is pretty weak.
It can't destroy everything.

986
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:33,761
Come on now.

987
01:38:35,528 --> 01:38:37,041
Are you okay?

988
01:38:38,688 --> 01:38:39,962
I'll call you,

989
01:38:50,448 --> 01:38:53,963
-Sorry...
-No problem. I got the keys.

990
01:39:00,528 --> 01:39:02,723
-Well?
-What?

991
01:39:07,168 --> 01:39:08,920
Isn't it nice?

992
01:39:13,288 --> 01:39:16,007
-What do you think?
-It's not bad.

993
01:39:16,168 --> 01:39:19,319
-You don't sound convinced.
-I am. It gets plenty of light.

994
01:39:24,808 --> 01:39:28,926
-I liked having you at home with us.
-Yes but...

995
01:39:29,768 --> 01:39:32,362
It's time for a home.

996
01:39:34,688 --> 01:39:36,565
Madame Fontaine?

997
01:39:56,848 --> 01:39:58,918
Let me show you something.

998
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,805
The prince drove slowly through the forest-

999
01:40:27,968 --> 01:40:30,118
His horse was quite quiet-

1000
01:40:30,288 --> 01:40:33,360
His hooves made no
sound on the moss.

1001
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:36,759
The branches weeks as a wonder... -

1002
01:40:38,568 --> 01:40:40,877
Mom. Phone.

1003
01:40:47,448 --> 01:40:49,120
Samir? Yes, go ahead.

1004
01:40:49,288 --> 01:40:51,927
The sky slowly shifted.

1005
01:40:52,408 --> 01:40:56,481
Will I come in time,
the prince asked.

1006
01:40:56,648 --> 01:41:01,676
He thought about what the magician
had said: The night is your sole enemy.

1007
01:41:01,928 --> 01:41:06,365
When they dressed her
in the world of darkness.

1008
01:41:06,528 --> 01:41:10,567
Then you no longer see the
difference between shadow and fog.

1009
01:41:10,728 --> 01:41:14,607
That difference is wolf.
Then you know it's too late.

1010
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:18,317
And your pretty girlfriend
is forever lost.

1011
01:41:18,488 --> 01:41:23,118
Hurry if you love her.
It struck the prince's heart, for he knew..

1012
01:41:28,488 --> 01:41:29,603
Well,

1013
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:34,241
He was thinking of her smooth face
in the darkness...

1014
01:41:34,408 --> 01:41:35,636
Well,

1015
01:41:37,808 --> 01:41:40,561
Are we? We are too late.

1016
01:41:42,248 --> 01:41:44,398
What is it mommy?

1017
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:45,916
It's nothing.

1018
01:41:47,368 --> 01:41:50,565
Don't worry. We'll go.

1019
01:41:52,088 --> 01:41:53,646
We'll go.

1020
01:41:56,728 --> 01:41:59,037
And what if we hadn't?

1021
01:41:59,968 --> 01:42:02,846
Do you think others
at that time counted?

1022
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,921
Do you think we made our
priorities about others?

1023
01:42:07,408 --> 01:42:10,320
You guys all had your lives.

1024
01:42:11,288 --> 01:42:14,166
You had people
that you were going to hate-

1025
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:17,679
-for the simple reason
that they existed.

1026
01:42:18,128 --> 01:42:21,040
Why didn't you tell us?

1027
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:24,359
I was there. We were there.
We could've been able to help.

1028
01:42:24,528 --> 01:42:27,679
Help? What help?
Help how?

1029
01:42:28,248 --> 01:42:31,604
What was it you were
going to do? Really?

1030
01:42:35,288 --> 01:42:40,157
When he screamed in agony?
When his limbs twisted?

1031
01:42:40,368 --> 01:42:44,646
When he choked?
When he could not?,

1032
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:48,246
What were you guys do to?!

1033
01:42:49,328 --> 01:42:51,796
What did you do?

1034
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:06,086
I'm here now.

1035
01:43:10,608 --> 01:43:12,280
And I love you.

1036
01:43:15,208 --> 01:43:16,880
I love you.

1037
01:43:19,528 --> 01:43:21,996
Tell me. Tell me,

1038
01:43:23,528 --> 01:43:24,847
Go on.

1039
01:43:26,168 --> 01:43:27,521
Tell me,

1040
01:43:41,528 --> 01:43:44,838
Say it. Tell me.

1041
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:50,600
I already knew from the start.

1042
01:43:52,688 --> 01:43:54,758
From the first signs

1043
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:59,481
I had done the studies
in the lab myself.

1044
01:44:01,728 --> 01:44:06,563
And then one night Pierre grabbed
the blade for his poem.

1045
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,960
He was so proud of it.
My little man.

1046
01:44:24,848 --> 01:44:26,804
He was so nice

1047
01:44:28,168 --> 01:44:29,965
So happy

1048
01:44:32,248 --> 01:44:35,604
And I saw the death in him.

1049
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,764
I felt it...

1050
01:44:43,128 --> 01:44:47,485
A pain so deep that my
belly and my heart shivered-

1051
01:44:47,648 --> 01:44:49,559
-and kept me cold.

1052
01:44:54,728 --> 01:44:57,117
I went away with him.

1053
01:44:58,728 --> 01:45:02,357
People said I abducted him.
I suppose I did.

1054
01:45:03,328 --> 01:45:06,126
I ran away with him.

1055
01:45:20,568 --> 01:45:23,719
One evening, we had a little party,
just the two of us.

1056
01:45:24,128 --> 01:45:26,164
It was in the Green House.

1057
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:33,559
He could barely move anymore.

1058
01:45:35,368 --> 01:45:37,438
We sang and we laughed.

1059
01:45:38,808 --> 01:45:42,005
And I read him all his favorite stories.

1060
01:45:42,568 --> 01:45:44,479
Then, I put him to bed.

1061
01:45:47,288 --> 01:45:50,564
I told him I loved him

1062
01:45:57,568 --> 01:46:01,277
I laid next to him
until the morning.

1063
01:46:12,768 --> 01:46:17,444
Afterwards, nothing seemed
important anymore. I longed for prison.

1064
01:46:21,808 --> 01:46:23,685
One way or another, I was guilty.

1065
01:46:24,368 --> 01:46:27,997
I had brought a child into the world
only to sentence him to death.

1066
01:46:29,408 --> 01:46:31,478
Anyway,
there was nothing to say.

1067
01:46:33,768 --> 01:46:38,080
Trying to explain it would
be trying to excuse it.

1068
01:46:38,728 --> 01:46:43,404
There is no excuse for death.

1069
01:46:52,648 --> 01:46:55,845
The worst prison is the
death of your child.

1070
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:00,563
There is never any release
from that prison.

1071
01:47:20,928 --> 01:47:22,919
Isn't it beautiful?

1072
01:47:26,608 --> 01:47:27,882
Yes...

1073
01:47:40,728 --> 01:47:43,003
It's Michel! Is anyone home?

1074
01:47:55,048 --> 01:47:57,687
Yes, I'm here.

1075
01:48:00,928 --> 01:48:02,566
I'm here!

1076
