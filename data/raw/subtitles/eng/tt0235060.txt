1
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:48,452
My father died suddenly.

2
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:50,787
I only found out last night.

3
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:53,452
The mayor called to tell me.

4
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:55,462
I couldn't believe it.

5
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,794
My hometown is in the mountains..

6
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,835
a village called Sanhetun

7
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:04,497
I left to work in the city..

8
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:08,030
So busy I haven't been home in years.

9
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,711
My father was
the village schoolteacher..

10
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,213
He taught there all his life.

11
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,251
I am an only child.

12
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,809
The only one from our village
who went to college.

13
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:26,589
I am very worried about my mother..

14
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,193
Come in and rest awhile.

15
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,597
I've got to get back.

16
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,102
Thank your boss again for me.

17
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,195
-Thank you.
-Good-bye.

18
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,585
Mother?

19
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,618
- Mother?
-Yusheng.

20
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,787
Mayor, Uncle Xia.

21
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:39,094
I saw the car and
Knew you were back.

22
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,759
Come in.

23
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,632
It's warmer inside.

24
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,334
Please. Sit down.

25
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:54,939
I couldn't tell you much
Over the phone.

26
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,416
Now you're here
I can explain everything.

27
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,117
It's the schoolhouse.

28
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,091
For many years your father
Has wanted to rebuild it...

29
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,253
but there were always
reasons we couldn't.

30
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:11,765
He brought it up
again recently...

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,360
and the village agreed.

32
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,769
We have the materials we need
but not enough money.

33
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,800
Your father's mind was set.
He was determined to find the money.

34
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,678
He began traveling around,
trying to borrow the money.

35
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,115
He went all over the county.

36
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:32,914
If he thought there was a chance,
he'd go after it.

37
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:36,548
On the last trip,
on his way home...

38
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:39,388
he ran into a snowstorm,
a big blizzard.

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,758
He was stuck in the storm,
and he got sick.

40
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,730
He was too sick to be moved.
That made him more anxious.

41
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,359
He was in bad shape
when he got back...

42
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,801
so we took him to the hospital.

43
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,602
They examined him,
said he had a heart problem.

44
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,733
We've known your dad
all these years.

45
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,473
Who knew he had
a heart condition?

46
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:01,742
They tried treating him,
but it was no use.

47
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,343
He fought,
but he didn't make it.

48
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,148
Where is my father now?

49
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:10,486
At the provincial hospital,
in the morgue.

50
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:13,083
That's why we wanted
you to return.

51
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,186
To tell you all this.

52
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,630
Last time I spoke with him
he seemed fine.

53
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:24,102
It was a bad storm.

54
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:29,269
At his age,
it was too much for him.

55
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:34,076
It would have been
hard on anyone.

56
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,584
The village wants
to arrange a car...

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,587
to bring your father back.

58
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,456
Bring him back here to bury him.

59
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,893
That's what we planned.

60
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,359
That's fine. Go ahead.

61
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,834
But there is a problem.

62
00:04:55,903 --> 00:05:01,170
Your mother doesn't
want to use a car.

63
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,972
She wants your father
to be carried back.

64
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:05,842
What do you mean?

65
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:11,317
She wants the coffin
brought back on foot...

66
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,821
so your father
won't forget his way home.

67
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,255
It's an old tradition,
a superstition.

68
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,953
And she wants to walk with us.

69
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,156
- So let's do it.
- We want to.

70
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:28,066
He was our village teacher.
Everyone respects him.

71
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,502
But our young people
have all left for the city.

72
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,506
They've gone away to work.

73
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:35,804
Only old people
and children are left.

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:40,439
We thought of using a tractor.

75
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,812
We could make the trip
in half a day.

76
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,944
You must help
your mother decide.

77
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:49,648
I appreciate your concern.

78
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,919
I will talk it over with her.

79
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,927
- Good.
- Where is she?

80
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:59,763
Probably at the schoolhouse.

81
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,065
She's there every day
since he died.

82
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:06,334
- She won't listen to anyone.
- She just sits there.

83
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,341
- Is she okay?.
- I think so.

84
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,377
I am only afraid--

85
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:13,174
- The old schoolhouse?
- Yes.

86
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,545
I'll go to her.

87
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:44,868
Mother.

88
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,107
It's so cold.
Let's go home, okay?.

89
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,343
Your father is dead.

90
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,521
Let's go home.

91
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,062
You will never see him again.

92
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,581
Get on the bed
where it's warm.

93
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:39,231
Bring me my loom.

94
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,565
What for?.

95
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,702
- I want to weave something.
- Weave what?

96
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:50,676
A cloth for your father's coffin.

97
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,243
Don't trouble yourself.

98
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:57,284
Why don't we go buy one instead?

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,615
I don't want to buy one.

100
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,587
That loom is so old.

101
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,321
It's been broken for years.

102
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,523
Why can't we fix it?

103
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,961
You need rest, Mother.
You must be so tired.

104
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,633
I have to make this cloth.

105
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,810
Can't I just buy one?

106
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,007
No! Just bring me the loom.

107
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:02,010
The only loom
left in the village...

108
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,018
is this one of your mother's.

109
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,054
She's guarded it like a treasure.

110
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:12,616
Looks like she's
determined to use it.

111
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:14,786
Just like the funeral procession.

112
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:19,822
Carrying the dead is an old custom.

113
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,926
Over the mountains...

114
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:26,769
across the river,
past the crossroads.

115
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,775
And we shout at him along the way.

116
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,277
What do we say?.

117
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:33,711
We tell him
this is the road home.

118
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,978
Everyone yells at him,
so that he remembers his way home.

119
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,678
It's an old tradition.

120
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,220
Is it really so difficult...

121
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:44,780
to do as my mother wishes?

122
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,350
It is a problem, yes.

123
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:50,261
We don't have the manpower.

124
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:53,357
All our young people have left.

125
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,668
No one has followed this custom...

126
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,968
since the Cultural Revolution.

127
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:17,423
I don't want her
to work like this...

128
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,289
but I don't know
how to stop her.

129
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,329
The funeral procession...

130
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,388
seems all that matters to her now.

131
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:39,180
I know about your wishes
for the funeral.

132
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,343
I know about your wishes
for the funeral.

133
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,976
Yes .

134
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:48,510
Is there some other way
to arrange it?

135
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,223
I know it won't be easy.

136
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:56,157
But your father
lived here for 40 years.

137
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:03,436
He taught many
generations of kids.

138
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:06,905
He worked very hard.
Long, long hours.

139
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:12,638
The town should give him
something back.

140
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,908
The mayor agrees with you.

141
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,916
How about this?

142
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:20,818
We can walk alongside...

143
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,015
with the coffin
pulled by a tractor.

144
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,422
We'd still be with him, right?

145
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:27,460
It's not the same.

146
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:35,194
I want your father
carried back by the men.

147
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,405
If they won't help,..

148
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,977
we'll get someone who will.

149
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,086
Please don't work anymore.

150
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:02,185
I have to.
I have to finish it.

151
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,926
You are tired.
Get some rest, okay?.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,265
You sleep in
your father's study.

153
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:12,271
I have to finish this.

154
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:15,599
This picture was taken the year
My parents married.

155
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,271
My father was not
from the village.

156
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,037
He came here to teach.

157
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,772
The story of
My parents' courtship..

158
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,440
is well known in the village.

159
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:32,952
Practically everyone here
has heard about lt.

160
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,849
My mother had just
Turned eighteen.

161
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,392
My father was twenty..

162
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,625
My mother told me
My father arrived by horse cart.

163
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,139
This is our new teacher.

164
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,180
His name is Luo,
Luo Changyu.

165
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:25,957
Is that Di?
What's all the racket for?.

166
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,228
Nothing.

167
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:33,706
Has the teacher arrived?

168
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,105
Yes .

169
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:39,407
It's about time
we got our own teacher.

170
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,371
What does he look like?

171
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,212
He's a young man.

172
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:49,779
A young teacher?.
He must be talented.

173
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,188
- Where is he staying?
- At the village council office.

174
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:59,164
That's good.
Where will he eat?

175
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:02,691
He'll eat with
a different family each day.

176
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,763
When it's our turn,
we'll have to make a good meal.

177
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:14,070
What are you doing?

178
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,978
Nothing.

179
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,782
Seeing a teacher
has you changing clothes?

180
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,663
My grandmother
was already blind by then.

181
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,323
Mother says when
Grandfather died...

182
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,165
Grandmother cried
Until she went blind

183
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,440
After Grandfather died...

184
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,635
there was only Mother
to look after Grandmother..

185
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,441
Grandmother's only wish
was to find a good husband for Mother.

186
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,812
She had many proposals...

187
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,113
but my mother
didn't like any of them.

188
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,751
The schoolhouse was not yet built
when my father arrived

189
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:05,320
The mayor enlisted
all the men's help

190
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,561
According to our village custom ...

191
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:12,127
a red cloth must be hung
in a new building.

192
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,934
It's hung on the ceiling beam
For good luck.

193
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,237
The cloth is called
the lucky red banner.

194
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,802
It must be woven by the village 's
Most beautiful maiden

195
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,010
This task, of course,
fell to my mother..

196
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,551
Perhaps she was already
a little in love...

197
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,955
because the cloth she made
was especially fine.

198
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,269
The village had
two wells back then.

199
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:45,430
The old well was
Called the "front well. "

200
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,439
The newer well was
Called the "back well. "

201
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:52,945
The new well was nearer the village,
so more people used that one.

202
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,311
After my father arrived...

203
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,010
Mother started
to use the old well.

204
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:00,576
She had to pass
The schoolhouse to get to it.

205
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,277
The village had another custom.

206
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,279
When putting up a new building...

207
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,511
each family prepared a dish
for the workers' lunch.

208
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,609
Everyone contributed.

209
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,884
Mother prepared
all her best dishes...

210
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,517
hoping Father
would eat what she made.

211
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:38,246
Back  when
something was built...

212
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:42,186
women were not
allowed to participate.

213
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:45,247
Superstition said.
they would bring bad luck.

214
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:49,227
When they put up the school,
the village women could only watch...

215
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,264
from a distance.

216
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,023
- What did you make today?.
- Steamed bread.

217
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,858
- What about you, Di?
- I made onion cakes.

218
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,058
I brought rice
steamed in lotus leaves.

219
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:29,193
Onion cakes are better.

220
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,430
Did you save some
For your boyfriend?

221
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:33,439
Shut up!

222
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:36,399
Look at them.

223
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,639
They just pick up the first dish
they see. They don't know who made what.

224
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:41,374
I don't know who's eating mine.

225
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,643
Must be your husband!

226
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,956
Put them here.

227
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,615
You're already done
with the banner?.

228
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,211
I was going to come get it from you.
Give it to me.

229
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:55,311
Okay.

230
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:58,016
You'll save me a further trip,

231
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:02,088
This is a beautiful banner.

232
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:04,790
The school is almost finished.

233
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,493
Chinese study will be
the first lesson.

234
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:13,699
- Is the teacher happy with the food?
- Yes .

235
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:16,469
- Does he eat what we make?
- Yes .

236
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,137
- He eats together with you?
- No.

237
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,180
He's a city gentleman.

238
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,182
It's not proper for him
to eat with us.

239
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,047
So, how does it work?

240
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:29,418
We give him first pick
Of the dishes.

241
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:03,113
" In life--" Follow me.

242
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,208
" In life--"

243
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,776
"You must make goals."

244
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:11,156
Start from the beginning.

245
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:16,722
"One must learn to write."

246
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:20,960
"One must learn to write."

247
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:24,492
"One must learn arithmetic."

248
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:28,769
"One must learn arithmetic."

249
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,835
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

250
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:37,178
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

251
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,209
" Know the present, know the past."

252
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,984
" Know the present, know the past."

253
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:46,992
When I was young,
My mother told me...

254
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,291
my father had a beautiful voice.

255
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:54,197
My mother never learned to write,
was never interested in school.

256
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:57,828
But she couldn't resist the sound
Of my father's voice.

257
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:02,807
She went by the school
everyday after that.

258
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,539
For most, the novelty of the new school
wore off after a while...

259
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,672
but not for my mother..

260
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,410
For 40 years,
she came to listen...

261
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:14,419
and it became part of her life.

262
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,155
" Know respect for your elders."

263
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:24,060
" Know respect for your elders."

264
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:42,206
Each day after school...

265
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:44,978
my father walked
some of his students home.

266
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:49,613
Knowing this,
My mother waited along the way.

267
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,484
The birds sing
with the beautiful sun

268
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:28,550
Their songs wake
the beautiful flowers

269
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,371
Hey!

270
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,435
- Who is she?
- That's Zhao Di.

271
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:40,665
Is she from Sanhetun?

272
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,469
Yes .

273
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:46,808
Di, the teacher
is asking about you!

274
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,812
- You need water?.
- Yes .

275
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,982
- Let me get it for you.
- No, that's okay.

276
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,856
- Let me do it.
- I can do it. Thanks.

277
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:44,863
No, let me. Let me help you!

278
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:47,957
You're the teacher.
You shouldn't bother.

279
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:51,026
- Let me do it.
- No, no.

280
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:52,536
Come on.

281
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,984
Di, you're fetching
water as well?

282
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,228
Tomorrow it's our turn
to have you over.

283
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:25,736
I know.

284
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,884
My father told me...

285
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:49,682
the first time
he went to my mothers house...

286
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,780
she stood in the doorway.

287
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:55,922
Leaning against the doorframe...

288
00:35:55,995 --> 00:35:58,293
she looked like
a figure in a painting...

289
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,356
an image he would never forget.

290
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:11,868
- Is the teacher here?
- Yes .

291
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:14,572
Your heavy footsteps
gave you away.

292
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,877
Come in. Come here.

293
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:20,217
My mother's eyesight
is not good.

294
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,316
This teacher is very tall.

295
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,324
Sit down.

296
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:16,338
Can't think when we last
had a man home for dinner.

297
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,706
The food must taste good to you.

298
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,474
You sound like you're enjoying it.

299
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,746
How long have you been here?

300
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:27,615
About a month.

301
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:29,551
Have you gotten used to it?

302
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,955
- It's okay.
- That's good.

303
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:37,018
- You're from the city?.
- Yes, from East Gate.

304
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:39,064
How did you choose Sanhetun?

305
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,962
After graduation,
I couldn't find work.

306
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,900
One day in the street
a man was signing people up,

307
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,960
I didn't know what for,
but I signed up anyway.

308
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,972
And I ended up here.

309
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,270
- Do you regret it?
- No.

310
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,333
Why?.

311
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,345
I like it here.

312
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:59,149
Are you married?

313
00:37:59,218 --> 00:38:00,651
No.

314
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,448
Are you engaged?

315
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,284
No.

316
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:14,232
Di will do it.
Sit for a while.

317
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,572
Do you remember this bowl?

318
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:32,583
This design?

319
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:35,678
No, I don't remember.

320
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:38,018
Did you eat the food
brought to the site?

321
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,557
Yes .

322
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,856
Looks like Di's hard work
was wasted.

323
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:46,056
You know...

324
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:48,292
when you were
building the school...

325
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,335
she made all her best dishes.

326
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,734
She always used that bowl...

327
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:55,330
hoping you would choose her dish.

328
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:58,137
Even I wasn't allowed to help,

329
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:02,372
I remember now.

330
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,677
You do?

331
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,980
The bowl and your cooking
are familiar.

332
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:09,520
- So you ate from it before?
- Yes .

333
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:12,216
You did? What did you eat?

334
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:20,256
On the first day
I made onion cakes.

335
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:23,165
On the second,
scrambled eggs and onions on rice.

336
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,499
On the third day,
mushroom dumplings.

337
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,631
What a shame.
Three delicious meals.

338
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:30,732
And I love mushroom dumplings.

339
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:32,834
I'll make you some
this afternoon.

340
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:35,905
- That is too much to ask.
- No.

341
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:39,314
You've hardly finished lunch,
and you're planning the next meal.

342
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:42,752
Di, show the teacher out.
He must be very busy.

343
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,187
Yes, I should go.

344
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,801
That red jacket of yours
is pretty on you.

345
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:05,707
I remember it
from the day I arrived.

346
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,576
Don't forget to come back
for dumplings.

347
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,719
You shouldn't make the dumplings.

348
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,389
- Why not?
- You may regret it.

349
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:28,998
- Why?.
- You don't understand.

350
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,263
This teacher is a nice man...

351
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:33,965
but he's out of our class.

352
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,701
What are you talking about?
It's only dumplings.

353
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:38,743
Don't play dumb.

354
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm just being honest.

355
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:43,274
You'd best forget about him.

356
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:10,433
I will not go back!

357
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,103
You've got no choice!.

358
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:56,040
I came to say good-bye.

359
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,676
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city.

360
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:03,243
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

361
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:08,521
I saw you argue with someone.
Was that what it was about?

362
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:10,926
Who was he?
Why do you have to go back?

363
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:14,363
It's no big deal. They just want
to ask me some questions. That's all.

364
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:17,732
- Can't they ask you questions here?
- He says it's not up to him.

365
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:24,241
Will you come back?

366
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:27,574
Of course!
I have classes to teach.

367
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,341
When will you be back?

368
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:32,577
By the 27th at the latest.

369
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,415
On the 28th the school holiday starts.
I have to be back before that.

370
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,791
- Come in and eat something.
- I can't.

371
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:46,695
I have things to do before I go.

372
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:51,229
I really do.
That man is waiting for me.

373
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:53,294
Tell him to come too.

374
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,533
You have to eat in any case.

375
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:02,279
Okay, I'll be back.

376
00:44:03,782 --> 00:44:05,374
I'll wait for you.

377
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,680
This is for you.

378
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:12,383
To go with your red jacket.

379
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,101
I'll be waiting.

380
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,418
What is going on?
No more class?

381
00:44:40,485 --> 00:44:43,147
- He's in some political trouble.
- Political trouble?

382
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,349
I don't understand it either.
But maybe it's nothing.

383
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:47,392
said he might be back
in a day or two.

384
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:11,482
The teacher's left.

385
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,887
- The teacher's left?
- Yes .

386
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:22,791
-Just left?
-Just left with the mayor.

387
00:49:57,135 --> 00:50:00,263
My mother retraced her steps
everyday...

388
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:03,102
searching back and forth.

389
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:06,200
She had to find the clip
My father had given her.

390
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:57,955
Pottery repairs!

391
00:51:58,023 --> 00:52:00,514
Please come in.

392
00:53:33,651 --> 00:53:35,619
I charge for the nails I use.

393
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:38,281
This will cost you
more than buying a new bowl.

394
00:53:38,356 --> 00:53:42,156
Just tell me how much
and I'll pay you.

395
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:44,195
Is it a family heirloom?

396
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,321
No.

397
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:48,524
It belonged to someone special?

398
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,296
You could say that.

399
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:52,859
Who?

400
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:57,635
It's for my daughter.

401
00:53:57,709 --> 00:54:01,873
The man who used it left...

402
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:05,279
and took my daughter's heart
with him.

403
00:54:06,684 --> 00:54:10,620
I've put it back together again.

404
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:13,316
I hope she'll be happy.

405
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:25,326
Pottery repairs!

406
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:53,495
Di, what are you doing?

407
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:57,399
Nothing. Just getting
a drink of water.

408
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,618
1 times 8 equals 8.

409
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,778
1 times 9 equals 9.

410
00:55:52,323 --> 00:55:54,553
2 times 2 equals 4.

411
00:55:54,626 --> 00:55:56,924
2 times 3 equals 6.

412
00:55:56,995 --> 00:55:59,190
2 times 4 equals 8.

413
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:01,232
2 times 5 equals 10.

414
00:56:01,299 --> 00:56:04,462
2 times 6 equals 12.

415
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:07,436
2 times 7 equals 14.

416
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:10,030
2 times 8 equals 16.

417
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:12,736
2 times 9 equals 18.

418
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,005
Good.

419
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,980
3 times 3 equals 9.

420
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,484
3 times 4 equals 12.

421
00:56:21,552 --> 00:56:24,248
3 times 5 equals 15.

422
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:26,916
3 times 6 equals 18.

423
00:56:26,991 --> 00:56:29,619
3 times 7 equals 21 .

424
00:56:29,694 --> 00:56:32,788
3 times 8 equals 24.

425
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:35,059
3 times 9 equals 27.

426
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:33,357
My father told my mother...

427
00:57:33,424 --> 00:57:35,358
when he was teaching the kids..

428
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:37,951
he could always look up
and see the red banner.

429
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:39,963
When he saw that banner...

430
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:42,465
it reminded him of Mother
and her red jacket.

431
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:45,292
The mayor kept insisting...

432
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,361
that the ceiling
needed proper insulation..

433
00:57:47,438 --> 00:57:49,668
but my father never let him.

434
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:54,371
That's why the school ceiling
was never completed.

435
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,293
Mother sat in the classroom
For hours that day.

436
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:59,029
The door was open,
And the mayor saw her there.

437
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,266
He understood what that meant.

438
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,274
Once he knew w...

439
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:06,936
the news got round
the village quickly.

440
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:09,036
Back then, arranged matches
were the rule.

441
01:00:09,113 --> 01:00:12,082
The freedom of falling in love
was unfamiliar.

442
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,744
This was a first for our village.

443
01:00:25,463 --> 01:00:28,660
On the day my father
Promised to return..

444
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:31,930
my mother was waiting
from first light.

445
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,870
She remembered his promise...

446
01:00:34,939 --> 01:00:37,169
that he would return on the 27th

447
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,233
School vacation
began on the 28th.

448
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:43,144
He had to be back before that.

449
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:08,820
It's so cold out. Where have you been?
Gone all day. Get warm on the bed.

450
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:22,495
You're burning up!

451
01:03:55,339 --> 01:03:58,035
I know you went
to wait for the teacher.

452
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:01,101
Everyone says he's in trouble
and won't be back.

453
01:04:01,178 --> 01:04:03,237
You've got to let go.

454
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,411
I'm going to the city
to find him.

455
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:11,944
Are you crazy?. You're ill!

456
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,890
Di! Come back!

457
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:58,960
My mother didn't make it
to the city..

458
01:04:59,036 --> 01:05:01,300
She fainted by the road.

459
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:05,399
Someone saw her,
And they got word to the mayor.

460
01:05:05,476 --> 01:05:09,344
The mayor and my uncle
Brought her home on a cart.

461
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:15,884
The mayor said that day
my mother's hands were like ice.

462
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,616
While on the cart,
they wrapped her in a heavy blanket...

463
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:22,090
but they couldn't
get her hands warm.

464
01:05:27,865 --> 01:05:29,799
I don't think it's too serious.

465
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:33,997
It's a bad chill,
but she is strong.

466
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:41,734
Mayor, is the teacher coming back?

467
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,246
I don't know the answer.

468
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,185
He should have been back by now.

469
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,258
Maybe someone can write to him.

470
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,851
I don't know how to help her...

471
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:02,524
if he doesn't come back.

472
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:18,404
"Spring is here."

473
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:20,848
" It melts the snow."

474
01:06:23,787 --> 01:06:27,553
"The grass turns green."

475
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:32,653
"The farmers sow."

476
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:36,530
"The ox plow the field."

477
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,661
"The wild geese return."

478
01:06:40,738 --> 01:06:44,469
"The frogs begin to hop,"

479
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,533
Di, you're awake.

480
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,544
You've been sleeping
for two. days.

481
01:06:48,612 --> 01:06:52,412
Di, the teacher is back.

482
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:55,819
He came back yesterday.

483
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,945
He came straight here.

484
01:06:58,022 --> 01:07:00,252
He sat with you for a long time.

485
01:07:00,324 --> 01:07:04,590
Isn't it good news?

486
01:07:04,662 --> 01:07:07,028
He came back for you.

487
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:10,828
" Full of energy. "

488
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,166
"Our spirit comes alive."

489
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:18,971
"Our spirit comes alive."

490
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:23,571
" It carries our wishes."

491
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:29,210
" Full of hope."

492
01:07:29,286 --> 01:07:32,619
"Spring is here."

493
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:38,287
" It melts the snow."

494
01:07:38,362 --> 01:07:42,594
"The grass turns green."

495
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:46,966
"The farmers sow."

496
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:51,201
"The ox plow the field."

497
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:55,609
"The wild geese return."

498
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:01,481
"The frogs begin to hop,"

499
01:08:01,552 --> 01:08:04,282
"Swallows start to sing."

500
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:15,026
"Spring is the season to sow."

501
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:19,763
"All starts to grow again."

502
01:08:21,005 --> 01:08:23,530
"The world is full of life again."

503
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:25,234
Mr. Luo!

504
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,335
Mr. Luo, Di is here to see you!

505
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:31,574
Sir!.

506
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,879
Di is here!.

507
01:08:37,921 --> 01:08:41,880
That evening,
My father had to leave again.

508
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:47,090
When he heard about my mother,
he left the city. without permission

509
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:51,430
He couldn't stand it any longer,,
so he sneaked back.

510
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,800
For this. disobedience...

511
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:58,103
my parents were kept apart
for another two years.

512
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:01,875
Someone told me...

513
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:09,847
my mother put on her red jacket,
my father's favorite...

514
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,684
and stood by the road
to wait for him.

515
01:09:12,756 --> 01:09:17,090
From that day on,
My father never left my mother again.

516
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:38,038
This is the story
Of my father and my mother..

517
01:09:38,115 --> 01:09:41,744
This road is part
Of their love story...

518
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,457
this. Road that leads
from the city. to our village.

519
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:50,493
Maybe because of the hope
It held for her...

520
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:54,258
as she waited for
my father to return..

521
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:58,097
she wants to walk this. way
with him one last time.

522
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:03,338
Mr. Mayor?.

523
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,035
- Who is it?
- It's me, Yusheng.

524
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:14,840
- You need to see me?
- Yes .

525
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:18,547
Come in. Come in.
It's cold out there.

526
01:10:18,622 --> 01:10:20,852
How can I help you?

527
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:24,553
I've thought it through.

528
01:10:24,628 --> 01:10:27,426
- I want to do as my mother wishes.
- To carry him back?

529
01:10:27,498 --> 01:10:30,467
It's still a problem though.

530
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,502
The problem is
not enough men, right?

531
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:36,300
How about this?
We'll hire men from the next village.

532
01:10:37,407 --> 01:10:39,500
That's a good idea.

533
01:10:40,878 --> 01:10:42,869
But how do we pay them?

534
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:46,040
Just tell me how many men we need.

535
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:51,084
For a short distance, only ten...

536
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:53,248
but this is a long trip,

537
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:56,417
I think we need about 16.

538
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:59,621
We will need two. shifts.
That's 32 men.

539
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:03,188
And we'll need others
to carry chairs...

540
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:07,033
so people can rest along the way.

541
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:11,040
That comes to about 35, 36 men.

542
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:13,542
How much per person?

543
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:18,411
100 yuan each should do.
That will do.

544
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,280
35, 36 people.

545
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:24,252
How much in total?

546
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:28,451
That's 3,500 or 3,600 yuan.

547
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:32,791
We need to buy cigarettes.

548
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:37,391
And wine too.
Got to ward off the cold.

549
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:41,426
We'll also want a little extra
for emergency use.

550
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:47,137
Altogether, around 4,000 yuan.

551
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:58,143
Here's 5,000 yuan.
Is that enough?

552
01:11:58,222 --> 01:12:00,156
It's more than enough.

553
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:49,739
Mrs. Luo, come and see Mr. Luo.

554
01:12:49,806 --> 01:12:51,740
Please don't cry.

555
01:12:51,808 --> 01:12:54,504
Don't let tears fall on him.

556
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:08,717
Mr. Luo, we are
going back to the village.

557
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:13,423
That day over 100 people
came to the ceremony.

558
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:17,297
The mayor told me
they were my father's students.

559
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:22,168
They heard about his death,
And they all came back.

560
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,504
Many came from other towns.

561
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,738
Some drove from the city..

562
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:33,010
The mayor said some came
from as far as Guangzhou.

563
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:37,747
Some tried but didn't make it in time
because of the snowstorm.

564
01:13:38,889 --> 01:13:41,449
I didn't recognize many of them.

565
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:43,686
Many were older than me.

566
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,820
I don't know when
My father taught them.

567
01:13:46,897 --> 01:13:49,889
I didn't know
how to address them.

568
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,835
Anyway, as the mayor said,
They are all my father's students.

569
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:59,335
Take this money back.

570
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:01,775
Why?. Didn't you pay the men?

571
01:14:01,845 --> 01:14:07,306
They won't take it, not even the ones
we hired. No one wants the money.

572
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:09,545
Take it back.

573
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:51,580
At my mother's request...

574
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,947
my father was buried
next to the old well.

575
01:16:55,018 --> 01:16:58,476
The village has running water now,
so no one needs a well.

576
01:16:58,555 --> 01:17:00,989
No one draws water from it now.

577
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:06,017
My mother says from this. hill
My father can look down on the school..

578
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:09,998
She asks to be buried next to him
when the time comes.

579
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:19,442
After my father's funeral,
the mayor came...

580
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:21,342
After my father's funeral,
the mayor came...

581
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:25,006
to talk about
rebuilding the school.

582
01:17:25,081 --> 01:17:27,709
The city has granted funds..

583
01:17:27,784 --> 01:17:30,548
and the village families
have donated money.

584
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,249
He says we must fulfill
My father's wishes.

585
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:38,192
Your money. Give it to me.

586
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:49,030
Mayor, we've saved
over the years.

587
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:53,306
Take it to rebuild the school.

588
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:57,244
I can't take it.

589
01:17:57,314 --> 01:18:01,011
With my husband gone,
you have to take it.

590
01:18:01,084 --> 01:18:03,746
All right. I'll take it then.

591
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,517
You are the first
but surely not the last to help,

592
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:10,958
I am leaving tomorrow.

593
01:18:11,027 --> 01:18:13,860
Mother has asked me to go
to the schoolhouse one last time.

594
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:17,889
My mother says
the next time I come back...

595
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:21,369
the school we know will be gone.

596
01:18:22,505 --> 01:18:26,703
Your father helped
build this school.

597
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,975
He taught here so many years.

598
01:18:32,048 --> 01:18:36,246
Spent as much time
here as at home.

599
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,691
Changyu, can you hear me?

600
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:46,161
The mayor will
rebuild the school.

601
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:52,657
They'll build a tall...

602
01:18:52,736 --> 01:18:57,332
and wonderful school...

603
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:03,674
Just as you wished.

604
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:08,047
They will start
building next spring.

605
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:12,316
You won't have
to worry anymore.

606
01:19:12,389 --> 01:19:15,552
When the school is completed...

607
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,891
I will hang
a lucky red banner there.

608
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:28,803
You can rest easy now.

609
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:40,672
You know, your father
was a sincere man.

610
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:45,449
He always wanted you
to become a teacher...

611
01:19:45,522 --> 01:19:48,320
to take over for him.

612
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:53,385
You went to
the teachers' college...

613
01:19:53,463 --> 01:19:55,761
but you never taught
a day of class.

614
01:19:55,832 --> 01:20:00,633
If you could teach
for one day...

615
01:20:00,704 --> 01:20:05,801
I think it would
make him happy.

616
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:12,842
Then you can go back
to your life.

617
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:20,016
Look, there's no teacher now...

618
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:25,921
no sound of children
reciting their lessons.

619
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:30,864
The mayor said a new teacher
was on the way.

620
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:36,303
Not many teachers...

621
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:41,640
would sound as good
as your father.

622
01:20:43,346 --> 01:20:46,144
After 40 years
I still love that voice.

623
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,948
I can still hear it.

624
01:20:54,491 --> 01:20:57,016
Mother, I've been thinking.

625
01:20:57,093 --> 01:20:59,926
Why don't you come
to the city with me?

626
01:21:00,997 --> 01:21:03,591
No, thank you.

627
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:06,931
I won't leave your father.

628
01:21:07,003 --> 01:21:11,269
How can I leave you here alone?

629
01:21:12,942 --> 01:21:14,967
Don't worry about me.

630
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:17,604
I can take care of myself.

631
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,342
Are you doing
all right in the city?.

632
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,649
Yes. Don't worry about me.

633
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:26,848
Do you have a girlfriend?

634
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,586
Let's not talk about it.

635
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:34,027
You're not young anymore.

636
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:36,361
Don't be so picky.

637
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:39,935
Listen to me.

638
01:21:40,003 --> 01:21:43,996
Find yourself a nice girl...

639
01:21:44,073 --> 01:21:47,406
and bring her home to meet me.

640
01:21:52,048 --> 01:21:56,781
Your father's gone.

641
01:21:56,853 --> 01:22:00,380
He used to worry about you.

642
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:07,586
Our children must leave home.

643
01:22:08,998 --> 01:22:13,458
We can't keep you here forever.

644
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:20,739
As parents...

645
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,904
we let you go...

646
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,448
but we never stopped worrying.

647
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:30,345
Your father...

648
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:35,483
missed you so.

649
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:45,132
Please don't cry.

650
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:49,467
With your father gone,
it's hard not to feel lonely.

651
01:22:54,544 --> 01:22:56,478
I know.

652
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:05,578
You must work hard
and make a good life.

653
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:49,589
"One must learn to read and write."

654
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:53,864
"One must learn to read and write."

655
01:23:53,937 --> 01:23:58,237
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

656
01:23:58,308 --> 01:24:02,472
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

657
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:06,606
" Know the present, know the past."

658
01:24:06,683 --> 01:24:10,915
" Know the present, know the past."

659
01:24:10,987 --> 01:24:15,287
"Spring, summer, fall, winter.
Four seasons in a year. "

660
01:24:15,358 --> 01:24:19,226
"Spring, summer, fall, winter.
Four seasons in a year. "

661
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:23,629
" East, west, south, north."

662
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:27,568
" East, west, south, north."

663
01:24:27,637 --> 01:24:32,006
" I n everything there is a purpose."

664
01:24:32,075 --> 01:24:35,943
" I n everything there is a purpose."

665
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:39,448
I gathered the students
early that morning.

666
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:42,279
I told them I would teach them
For one day.

667
01:24:42,352 --> 01:24:44,320
The mayor asked me why.

668
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:48,517
I said it was for my mother
And for my father too.

669
01:24:48,591 --> 01:24:51,287
I stood in my father's place...

670
01:24:51,361 --> 01:24:54,558
where he stood for so many years.

671
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:59,659
I felt sure he could hear my voice
And those of the students.

672
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:05,904
The book lam using
is the same one he used that first day.

673
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:08,500
It is not a textbook.

674
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:11,547
It is a book he wrote himself..

675
01:25:11,614 --> 01:25:15,243
"One must learn to read and write."

676
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:18,651
"One must learn to read and write."

677
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:22,020
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

678
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:26,289
" Keep a journal faithfully. "

679
01:25:26,362 --> 01:25:30,230
" Know the present, know the past."

680
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:34,167
" Know the present, know the past."

681
01:25:34,237 --> 01:25:37,729
"Spring, summer, fall, winter.
Four seasons in a year. "

682
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:42,210
"Spring, summer, fall, winter.
Four seasons in a year. "

683
01:25:42,278 --> 01:25:46,214
" East, west, south, north."

684
01:25:46,282 --> 01:25:50,150
" East, west, south, north."

685
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:54,315
" I n everything there is a purpose."

686
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:58,520
" I n everything there is a purpose."

687
01:25:58,594 --> 01:26:02,223
" Know respect for your elders."

688
01:26:02,298 --> 01:26:06,359
" Know respect for your elders."
