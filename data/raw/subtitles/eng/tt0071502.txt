1
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:11,199
ARABIAN NIGHTS

2
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:00,141
<i>“Truth lies not in one dream, but many.”
- The Arab/an Nights</i>

3
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:08,778
Who'll open bidding for this slave,
the Lady of the Moons?

4
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:12,574
No woman here
gives better massages.

5
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,578
Her scalp massages
will make you sleep like a baby.

6
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:20,457
Her leg massages
will make you skip like a deer.

7
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,084
As the poet says:

8
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,463
“A masseuse is worth
more than all wise men.

9
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:30,258
In her hands she holds
the heads of kings.”

10
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,261
- Five hundred dinars.
- Six hundred.

11
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,597
Seven hundred.

12
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,641
Hear that, Lady of the Moons?

13
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,643
Seven hundred dinars!

14
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,811
Will you have him as your master?

15
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:44,773
I certainly do not want
that monkey-beard!

16
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,442
<i>I'll take her. Eight hundred!</i>

17
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:51,947
You can't be any good
if God only gave you one eye.

18
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,074
How dare you, you rude girl!

19
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,118
Cursed vendor, what have you
brought to this market?

20
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,329
You're right, but it's not my doing.

21
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,457
Her master has allowed her
to choose her buyer.

22
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,833
One thousand!

23
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,670
A kingly sum!
What are you waiting for?

24
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,671
Will you take this old man
as your master, Zumurrud?

25
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,053
You have a soft candle
in your pants.

26
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:17,138
It rises when you sleep,

27
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,140
and sleeps when you rise.

28
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:21,643
God pity whoever lies with you!

29
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:22,894
Auctioneer...

30
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:27,274
how dare you bring
a slave here who ridicules us

31
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,734
so brazenly with her stupid

32
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,487
and irreverent remarks!

33
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:37,488
I beg your forgiveness.

34
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:42,080
<i>I'll be sold to no one</i>

35
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,082
but that boy there.

36
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,711
Me?

37
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,422
That pip-squeak doesn't have a dinar!

38
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,842
- Are you sure?
- He alone will be my master.

39
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:57,012
His cheeks are smooth,
and his beauty enchants the eye.

40
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,931
Step forward, young man,
and buy this slave,

41
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,976
for she's chosen you.

42
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:07,977
Come forward.
What are you waiting for?

43
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,110
Come.

44
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:24,702
Lead me by the hand
to the next alley.

45
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,378
Take this money.

46
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,131
- Then what?
- Give the seller a thousand dinars,

47
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:38,132
then rent a house
in the carpenters' district.

48
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:20,071
Not there, silly. Not like that.

49
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:25,072
I don't know how.
You have to help me.

50
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,636
Stop gambling, Barsum,

51
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,805
and come here.

52
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:50,806
Come, I say! Quick!

53
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,541
Nur ed Din, wake up.
Come here.

54
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:18,542
What is it, my love?

55
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:26,383
Did you stay up all night
making that?

56
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,390
Look.

57
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,319
Run to the market
and sell this cloth

58
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,112
for 200 dinars.

59
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,406
But listen very carefully.

60
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,160
Don't sell it to a blue-eyed man.

61
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,956
Not at any price. Understand?

62
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:56,626
I fear that something
is going to part us.

63
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,337
I feel feverish,
like there's a shadow over my heart.

64
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:04,338
Don't worry. I'm here.

65
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,355
Look, sir.

66
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,899
Isn't this beautiful?

67
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,862
Clearly made by expert hands.
Who made that?

68
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,030
My slave girl embroiders for me.

69
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:27,532
<i>I'll buy her.</i>

70
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,785
Could I sell the soul from my body?

71
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:33,454
I'm jesting. Please take it

72
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,248
for 200 dinars.

73
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:40,249
<i>I'll pay 1,000.</i>

74
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:45,049
No, I was forbidden
to sell it to a blue-eyed man.

75
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,968
It's a handsome offer.

76
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:51,139
You're a fool
if you don't take it, my boy.

77
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Very well, but stay away from me.

78
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,966
Christian, why do you follow me?

79
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,219
I ask only for something to eat.
My belly's empty.

80
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,639
I have nothing. Go with God.

81
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,933
Who won't feed a guest

82
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:39,934
is an ingrate in God's eyes.

83
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,081
What is it?

84
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,458
What are you reading?

85
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:05,459
Listen...

86
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:52,218
My eyes saw her,
to my great misfortune.

87
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:57,219
What agony it was
to leave her there.

88
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,024
Poets of my court...

89
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,360
let's see if it's true
that poets can speak

90
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,487
even of what they haven't seen.

91
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,574
Compose a poem
beginning with these words:

92
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:17,285
“My eyes saw her,
to my great misfortune.

93
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:20,246
What agony it was
to leave her there.”

94
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,622
Sium.

95
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,667
“My eyes saw her,
to my great misfortune.

96
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,211
What agony it was
to leave her there,

97
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:31,549
that gazelle who captured my heart
'neath the shade of two palms.

98
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,260
Over her body she poured water
from a silver vase.

99
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,263
She saw me
and hid her love mound,

100
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,599
but it peered out
from between her fingers.

101
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Ah, to lie with her
for an hour or two!”

102
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,068
<i>"I said to two youths,
'/ love you.'</i>

103
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,737
<i>Have you any money?'
they replied.</i>

104
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:55,740
<i>' Yes, ' I answered
'and I spend it generously. '</i>

105
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,493
which those fine lads exclaimed.

106
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:01,662
<i>It's a deal. </i>

107
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,663
<i>Look there!
Who ere those three boys ?</i>

108
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,944
You boys!
May I read some verses to you?

109
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:36,364
I wrote them long ago,
when I was almost

110
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:39,700
as young as you.

111
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,370
“A man hoary with age,
but with youthful desires,

112
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:45,081
loves handsome young men
and delights in distraction.

113
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:50,082
He arises in the morning
in the spirit of Mosul -

114
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,547
oh, city of purity -

115
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:57,548
but dreams all day
of the sinful life of Aleppo.”

116
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:00,680
And now I'd like
to propose something.

117
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:03,349
- We're listening.
- Tell us.

118
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,228
Come to my house,
where we always enjoy nice things:

119
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:09,230
fine wine

120
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:12,567
brought by the brothers
of the monastery...

121
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:15,695
lamb, and all manner of fowl.

122
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,030
Let us eat and drink,

123
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,659
and then you'll take pleasure
with each other,

124
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,996
and, if you wish,
all three will pleasure me.

125
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:27,081
All right.

126
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:32,082
Come.

127
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,676
<i>"The greatest joy
is that of a young reveler</i>

128
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:41,095
<i>with handsome boys
for company.</i>

129
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,930
<i>One sings for him,</i>

130
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,641
one drinks to his health,

131
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:50,642
and the other offers
his mouth to be kissed.”

132
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:55,026
Sium, compose a poem
about each of us.

133
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,777
“L would give my life

134
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,030
for the tenderness of this cheek,

135
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:01,949
for it's worth more than any sum.”

136
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,162
“Blessed be he who created
these smooth hairless cheeks

137
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:11,163
and gave this skin
such a beautiful hue.”

138
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:19,383
“While my soul remains
in this tranquil village,

139
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,552
my heart is torn
between two desires:

140
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:25,848
one, for the minaret of Baghdad,

141
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:30,849
the other for the land
of the two mosques.”

142
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,732
- What is your name?
- Berhane.

143
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,443
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

144
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:23,364
- Are you married?
- No, and I plan never to marry.

145
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:25,866
Why? Have women hurt you?

146
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,369
No, but books say
they're treacherous.

147
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,163
“Heaven on earth
is to be found at their breasts,

148
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,958
and the moon shines
above their mound of love.”

149
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,919
That too is written in books, my boy.

150
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,132
But it's in their nature to betray men,
whether near or far.

151
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:44,885
They paint their eyes and nails
and braid their hair

152
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:47,305
and cause you nothing but woe.

153
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:50,891
I have a proposition:
Will you come to my palace?

154
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:55,892
Certainly, my lord. Thank you.

155
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,092
- What is your name?
- Giana.

156
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,262
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

157
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:33,263
- Would you like to come with me?
- Gladly.

158
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:01,212
Come, let's go.

159
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,631
You'll lose your bet, Zeudi.

160
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:06,634
Your girl is a pot of piss

161
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,969
compared to my branch of myrrh.

162
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,514
No point arguing which is fairest.

163
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,683
We've lulled them to sleep
with different potions

164
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,269
so they'll wake at different hours,
have we not?

165
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,270
They'll judge for themselves.
You and I will never agree.

166
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:30,987
She's far fairer than him.
Just look at her.

167
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:40,334
I believe you're mistaken.
He is the fairest.

168
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:43,504
Love will decide.

169
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,464
We'll wake them,

170
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,634
and the one who falls in love
with the other is the less beautiful,

171
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:52,805
for the plain always fall in love
with the beautiful.

172
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:57,806
Very well.
We'll let love decide.

173
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:36,219
What God wills, happens.
What he doesn't, doesn't.

174
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:02,763
Neither of us won.

175
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:06,100
Each has fallen for the other
in equal measure.

176
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:08,560
Each is the mirror of the other.

177
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:13,561
Two full moons in the same sky.

178
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:20,276
- How did you get in?
- Gate or courtyard - it's all the same.

179
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:25,804
You recognize me, Zumurrud?

180
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:28,724
You dared say
my member never grew firm.

181
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:30,642
Now you'll receive

182
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:35,643
your just punishment.

183
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,612
God will punish you for this!

184
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:46,613
Nur ed Din!

185
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:55,413
Zumurrud!

186
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:07,717
Blood of my blood!
Zumurrud!

187
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:16,021
Zumurrud, where are you?

188
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:21,022
Where are you?

189
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:57,104
What's your name, handsome lad,
and why are you crying?

190
00:24:57,105 --> 00:24:59,356
What's happened?

191
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:00,941
I've lost my slave.

192
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:03,443
I paid a thousand dinars for her.

193
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:05,821
A blue-eyed Christian stole her

194
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:07,281
from my house.

195
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:09,283
<i>I'll die without her!</i>

196
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:11,285
Don't cry.

197
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,120
<i>I'll find your Zumurrud,</i>

198
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:17,541
even if I must search every house
in the guise of a holy woman.

199
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:22,542
Thank you.

200
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:42,816
Nur ed Din!

201
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:47,817
I have good news for you!
Cheer up!

202
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:59,541
Nur ed Din, I found your slave.

203
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:03,420
In Rashid's house, just as I thought.
I managed to speak to her.

204
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:07,466
She'll wait for you tonight
by the garden wall.

205
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:10,594
She'll whistle,
you'll help her down,

206
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:12,638
and off you'll go together.

207
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,807
I helped you,
so now you must be nice to me

208
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:20,808
and show me you're a man.

209
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:29,901
My love...

210
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,451
You're making it stand up!

211
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,663
I should hope so!

212
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:42,664
My love...

213
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,702
Nur ed Din!

214
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:03,703
Grab this rope.
Help me, my love.

215
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:20,386
My love, take this bag.
it's full of gold.

216
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:26,646
Oh, God! Who are you?
Where are you taking me?

217
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,149
<i>I am me,
and I'll take you where I like.</i>

218
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,818
Who are you?
Nur ed Din's hair is silky,

219
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:35,906
but you feel like a pig!
Let me go!

220
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,366
Let me go, you ugly beast.

221
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,828
<i>Hold your tongue
or I'll strangle you. Now walk.</i>

222
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,371
Walk!

223
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,916
We killed that soldier over there.

224
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,043
That will be your fate tomorrow

225
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:53,044
if you don't shut up.

226
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,719
I am Giawan the Kurd,
if you must know.

227
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,720
We're a group of 40 thieves,
and we'll all screw you tonight.

228
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:24,746
I've brought you
something precious, Father.

229
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:26,498
Guard her well.

230
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,499
<i>I'll be back with the others soon.</i>

231
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:46,893
I bet your head is full of lice.

232
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:50,856
Shall I pick them out for you?

233
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:55,857
Shall I?

234
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:04,157
Zumurrud, my love!

235
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,246
That's right.

236
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,541
Sleep, baby, sleep.

237
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:56,542
Go beddy-bye.

238
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,672
Horseman from the desert,

239
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:23,883
you are to be crowned
king of this city.

240
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:27,053
- What?
- What is your name?

241
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:29,389
I'm a soldier.
My name is Wardan.

242
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,474
When our king dies

243
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,143
and leaves no heirs,

244
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:37,147
we wait for the first man
to arrive from the desert

245
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,232
and make him king.

246
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,735
Praised be the Lord
for sending us a man

247
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:44,195
lean of figure and fair of face.

248
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:49,196
Drink now,
and let us enter the city.

249
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:20,774
Before being crowned,
you must have a wife.

250
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:22,650
You will marry my daughter.

251
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:24,861
Who said I wished to marry?

252
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:28,782
It is our custom. Refuse
and you'll be thrown from a tower.

253
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:33,783
Then God's will be done.

254
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:19,582
Do you have nothing
to do tonight but pray?

255
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,918
Don't you like your bride?

256
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,587
You're beautiful, Hayat,
but I am unhappy.

257
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:26,840
Do you love another woman?

258
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:29,342
If you don't consummate
our marriage,

259
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:33,513
you'll be thrown from a tower.
- May I ask you something?

260
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:37,142
If I tell you a secret,
will you keep it?

261
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,978
I promise.

262
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:44,979
Then look.

263
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:51,944
My God!

264
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,375
Now you know my secret.

265
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:06,629
<i>If you betray me,
I'll be thrown from the highest tower.</i>

266
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,883
<i>- I'll not betray you, Wardan.
- My name is Zumurrud.</i>

267
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:14,012
I was the handsome Nur ed Din's slave,
but I've lost all trace of him.

268
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:18,057
<i>I'll help you. Luck has frowned on me,
but I'll not betray you.</i>

269
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:21,478
If we can draw
multitudes to this city,

270
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,688
we might find him.

271
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,108
But you must pretend
to be my wife and tell no one.

272
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:32,109
I promise. We'll bring
all the people here you want.

273
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:31,130
Stranger, eat from your own plate.

274
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:33,383
Leave him alone.
The king said to eat our fill.

275
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:36,511
But not from other people's plates.

276
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:39,722
<i>I'll eat what I like.</i>

277
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:41,599
Fine! Eat what you like!

278
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I hope you choke!

279
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:56,322
I told him not to grab
from other people's plates.

280
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:59,492
If the king has him whipped,
he deserves it.

281
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:03,496
What is your name,
and why have you come here?

282
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:06,791
My name is Ali.
I'm a weaver, and I've come to trade.

283
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:11,792
Raise your head
and look me in the eyes, stranger.

284
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,923
You'd lie to a king, you dog?

285
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:18,303
Are you not Barsum,
the Christian who kidnapped a girl?

286
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,637
You're right, King.

287
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,056
I am Barsum.

288
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:24,726
Take this blue-eyed man
outside the city

289
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:29,727
and put him to death.

290
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:58,843
Excuse me.

291
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:03,844
Do you know where I might
find my slave Zumurrud?

292
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:09,937
Children, have you seen
Zumurrud pass this way?

293
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:14,938
Who is this Zumurrud?

294
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:05,948
Come with us.

295
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,167
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.

296
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:18,168
We'll just give you
a nice massage.

297
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:24,762
Be good and lie down.

298
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:28,057
- My love.
- Stop, you're making it stand up.

299
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:31,310
Of course, handsome boy.

300
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:35,148
You're trying to take
all his goodness.

301
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:38,151
Don't I get a share?

302
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:41,612
No, I made it stand up,
and as my mother used to say,

303
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:46,613
“Who brings barren earth to life
enjoys its fruits.”

304
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:49,412
That may be,
but my mother used to say,

305
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:52,081
“Wild game belongs
to whoever takes it,

306
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,167
not whoever finds it.”

307
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:57,879
You found it, but I'm taking it.

308
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,799
Let's do this.
Since you two can't agree,

309
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,800
<i>I'll enjoy all of this.</i>

310
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:56,020
Hands off, brother!

311
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,231
<i>I'll eat what I like.</i>

312
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:00,233
That rice is cursed.

313
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:04,362
Eat it and you'll be crucified.
It already happened once.

314
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:07,907
<i>Hold your tongue, you bastard.
I'll do as I like.</i>

315
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:09,784
He'll even eat the plate!

316
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,160
Let him be.

317
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:14,580
His face is that
of one who's dead already.

318
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:17,333
Besides, you can't fight

319
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:22,334
the will of God.

320
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:15,266
Beggar, are you strong enough

321
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,101
to be my porter?

322
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:22,102
<i>I'll pay you well.</i>

323
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:27,194
Give me some apples from Syria,

324
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:30,865
Ottoman quince, peaches from Amman,
jasmine from Aleppo,

325
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:33,326
cucumbers from the Nile,
lemons from Egypt,

326
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:36,120
currants, myrtle,

327
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,664
chamomile, pomegranates,
and white roses.

328
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:40,458
I'd also like some pastries,

329
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:43,210
nutmeg ring cakes, soft nougat,

330
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:47,423
puff pastry, sugar, incense,

331
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:52,424
amber, musk, and candle wax.

332
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,486
Mabuba! Budur!

333
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:13,487
Sisters, come down.
Everything's ready.

334
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:19,205
“Taj al-Muluk,
son of King Suleiman,

335
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:23,209
<i>grew into such
a handsome young man</i>

336
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,088
<i>that everyone who saw him
was enchanted</i>

337
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:30,049
Poems were written praising him,

338
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,219
and even the purest souls
grew shameless for his love,

339
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,179
so resplendent was his beauty.

340
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,264
As the poet said,

341
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:40,059
'I embraced him
and grew drunk from his scent,

342
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,228
swaying like a windswept branch.

343
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:44,397
I grew drunk without drinking,

344
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:49,398
intoxicated on the liquor of his saliva.”'

345
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:32,523
“Dismounting from his horse,

346
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:36,110
Taj spied a gentle and handsome
young man dressed in black.

347
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:40,239
But the youth's beauty seemed faded,

348
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,074
and he appeared dejected,

349
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:47,075
like one separated
from his loved ones.”

350
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,387
What's that paper?

351
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,347
Nothing of any use to you.

352
00:47:05,348 --> 00:47:10,348
Show me.

353
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,860
Glory to God, who teaches a man
what he didn't know.

354
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:26,118
Why did you begin to cry
when you saw this?

355
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,454
Mine is a very long story.

356
00:47:28,455 --> 00:47:31,123
The events linking me to that scroll

357
00:47:31,124 --> 00:47:35,377
and to her that made it
are very strange.

358
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:39,173
Tell me your story,
and of her who drew these gazelles.

359
00:47:39,174 --> 00:47:40,966
My name is Aziz,

360
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,719
and I was engaged to my cousin Aziza.

361
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,888
On the day of the wedding,

362
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:47,973
when everything was ready,

363
00:47:47,974 --> 00:47:51,352
I went to have my bath.

364
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:52,978
All the best, Aziz.

365
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:57,979
Best wishes to you and Aziza.

366
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:00,736
Good-bye, Aziz.

367
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:05,737
Come back to see us one day.

368
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:13,286
You smell so good, Aziz!

369
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:38,019
Aziza, my bride.

370
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:41,777
Ah, I just remembered:

371
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:45,531
I forgot to invite
my best friend, Ali.

372
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:50,532
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

373
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,970
What are you doing?
Aziza's waiting.

374
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,899
You sat on your kerchief.

375
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,900
Now you can't
wipe your brow with it.

376
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,144
“The sun and moon marvel
when he appears,

377
00:50:39,145 --> 00:50:44,145
and rosebuds blush in shame
to see his curls.”

378
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:54,993
<i>Now you return ?</i>

379
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:58,664
All were here: the qadi,
guards, emirs, merchants.

380
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:02,418
They ate and drank,
but you didn't appear, and they left.

381
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:07,419
Your father has postponed
the wedding for a year.

382
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:37,870
What happened to you?

383
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:40,205
I've fallen in love with a girl

384
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:45,206
who threw her kerchief to me
from a window and then disappeared.

385
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,883
Didn't she say anything?

386
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:55,884
She just did this.

387
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:05,939
What could she have meant?

388
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,108
Putting her finger in her mouth

389
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:11,069
means you've become to her

390
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,363
what the soul is to the body.

391
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:17,493
Two fingers
between her breasts means

392
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:20,412
“Return in two days
to ease my heart.”

393
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:25,413
Two days?

394
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:55,489
Aziz.

395
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,534
My God, how awful you look!

396
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:02,955
You haven't eaten, drunk, or slept.

397
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:05,207
Get up, put on fine garments,

398
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,959
and be happy.

399
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,960
The two days have passed.

400
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,840
Hurry and get dressed.

401
00:53:18,555 --> 00:53:23,555
Go to her.
May God give wings to your love.

402
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:17,529
Well, Aziz?

403
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,324
Why didn't you spend
the night with your beloved

404
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:25,325
and taken the pleasure
you wanted from her?

405
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:32,169
I wasn't mocking you.

406
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,879
Tell me what happened.

407
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,548
No, she didn't appear!

408
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:39,384
Aziz, don't be sad.

409
00:54:39,385 --> 00:54:41,720
You're about to get
what you desire.

410
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:43,847
She was testing

411
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,183
the sincerity of your love.

412
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:49,978
You need only return tomorrow night
and sit beneath her window.

413
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,772
Your troubles are over.

414
00:54:51,773 --> 00:54:56,773
And now eat or you might die.

415
00:55:00,907 --> 00:55:05,077
Love drives a man insane!
He can't eat or sleep!

416
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:06,953
I know.

417
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:11,954
These are the signs of love.

418
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:24,485
- How did it go this time?
- She did this.

419
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:44,843
What does it mean?

420
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:47,679
“Wait until sunset.

421
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,184
When darkness falls, come.

422
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:55,479
Go to the garden
at the far end of the city.

423
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,648
Keep going until you find a lamp.

424
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:01,234
Sit and wait for me there.

425
00:57:01,235 --> 00:57:05,322
My love is almost killing me.”

426
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:07,866
it's not night yet.
Rest a while.

427
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:12,867
You haven't eaten in a week.

428
00:58:47,383 --> 00:58:48,842
How did it go?

429
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:52,470
I did everything just as you said,
only I dozed off.

430
00:58:52,471 --> 00:58:54,389
When I awoke,

431
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,809
I found these on my stomach.

432
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:00,896
The coin is her right eye,
the eye one swears by.

433
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:04,190
The dagger means
she has sworn to kill you

434
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:06,985
if you behave like that again.

435
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:08,987
Then what must I do?

436
00:59:08,988 --> 00:59:11,364
Return to her garden tonight.

437
00:59:11,365 --> 00:59:13,867
But so you don't doze off again,

438
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,369
you must eat and rest now.

439
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:21,370
Lie down and sleep.

440
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:32,010
I am to die.

441
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:37,011
Wake up, Aziz, and eat.

442
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:42,187
I'm not hungry.

443
00:59:42,188 --> 00:59:47,188
Come now, eat.
Don't act like a child.

444
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:54,240
This time be sure not to eat
or doze off in the garden.

445
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:57,285
She will come around dawn.

446
00:59:57,286 --> 01:00:01,289
But I want to give you some advice.

447
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,208
When you leave her,

448
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:06,211
after you've done
what you want with her,

449
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:09,881
recite these lines:

450
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:12,258
In the name of God

451
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:14,678
what should a young man do

452
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:19,679
when love becomes his master?”

453
01:00:35,074 --> 01:00:40,074
No, I mustn't touch anything!

454
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:54,171
Aziz, my love,
you waited for me.

455
01:01:51,734 --> 01:01:54,694
Did you remember
to recite those lines?

456
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:56,946
Oh, I forgot!

457
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:00,325
I was looking
at this parchment she gave me.

458
01:02:00,326 --> 01:02:05,326
Isn't it beautiful?

459
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,001
May I have it?

460
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:15,002
Certainly, if you like it.

461
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:23,556
After making love with her tomorrow,
promise to recite those lines

462
01:02:23,557 --> 01:02:25,308
before you leave her.

463
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,018
I promise.

464
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:29,354
Now let me sleep.

465
01:02:29,355 --> 01:02:34,355
I'm so sleepy...

466
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,049
- Farewell.
- Listen.

467
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,260
“In the name of God,

468
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:45,680
what should a young man do
when love becomes his master?”

469
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:48,766
He must handle it skillfully,
hide his secret,

470
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:53,767
and be patient
and resigned in all things.

471
01:04:01,322 --> 01:04:02,739
Where's Aziza?

472
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,325
Alone on the terrace, crying.

473
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:06,910
Why?

474
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,037
How can you leave her like this,

475
01:04:09,038 --> 01:04:14,038
without a thought to her suffering?

476
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:04,588
Aziz, did you recite those lines?

477
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:08,263
Yes, and she answered with these:

478
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:12,517
“He who loves must hide his secret
and be resigned to it.”

479
01:05:12,518 --> 01:05:14,602
“He has tried to resign himself

480
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:19,603
but finds within only a heart
made desperate by passion.”

481
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:22,568
When you leave her
tomorrow morning,

482
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:27,569
recite those lines to her.
All right?

483
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:31,244
<i>“He has tried to resign himself,</i>

484
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:34,580
<i>but finds within only a head</i>

485
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:39,581
made desperate
by passion, my love.”

486
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:44,090
If he cannot be resigned,

487
01:05:44,091 --> 01:05:49,091
perhaps death is the best answer.”

488
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:57,186
Here.

489
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:00,315
Did you recite my lines to her?

490
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:02,108
Yes, and she replied,

491
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:05,236
“If he cannot be resigned,
perhaps death is the best answer.”

492
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:07,488
“We have heard and obeyed,

493
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:09,407
so now we die.

494
01:06:09,408 --> 01:06:14,408
Say farewell to her
who has hindered my love.”

495
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,485
Listen:

496
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,862
“We have heard

497
01:08:10,863 --> 01:08:13,322
and obeyed, so now we die.

498
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,992
Say farewell to her
who has hindered my love.”

499
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:19,287
My God! The girl who told you
those lines is dead.

500
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:22,957
If I'd known about her,
I wouldn't have drawn you to me.

501
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:27,958
But she's my cousin!

502
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:33,885
- Did she know we were making love?
- Yes.

503
01:08:33,886 --> 01:08:36,053
May God make you weep for your youth

504
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:38,681
as you've made her weep for hers.

505
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:43,682
Go now and see her.

506
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:11,422
How long will this ceremony go on?

507
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:14,509
We shall pray deep into the night,

508
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:19,430
as should you, who bear her death
on your conscience.

509
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:22,975
What did you do to break her heart?

510
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:26,270
She told me nothing. Tell me.

511
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:28,189
I didn't do anything.

512
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,817
Before she died,
she said you should tell that other girl:

513
01:09:31,818 --> 01:09:36,818
“Fidelity is good,
but so is frivolity.”

514
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,366
<i>I'll tell her.</i>

515
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:40,910
She left me something to give you,

516
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:44,372
but only when
you sincerely mourn her death.

517
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:45,706
Show me.

518
01:09:45,707 --> 01:09:49,835
I don't see you sincerely weeping
and moaning over her death.

519
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:52,129
I have to go now.

520
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:57,130
I can't wait any longer.

521
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:08,646
My love!

522
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:13,647
You were right: She's dead.
We buried her today.

523
01:10:14,486 --> 01:10:18,739
You are to blame.
Beware lest you be made to pay.

524
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,993
She left word
that I should tell you this:

525
01:10:21,994 --> 01:10:23,995
“Fidelity is good,

526
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,414
but so is frivolity.”

527
01:10:26,415 --> 01:10:28,541
With these words she's saved you,

528
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,668
for I'd decided to harm you.

529
01:10:30,669 --> 01:10:33,129
Harm me? How?

530
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,840
Tonight,
before making love to me,

531
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:38,676
distribute alms for her soul

532
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:41,512
and have a tomb built
for her of marble,

533
01:10:41,513 --> 01:10:46,513
as they do for a saint.

534
01:10:47,519 --> 01:10:51,856
I shall do as you ask.

535
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:56,857
Go.

536
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:01,866
Wait, Aziz.
A bit more perfume.

537
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:04,452
Wait, Aziz.
A bit more perfume.

538
01:11:04,453 --> 01:11:09,040
Have another glass
of this chilled wine.

539
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:14,041
To your health!

540
01:11:31,938 --> 01:11:34,065
Young man...

541
01:11:34,066 --> 01:11:37,652
read me this letter from my son,
who works far away.

542
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:40,196
Let me have it.

543
01:11:40,197 --> 01:11:42,198
“Dear Father, I am well,

544
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:45,743
but I can't earn
a single dinar here.

545
01:11:45,744 --> 01:11:49,288
But God's will be done.
I send my love. Your son, Ali.”

546
01:11:49,289 --> 01:11:50,289
Thank you.

547
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:53,042
Now come into my house
for some wine.

548
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:58,043
It's right here.
- Ah, very nice!

549
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:12,061
Would you prefer to die or to live?

550
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:15,648
- Live!
- Then marry me.

551
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:17,692
Marry you?

552
01:12:17,693 --> 01:12:21,445
Only then will you be safe
from crazy Budur.

553
01:12:21,446 --> 01:12:23,447
Who's crazy Budur?

554
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:27,159
You've lived a year with her
and don't know who she is?

555
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,787
Ah, the men
she's killed before you!

556
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:32,456
Aziza kept you safe up until now,

557
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:34,667
but where will you find
another like her?

558
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:38,796
You're an innocent babe when it comes
to women's perversity, are you not?

559
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:40,131
It's true.

560
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:43,759
I want to save you, but not like
your cousin, without compensation.

561
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,721
I'm rich.
Nothing's lacking in my house.

562
01:12:46,722 --> 01:12:49,682
“No lack of bread in the pantry
or water in the pitcher.”

563
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:52,476
You need only do for me
what the rooster does

564
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:57,477
for the hen.
- And what's that?

565
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:02,987
Come closer.

566
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:07,988
You can't get away anyway.

567
01:13:08,493 --> 01:13:12,037
Do as you like with me.
I am your slave.

568
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:17,038
Give it all to me,
for my life is yours.

569
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:38,981
Aziz...

570
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:42,860
it's been a year,
and we've each kept our promise.

571
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:45,196
You can go to your mother,
but swear

572
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:47,198
you'll return before nightfall.

573
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:52,199
I swear!

574
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,928
Budur!

575
01:14:08,929 --> 01:14:12,848
You're waiting for me?
How did you know I'd return today?

576
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,225
I didn't.

577
01:14:14,226 --> 01:14:17,770
I've waited here a year,
day and night, without moving.

578
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:20,272
I'm married and have a son.

579
01:14:20,273 --> 01:14:23,400
I can only stay with you
for one night.

580
01:14:23,401 --> 01:14:25,361
Thank you very much,

581
01:14:25,362 --> 01:14:29,240
but if you're married,
what good are you to me now?

582
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:34,241
But though I don't want you,
I won't let her have you either.

583
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:41,581
Ladies, come out!

584
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:50,549
Help!

585
01:14:56,434 --> 01:15:00,646
“Fidelity is good,
but so is frivolity!”

586
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:04,483
Aziza has saved you
with her words once again.

587
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:09,484
<i>But I'll still punish you,
for you deserve it.</i>

588
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:13,242
Get powders for the wound.

589
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:14,952
What are you doing?

590
01:15:14,953 --> 01:15:16,620
What are you doing?

591
01:15:16,621 --> 01:15:21,621
No, Budur, please!

592
01:15:22,419 --> 01:15:27,419
Take this.

593
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:33,758
Pull.

594
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:02,124
Aziz, my son!

595
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,919
Where have you been?

596
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,920
What have you been doing
all this time?

597
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,933
Aziza...

598
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:21,518
how good you were to me!

599
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:26,519
How you loved me!

600
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:39,119
Here's what Aziza left for you.

601
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,871
Yes, Aziz...

602
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:45,872
now I can give it to you.

603
01:16:49,714 --> 01:16:53,842
“This is not the work of Budur
but of Princess Dunya.

604
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:57,513
Know, my love,
that I blame you for nothing.

605
01:16:57,514 --> 01:16:59,556
In fact, I thank God

606
01:16:59,557 --> 01:17:04,557
for letting me die before you.
Your Aziza.”

607
01:17:13,321 --> 01:17:16,824
I searched for Princess Dunya.
I entered her garden.

608
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:20,369
I saw her
and fell in love with her.

609
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:25,370
But what could I do now?
I've become like a woman.

610
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:38,049
What's the matter?

611
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,854
Let us go to Dunya's city.

612
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:50,107
I've fallen for her
without ever even seeing her.

613
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:52,943
Help me find her and I'll pay you.

614
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:55,529
When my father sees
my bloodstained clothes,

615
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,530
he'll think I'm dead.

616
01:18:33,568 --> 01:18:38,568
That's Dunya's father,
perhaps off to visit another king.

617
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:48,411
Come on, Taj.

618
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,751
Is the sheik of the market here?

619
01:18:50,752 --> 01:18:54,171
Yes, but be careful.

620
01:18:54,172 --> 01:18:57,508
He's one of those
who prefer bananas to figs.

621
01:18:57,509 --> 01:19:01,428
That's him smoking over there.

622
01:19:01,429 --> 01:19:04,973
- Greetings, sheik.
- What handsome lads!

623
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:09,478
It's a shame you're so dirty
from your journey.

624
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:12,606
Before anything else,
you must have a nice bath.

625
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:14,733
As the poet said:

626
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:17,903
“May the bath keeper enjoy
a long and happy life,

627
01:19:17,904 --> 01:19:20,489
for his hand gently caresses

628
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,783
a naked body
born of water and light.”

629
01:19:22,784 --> 01:19:27,121
You'd like to enjoy
their beauty in your bath, eh?

630
01:19:27,122 --> 01:19:31,291
Certainly! I'm not like
our Princess Dunya, who hates men

631
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:34,253
and can't abide
any talk of marriage.

632
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:39,254
What's that?

633
01:19:47,559 --> 01:19:50,185
Hey, are you the gardener here?

634
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:51,937
Yes. Why?

635
01:19:51,938 --> 01:19:54,481
May we see the garden?

636
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:59,482
<i>Just a moment.
I'll open the gate.</i>

637
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,324
Tell me: To whom
does this garden belong?

638
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:06,410
Dunya, the king's daughter.

639
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:09,079
The one who hates men
and refuses to marry?

640
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,790
- That's the one, sir.
- Why does she hate men?

641
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:14,459
She dreamed that a pigeon
was caught in a net

642
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,336
and saved by its companion.

643
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:18,714
But when the dove then got caught,

644
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:21,049
the pigeon flew off,
and the dove was slaughtered.

645
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,760
She's thought ever since
that all men are like that pigeon.

646
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:27,097
How much does this Dunya pay you?

647
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:29,725
Just one dinar.

648
01:20:29,726 --> 01:20:33,937
Listen, I want to create something
beautiful here to be remembered by.

649
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:35,939
Like what, sir?

650
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:38,609
Take these 300 dinars for now.

651
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:43,610
Do as you wish here, gentlemen.

652
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:49,699
- Let's go.
- What are you going to do?

653
01:20:57,128 --> 01:21:00,589
Are you looking for work?
I need two laborers.

654
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,633
At your service.

655
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:05,594
Three dinars a day each.

656
01:21:05,595 --> 01:21:08,722
- No, that won't do.
- Four.

657
01:21:08,723 --> 01:21:10,140
Six.

658
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:12,017
Nine.

659
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:14,061
We'll only work for you

660
01:21:14,062 --> 01:21:19,062
if you pay us
just one dinar a day each.

661
01:21:51,849 --> 01:21:55,519
Are you two brothers?

662
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,437
Not blood brothers.

663
01:21:57,438 --> 01:21:59,398
Just brothers in God.

664
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:01,608
Why did you become holy men

665
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:04,611
who wander around living off alms?

666
01:22:04,612 --> 01:22:06,238
To serve God.

667
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,699
Tell me what happened
to bring you

668
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,200
to this point.

669
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:12,369
It will lighten your work

670
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:15,956
and perhaps teach
this young man something too.

671
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:18,667
If it magnifies the glory of God,

672
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:23,668
<i>I'll tell you my story.</i>

673
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:37,889
Thank you for helping me.
I'm dying of hunger and thirst.

674
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:40,767
But I'll reward you,
for I'm the son of a king.

675
01:24:40,768 --> 01:24:44,980
Bandits attacked us as we carried
gifts to our ally, the king of India.

676
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:47,774
You'd best tell no one of that.

677
01:24:47,775 --> 01:24:51,027
<i>Our countries are enemies,
but I'll shelter you.</i>

678
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:54,322
<i>I'll be no trouble. I can work.</i>

679
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:58,243
<i>I'll pay for my needs. I've studied.</i>

680
01:24:58,244 --> 01:25:00,954
I can write and do sums.

681
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:04,791
I know science and literature.

682
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:07,961
Your learning is worthless here.

683
01:25:07,962 --> 01:25:10,714
Money is all people care about here.

684
01:25:10,715 --> 01:25:15,715
You can chop wood
outside the city if you like.

685
01:26:29,085 --> 01:26:31,878
Are you man or demon?

686
01:26:31,879 --> 01:26:33,713
I'm a man.

687
01:26:33,714 --> 01:26:36,967
- How did you find this place?
- I don't know myself.

688
01:26:36,968 --> 01:26:39,469
Perhaps fate meant to put an end

689
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:44,470
to my sorrow and pain.

690
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,107
Who are you, child?

691
01:26:52,108 --> 01:26:54,484
The daughter of a king.

692
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:58,572
A demon carried me off
and locked me in this tomb.

693
01:26:58,573 --> 01:27:02,826
Every ten days he comes
and makes love to me.

694
01:27:02,827 --> 01:27:04,494
If I need him,

695
01:27:04,495 --> 01:27:08,415
I have only to touch the words
engraved on that tablet

696
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:13,416
and he comes.

697
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:31,187
My love...

698
01:27:31,188 --> 01:27:36,188
I want to free you from that demon!

699
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,779
<i>You must be mine alone.
I'll take you away from here.</i>

700
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:44,780
If the demon comes,
he'll answer to me!

701
01:27:46,454 --> 01:27:48,163
Run! Get away!

702
01:27:48,164 --> 01:27:53,164
He'll be here any minute,
and he'll kill you!

703
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:50,100
Do you know
who these shoes belong to?

704
01:28:50,101 --> 01:28:55,101
No, we've never seen them before.

705
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:04,948
I seek the owner of these shoes.
Would you know who that is?

706
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:09,949
No, none of us lost those shoes.

707
01:29:18,045 --> 01:29:23,045
Tailor, would you know
the owner of these shoes?

708
01:29:24,051 --> 01:29:25,593
Shahzaman...

709
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:30,594
a stranger found your shoes!

710
01:30:17,897 --> 01:30:22,897
There's your lover.
Kill him and you'll be spared.

711
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:41,294
Kill her...

712
01:30:41,295 --> 01:30:46,295
<i>and I'll let you go unharmed.</i>

713
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:55,892
I can't kill a woman
I've never seen before

714
01:30:55,893 --> 01:30:57,894
and who's never hurt me!

715
01:30:57,895 --> 01:31:02,895
There's love between you two.

716
01:31:41,397 --> 01:31:46,397
You've made love with your eyes.

717
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:07,589
I can't be certain
you've betrayed me

718
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:10,466
with her.

719
01:32:10,467 --> 01:32:13,553
I won't kill you,
but neither will you go

720
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,054
unpunished.

721
01:32:15,055 --> 01:32:17,265
I beg you: Be merciful.

722
01:32:17,266 --> 01:32:19,058
Set me free.

723
01:32:19,059 --> 01:32:24,059
Set aside all hope of that.

724
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:38,407
Rise up!

725
01:32:39,997 --> 01:32:42,582
Rise up...

726
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:47,583
you damned monkey!

727
01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:23,289
In the great name of God
and by his power,

728
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:28,290
become that which your nature
most craves to be.

729
01:33:32,466 --> 01:33:37,466
A monkey!

730
01:34:01,161 --> 01:34:05,456
Come here!

731
01:34:05,457 --> 01:34:10,457
Come on!

732
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:26,310
Captain...

733
01:34:26,311 --> 01:34:28,104
before we reach port,

734
01:34:28,105 --> 01:34:30,606
an account of our voyage
must be written

735
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:32,108
on this scroll.

736
01:34:32,109 --> 01:34:34,193
<i>- We overlooked it, sir.
- I'll handle it.</i>

737
01:34:34,194 --> 01:34:39,194
Where are you going?

738
01:34:55,549 --> 01:34:58,342
“Allow destiny to take its course,

739
01:34:58,343 --> 01:35:00,511
and accept willingly what it brings.

740
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:03,139
Be neither happy nor sad
about anything.

741
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:05,308
But if you open the inkwell

742
01:35:05,309 --> 01:35:07,351
of power and grace,

743
01:35:07,352 --> 01:35:11,314
be certain your ink is that
of goodness and generosity.”

744
01:35:11,315 --> 01:35:14,067
This calligraphy is truly beautiful.

745
01:35:14,068 --> 01:35:18,404
None of my advisors
write in this script so well.

746
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:20,865
Dress the author

747
01:35:20,866 --> 01:35:23,284
in garments of honor

748
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:28,285
and lead him here in a procession.

749
01:37:46,261 --> 01:37:48,221
Ibriza, look.

750
01:37:48,222 --> 01:37:51,307
Father, how can you bring
a strange man

751
01:37:51,308 --> 01:37:52,767
to see me?

752
01:37:52,768 --> 01:37:55,061
Is what my daughter says true?

753
01:37:55,062 --> 01:37:57,480
You're a man and not a monkey?

754
01:37:57,481 --> 01:38:02,481
Is that right?

755
01:38:02,486 --> 01:38:05,071
That's not a monkey but a man.

756
01:38:05,072 --> 01:38:07,198
Then I pray you, in God's name,

757
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:11,118
free him from his present condition,
for I would appoint him vizier.

758
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:16,119
I shall obey your command.

759
01:38:19,002 --> 01:38:24,002
Though it cost me my life,
you are welcome here.

760
01:38:29,763 --> 01:38:31,555
Poor monkey.

761
01:38:31,556 --> 01:38:34,517
But your soul was stronger
than your form.

762
01:38:34,518 --> 01:38:39,518
Thank you
for giving me back my soul.

763
01:38:49,533 --> 01:38:52,201
She sacrificed her life for me

764
01:38:52,202 --> 01:38:54,036
and was consumed by flames.

765
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:55,454
My grief

766
01:38:55,455 --> 01:38:58,791
was such that it could
have shattered mountains.

767
01:38:58,792 --> 01:39:03,792
I felt I had offended God.

768
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:46,505
Why would you renounce
your wealth, status, and learning?

769
01:39:46,506 --> 01:39:48,507
Not out of generosity

770
01:39:48,508 --> 01:39:53,508
but because of destiny
and as a judgment on humankind.

771
01:40:16,453 --> 01:40:20,539
- God be with you.
- And also with you, stranger.

772
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:23,876
I wish to entrust you
with a mission as if you were

773
01:40:23,877 --> 01:40:25,211
my oldest friend.

774
01:40:25,212 --> 01:40:27,380
Very well. What is it?

775
01:40:27,381 --> 01:40:31,133
God has revealed to me
that at noon tomorrow,

776
01:40:31,134 --> 01:40:34,387
you will come to me
on that island across the gulf

777
01:40:34,388 --> 01:40:37,390
and find me dead near a well.

778
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:39,517
Wash my body and wrap me

779
01:40:39,518 --> 01:40:42,686
in the shroud you'll find beside me,
and bury me.

780
01:40:42,687 --> 01:40:45,064
Then take my turban and tunic,

781
01:40:45,065 --> 01:40:48,359
and when someone appears
and asks for them,

782
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:53,360
give them to him.
- Very well.

783
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:07,499
One, two, three, four...

784
01:41:38,702 --> 01:41:42,037
<i>Yunan, my son.</i>

785
01:41:42,038 --> 01:41:45,583
<i>Keep your eyes closed</i>

786
01:41:45,584 --> 01:41:47,460
<i>and listen to me.</i>

787
01:41:47,461 --> 01:41:50,921
<i>The see, Yunan, the see.</i>

788
01:41:50,922 --> 01:41:52,631
<i>Go to your father</i>

789
01:41:52,632 --> 01:41:55,509
<i>and ask permission</i>

790
01:41:55,510 --> 01:42:00,510
go on a sea voyage.

791
01:42:32,923 --> 01:42:34,757
Father.

792
01:42:34,758 --> 01:42:37,343
We have islands
across the sea, don't we?

793
01:42:37,344 --> 01:42:39,178
Yes. Why?

794
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:41,680
I want to outfit a ship and visit them.

795
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:46,393
You, set out to sea?
What kind of idea is this?

796
01:42:46,394 --> 01:42:49,355
You, who's afraid even
of taking a bath,

797
01:42:49,356 --> 01:42:52,066
who still plays with children,

798
01:42:52,067 --> 01:42:55,027
and who sleeps all day long?

799
01:42:55,028 --> 01:43:00,028
Father, I want to see the world
and travel the sea.

800
01:43:44,077 --> 01:43:49,077
Climb the mast
and tell us what you see!

801
01:44:08,435 --> 01:44:10,227
To starboard

802
01:44:10,228 --> 01:44:12,605
the surface is teeming with fish.

803
01:44:12,606 --> 01:44:16,108
Straight ahead is a shadow

804
01:44:16,109 --> 01:44:18,527
that's sometimes black

805
01:44:18,528 --> 01:44:20,529
and sometimes white.

806
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:24,575
We're doomed! We'll all perish!

807
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,910
What's happening?

808
01:44:26,911 --> 01:44:29,330
We're near Black Stone Mountain,

809
01:44:29,331 --> 01:44:33,834
where a copper knight
stands beneath a copper dome.

810
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:35,878
As long as he stands there,

811
01:44:35,879 --> 01:44:38,380
every ship will be drawn
to the mountain

812
01:44:38,381 --> 01:44:43,381
and smashed on the rocks below.

813
01:46:13,727 --> 01:46:15,310
<i>Yunan...</i>

814
01:46:15,311 --> 01:46:17,312
<i>dig beneath your feet.</i>

815
01:46:17,313 --> 01:46:21,233
<i>There you'll find
a copper bow and a lead arrow.</i>

816
01:46:21,234 --> 01:46:24,653
<i>Shoot the knight beneath
the dome with your arrow.</i>

817
01:46:24,654 --> 01:46:27,156
Send him crashing into the sear

818
01:46:27,157 --> 01:46:29,032
<i>and free the world</i>

819
01:46:29,033 --> 01:46:34,033
<i>of this curse,</i>

820
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:03,085
Stay down there.

821
01:48:03,086 --> 01:48:07,589
Don't come out for any reason.
- All right, Father.

822
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:10,175
<i>I'll open this door when I return.</i>

823
01:48:10,176 --> 01:48:12,386
Farewell, Father.

824
01:48:12,387 --> 01:48:17,387
Farewell, my son.

825
01:49:20,455 --> 01:49:22,956
Who are you?
What do you want?

826
01:49:22,957 --> 01:49:27,957
Go away! Don't kill me!

827
01:49:35,595 --> 01:49:40,595
You don't mean to kill me?

828
01:49:46,356 --> 01:49:51,356
You won't kill me, will you?

829
01:50:18,805 --> 01:50:21,598
I'm glad you've calmed down.

830
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,060
I am a king, the son of a king,
and your friend.

831
01:50:25,061 --> 01:50:28,689
I don't mean to kill you.
Why would I?

832
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:32,401
I turn 15 today, and prophets
told my father, the king,

833
01:50:32,402 --> 01:50:34,861
that on this day I would be killed

834
01:50:34,862 --> 01:50:37,322
by a young man with no eyes

835
01:50:37,323 --> 01:50:40,367
who would come from the sea
and free the world

836
01:50:40,368 --> 01:50:43,704
by toppling a great copper knight.

837
01:50:43,705 --> 01:50:45,414
But in exchange

838
01:50:45,415 --> 01:50:48,917
an innocent victim
would have to die - me.

839
01:50:48,918 --> 01:50:52,963
Then trust in the goodness
of God and be happy.

840
01:50:52,964 --> 01:50:55,090
I'm glad I was shipwrecked

841
01:50:55,091 --> 01:50:57,426
and ended up here to defend you,

842
01:50:57,427 --> 01:51:00,595
for anyone seeking
to harm you will answer to me.

843
01:51:00,596 --> 01:51:01,763
Thank you.

844
01:51:01,764 --> 01:51:04,266
I'm glad you're my guest here,

845
01:51:04,267 --> 01:51:09,267
even if it's underground.

846
01:51:09,605 --> 01:51:11,732
There's a beautiful bath here.

847
01:51:11,733 --> 01:51:14,109
Go inside.

848
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:16,194
As the poet says:

849
01:51:16,195 --> 01:51:18,363
“Happy is the bath boy

850
01:51:18,364 --> 01:51:23,364
whose hand touches
Ali's breast and Malik's back.

851
01:51:23,619 --> 01:51:27,372
The bath may seem like an inferno,
but it is paradise.

852
01:51:27,373 --> 01:51:31,793
There you'll find bodies
as beautiful as suns and moons.”

853
01:51:31,794 --> 01:51:33,628
Come.

854
01:51:33,629 --> 01:51:37,174
I too know a poem about the bath.

855
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:38,884
“A life of joy

856
01:51:38,885 --> 01:51:40,969
for those
who enter the bath waters.

857
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:45,970
Upon them many ponds
pour their ardent tears.”

858
01:53:43,176 --> 01:53:45,135
Look there...

859
01:53:45,136 --> 01:53:48,388
at that boy lying all alone

860
01:53:48,389 --> 01:53:50,432
on the beach.

861
01:53:50,433 --> 01:53:54,060
Perhaps it's Yunan, my son.

862
01:53:54,061 --> 01:53:56,271
Yes, it's him!

863
01:53:56,272 --> 01:53:58,148
I recognize him!

864
01:53:58,149 --> 01:54:03,149
Yunan, my son, it's me -
your father!

865
01:54:30,389 --> 01:54:32,224
God be with you, sir.

866
01:54:32,225 --> 01:54:35,852
Did someone leave a tunic with you?

867
01:54:35,853 --> 01:54:37,395
Yes, sir.

868
01:54:37,396 --> 01:54:42,396
Give it to me.

869
01:55:00,169 --> 01:55:02,045
What's happening?

870
01:55:02,046 --> 01:55:07,046
Farewell, Father.

871
01:55:19,105 --> 01:55:24,105
Where are you going, my son?

872
01:56:02,231 --> 01:56:05,775
Dunya, look there, in the house!

873
01:56:05,776 --> 01:56:09,195
Look how beautiful!

874
01:56:09,196 --> 01:56:14,196
Who could have decorated
the ceiling?

875
01:56:26,756 --> 01:56:31,756
It's beautiful, Dunya.

876
01:56:33,804 --> 01:56:37,640
I don't understand.
This is the story from my dream.

877
01:56:37,641 --> 01:56:42,641
Yes, the dove there
is caught in the net.

878
01:56:42,688 --> 01:56:46,483
But there's something here
that wasn't in your dream.

879
01:56:46,484 --> 01:56:49,277
The pigeon you thought
flew off like a coward

880
01:56:49,278 --> 01:56:53,615
was caught and killed
by a bird of prey.

881
01:56:53,616 --> 01:56:56,451
Sometimes dreams
are poor teachers,

882
01:56:56,452 --> 01:57:00,789
because the whole truth
never lies in one dream...

883
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:05,790
but in many.

884
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:42,700
Look here carefully, slave,
and make no mistake.

885
01:59:42,701 --> 01:59:44,494
What's this called?

886
01:59:44,495 --> 01:59:49,495
Tell me.

887
01:59:56,423 --> 01:59:59,092
- Then it's called your pigeon.
- Wrong!

888
01:59:59,093 --> 02:00:01,010
Then you tell me!

889
02:00:01,011 --> 02:00:04,681
It's called
perfumed meadow grass.

890
02:00:04,682 --> 02:00:07,976
Thank God
for perfumed meadow grass.

891
02:00:07,977 --> 02:00:11,396
Now it's my turn. Come here.

892
02:00:11,397 --> 02:00:13,481
What's this called?

893
02:00:13,482 --> 02:00:17,402
Look carefully.
Don't make a mistake.

894
02:00:17,403 --> 02:00:19,404
Perfumed meadow grass.

895
02:00:19,405 --> 02:00:21,531
Wrong, stupid!

896
02:00:21,532 --> 02:00:23,283
Then what's it called?

897
02:00:23,284 --> 02:00:25,410
Peeled pomegranate.

898
02:00:25,411 --> 02:00:27,078
You're not done yet.

899
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:31,457
What's this called?

900
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:34,752
Look carefully.
Don't get it wrong again.

901
02:00:34,753 --> 02:00:38,006
- Peeled pomegranate.
- Idiot! That's wrong.

902
02:00:38,007 --> 02:00:39,757
Then what is it?

903
02:00:39,758 --> 02:00:42,635
The Inn of Good Fare.

904
02:00:42,636 --> 02:00:45,763
Really?
And what's this called?

905
02:00:45,764 --> 02:00:50,764
Look carefully! No mistakes!

906
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:59,690
- Which of you knows?
- I do.

907
02:01:05,868 --> 02:01:08,286
Then tell us.

908
02:01:08,287 --> 02:01:10,705
This is the donkey

909
02:01:10,706 --> 02:01:12,707
that grazes
on perfumed meadow grass,

910
02:01:12,708 --> 02:01:15,835
eats peeled pomegranates...

911
02:01:15,836 --> 02:01:20,836
and spends the night
in the Inn of Good Fare!

912
02:01:40,694 --> 02:01:45,694
Zumurrud!

913
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:17,897
Tear me to pieces if you like.

914
02:02:17,898 --> 02:02:22,360
I'm tired of wandering and searching.

915
02:02:22,361 --> 02:02:26,614
I had the most beautiful slave
in the world, and I lost her.

916
02:02:26,615 --> 02:02:28,533
Come, lion.

917
02:02:28,534 --> 02:02:33,534
Kill me! Eat me!
Then my suffering will be over.

918
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:46,509
What is it?

919
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:51,139
What do you want?

920
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:55,143
I don't understand.

921
02:02:55,144 --> 02:03:00,144
Am I to follow you?

922
02:03:01,483 --> 02:03:06,483
All right. I'm coming.

923
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:53,386
Stop!

924
02:04:53,387 --> 02:04:55,805
It's dangerous
to eat from that dish.

925
02:04:55,806 --> 02:04:58,558
Others who ate that rice
were killed.

926
02:04:58,559 --> 02:05:01,352
Let him eat.
We'll see what happens.

927
02:05:01,353 --> 02:05:03,145
Let me eat.

928
02:05:03,146 --> 02:05:08,146
If I'm killed, it will end my suffering.

929
02:05:22,332 --> 02:05:24,333
- What is your name?
- Nur ed Din.

930
02:05:24,334 --> 02:05:28,254
Dress and perfume this Nur ed Din
and bring him to my chambers.

931
02:05:28,255 --> 02:05:32,633
Far from killing him,
our king's treating him very hospitably.

932
02:05:32,634 --> 02:05:35,845
The king must have noticed
his beautiful eyes.

933
02:05:35,846 --> 02:05:37,597
One needn't wonder.

934
02:05:37,598 --> 02:05:40,892
Our king may well prefer
melons to plums.

935
02:05:40,893 --> 02:05:45,893
I'd have that boy too, my friends!

936
02:05:54,072 --> 02:05:59,072
Come here and massage my legs.

937
02:06:07,878 --> 02:06:09,503
Come on.

938
02:06:09,504 --> 02:06:12,632
Higher.

939
02:06:12,633 --> 02:06:15,217
<i>I'll go no higher than your knees.</i>

940
02:06:15,218 --> 02:06:17,595
What? You'd refuse
to do as I command?

941
02:06:17,596 --> 02:06:18,721
Beware!

942
02:06:18,722 --> 02:06:23,184
<i>I'll make it very clear:
You must do as I say, boy.</i>

943
02:06:23,185 --> 02:06:25,227
I want you as my lover.

944
02:06:25,228 --> 02:06:28,105
<i>Perhaps as a reward
I'll make you an emir.</i>

945
02:06:28,106 --> 02:06:31,150
- What do I have to do?
- Go lie on the bed.

946
02:06:31,151 --> 02:06:35,071
I've never done this before. Take back
your presents and let me leave.

947
02:06:35,072 --> 02:06:38,240
Obey me!
Now go lie on the bed.

948
02:06:38,241 --> 02:06:43,241
Or shall I have you beheaded?

949
02:07:01,139 --> 02:07:06,139
On your stomach.

950
02:07:08,188 --> 02:07:12,358
Pull your pants down.

951
02:07:12,359 --> 02:07:17,359
Hurry UP!

952
02:07:33,839 --> 02:07:36,007
Please don't hurt me too much.

953
02:07:36,008 --> 02:07:38,134
Do you like love poems?

954
02:07:38,135 --> 02:07:41,220
Haven't you ever heard one?

955
02:07:41,221 --> 02:07:43,639
Don't look at me!
Now listen.

956
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:47,685
“The fuzzy down of a first beard
has traced, like a poet's pen,

957
02:07:47,686 --> 02:07:50,813
two lines in myrtle
on a young boy's cheeks.

958
02:07:50,814 --> 02:07:54,358
The sun and moon marvel
when he appears.

959
02:07:54,359 --> 02:07:58,070
No tree has ever yielded
so sweetly to the storm.”

960
02:07:58,071 --> 02:07:59,655
Fine.

961
02:07:59,656 --> 02:08:02,825
You know this other one?
Don't look at me!

962
02:08:02,826 --> 02:08:05,995
“L spoke of mounting him,
and he replied,

963
02:08:05,996 --> 02:08:08,539
'Will you never stop insulting me?'

964
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:11,000
But when I showed him a dinar,

965
02:08:11,001 --> 02:08:13,377
that handsome youth said,

966
02:08:13,378 --> 02:08:16,005
'If destiny says
you are to mount me,

967
02:08:16,006 --> 02:08:19,008
I can't escape it.”'

968
02:08:19,009 --> 02:08:21,427
And how about this other one?

969
02:08:21,428 --> 02:08:24,346
Don't look at me!

970
02:08:24,347 --> 02:08:27,516
“My love is great,
and that handsome youth said to me,

971
02:08:27,517 --> 02:08:29,685
'Push that thing in deep

972
02:08:29,686 --> 02:08:34,686
with all your might!”'

973
02:08:57,047 --> 02:09:00,549
isn't it getting hard?

974
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,718
Not unless you touch it.

975
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:04,386
Go on, touch it.

976
02:09:04,387 --> 02:09:09,387
You know what awaits
if you don't obey.

977
02:09:09,434 --> 02:09:14,434
Come on!

978
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:18,150
You're like a woman down there!

979
02:09:18,151 --> 02:09:20,736
And now mine
is standing up straight!

980
02:09:20,737 --> 02:09:25,533
My love, don't you recognize
your slave?

981
02:09:25,534 --> 02:09:30,534
Zumurrud, my love!

982
02:09:35,502 --> 02:09:36,836
You know...

983
02:09:36,837 --> 02:09:41,674
I know a poem too.

984
02:09:41,675 --> 02:09:44,927
“What a night!
God has made no other like it.

985
02:09:44,928 --> 02:09:49,928
Bitter was its beginning,
but how sweet is its end.”
