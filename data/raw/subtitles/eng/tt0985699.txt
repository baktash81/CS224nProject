1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,400
The Führer's promises of peace and
prosperity have fallen by the wayside...

2
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
leaving in their wake a path of destruction.

3
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,500
The outrages committed by Hitler's SS are
a stain on the honor of the German Army.

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,800
There is widespread disgust
in the officer corps...

5
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,800
toward the crimes committed
by the Nazis...

6
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,500
the murder of civilians...

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
the torture and starvation of prisoners...

8
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,600
<i>... the mass execution of Jews.</i>

9
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,000
<i>My duty as an officer is no longer</i>
<i>to save my country,</i>

10
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
<i>but to save human lives.</i>

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,800
<i>I cannot find one general</i>
<i>in a position to confront Hitler</i>

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
<i>with the courage to do it.</i>

13
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,200
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
The General will be here in four hours.

14
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,400
Thank you.
I'll need to see him when he arrives.

15
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,700
<i>I find myself surrounded by men</i>
<i>unwilling or unable to face the truth.</i>

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,900
<i>Hitler is not only</i>
<i>the archenemy of the entire world</i>

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>but the archenemy of Germany.</i>

18
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,700
<i>A change must be made.</i>

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

20
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
That's what we'll do.

21
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,300
The British are moving up from the south,
Patton is closing in on the coast.

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
You know,
we should have left two days ago.

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
No, Colonel.

24
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,700
We keep fighting until the final victory.

25
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,300
North Africa's lost, and you're going to
need these men a year from now

26
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
to defend Berlin.

27
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,800
We can serve Germany or the Führer,
not both.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
It's just that sort of talk
that had you sent here, Colonel.

29
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
What I said was much worse.

30
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,200
General.

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,900
I'm just trying
to get these men out of here alive.

32
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
- What would you have me do?
- Tell Command we're low on water.

33
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,500
We'd have to reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

34
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
At least then we'd have a chance.

35
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,300
And the records will show that we didn't
have enough water to reach Sidi Mansour?

36
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,100
I can guarantee it.

37
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,000
See that it's done.

38
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,900
General.

39
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,800
Up!

40
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,900
Down!

41
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
- Hitler's leaving.
- Now?

42
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
<i>Ja.</i> Fuse.

43
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,100
Colonel Brandt! Colonel Brandt!

44
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,700
My regards to Colonel Stieff.

45
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,500
Cointreau?
Let's hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.

46
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
This is Tresckow.

47
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
He's landed.

48
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
This is General Tresckow.

49
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,400
Connect me with Operations,
Colonel Brandt.

50
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,300
Colonel! Tresckow.

51
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm glad you arrived safely.
I hate to trouble you,

52
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,600
but it seems you have the wrong bottles
for Colonel Stieff.

53
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,500
You do still have the package?

54
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Oh, no, no, no. As it happens,
I've been called to Berlin unexpectedly.

55
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,100
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

56
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,600
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.
Yes, thank you.

57
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,200
Do you think he knows?

58
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,100
Well, there's only one way to find out.

59
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,300
- We've been discovered.
- What makes you think that?

60
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,000
Oster's been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him last night.

61
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,200
The Gestapo could have arrested him
for anything.

62
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
- What do you think went wrong?
- We don't know.

63
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,100
Fuse. Temperature. Altitude.
All I know is the damn thing didn't go off.

64
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,500
- General Tresckow to see Colonel Brandt.
- The Colonel's expecting you, sir.

65
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,100
At ease.

66
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,100
You'll forgive me, General.

67
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,600
This little roundup
has had me writing reports all day.

68
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,000
- Roundup?
- Dissenters.

69
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,400
- Another plot against the Führer.
- Who are these people?

70
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
You'd be surprised.

71
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,900
Now, is this what you've come for?

72
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,100
Perhaps we should open it.

73
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,000
I beg your pardon?

74
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,500
Well, you've come a long way.
You must be thirsty.

75
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You know, I wonder how the Führer,
who does not partake,

76
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,700
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

77
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Colonel Brandt.

78
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,400
I took you for another sort, General.

79
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,600
And I you.

80
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,700
We're still in business.

81
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
Find a replacement for Oster.

82
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,900
There's no one we can trust, not in Berlin.

83
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
Well, then stop looking in Berlin.

84
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
Countess von Stauffenberg?

85
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,500
Perhaps before you go in, we could have
a word together in my office.

86
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I will see my husband now.

87
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,700
The right hand has been amputated
above the wrist.

88
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,400
He's missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand.

89
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,800
We couldn't save the left eye.

90
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Colonel.

91
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,100
When you're ready, sir.

92
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,600
<i>I'm a soldier. I serve my country.</i>

93
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,800
<i>But this is not my country.</i>

94
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,700
<i>I was lying out there bleeding to death,</i>
<i>thinking, "If I die now,</i>

95
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,700
<i>"I leave nothing to my children</i>
<i>but shame. "</i>

96
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,900
I know now there's only one way
to serve Germany.

97
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,300
In doing so, I'll be a traitor. I accept that.

98
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

99
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,600
We need to reorganize.
Reconsider our strategy, recruit new men.

100
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's why we want you.

101
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,800
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children

102
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,400
if these men can't see it through?

103
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Come and hear what they have to say.

104
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
You know where to find us.

105
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,900
Enough! Enough. I'm not going to listen
to another word of this.

106
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
You had your chance, you failed.

107
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,900
Your so-called "central solution"
didn't work.

108
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Our only option now
is to confront Hitler openly.

109
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,100
This is a military operation...

110
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
It's not a military operation,
it's a political organization,

111
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
and one that's given its military arm
too much control.

112
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,300
In any military exercise,

113
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation.

114
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,000
A measure? A measure?
What about total, complete, utter failure?

115
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,300
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we face the fact

116
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,900
that the Allies are coming, sooner or later.

117
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
I say we sit back
and let them wipe out the Nazis.

118
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,800
And ask every living soul in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

119
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
- Carl, please.
- I'm sorry, Ludwig.

120
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
I've held my tongue too long.

121
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
We must confront Hitler now.
Force him out!

122
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,800
And then what?

123
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,100
I beg your pardon?

124
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,000
When Hitler is gone, then what?

125
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm sorry, who is this man?

126
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

127
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,300
He's been transferred to my office
at the War Ministry.

128
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,700
- How's your uncle?
- He's well, sir. He sends his regards.

129
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,200
- He speaks very highly of you.
- And of you, General.

130
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,700
Of course, one of the things
that made Oster such a great organizer

131
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,600
was that he kept his opinions to himself.

132
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm simply asking what you intend to do
when Hitler is gone.

133
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,900
You don't really believe you could just
walk into the Reich Chancellery

134
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
and command the army to end the war?

135
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,800
Yes. We do.

136
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
You are in the presence of men
who would have been Hitler's inner circle.

137
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300
Instead, we refused, Colonel.

138
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,900
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

139
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,400
We have the respect of the people.
And the army.

140
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,600
Then you don't need me. Gentlemen.

141
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,000
<i>Those men are confusing</i>
<i>respect with popularity.</i>

142
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,200
The army swore an oath,
an oath that won't just die with Hitler.

143
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,400
What are you going to do?

144
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
How are you going to deal with Goebbels?
Himmler? The SS?

145
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,900
- They will wipe you out!
- It doesn't matter!

146
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,900
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

147
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Otherwise, this will always be
Hitler's Germany.

148
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,000
And we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

149
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
That is not enough for me.

150
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,600
There has to be a chance of success.

151
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Then find a way.

152
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,500
- <i>Poppy!</i>
- <i>Poppy!</i>

153
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,500
- Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
- Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

154
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Mommy, he's here!

155
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,500
- Mom, come down!
- Poppy's here!

156
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,200
I thought we agreed
I'd come see you in Bamberg.

157
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,400
- The children couldn't wait.
- The children?

158
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Super!

159
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
<i>Valkyrie.</i>

160
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,300
We've already considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.

161
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,500
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

162
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
- I think we should consider.
- Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?

163
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
Operation Valkyrie.

164
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,200
The Reserve Army has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

165
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,800
Valkyrie is Hitler's contingency plan

166
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,400
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

167
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,000
The sole purpose of the order
is to protect Hitler's government

168
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
- if he's cut off or killed.
- And what use is this to us?

169
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

170
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,700
But what if the SS were staging a coup?

171
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,800
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

172
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,100
- How would High Command respond?
- We would have no choice.

173
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,900
We would declare
a military state of emergency.

174
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,600
Exactly, and initiate Valkyrie.

175
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,600
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

176
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,300
will have no choice but to seize power
in Berlin to prevent the SS takeover.

177
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
They'll think they're fighting
for Hitler's government, not against it.

178
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,500
While we quietly put
a new government in place.

179
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
But only if he's dead.

180
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,700
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

181
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,300
How else are you going to convince people
the SS are trying to seize power?

182
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,300
We have to kill Hitler.

183
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,700
I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.
I thought a man of your background

184
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,700
would suggest
a more honorable approach.

185
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

186
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,900
Firstly, Valkyrie would have
to be rewritten to exclude the SS.

187
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,700
Then I'll need your help to get a copy.

188
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Rewriting an order is one thing.

189
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,700
Distributing it is another.

190
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,100
In this case,

191
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,800
we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

192
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,500
Evidence requiring Hitler's signature.

193
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,100
Well, we can all draw straws for that job.

194
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,300
- And what about Fromm?
- Fromm? Who is Fromm?

195
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,000
He's the commander of the Reserve Army.

196
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,700
I can put the reserve troops on alert,
but only Fromm can initiate Valkyrie.

197
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
Can you get to him?

198
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,200
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

199
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,500
He's a careerist pig.

200
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,200
But one who's gone as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

201
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,300
It's no secret he's not happy about it.

202
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

203
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,900
Make him see the light.

204
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Your office is through there.

205
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,400
I have Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

206
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,400
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
Welcome back to the War Ministry.

207
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,700
- It's an honor, sir.
- You're an old woman, Fromm!

208
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,000
I'd send you to the front

209
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
if I didn't think you'd surrender
just to be Montgomery's whore!

210
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,700
The General will see you now.

211
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,100
What is it you want?

212
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,200
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

213
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,300
From Africa.

214
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,700
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

215
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,300
I'd say the General has lost
more important things this morning.

216
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,800
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

217
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,600
Please, sit down, Colonel.
And you, Olbricht, if you must.

218
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,900
They tell me you're critical
of the war, Colonel,

219
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,500
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

220
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
I am critical of indecision, General.

221
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
- In the field?
- In Berlin.

222
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,100
So that's why you're here, I take it, to...

223
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
- To make decisions.
- I've already made my decision.

224
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm here to help others make theirs.

225
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,100
They say when there's no clear option,

226
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,000
- the best thing is to do nothing.
- We're at war. We must act.

227
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Sometimes rashly.

228
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,500
And what rash action
did you have in mind, Colonel?

229
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,900
That would be a decision
for the supreme military commander, sir.

230
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
A supreme commander.

231
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,800
Second only to the Chancellor.

232
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
If I were that man,

233
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,400
this war would be going quite differently.

234
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,500
Well, we were thinking the same thing.

235
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I don't need to remind you

236
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,600
that we've all sworn an oath

237
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
to the Führer.

238
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,500
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place,

239
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
in the strict understanding

240
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,900
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof.

241
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,200
Now, you can tell your friends, Colonel,
that I always come down on the right side.

243
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,100
And as long as the Führer is alive,
you know what side that is.

244
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,700
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

245
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,800
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

246
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,700
Of course! Yes! Very good guess!

247
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
You realize how close I am to Hitler.

248
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,200
With one word I can make you disappear.

249
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,000
My associates don't know
we've been talking,

250
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,100
- if that's what you're afraid of.
- When the SS catch you,

251
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,500
they will pull you apart like warm bread.

252
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
It will be a crime
just to have known you then.

253
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,100
I warn you, don't try to contact me again.

254
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,700
You won't report me.

255
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,300
Maybe if you had
when I first approached you,

256
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,800
you might have been keeping your oath.

257
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,300
Now you're just as guilty as the rest of us.

258
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,700
And you think that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

259
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his Führer

260
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,000
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

261
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,000
- It is not that simple.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

262
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,800
For the last time,
don't push me to make a decision.

263
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,600
I don't have a choice. It's clear now.

264
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,300
Without you, there is no hope of success.

265
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,400
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

266
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

267
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,500
What makes you think you're stronger
than the people, the Reich?

268
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,500
- The very momentum of history!
- This is going to happen.

269
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

270
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

271
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,300
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

272
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,100
but don't delude yourself.

273
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
You were involved in a crime
against your country

274
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,200
long before you met me.

275
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,300
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

276
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,900
Only God can judge us now.

277
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,900
Hitler had Operation Valkyrie designed

278
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,700
to completely secure his government
in six hours.

279
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three.

280
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,200
As written,
the order spreads reserve troops

281
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,700
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

282
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,800
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna and Prague.

283
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,600
<i>This is a waste of resources.</i>

284
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,500
<i>Since all of these districts follow</i>
<i>orders from Berlin without question,</i>

285
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,000
<i>you take Berlin, you take Germany.</i>

286
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,100
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

287
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,800
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

288
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,000
to focus entirely on Berlin.

289
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,800
We'll surround the government quarter,
occupy all SS and police barracks.

290
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,300
Once we have control of the government,
we'll shut down all concentration camps.

291
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,100
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

292
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,700
I've been transferred to the front.

293
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,500
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

294
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
You know these orders
better than anyone.

295
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,100
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation.

296
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,500
- Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

297
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,600
No. It's your plan. It's you.

298
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,800
One more thing.
You need to be absolutely certain

299
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
no conflicting orders get out
after the flash.

300
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
It is not enough to kill Hitler.

301
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,400
We need to isolate his chain of command

302
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,000
and cut them off
from the outside world immediately.

303
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,800
Yes, I've already considered that.
I think I have just the man who can help.

304
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,700
- Who is he?
- Perhaps it's better I don't say.

305
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,200
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

306
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,600
if he could find just 10 righteous men.

307
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,400
I have a feeling that, for Germany,
it may come down to one.

308
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,400
Let's begin.

309
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,200
"The Führer, Adolf Hitler,

310
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,500
"is dead."

311
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,400
<i>Heil</i> Hitler, General.

312
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,800
Would you excuse us, please? Thank you.

313
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,200
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

314
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,800
It's the only time I get to relax.

315
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,500
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.

316
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
- Excuse me?
- Congratulations.

317
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,900
- I am busy with other things.
- Unfortunately,

318
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,500
your nocturnal activities
don't count as service to the Reich.

319
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,900
- I'll refuse the promotion.
- You'll do no such thing.

320
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

321
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
but in this world I still outrank you.

322
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,100
You will accept the promotion.

323
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,200
You'll have real access to Hitler,
his advisers, his schedule. We need this.

324
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I've looked through your changes
to Valkyrie.

325
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,800
I approve.
I'll need you to get Hitler to sign it.

326
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,600
Now. There's a man here to interview
as your adjutant.

327
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,900
He comes highly recommended.

328
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,200
Close the door.

329
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Be seated.

330
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Do you know
how this war will end, Lieutenant?

331
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,700
The portrait will be unhung,

332
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and the man will be hung.

333
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,700
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

334
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,500
Can I count you in?

335
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,000
For anything, sir. Anything at all.

336
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,600
Come. Come, come.

337
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Colonel Brandt, Operations.

338
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review
your presentation to the Führer.

339
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Strictly routine.

340
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,900
Sir, the contents of the Colonel's bag
are for the Führer's eyes only.

341
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,000
I am the Führer's eyes, Lieutenant.

342
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,100
The Colonel is a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

343
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
He doesn't answer to you.

344
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,700
- They're waiting.
- This way.

345
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,100
My Führer.
May I present Colonel Stauffenberg,

346
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,100
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

347
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,500
<i>Heil,</i> my Führer.

348
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,400
May I say what an honor it is
to meet an officer

349
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,100
who has sacrificed so much for Germany.

350
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,100
If only more of my men were like you.

351
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,200
Let this man stand
as an example to all of you.

352
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
He is the ideal German officer.

353
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,300
My Führer. Colonel Stauffenberg
was asked to come here today

354
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,400
to brief us on mobilizing troops
of the Reserve Army to...

355
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,400
To repel the invasion.

356
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,300
Invasion?

357
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
At Normandy, my Führer.

358
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,600
Oh, yes.

359
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,700
Normandy.

360
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
That will not be necessary.

361
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,100
<i>Reichsmarschall</i> Göring assures me that
everything is completely under control.

362
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,600
Thank you, Colonel.

363
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,800
My Führer, if I may.

364
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,800
I have an amended copy
of Operation Valkyrie for your approval.

365
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,400
You know your Wagner, Colonel?

366
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,300
The Valkyrie. Handmaidens of the Gods,

367
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,400
choosing who will live and who will die,
sparing the most heroic

368
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,300
from an agonizing death.

369
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,700
One cannot understand National Socialism

370
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,000
if one does not understand Wagner.

371
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm sure whatever changes you've made
are for the best.

372
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,300
You're dismissed. Send your man home.
And, Fromm?

373
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,000
Have some fresh tea brought in, will you?

374
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,300
I don't know what you're brewing up,
and I don't want to know.

375
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,200
But when the music stops,

376
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,700
I'd be obliged if Keitel found himself
without a chair.

377
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,300
Any problem on Earth can be solved

378
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,700
with the careful application
of high explosives.

379
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,100
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

380
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,700
Two 975-gram packs of Plastit W.
Enough explosive to cripple a panzer.

381
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,400
Your detonators, your fuses.
British time pencils.

382
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
This acid capsule is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

383
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,500
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time pencil, like so,

384
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,400
insert the entire device
into either end of the Plastit W,

385
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,600
crush the acid capsule, and you're live.

386
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,900
When the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin,

387
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,600
well, you'll want to be very far away.

388
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,100
For you.

389
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,700
- How much time will we have?
- Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay,

390
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,200
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,

391
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,400
I'd give you 10, 15 minutes, tops.

392
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,400
That's hardly precise.

393
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,000
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have small or precise, not both.

394
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,200
Might this just be a little too small?

395
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,700
No. Hitler's bunker will magnify the blast.

396
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,700
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

397
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,100
The air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that

398
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,000
will kill everyone instantly.

399
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,300
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

400
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,200
If, by some miracle,
Hitler does survive, what then?

401
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,600
We still initiate Valkyrie.

402
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,100
At that point,
there will be no turning back.

403
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,300
But we'll have an advantage.

404
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,100
We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair.

405
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,000
After the flash, he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

406
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,400
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

407
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,200
we'll have the momentum we need
to seize control in Berlin.

408
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,500
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

409
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,400
Don't proceed
unless you can get them both.

410
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,000
What?

411
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,600
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

412
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,000
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

413
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,800
I'll hold off, if the decision is unanimous,

414
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,800
but I want another man on the committee.
Not a politician.

415
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,200
- Who?
- Him.

416
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,100
- Him?
- Him.

417
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,200
Fine.

418
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,200
But remember, this is a military operation.
Nothing ever goes according to plan.

419
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,300
I'll take the children to Bamberg.

420
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,800
If I fail,

421
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,200
they'll come for you.

422
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,400
All of you.

423
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,500
I know.

424
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,200
Gentlemen. Good morning.

425
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,200
Hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today at 1:00.

426
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,800
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

427
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,600
- They're here.
- <i>Before arming the explosives,</i>

428
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,600
<i>Stauffenberg will call</i>
<i>for authorization to proceed.</i>

429
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,500
<i>After the flash, his inside man</i>
<i>will sever all communications.</i>

430
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,100
<i>Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,</i>

431
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,400
<i>Olbricht would take command</i>
<i>of the Reserve Army</i>

432
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,400
- <i>and initiate Valkyrie.</i>
- Initiate Valkyrie.

433
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,800
<i>Then he'll notify all district commanders</i>
<i>that the SS is attempting to seize power.</i>

434
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,300
<i>The Reserve Army will arrest all SS,</i>
<i>Gestapo and Nazi officials.</i>

435
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,600
<i>By then, Stauffenberg</i>
<i>will have returned to Berlin</i>

436
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,100
<i>and taken command of the Reserve Army.</i>

437
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,800
<i>Witzleben and I will assume the roles</i>
<i>of commander of the armed forces</i>

438
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,400
<i>and head of state.</i>

439
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,700
<i>With Berlin secured,</i>

440
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,800
<i>Dr. Goerdeler will address the nation</i>
<i>as our new chancellor.</i>

441
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Then, God willing,

442
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,700
we can negotiate a truce with the Allies
and save Europe from total destruction.

443
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,900
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

444
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,300
Nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one.

445
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,900
Gentlemen, this is the most important day
of your lives.

446
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,100
Long live sacred Germany.

447
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,200
- Captain.
- What is it?

448
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,900
An order from General Olbricht's office.

449
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,500
It's calling the Reserve Army
for some sort of standby action

450
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,200
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

451
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,100
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

452
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,400
Sir?

453
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,900
- "Standby action"? What the hell for?
- The order doesn't say.

454
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,000
Assemble the men.
This better not be a drill.

455
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,300
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

456
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,300
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

457
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,600
Your man?

458
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,300
He is now.

459
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,100
Colonel.

460
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,700
Attention!

461
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,200
Gentlemen. For our first order of business,

462
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,900
General Fromm will present his plans

463
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,700
for the reallocation of troops from
the Reserve Army on the eastern front.

464
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,800
Now, as you know, last night
the Russians launched a new offensive

465
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,900
against Army Group North Ukraine
in the South Poland section.

466
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,100
General Harpe was brought in
to replace Model

467
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,900
and bring a swift end to this confrontation.

468
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,700
- Himmler is not here.
- Hence the transfer of three divisions

469
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,400
to fortify General Harpe's troops.

470
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,600
Now, these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan

471
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,000
rather than holding any one particular...

472
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,300
Yes, sir. I'll put that right through.
Connecting now.

473
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Direct me to the War Ministry.

474
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,100
- General Olbricht's office.
- <i>One moment, please.</i>

475
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Yes, sir. Connecting now.

476
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,400
- General Olbricht's office.
- Himmler's not in the briefing.

477
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,100
I'm ready to arm. Permission to proceed.

478
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,100
Hold the line.

479
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,100
Stauffenberg says Himmler's not
at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

480
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,500
Call Beck.

481
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,000
- Beck.
- <i>Himmler is not at the briefing.</i>

482
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,700
Himmler's not at the briefing.

483
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,000
...already diminished reserves.

484
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,000
<i>No.</i>

485
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,300
They say no.

486
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,400
What do you say?

487
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,700
I say do it.

488
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,900
Attention!

489
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,500
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

490
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,400
Colonel? Your bag.

491
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,500
This has been a drill! You're dismissed!

492
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,900
How dare you put the Reserve Army
on standby without my knowledge?

493
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,600
Damn near cost me my commission.

494
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,300
And what in God's name made you think
you even had the authority?

495
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,700
- It was only a drill, an exercise.
- Don't lie, Olbricht! Not to me.

496
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,800
We both know it wasn't a drill.

497
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,400
- General, if I may...
- No, you may not, Colonel.

498
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,100
You may not do anything.

499
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,300
Because not only have you proved to me
you can't deliver,

500
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,000
you've painted a target on my back.

501
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:54,100
If I so much as sense you trying
to move the Reserve Army again,

502
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,000
I will personally have you both arrested.

503
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,100
Do I make myself abundantly clear?

504
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

505
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

506
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,800
I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

507
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,400
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

508
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,500
The point of replacing Hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the Allies.

509
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,000
The Allies, I suspect,
would be more amenable to a truce

510
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,100
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking Berlin!

511
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,600
There's no point in killing Hitler
unless you kill Himmler, too.

512
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,200
Why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place?

513
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,000
Today's failure had nothing to do
with Himmler, and you know it.

514
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,800
This is a military operation
in the hands of a politician, nothing more.

515
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,100
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

516
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
I'm stating the facts as I see them.

517
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,300
You don't have the courage to kill Hitler,
so you are making the task impossible.

518
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,500
Nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own.

519
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,800
My only regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone.

520
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,900
I don't think I'm alone
when I say your judgment is in question.

521
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,900
- I'd like to call a vote.
- Carl.

522
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,300
I propose
that we relieve Colonel Stauffenberg.

523
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,600
Carl, can I have a word with you
in private?

524
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,600
No, Ludwig.
If you've got something to say, say it.

525
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,100
Very well. I heard from the Chief of Police
this evening

526
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,400
that Himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

527
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,700
You have to leave Germany tonight.

528
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,800
When we succeed
with the central solution,

529
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,400
you'll return as chancellor.

530
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,200
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

531
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,200
Good luck, Colonel.

532
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,900
No more indecision.

533
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,500
From now on,
Stauffenberg has full discretion.

534
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,800
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

535
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,100
I'll do my job. You just take Berlin.

536
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,200
<i>Hold on, sir.</i>
<i>I'll try to connect you right now.</i>

537
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,700
Thank you.

538
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,300
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

539
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,000
Hello?

540
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,200
Hello?

541
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,100
<i>I'm sorry, sir. There is bombing in Ebingen.</i>
<i>We've been disconnected.</i>

542
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,100
<i>Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.</i>
<i>I'm sure your family is safe.</i>

543
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,600
Thank you.

544
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,100
Welcome, Colonel.

545
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,300
Do you have a place
where I could change, Major?

546
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,700
Please follow me.

547
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,000
At least put the Reserve Army
on standby alert.

548
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
Not until I've heard from Stauffenberg.
Not until I'm sure.

549
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,600
- But that's not what he...
- Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

550
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,100
The meeting has been moved up to 12:30.

551
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,100
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

552
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,500
- The Führer wants to have lunch with him.
- Yes, sir.

553
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,900
Will Mussolini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

554
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,400
I only wish he were.

555
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,100
Then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

556
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,300
to shoot that dago bastard.

557
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,900
Excuse me, General.
I'm expecting an important call.

558
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,200
Could you please have someone come
and get me?

559
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,000
Even if I'm with the Führer.

560
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,600
- Of course, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

561
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,200
Colonel.

562
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,500
Major Freyend speaking.

563
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,700
Colonel? They insist you hurry.
The briefing's about to begin.

564
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,600
One moment, please, Major.

565
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,200
Ten minutes.
Two for the walk, one for the checkpoint,

566
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,700
one for the bunker, six to get out.

567
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,900
Plenty of time.

568
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,700
Excuse me, Colonel.

569
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,700
Sir! The Führer's at the briefing!

570
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,000
The Colonel is changing, Major.

571
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,800
- You understand this can be difficult.
- Of course.

572
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,400
Plenty of time.

573
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,100
- Get the car.
- But, sir...

574
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,800
I have everything I need. Get the car.

575
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,500
I can manage this.

576
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,400
- Where are they going?
- It's too hot.

577
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,700
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

578
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,700
Major, my injuries
have left me hard of hearing.

579
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,400
Would you place me
as close to the Führer as possible?

580
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,399
- I'll see what I can do.
- ...against the Red Army.

581
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,600
Not only have they been advancing
from the east,

582
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,100
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well.

583
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,100
As you can see, my Führer,
if the enemy continues at this rate,

584
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,600
the situation in the East Prussian sector
is critical.

585
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,900
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

586
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and reserves are severely depleted.

587
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,100
My Führer,
you remember Colonel Stauffenberg?

588
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,600
As you are all aware,

589
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,600
in the past two days alone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

590
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,700
the 14th Division has been pushed
out of Livorno.

591
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,500
Army Group Center has already lost
28 of their 40 divisions.

592
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,500
That is a total of almost 350,000 men.

593
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,600
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearly a month ago,

594
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,000
our troops have already been pushed back
to the Polish border.

595
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,900
Conference hut.

596
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,600
This, compounded with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

597
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,600
- threatens the entire eastern perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

598
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,100
We must consider pulling men
from Army Group North Ukraine,

599
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,800
as well as the Romanian...

600
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,500
...and prevent further losses.

601
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,500
Unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions

602
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,700
at vital points along the German right,

603
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,099
- Army Group will be swallowed by the enemies...
- Colonel. There's a telephone call for you.

604
01:09:56,099 --> 01:09:57,300
.....in less than a fortnight.

605
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,100
And we run the risk of losing
all the ground we have managed to gain

606
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,100
in the last three years. Our spearhead...

607
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,100
General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent.

608
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,100
Yes, General, this is Stauffenberg.

609
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,800
...Russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force.

610
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,000
- Why?
- My Führer...

611
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,100
In some areas
they outnumber us seven to one.

612
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,500
If we can afford to give ground
along the Italian front, I further...

613
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,800
One thing is certain,

614
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,600
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

615
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,700
even at the expense...

616
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,900
In order to rebuild at this...

617
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,000
...already southwest of Dünaburg
and closing on Army Group at Lake Peipus.

618
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,600
If they are not immediately withdrawn,
it will be a catastrophe.

619
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,900
Get in. Drive.

620
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,400
I have orders from the Führer. Drive.

621
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,400
Drive! Drive!

622
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,300
As you were.

623
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,200
Get me the War Ministry.
General Olbricht. Olbricht!

624
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,100
The call is urgent!

625
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,700
General Olbricht's office.

626
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,400
I'm calling from the Wolf's Lair

627
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,200
with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

628
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Something terrible has happened.
The Führer is...

629
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,900
Fellgiebel?

630
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,100
Sever all communications.

631
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,800
- Sir?
- Just do it!

632
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,000
- Well, what did he say?
- I couldn't be sure.

633
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,500
Well, get him back on the line.

634
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,100
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

635
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,200
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

636
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,000
- Sorry, Colonel. No one gets in or out.
- We have an order from the Führer.

637
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,300
We have to get to the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

638
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,100
I'm very sorry Sir,
but my orders are to keep the gate...

639
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,100
- I just gave you an order, Sergeant.
- Sir!

640
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,300
Sir. Excuse me.

641
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,000
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

642
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,400
Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.
We initiate Valkyrie regardless.

643
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,100
Only Fromm can initiate. You know that.

644
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,100
Then tell him Hitler's dead.
Or arrest him. But do it now.

645
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,100
Sir, you have to give the order
to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only...

646
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,200
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

647
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,600
Get him back on the phone now.

648
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,000
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost.

649
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,500
The risk is too great.

650
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,500
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

651
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,900
He did his part,
and now you're abandoning him.

652
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,500
Field Marshal, sir. Stauffenberg here.
A Sergeant...

653
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,800
Kolbe, sir.

654
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,600
- What?
- Kolbe.

655
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,200
...Kolbe won't let me pass the main gate.

656
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,300
Yes, sir, I explained that.

657
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,100
Perhaps you can
make him understand, sir.

658
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,100
Everything's fine now, sir. Thank you.

659
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,000
Open the gate!

660
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,000
- At least put the Reserve Army on alert.
- When Stauffenberg returns,

661
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:58,400
when he gives me confirmation
that Hitler is dead, then we'll proceed.

662
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,800
- And where are you going?
- The same place as you are. Lunch.

663
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,900
Another standby alert.

664
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,400
Send it through. But keep me informed.

665
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:25,300
Sir. Another standby order.

666
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,900
In ancient Greece,
you would have been killed for this.

667
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,200
Lucky for you we've evolved.

668
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,200
Assemble the men.

669
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,000
Quiet, isn't it?

670
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,500
I'll see where our driver is.

671
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,400
This is von Haeften.
The Colonel and I are at the airfield.

672
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,000
There's no car. There's no one here.

673
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,500
You mean to tell me
the alert's only just gone out?

674
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,000
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me General Olbricht.

675
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,100
What's this?

676
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,600
- Explain this!
- Someone had to do something

677
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,700
while you were playing dead!

678
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800
We don't know that Hitler is not alive.

679
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:14,000
This is about Germany, for God's sake,
not you!

680
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,900
General Olbricht's office.
Colonel Stauffenberg. For you, sir.

681
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,300
- This is Olbricht.
- It's been three hours, Olbricht.

682
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,600
What the hell have you been doing?

683
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

684
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:48,600
Damn it! I saw the explosion myself!
We are committed.

685
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,300
- Dear God.
- Now, where is Fromm? Is he with us?

686
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,900
- Is he with us?
- No one has spoken to him yet.

687
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,100
You listen to me. Never mind Germany.
Never mind Europe.

688
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,400
Your life is at stake now.

689
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,900
And if you want to live through the night,
you'll do exactly as I say.

690
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,100
The second you hang up the phone,
initiate Valkyrie in Fromm's name.

691
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,100
Give him the choice to join us,
or place him under immediate arrest.

692
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,100
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

693
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,100
I'll be in Fromm's office in 15 minutes.
Be there when I arrive.

694
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Call Beck and the others.
Tell them it's time.

695
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,300
Put me through to Communications.

696
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,800
This is General Olbricht,

697
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:18,100
calling on behalf of General Fromm,
commander of the Reserve Army.

698
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,500
The Führer, Adolf Hitler, is dead.

699
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,100
A group of radicals in the SS

700
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,600
are attempting to seize control
of the government.

701
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,900
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

702
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,300
You have your orders. Pass them along.

703
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,700
Battalion. Attention!

704
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,800
The Führer...

705
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,900
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler,

706
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,800
is dead.

707
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:09,100
- Who told you the Führer was dead?
- General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair.

708
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,300
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

709
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,500
- Yes. Get me the Wolf's Lair.
- One moment, sir.

710
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,000
Wolf's Lair. May I connect you?

711
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,400
Yes. General Fromm
for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

712
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,800
- Keitel.
- Yes, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

713
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,600
but I wonder if you could tell me
what's happening.

714
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,400
The most incredible rumors
are circulating in Berlin.

715
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,000
I don't know what you mean.

716
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,400
There's talk
that the Führer has been assassinated.

717
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,600
Another failed attempt.

718
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,800
The Führer was never in danger.

719
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,200
By the way,
where's your man Stauffenberg?

720
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,900
Stauffenberg? He...
On his way back to Berlin, I would think.

721
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,900
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

722
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,700
- The Führer's fine.
- That is a lie. Adolf Hitler's dead.

723
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,400
- Operation Valkyrie is in effect.
- Only I can initiate Valkyrie.

724
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,700
You did.

725
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
This is treason.

726
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,900
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

727
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,700
Are you with us or not?

728
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,400
Do you realize what you've done?

729
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
- The Führer is alive.
- I delivered the bomb myself.

730
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,800
I saw the blast. He is dead.

731
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,100
- Are you with us?
- I don't believe this is happening.

732
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,500
- This is some kind of a joke.
- Are you with us or not?

733
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,900
Colonel, if what you say is true,
you should shoot yourself immediately.

734
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,500
- The rest of you are under arrest.
- No, General. You are.

735
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,000
I don't know where you think this is going.

736
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,600
Get me Operations.

737
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,300
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

738
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,800
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

739
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,900
No one gets in or out

740
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,500
without authorization
from General Olbricht's office.

741
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:41,700
General Beck.
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

742
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,900
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

743
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,800
- Colonel Stauffenberg?
- Yes.

744
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,400
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of the Berlin Police.

745
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,100
You will have no interference
from my men. You have my word.

746
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,900
Thank you.

747
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:52,100
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

748
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,600
Thank you for coming.

749
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,000
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

750
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,900
that the government quarter is ours

751
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,300
and SS Command has been cleared
of every living soul.

752
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,300
You all know what must be done.

753
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,600
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

754
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,500
has seen its last sunrise.

755
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,200
Yes, sir.
All replacements have been authorized.

756
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,700
In fact, Field Marshal Witzleben

757
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,700
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

758
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,200
That's exactly why he's been appointed.

759
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,800
If he was a member of the Party,
he'd be locked up as a suspect.

760
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,100
Yes, sir, I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

761
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,900
The commanding officer
at the 11th District, please.

762
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,000
I need a decision, Major.

763
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,100
Tell your men that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

764
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,900
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the Tegel broadcasting station?

765
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,700
Can I speak to the commanding officer
in Hannover, please?

766
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,000
We represent
a different form of government.

767
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,500
I'd be careful who you said that to.

768
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,100
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

769
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,000
- Yes, Paris. France.
- Not since they murdered the Führer.

770
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:23,600
And, Josef. Thank you.

771
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,100
You've made the right decision.

772
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,200
District 13 is ours.

773
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,300
By order of Field Marshal von Witzleben,

774
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,600
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

775
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,700
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to
connect with Major-General Thadden.

776
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,200
No, I've already spoken to 413 Battalion.

777
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,900
You'll have no trouble getting 
reinforcements. Yes, Sir.

778
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,900
This is Colonel Stauffenberg. The order 
explaining everything will be in your hand shortly.

779
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,600
No, these are your orders. Excellent.

780
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,200
My wife is in Bamberg with my children.

781
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,700
Would you please try to raise them
on the phone?

782
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

783
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,800
General Schwedler
has issued the Valkyrie orders

784
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,900
and has sealed off headquarters.

785
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,900
Good. Check on the radio stations
every 20 minutes

786
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,200
till we have confirmation they're ours.

787
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,300
Well, with all due respect, sir,
you can't believe everything you hear.

788
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,200
That is SS propaganda. He's dead.

789
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,300
Only the commander of the Home Army
is authorized to give orders.

790
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,600
General? Sir.

791
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,400
- Hello, Christian?
- Our men in the transport offices

792
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,000
have secured
the railway communications network,

793
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,100
but there are repeater stations...

794
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,100
- Yes. I give you my word.
...telephone and telegraph offices,

795
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,300
emergency broadcast outposts.
We need more men.

796
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,900
Thank you. Give my best to your family.

797
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,400
He's with us.

798
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,500
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

799
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,100
Tell them to place all available units
under our control.

800
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,900
You have your men.
Now get control of the radio.

801
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,900
We have control
of the government quarter.

802
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
We don't have Berlin yet.

803
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,100
- What is it now, Sergeant?
- Arrest orders, sir.

804
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,100
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

805
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,800
to arrest Reich Minister Goebbels.

806
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:43,000
The other is from the Wolf's Lair,
to arrest Colonel Stauffenberg.

807
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,600
Send them both through.

808
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:56,600
Our job is not to interpret orders,
our job is to pass them along, regardless.

809
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,400
- Yes, but...
- That will be all, Sergeant.

810
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,300
This is treason! You're all going
to pay for this! Do you hear me?

811
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,400
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and Goebbels.

812
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,900
Do we arrest them both?

813
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,400
I would hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

814
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,100
- You really think it's a coup?
- Of that I am certain.

815
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,700
What I can't say is which side we're on.

816
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,100
Come with me.

817
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,100
District 4, Dresden and Leipzig.
District 12, Wiesbaden. District 9...

818
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,800
They've had no trouble
getting reinforcements,

819
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,900
and I rely on you seeing
that this gets done.

820
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,600
I've just spoken to Colonel Linstow.

821
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,700
They've arrested 1,200 SS
and Gestapo officials in Paris.

822
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,300
Not a single shot fired.

823
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,500
Early reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on word from Prague.

824
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,000
Incredible.

825
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,000
I'm ready to be connected.

826
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:14,600
- Minister Goebbels?
- What can I do for you, Major?

827
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,800
My battalion has an order
to blockade the government quarter

828
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,000
and place you under arrest.

829
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:26,300
Are you
a dedicated National Socialist, Major?

830
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,900
Yes, sir.

831
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,000
Major Remer here. Hello?

832
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,100
Do you recognize my voice?

833
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,000
- Yes, my Führer.
- Then listen to me very carefully.

834
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,200
I want these traitors taken alive.

835
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,000
Yes, my Führer.

836
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,800
You heard what he said.
The Führer wants the traitors taken alive.

837
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,400
Yes, sir.

838
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:49,400
It's a coup, all right. We can't afford
to remain neutral any longer.

839
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,800
You have to make a decision.

840
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,900
When it's over,
we better wind up on the right side.

841
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,800
Very well.

842
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,600
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

843
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,400
Stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

844
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,200
Release these men!

845
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,900
But they're part of the coup.

846
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,400
I've just been on the phone
with Hitler himself.

847
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,500
We are the coup, you idiot.
We've been duped.

848
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,200
We've lost contact with District 11.

849
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:46,500
The switchboard is overloaded.
Give it 10 minutes and try again.

850
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,700
Give me General Bieler, District 11.

851
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,200
We still need...

852
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,000
- I don't want to leave any section...
- Keep trying.

853
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,800
Out of my way. Where is General Fromm?

854
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:07,400
General Fromm is no longer in command.
I am.

855
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,100
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

856
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,300
The Führer is dead.
The SS are staging a coup.

857
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,000
We've initiated Operation Valkyrie
to crush the uprising

858
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,600
and save Hitler's Germany.

859
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:21,000
You will present the order to your troops.

860
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,300
I will do no such thing
until I speak to General Fromm.

861
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,700
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

862
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:34,800
This is treason. I will take no part.
The Führer is not dead.

863
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,600
- The Führer is not dead!
- Stop him!

864
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,200
The Führer is not dead!
The Führer is not dead!

865
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:44,800
I have sworn an oath! This is treason!

866
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,000
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

867
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,600
You are all making a terrible mistake!

868
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,600
The Führer is not dead!

869
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,900
The Führer is not dead!

870
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,900
Please try my wife again.

871
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,500
Bamberg, please.

872
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,900
Take your hands off me!

873
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,900
Sir.

874
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,800
Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

875
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,800
in the past week alone.

876
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,500
The air force,
engaged in low-flying offensives

877
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,000
- on enemy concentrations...
- Lieutenant.

878
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,200
I can't get through to General Gerlach.

879
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,500
Send a runner down to his office.
Bring him here.

880
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,000
Yes, thank you.

881
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,500
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

882
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,000
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

883
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,900
He told me he'd return my call.
I've yet to hear from him.

884
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,500
I trust everything in your district
is under control?

885
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:13,800
Hans, I need your answer.
There's no more time for indecision.

886
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,500
And the General knows I'm waiting?

887
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,000
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

888
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:19,900
The army gave their oath to a liar, Hans.

889
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,600
- Hello?
- One who's broken his own oath...

890
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,100
- Hello?
...to the people a hundred times over.

891
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,000
Hans, listen to me...

892
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,500
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

893
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,500
Today, an attempt
was made on the Führer's life.

894
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,000
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

895
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,500
He resumed his work immediately.

896
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:15,100
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

897
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,100
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

898
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,600
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

899
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,800
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

900
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:27,200
Send the following orders
to all Reserve Army commanders.

901
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:30,200
"Broadcast incorrect. Führer is dead.

902
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,600
"Operation Valkyrie still in effect."

903
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,700
... and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

904
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:43,500
Long live our Führer, Adolf Hitler,

905
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,800
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

906
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,300
I saw the blast.

907
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,700
I saw the blast.

908
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:11,200
Today an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

909
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:15,800
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

910
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,900
- I'm sorry.
- He resumed his work immediately.

911
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,700
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

912
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,300
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

913
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,500
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

914
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:32,100
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

915
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,300
Shortly after the attempt on his life,

916
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,900
the Führer was joined
by Reichsmarschall Göring

917
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,600
and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

918
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:50,300
Stay tuned for the Führer's address
to the German people.

919
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,700
My family?

920
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,100
Our lines have been cut.

921
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,300
- I'm sorry.
- Go.

922
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,900
It's all right. Go.

923
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,999
General. Sir.
We have to get you out of here.

924
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,400
Get him out of here.

925
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,200
- Stop!
- Stand down!

926
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,600
- I said stop!
- I said stand down!

927
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,700
Hold your fire!

928
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,700
Colonel Stauffenberg?

929
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,100
By orders of the Führer,
you're under arrest.

930
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:11,300
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

931
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,200
I will hear them now.

932
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,600
Very well.

933
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,800
A court-martial convened by me
in the Führer's absence

934
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,900
will pronounce sentence.
Beck, you're under arrest.

935
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,300
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

936
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,600
and the Colonel
whose name I will not mention,

937
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,100
are condemned to death.

938
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,600
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

939
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,200
Noted, Major.

940
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,900
I'd like a pistol, please.

941
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,500
For personal reasons.

942
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,300
Get on with it.

943
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,600
- With all respect...
- That will be all, Major.

944
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:08,000
Killing us won't hide your involvement.

945
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,300
My involvement?
I don't know what you're talking about.

946
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,200
- You knew and did nothing.
- You're as guilty as any of us.

947
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:18,100
- Spare me, Lieutenant.
- No one will be spared.

948
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,100
I'm thinking of earlier times.

949
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:45,700
This is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here!

950
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:50,800
A field marshal and a general declare
that they could do things better

951
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,600
than he who is the Führer of us all!

952
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:57,300
- You confess to having said this?
- Yes.

953
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:07,000
My fellow Germans.
I speak to you tonight for two reasons.

954
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,300
First, so that you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

955
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:17,300
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

956
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,100
without parallel in German history.

957
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,800
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

958
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,100
have conspired to eliminate me.

959
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:34,200
Except for a few bruises and burns,
I was completely untouched.

960
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,500
I see in this the hand of Providence,

961
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,300
directing me to complete my work.

962
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,800
Look them in the eye.

963
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,100
They'll remember you.

964
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,600
Olbricht!

965
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,400
Make ready.

966
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:30,900
Well, we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

967
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,300
Safe! Stand!

968
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,500
Fire!

969
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,200
Stand!

970
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,000
Stauffenberg!

971
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,500
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

972
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,900
Make ready!

973
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:22,800
Aim!

974
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,200
Safe! Stand!

975
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:51,100
You may hand us over to the executioner,

976
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,800
but in three months' time,

977
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,800
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book

978
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,900
and drag you alive
through the dirt in the streets.

979
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:02,800
Take him away.

980
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,600
Make ready.

981
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,100
Aim.

982
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,700
- Long live sacred Germany!
- Fire!

983
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,600
Stand.
