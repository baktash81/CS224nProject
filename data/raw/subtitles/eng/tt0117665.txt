1
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:14,393
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

2
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:20,025
This is my story and that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,440
Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

4
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:29,651
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

5
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:33,454
...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

6
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:39,248
I'm the only one who could speak for
them...and the children we were.

7
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,222
My three friends and
I were inseparable...

8
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,282
...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

9
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,741
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

10
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,452
...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

11
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:38,287
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

12
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,329
Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

13
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:43,956
and Eastern European laborers.
Hard men living hard lives.

14
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:57,169
We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

15
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,212
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

16
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,215
I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

17
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,303
Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

18
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:22,013
Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

19
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,096
The will of the Church was forceful.

20
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,222
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

21
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,391
Yet, despite the harshness of life...

22
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,642
...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

23
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,351
...enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

24
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,602
Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

25
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,688
When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

26
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,604
...and, in some cases, final.

27
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,606
A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

28
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,066
A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

29
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,859
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

30
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,737
Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence...ruled by corruption.

31
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,404
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

32
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,281
We each served as altar boys.

33
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,741
Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

34
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,699
since the funeral included a $3 fee...

35
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,075
...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

36
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,326
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

37
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,077
...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

38
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,495
Two weeks into the new school year,

39
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,538
I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

40
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,372
...and I was ready for the big leagues.

41
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,415
In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

42
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,749
...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

43
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,168
...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

44
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,418
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

45
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:55,340
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

46
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,759
And you will receive the gifts...

47
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,259
...of the Holy Spirit.

48
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,470
It's gonna be a great day and your...

49
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:11,972
...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptized...

50
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,807
...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

51
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,765
-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

52
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:18,932
What clacker?

53
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,766
Now!

54
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,309
Let everyone rise.

55
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:26,769
Let us pray.

56
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,398
Nuns are such easy targets.

57
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,776
John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

58
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,861
We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

59
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,779
And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

60
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,320
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

61
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:54,072
...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

62
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,739
Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

63
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:59,114
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

64
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:00,949
...committed by people we knew.

65
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,535
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

66
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,744
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,327
What if our mothers are out there?

68
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,953
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

69
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:12,663
What if we hear something worse?

70
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,163
Like what?

71
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:17,539
Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

72
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:22,040
Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

73
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,754
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

74
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,379
I...sleep with married men.

75
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,255
Men with families.

76
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:43,508
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

77
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,385
Yes?

78
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,886
You see, I'm...I'm pregnant.

79
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,221
The father?

80
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,555
Take a number.

81
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:00,391
What are you going to do?

82
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,933
I know what you want me to do.

83
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,267
And I know what I should do.

84
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,601
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

85
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:12,811
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,562
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

87
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,772
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

88
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:26,483
She knew.

89
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,401
Yeah, she knew.

90
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,442
Why do you think she told us all that?

91
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,111
I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

92
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,989
Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

93
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,823
...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

94
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,116
...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

95
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,825
He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

96
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,660
He was a friend...a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

97
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,245
You know what crap like
that does to your body?

98
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,830
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

99
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,789
Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

100
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,663
No, nothing.

101
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,623
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,665
Who says?

103
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:10,541
Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

104
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,919
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

105
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:13,961
You don't?

106
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,669
Maybe I got the wrong information.

107
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,254
I guess you did.

108
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,380
I'll see you later tonight.

109
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,048
What's tonight?

110
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,966
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

111
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,965
...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

112
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,299
Your mother said you'd love to help.

113
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,966
I bet she did.

114
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:37,137
Shakes...l don't want you
getting into any trouble.

115
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,304
Come on, Father, you know I never do.

116
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,513
That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

117
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:42,722
That's it?

118
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,555
That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

119
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,306
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

120
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,265
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

121
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,306
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,476
All right...see you.

123
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,395
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

124
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:01,062
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

125
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:05,564
But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

126
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,647
Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

127
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,192
her mother having died at childbirth.

128
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,068
Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

129
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:15,984
We could always count on Carol...

130
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,278
...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

131
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,028
While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

132
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,237
...waiting to see the skaters perform...

133
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,653
...we each had one eye in a hole...

134
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:27,280
...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

135
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,781
...get into their skaters' outfits.

136
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,575
This is what heaven must be about.

137
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,078
Carol, you want to take a look?

138
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,537
Like it's something I haven't seen?

139
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,206
You're so lucky!

140
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,749
She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

141
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,584
When my friends and I were young,

142
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,667
...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

143
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,085
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

144
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,421
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

145
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,923
But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

146
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:12,632
There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

147
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:16,759
...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

148
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:20,092
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

149
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:23,677
I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

150
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,803
As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

151
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,263
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

152
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,972
And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

153
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:37,017
...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

154
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,891
...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

155
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,852
King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

156
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,519
You know what King Benny does?

157
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:48,313
He waits. He waits 8 years...

158
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,855
...to get even with that prick.

159
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,314
He walks into a public bath house.

160
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,605
The guy's soaking in the tub.

161
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:58,816
King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

162
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,778
Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

163
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,821
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

164
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,029
Then he pulls out a gun...

165
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,322
...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

166
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,032
Then he says to the guy:

167
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,201
"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

168
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,035
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

169
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:28,371
Revenge!

170
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,247
Revenge!

171
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,373
Can I talk to you for a minute?

172
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,915
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

173
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,916
You're the butcher's kid...am I right?

174
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,085
What kind of a job are you looking for?

175
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,794
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

176
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:50,838
It doesn't matter?

177
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,172
Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

178
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:56,880
Who is everybody?

179
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:58,756
People from the neighborhood.

180
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,841
Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

181
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,009
They know you got jobs.

182
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:12,429
Sorry I wasted your time.

183
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,013
Hold on a sec!

184
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:18,723
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

185
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,724
-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

186
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:21,933
You'll be here?

187
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,892
I'm always here.

188
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,062
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

189
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,062
...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

190
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,857
In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

191
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:42,483
...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

192
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,024
It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

193
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,568
Come on, let's go! Right here.

194
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,278
Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

195
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,611
You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

196
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,903
Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,948
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

198
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:03,407
Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

199
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,283
This time they took my money!

200
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:06,950
You took the money from the boy?

201
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:08,200
The money they took is in the bag.

202
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:09,033
Let me have the bag.

203
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:09,867
Fuck you!

204
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,160
How about now?

205
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,410
All right, take it easy.

206
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:17,413
You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

207
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:18,538
Let me have the bag.

208
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:23,247
Now, go!

209
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:24,291
What about them?

210
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,124
You care?

211
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,000
Then go! Go! Run!

212
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,835
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

213
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:33,503
What you need?

214
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,003
My friends.

215
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:38,088
Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

216
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,923
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

217
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,798
Okay, get your friends.

218
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:48,591
Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

219
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,675
He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

220
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,428
...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

221
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,470
He didn't want that to happen to us.

222
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,929
You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

223
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:58,762
It pays.

224
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,137
A lot of things pay.

225
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,138
Not like this.

226
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,765
Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

227
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:09,392
Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

228
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:11,019
Good shot!

229
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,727
I found an art class for you to take.

230
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,394
You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

231
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,811
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

232
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,063
It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

233
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,979
Maybe, or it could be the first step.

234
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:25,273
First step to what?

235
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,482
Doing something with your life.

236
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,148
You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

237
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:29,066
You all can get out of here.

238
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,984
Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

239
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,152
Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

240
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,987
It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

241
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:41,236
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

242
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,862
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

243
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:46,530
He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

244
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,908
Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

245
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,242
Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

246
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:53,867
...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

247
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,743
It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

248
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,369
Well, for Michelangelo it was.

249
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,619
Michelangelo needed the job...

250
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,746
...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

251
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:05,205
And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

252
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:05,997
What's his father?

253
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,832
He was like a low-level...con guy.

254
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,541
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

255
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,374
Goats?

256
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,875
Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

257
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,710
-Chickens?
-Chickens?

258
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,085
You know what happened?

259
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,378
He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

260
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,419
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

261
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,503
Did he pay off the loans?

262
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,795
Every single one of them.

263
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,881
How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

264
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:29,547
It took him about 9 years.

265
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:30,965
9 years?!

266
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,299
That's a big ceiling!

267
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,425
I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

268
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:36,550
And he had a bum leg.

269
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,927
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

270
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,803
Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

271
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,095
You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

272
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,138
Sixteenth Chapel?

273
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,098
Who painted the other fifteen?

274
00:16:55,725 --> 00:17:00,059
Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

275
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,977
...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

276
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,562
Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

277
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:10,314
...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

278
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,855
...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

279
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,481
...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

280
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,942
...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

281
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:20,735
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

282
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,278
...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

283
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,572
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

284
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:34,490
...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

285
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:37,324
...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

286
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,286
For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

287
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:46,662
They might as well have occurred in
another country...in another century.

288
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:49,413
Our attention was elsewhere.

289
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:53,456
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

290
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,123
...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

291
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,124
A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

292
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,626
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

293
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:08,504
Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

294
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,213
I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

295
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:10,920
John Reilly.

296
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,337
The little punk!

297
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:15,006
He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

298
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:16,505
You put him in the hospital.

299
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:20,175
He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

300
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,800
What are you? About 220, 230?

301
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:27,136
You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weighs?

302
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:31,053
80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

303
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,221
If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

304
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,848
Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

305
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,433
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

306
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:44,933
And I may not be in your division, but
I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

307
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:48,811
And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

308
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,020
...to pray over your body.

309
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,605
See you in church.

310
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,775
Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

311
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:07,611
It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

312
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:13,737
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

313
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,406
...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

314
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,407
Come on, Davy...take this chump out.
He got nothing!

315
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:21,366
Shut up!

316
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:22,742
Who's that?

317
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,075
His sister.

318
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:25,910
What happened to her?

319
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:29,243
I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

320
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,577
Worry about the game, come on.

321
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:34,286
Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

322
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:36,664
He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

323
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,956
Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

324
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:40,539
This is it...home run!

325
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,209
Easy, Mike.

326
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,958
What the fuck you
looking at, little dick?!

327
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,292
She's nothing but charm.

328
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,752
Come on, Davy!

329
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,252
You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

330
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,587
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

331
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:56,671
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

332
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,672
You could've helped her
across the street...

333
00:19:58,714 --> 00:19:59,923
...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

334
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:01,173
You didn't have to throw the game.

335
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,590
Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

336
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,925
You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

337
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,634
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

338
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,051
He's no better than you.

339
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:12,677
He was today.

340
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,346
No. You let him be.

341
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,888
All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

342
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:20,055
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

343
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,598
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

344
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,933
And when it does, it's
going to hurt...bad.

345
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,642
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

346
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,184
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

347
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,894
Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

348
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:35,436
Do you see that street?

349
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:39,187
That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetizers.

350
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,689
Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

351
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,272
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

352
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,608
Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

353
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:52,108
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

354
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:54,319
All right, all right, calm down.

355
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,486
It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

356
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,070
Be funny, limp dick.

357
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,403
Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

358
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,238
You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

359
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,240
Thanks a lot, fat man.

360
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,741
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

361
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,826
But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

362
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:13,325
...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

363
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,327
...was more than the right thing to do.

364
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,456
Come on, let's go swimming.

365
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:28,874
The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

366
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,167
...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

367
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

368
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,669
a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

369
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,836
Can't you feel the breeze up here?

370
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,920
What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

371
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,003
The devil couldn't stand this heat.

372
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,379
Will you guys shut up, please?

373
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:44,671
I'm trying to get my burn.

374
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,171
It's 98 degrees!

375
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,923
-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

376
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,258
We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

377
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:54,634
I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

378
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,677
I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

379
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:02,387
We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air...choose.

380
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,055
Air is probably safer, Mike.

381
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:08,515
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

382
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,723
Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

383
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:12,141
Yours!

384
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,309
-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

385
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,144
-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

386
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,309
-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

387
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:20,477
-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

388
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:21,310
I'm not going.

389
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,477
-Why?
-It's too hot.

390
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,562
If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

391
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,023
Mustard and onions. No soda.

392
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:31,648
I know you!

393
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,483
I look like a lot of people.

394
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:35,650
The scam was simple.

395
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,235
I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

396
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,069
The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

397
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,405
This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

398
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:50,031
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

399
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,364
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

400
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,449
...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

401
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,325
I'm gonna need two napkins?

402
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,619
Pay my money, thief!

403
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,206
Wow! Ketchup!

404
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,622
I took it from him and ran!

405
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,875
I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

406
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:21,544
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

407
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:24,129
You gonna give me two?

408
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,591
You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

409
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,759
Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

410
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,260
They're heavier than shit!

411
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,594
Think we can push it, the three of us?

412
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:45,636
Push it where?

413
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,886
A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

414
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,721
...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

415
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,938
The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

416
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:16,939
I was on the other side of the street.

417
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,026
He was beat...but not beaten.

418
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,109
He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

419
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,861
Give it up.

420
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,034
What's wrong, Mikey?

421
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:46,160
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

422
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:48,827
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

423
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,996
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

424
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:56,538
-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

425
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:57,665
He still near?

426
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:00,208
I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

427
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,793
The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

428
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,876
We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

429
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,210
Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

430
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,337
We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

431
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,672
Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

432
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:18,422
To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

433
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,340
But, we would all pay a price.

434
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:25,050
It only took a minute...but
in that minute...everything changed.

435
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:27,301
Guys, I can't hold it!

436
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:29,176
-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

437
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,220
I can't hold it!

438
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,849
Stop! God, no! !

439
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:11,443
Damn!

440
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:20,822
Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

441
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:23,907
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

442
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,324
I think we just killed a man.

443
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:33,954
While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

444
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:38,537
...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

445
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:40,497
I'm sorry, dad.

446
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,206
'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

447
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,541
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

448
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,125
You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

449
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:51,917
Ma! Come look, Ma!

450
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,418
I don't know. Bastard!

451
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,085
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

452
00:26:57,253 --> 00:27:01,755
Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

453
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:29,558
I hear you're short an altar boy.

454
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,602
You still remember what to do?

455
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,102
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

456
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:42,313
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

457
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,273
Get ready...we got 5 minutes
till show time.

458
00:27:58,484 --> 00:27:59,776
I'm gonna miss this.

459
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,322
I'm gonna miss all of this.

460
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:09,781
I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

461
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:18,035
I could run...we all could run.

462
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:22,369
Disappear for a while.

463
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,747
Nobody's gonna come looking.

464
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,873
Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

465
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,168
You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

466
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,921
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

467
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:48,546
You've gotta face this.

468
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,049
I can't, Father.

469
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,134
I don't want to face it.

470
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:04,011
I'm too scared to face it.

471
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:07,137
I'm scared, too.

472
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:12,097
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

473
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:19,059
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

474
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:21,476
You understand?

475
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,813
Come on. We got an audience.

476
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:39,276
I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

477
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,653
Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

478
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,987
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

479
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:56,572
This is one of my favorites.

480
00:29:57,908 --> 00:29:58,909
What is?

481
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,661
"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren...you do to me."

482
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:10,329
Come on.

483
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,998
We never saw the vendor as a man...

484
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,707
...not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood.

485
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,001
And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

486
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,711
We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

487
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,629
...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

488
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,464
We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

489
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:39,549
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

490
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,968
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

491
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,969
...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

492
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,010
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

493
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:55,638
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

494
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:58,556
...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

495
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,015
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:01,890
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

497
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:06,017
Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

498
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,185
...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

499
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,351
...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

500
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:15,729
...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

501
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,480
Michael Sullivan.

502
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,940
The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

503
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,690
...for a period of no more than
18 months...

504
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:25,150
...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

505
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:28,152
And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

506
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:31,403
...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

507
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:34,112
...l would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

508
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,531
I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

509
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:40,198
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

510
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:45,032
Could you do me a favor?

511
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,574
What do you want? Name it.

512
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:48,950
The past couple of weeks...

513
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,703
...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

514
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,702
Could you watch over them for me?

515
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,746
I will.

516
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:59,247
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

517
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,122
You mean, you want me to lie?

518
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,791
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

519
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,085
Come on, let's go.

520
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:12,919
Be strong.

521
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,295
I will.

522
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:55,268
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

523
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:57,353
...housed in 5 separate units.

524
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,937
From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

525
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,438
...wanted it to resemble...

526
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,314
...some kind of nice
school or university.

527
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:10,691
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

528
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:15,777
We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

529
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:19,653
...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

530
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,654
...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

531
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:27,656
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

532
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:40,870
Hello, Carcaterra.

533
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,038
Toss your clothes on the floor.

534
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:45,830
Here?

535
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:48,248
Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

536
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:49,374
Now, lose the clothes.

537
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,249
In front of you?

538
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:01,002
Let's go, let's go!

539
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,384
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

540
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,009
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

541
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:20,385
I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

542
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,100
Everything.

543
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,766
You want me to stand here naked?

544
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,058
Now you're catching on.

545
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,603
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

546
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:50,522
Now, what?

547
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,358
Get dressed.

548
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,901
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

549
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:05,404
...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

550
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,905
Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

551
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,989
...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

552
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:13,322
...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

553
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:17,825
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

554
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,909
Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

555
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,118
...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

556
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:27,577
It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

557
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:29,914
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

558
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,831
A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

559
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:36,624
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

560
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,125
And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

561
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:18,223
What the fuck did you do that for?

562
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,057
You got close to me.

563
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,226
So?

564
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:24,475
It bothers me.

565
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:28,394
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

566
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:27,125
You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

567
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,212
You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

568
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:32,960
...the day you walked in here.

569
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:39,214
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

570
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:40,380
There's nothing to see.

571
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:44,298
Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

572
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:47,758
Go on.

573
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,472
That go for me too?

574
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:01,471
No, it don't go for you.

575
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:06,349
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

576
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:11,143
You and me...we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

577
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:12,601
Maybe at dinner.

578
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:17,187
So...you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

579
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:20,980
I got to smell it.

580
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:24,313
You got to smell it...

581
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:28,650
That's good.

582
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:31,109
Where you going?

583
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,151
You said to get lunch.

584
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:37,194
You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

585
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,695
...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

586
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,863
You could smell it.

587
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,699
I'm not hungry.

588
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,992
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

589
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:54,828
You eat...because I'm
telling you to eat.

590
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:01,120
I'm still not hungry.

591
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:09,290
I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

592
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:10,333
Now, eat.

593
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,044
Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

594
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:20,460
Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

595
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,506
Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

596
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:29,714
You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

597
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:33,717
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

598
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:35,676
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

599
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:41,555
None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

600
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,847
You got that? Hey you....

601
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:47,973
There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

602
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,307
Come on now, that's good.

603
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,891
Show the boys how you follow my rules.

604
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,392
Rules! You understand?

605
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,227
Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

606
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:02,146
Your shift's over, Nokes.

607
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,896
I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

608
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:09,189
...l gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

609
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:12,399
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

610
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:14,399
Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

611
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:17,567
This one, I'm staying in.

612
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,404
Don't fuck with me, boy.

613
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:28,613
No, Nokes...you fuck with me.

614
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,614
I'm asking you.

615
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,076
You're eating into my shift.

616
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:46,580
I'll get out of your way...for now.

617
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,372
I'll take what I can get.

618
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:53,582
You boys get off your knees.

619
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,545
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

620
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,423
I don't understand you boys.

621
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:15,716
I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

622
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:18,050
You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

623
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,510
I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

624
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:25,302
...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

625
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:28,679
And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

626
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:32,096
You had rules, and you had discipline.

627
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:38,224
Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

628
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:43,061
Right around there to the right.
There you go.

629
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:54,190
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

630
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:57,607
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

631
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,069
We understand each other?

632
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,069
Turn and face the wall.

633
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,742
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

634
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,617
...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

635
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:35,373
What do you want?

636
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:38,998
A blow job.

637
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
Down on your knees.

638
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:54,380
Face the wall.

639
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:14,136
There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

640
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,846
I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

641
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,598
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

642
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,182
...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

643
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,684
...and the end of my childhood.

644
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:37,853
Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

645
00:43:38,688 --> 00:43:41,022
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

646
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:42,146
...all that had happened to me.

647
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:45,691
Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

648
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,857
Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

649
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:50,026
John's mother came up once a month.

650
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:56,113
But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

651
00:43:58,363 --> 00:44:01,364
So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

652
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:04,614
Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

653
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,908
If we did, reprisals would be severe.

654
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:24,291
You lost a few pounds.

655
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,624
It's not exactly home cooking.

656
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,291
Sit down.

657
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,459
This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

658
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:36,627
I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

659
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:39,253
I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

660
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,087
...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

661
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:44,464
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

662
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,757
Anything at all?

663
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:51,508
You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

664
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,885
I appreciate it and all, but...

665
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:58,760
...l don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

666
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,981
I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

667
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,899
You have any friends not in jail?

668
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,442
Not as many as I would like.

669
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,275
What's he in for?

670
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:41,696
Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

671
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:44,154
And he's a good friend?

672
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:45,947
He's my best friend.

673
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:49,990
We hung out together.

674
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:53,033
We were close...
just like you and the guys.

675
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:06,830
We were both sent up here.

676
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,248
That's right. And it wasn't easy...

677
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,335
...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

678
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:25,463
This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

679
00:46:30,173 --> 00:46:32,590
Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

680
00:46:33,715 --> 00:46:36,006
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

681
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:39,008
I've got to go, Father.

682
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:48,679
I'll see you in the Kitchen.

683
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:52,055
I'm counting on you.

684
00:46:54,555 --> 00:46:56,683
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

685
00:46:57,892 --> 00:47:01,559
Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

686
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:06,353
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

687
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,437
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,525
I didn't want to let him go.

689
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:23,401
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

690
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:33,572
A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

691
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,615
...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

692
00:47:36,782 --> 00:47:38,115
There were other cries, too.

693
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,243
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

694
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:45,536
They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

695
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,328
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

696
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,955
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

697
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:56,290
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

698
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,706
...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

699
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:18,298
I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

700
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:22,174
There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

701
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:27,010
This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

702
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:33,847
I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

703
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:36,013
Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

704
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:46,600
-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

705
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:49,602
No. You did a great
job on your book report.

706
00:48:51,936 --> 00:48:54,687
You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

707
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:58,189
It's my favorite.
I like it more since I've been here.

708
00:48:58,981 --> 00:48:59,605
Why is that?

709
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,815
It's like...he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

710
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,485
Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

711
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:11,527
And he learned from it.

712
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,028
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

713
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:20,488
-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

714
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:24,198
You got a copy of the book at home?

715
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:26,701
I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

716
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:29,033
No, it's not the same thing.

717
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:32,035
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

718
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:34,870
I've got something for you.

719
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:38,079
I thought you might like to have it.

720
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,037
Are you serious?

721
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:43,038
Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

722
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:46,125
-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

723
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,624
You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

724
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:49,875
It's been a while.

725
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:54,419
-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

726
00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:58,254
That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

727
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,505
You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

728
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,796
Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

729
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,716
...think the Count can
hold their attention.

730
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,215
He's got a shot.

731
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,341
Any particular section
I should read from?

732
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,759
That's easy...the part where
he escapes from prison.

733
00:50:25,432 --> 00:50:28,266
There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

734
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,312
It was only a game...just a touch
football game, nothing more.

735
00:50:41,146 --> 00:50:42,897
But a game I wish we
had never played.

736
00:50:43,939 --> 00:50:47,773
Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

737
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:50,775
Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

738
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:52,983
We had a 2 hour practice.

739
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:55,109
It didn't matter much.

740
00:50:55,484 --> 00:50:58,485
We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

741
00:50:59,152 --> 00:51:00,613
Who's the toughest guy here?

742
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:02,821
How do you mean, tough?

743
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,988
Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

744
00:51:05,156 --> 00:51:07,156
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

745
00:51:09,115 --> 00:51:12,616
Michael saw an opening...a chance
to bring the game to our level.

746
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:16,785
Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

747
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:21,703
Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

748
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,622
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

749
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:28,040
I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

750
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:29,831
...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

751
00:51:29,915 --> 00:51:30,666
Why?

752
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:31,999
Look man...

753
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,999
...guards stay clear of me, all right?

754
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,666
They stay back and let me do my time.

755
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,835
If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

756
00:51:38,002 --> 00:51:39,628
...they just might change my cushion.

757
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:43,003
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

758
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:44,504
You do every day.

759
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:48,505
-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

760
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:54,715
They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

761
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:56,133
You're just an animal to them.

762
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,967
-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

763
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:02,844
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

764
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:04,887
Then why, white boy, why?

765
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:09,430
To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

766
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,432
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

767
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,767
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:17,101
I call heads.

769
00:52:20,226 --> 00:52:22,228
He called heads.
It is a head.

770
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:25,104
Let's go.

771
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:38,693
You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

772
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,405
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

773
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:55,074
We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

774
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:56,740
This shit feels good.

775
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:04,744
Fuck!

776
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:13,164
Get the fuck off me!

777
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,252
Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

778
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:32,922
For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

779
00:53:33,548 --> 00:53:35,464
...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

780
00:53:35,631 --> 00:53:37,757
...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

781
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:41,174
...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

782
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:45,260
For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

783
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,601
Rizzo! Rizzo!

784
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:21,315
Rizzo...Rizzo.

785
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:26,192
Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

786
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:32,445
For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

787
00:54:33,112 --> 00:54:37,447
It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

788
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:42,531
I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

789
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:47,368
Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain...suffering his own demons.

790
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,119
Rizzo was there, too.

791
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:53,827
I had lost any sense of time.

792
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:35,845
I thought you'd never wake up.

793
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,513
I thought I'd never want to.

794
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:42,055
John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

795
00:55:43,598 --> 00:55:47,267
How are they?
They're alive.

796
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,060
Who isn't?

797
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:52,976
Rizzo.

798
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,853
They killed him?

799
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:03,064
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

800
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:09,400
Rizzo was dead because of us.

801
00:56:10,816 --> 00:56:12,817
We made him think that going
up against the guards...

802
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,318
...in a meaningless football game...

803
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:18,069
...had some value...that it would
give us a reason to go on.

804
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:20,947
Once again, we were wrong.

805
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,448
Did they give you
your release date yet?

806
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:26,948
Nokes had a letter from the warden.

807
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:29,659
Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up....

808
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:31,659
When do you figure?

809
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,660
End of spring, early
summer or something.

810
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,285
I wish we were coming with you.

811
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,663
It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

812
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:46,289
No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

813
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:51,667
When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

814
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,292
Shave a month or two off.

815
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:56,126
-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

816
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,545
Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

817
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,796
I don't want anybody to know.

818
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:06,297
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

819
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,798
...not my mother. Nobody.

820
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:11,966
I don't either.

821
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:14,299
I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

822
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,678
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

823
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:21,387
Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

824
00:57:22,345 --> 00:57:24,639
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

825
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:30,973
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

826
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:34,517
So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

827
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:36,851
The truth stays with us.

828
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:41,853
I want to be able to sleep one night...

829
00:57:43,394 --> 00:57:46,980
...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

830
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,690
If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

831
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,153
Someday, John, I promise.

832
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:20,325
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

833
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:23,077
I was given four copies
of my release form.

834
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:25,745
The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

835
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,788
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

836
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:32,456
...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

837
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:35,291
You should be asleep.

838
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:40,584
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

839
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,586
I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

840
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:47,587
I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

841
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,212
I'm not working those kind of hours.

842
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:50,754
Yeah, did you put in for it?

843
00:58:51,254 --> 00:58:52,214
I put in for it!

844
00:58:52,256 --> 00:58:53,964
Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

845
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,799
I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

846
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,926
A part of all of us was
left there that night.

847
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:04,302
That night will never be
removed from my mind.

848
00:59:04,886 --> 00:59:09,429
The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

849
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,097
My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

850
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:02,532
At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

851
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:06,618
The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names.

852
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,661
They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

853
01:00:09,745 --> 01:00:11,245
They were also its deadliest.

854
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:16,330
The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

855
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,997
He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

856
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:22,499
He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

857
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:26,669
He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

858
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,961
He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

859
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,254
The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

860
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,588
...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

861
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:41,299
In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

862
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:44,591
...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

863
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,719
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

864
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:54,469
-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

865
01:00:54,594 --> 01:00:56,262
It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get....

866
01:00:56,429 --> 01:00:57,638
They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

867
01:00:58,138 --> 01:01:00,972
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

868
01:01:01,182 --> 01:01:03,850
He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

869
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:07,684
Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

870
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:10,101
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

871
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,604
Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

872
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:20,355
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

873
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:24,023
...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

874
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,441
Sure thing.

875
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:35,403
The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

876
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:39,404
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

877
01:01:40,028 --> 01:01:41,155
You get my meaning?

878
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:01,330
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

879
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:33,300
Can I help you with something, chief?

880
01:02:35,176 --> 01:02:39,554
Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

881
01:03:25,613 --> 01:03:29,821
I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

882
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:33,990
...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

883
01:03:35,118 --> 01:03:36,118
Is that okay by you?

884
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:41,577
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

885
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:54,499
Motherfucker.

886
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,593
That's him.

887
01:04:22,885 --> 01:04:24,302
Are you fucking kidding me?

888
01:04:27,845 --> 01:04:28,553
Bingo!

889
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:55,397
This is amazing.

890
01:04:55,565 --> 01:04:58,233
Hello...it's been a long time!

891
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,067
Who the fuck are you guys?

892
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,027
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

893
01:05:07,527 --> 01:05:10,613
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

894
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,864
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

895
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:17,741
You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

896
01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:20,407
...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

897
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:22,034
That seems like a waste.

898
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:24,200
I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

899
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:26,117
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

900
01:05:31,913 --> 01:05:33,706
I can see how he might forget us.

901
01:05:34,372 --> 01:05:37,289
You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

902
01:05:37,456 --> 01:05:39,582
It's a little harder for us to forget.

903
01:05:39,957 --> 01:05:42,209
You gave us so much more to remember.

904
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,960
You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

905
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,712
Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

906
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:04,091
Yeah, that's right.

907
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,221
That was a long time ago.

908
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:16,514
So how you been?

909
01:06:17,514 --> 01:06:19,014
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

910
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:21,640
So, what do you want?

911
01:06:22,473 --> 01:06:25,809
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

912
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:32,895
You ordered the meat loaf.

913
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:37,522
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

914
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:39,646
You fucked up.

915
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:57,779
Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

916
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:03,991
All of you...scared shitless.
But l...

917
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:09,367
...l tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

918
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:13,036
I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

919
01:07:13,202 --> 01:07:14,703
...fucking and beating up little boys.

920
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:17,162
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

921
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:19,079
You're gonna burn in hell.

922
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,203
Yeah, after you.

923
01:07:25,999 --> 01:07:27,167
Did that hurt, Nokes?

924
01:08:04,682 --> 01:08:08,933
Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

925
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:22,855
John Reilly, how do you plead?

926
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,397
Not guilty, Your Honor.

927
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,232
Thomas Marcano?

928
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:28,900
Not guilty, Your Honor.

929
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,151
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

930
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:37,778
In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

931
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:41,279
...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

932
01:08:41,446 --> 01:08:43,446
...but the relationship
had been altered.

933
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:48,783
We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

934
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:50,990
...that would force us to
deal with the past.

935
01:09:04,497 --> 01:09:07,830
One down, Shakes, one down.

936
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:10,663
One what?

937
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:16,250
One Sean Nokes.

938
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:18,293
Nokes?

939
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:27,837
At the time of Nokes' shooting,

940
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:30,838
Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

941
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:34,384
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

942
01:09:35,217 --> 01:09:36,175
Then, he hung up.

943
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,428
-So, what did they say?
-What?

944
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:43,928
John and Tommy, what'd they say?

945
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,429
It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

946
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:48,347
Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

947
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:51,598
-John did.
-Yeah?

948
01:09:52,473 --> 01:09:53,473
What did he say?

949
01:09:54,307 --> 01:09:56,934
He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

950
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:02,477
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

951
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:05,144
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

952
01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:08,062
Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

953
01:10:08,313 --> 01:10:10,689
-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

954
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,314
Perfect for what?

955
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:18,192
Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

956
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:19,359
-Me?
-Yeah.

957
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:23,360
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

958
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:24,485
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

959
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:30,363
Get some coffee?

960
01:10:31,406 --> 01:10:32,365
Let's take a walk.

961
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,201
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

962
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:48,079
What, are you fucking nuts?

963
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:49,954
Just hear me out.

964
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,123
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

965
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,623
I'm not taking this case to win.

966
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:57,832
I'm taking this case to lose.

967
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,083
What does that mean?

968
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,085
It means it's payback time.

969
01:11:05,209 --> 01:11:09,629
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

970
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:13,754
It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but...here it is.

971
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:17,881
And you and l, we can finish it.

972
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:20,008
Finish what, Mikey?

973
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:24,217
You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

974
01:11:26,052 --> 01:11:28,136
I don't know...ten years ago.

975
01:11:29,303 --> 01:11:31,637
You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

976
01:11:32,762 --> 01:11:36,973
I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

977
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,682
Payback time.

978
01:11:42,516 --> 01:11:43,850
It's our time.

979
01:11:44,642 --> 01:11:45,893
What are you saying, Mike?

980
01:11:46,852 --> 01:11:49,644
I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

981
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:53,438
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

982
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:56,646
Let's walk.

983
01:12:00,522 --> 01:12:01,982
So, I asked for the case.

984
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,026
I told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused...

985
01:12:04,193 --> 01:12:06,192
...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

986
01:12:06,485 --> 01:12:07,358
They bought it.

987
01:12:08,235 --> 01:12:10,319
And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

988
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:13,612
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

989
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,237
We were never at Wilkinson's.

990
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:22,366
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

991
01:12:23,783 --> 01:12:24,657
Bring it all down.

992
01:12:25,493 --> 01:12:28,659
Adam Styler, plain-clothes cop,
works narcotics in Queens.

993
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:32,453
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

994
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:34,287
Other personal information there.

995
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,955
Henry Addison now works for the Mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

996
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,164
He's a Community Outreach
Director in Brooklyn.

997
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:44,458
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

998
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,876
Ralph Ferguson works in a Social
Service agency in Long Island.

999
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:49,543
How long have you been
working on this, Mike?

1000
01:12:49,627 --> 01:12:51,835
He's recently divorced, got
one child, and on weekends...

1001
01:12:52,127 --> 01:12:53,669
...teaches Catholic Sunday school.

1002
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:55,461
Well, he seems clean then, right?

1003
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,545
That's exactly why I
want the piece of shit.

1004
01:12:58,213 --> 01:13:00,964
The plan is to call Ferguson
in as a character witness.

1005
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,298
Get him talking about his
best friend, Sean Nokes.

1006
01:13:03,674 --> 01:13:07,467
Once I got him on the stand, I'm
gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

1007
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:12,552
Mike, are you sure you
want to go this way?

1008
01:13:15,969 --> 01:13:17,969
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

1009
01:13:20,472 --> 01:13:21,973
Do you still sleep with the light on?

1010
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:30,767
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

1011
01:13:31,185 --> 01:13:32,769
No, it'll play better in
court if they don't know.

1012
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:48,942
The 'not guilty' verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question.

1013
01:13:49,913 --> 01:13:52,414
Danny Snyder was to remain as
Tommy and John's attorney.

1014
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:55,873
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen...

1015
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:57,874
...to deliver information and keep quiet.

1016
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:00,418
Both were skills the Neighborhood
had in abundance.

1017
01:14:01,252 --> 01:14:03,252
We'd set up a simple
method of communication.

1018
01:14:03,794 --> 01:14:06,252
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work...

1019
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,588
...for me to call my non-existent
girlfriend, "Gloria".

1020
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:12,630
If I needed to get word to Michael, I'd
have someone from the neighborhood...

1021
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:14,464
...pick up an early edition
of the New York Times...

1022
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,799
...write the word "Edmund" in the upper
right hand corner of the Metro section...

1023
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:19,801
...and drop it in front
of Michael's apartment.

1024
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:25,968
For this plan to succeed...

1025
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:29,052
...we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted.

1026
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,678
The plan depended on
keeping Michael alive...

1027
01:14:32,053 --> 01:14:34,265
...which meant that word had to get
to John and Tommy's killing crew...

1028
01:14:34,347 --> 01:14:35,640
...that he was not an open target.

1029
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:39,516
After this night, Michael would
not be available to any of us.

1030
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,933
The only time we would see
him would be in court.

1031
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:44,143
-That's it?
-Not quite.

1032
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:47,853
We've got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify.

1033
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:48,977
Gotta get that number down.

1034
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,619
-I'll talk to King Benny.
-Good.

1035
01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:56,456
I can handle two, but...
you gotta get us one for our side.

1036
01:14:56,957 --> 01:14:58,914
-One of what?
-One witness.

1037
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,417
A witness who'll put John & Tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder.

1038
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,792
A witness they can't touch.

1039
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:07,751
Don't they have a name for that?

1040
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:10,044
A judge would call it perjury.

1041
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:12,920
And what are we calling it?

1042
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:14,422
A favor.

1043
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:18,750
Get up!

1044
01:15:22,509 --> 01:15:24,051
-Tony!
-Yeah, King?

1045
01:15:24,468 --> 01:15:26,261
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

1046
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:28,178
Who? Danny Snyder, the lawyer?

1047
01:15:28,344 --> 01:15:30,011
You know more than one Danny Snyder?

1048
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:32,721
Bring me the one you know.

1049
01:15:51,729 --> 01:15:56,063
I can't do this now, you gotta know that.
It's been a long time for me.

1050
01:15:58,564 --> 01:16:01,899
You need somebody younger, you know.
Somebody like I used to be.

1051
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:03,609
Younger is not better.

1052
01:16:04,317 --> 01:16:07,902
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

1053
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,945
Yeah, I'm lucky I can
find the courthouse.

1054
01:16:11,736 --> 01:16:15,239
I had only four cases last year.
You know how many I won?

1055
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,780
None. That's how many. None.

1056
01:16:20,074 --> 01:16:23,157
In two of them, I think the...

1057
01:16:23,408 --> 01:16:24,992
...the jury blamed me personally.

1058
01:16:25,575 --> 01:16:26,576
They must've been innocent.

1059
01:16:28,077 --> 01:16:30,993
It's tough to get
innocent men off a rap.

1060
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,620
I wasn't even planning on
going to court with this one.

1061
01:16:33,788 --> 01:16:36,746
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could and walk away.

1062
01:16:36,913 --> 01:16:39,665
I wasn't planning on
taking this to trial, sir.

1063
01:16:39,997 --> 01:16:41,999
Well, your plans have been changed.

1064
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:46,376
Well, I am afraid that I'll make a
mistake and say the wrong thing...

1065
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:51,668
...make a wrong turn somewhere.
And you don't want to take that risk.

1066
01:16:52,002 --> 01:16:53,336
Life is risk.

1067
01:16:53,628 --> 01:16:54,503
I'm sorry.

1068
01:16:54,837 --> 01:16:56,170
Life is risk.

1069
01:16:56,754 --> 01:16:57,755
Life is a risk?

1070
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:03,924
I haven't been in here before.

1071
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:07,467
What do you need me to do?

1072
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:11,968
You're gonna be given the
answers and the questions.

1073
01:17:13,135 --> 01:17:16,596
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1074
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:19,138
Is it in English?

1075
01:17:19,305 --> 01:17:22,224
Just don't drift, don't drink,
and don't lose.

1076
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:24,974
What if I do lose?

1077
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:27,475
Then you'll go down for the dirt nap.

1078
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:30,476
Never heard that expression before.

1079
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:33,519
Dirt nap.

1080
01:17:35,645 --> 01:17:39,855
I'm not really cut out for this anymore.
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus...

1081
01:17:40,564 --> 01:17:43,189
...and sues, I like that.

1082
01:17:43,357 --> 01:17:47,149
Some lady slips in a supermarket...
I'm with her.

1083
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:48,816
The discussion is over.

1084
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:52,901
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

1085
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:54,236
It was once.

1086
01:17:55,318 --> 01:17:56,903
Before you let the drink lead.

1087
01:17:58,404 --> 01:18:02,237
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1088
01:18:02,905 --> 01:18:05,447
You've got nothing to lose...
just like the rest of us.

1089
01:18:06,365 --> 01:18:09,241
I don't want to be a burden
to you, but l...

1090
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:14,453
...along with my alcohol problem,
I have a slight drug problem.

1091
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:15,618
I mean, nothing big.

1092
01:18:16,493 --> 01:18:17,203
Go away.

1093
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:29,874
Within days of Michael taking the case...

1094
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:32,126
...the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.

1095
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:35,959
The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

1096
01:18:36,419 --> 01:18:39,752
"Traitor" and "gutter rat" were
heard up and down the avenue.

1097
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,087
But there was never to be
a death move against him.

1098
01:18:42,713 --> 01:18:46,547
The hit on Michael Sullivan, if there was
one, could only come from King Benny.

1099
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:49,423
The underground word...
the only one that mattered...

1100
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:51,966
...had spread through the streets with
the speed of a late-night bullet.

1101
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,969
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

1102
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:03,929
"Sleepers" was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.

1103
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:16,226
You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

1104
01:19:16,642 --> 01:19:19,643
Need your help, fat man.
Need a big favor.

1105
01:19:19,726 --> 01:19:20,852
I'll be outside.

1106
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:22,352
King Benny been to see you?

1107
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,687
Oh, my goodness!

1108
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:26,396
What a fucking thing we put together!

1109
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:31,023
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1110
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:33,857
Fucking paper boy,
making like Dick Tracy.

1111
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:37,526
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing!

1112
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:41,610
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1113
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,361
Fucking General Custer has
a better shot at a walk!

1114
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:46,280
There's no connection
with the guard and us.

1115
01:19:46,445 --> 01:19:48,322
The cops think it's a
drug-related homicide.

1116
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,323
It's just we need you to
pull a few strings, fat man.

1117
01:19:50,656 --> 01:19:53,656
You know, if you get caught on this,
you're looking straight at serious.

1118
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:55,991
I'm talking real jail.
The big house....

1119
01:20:03,534 --> 01:20:05,286
They are not good boys any more.

1120
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:09,455
They're killers now.
Cold as stone.

1121
01:20:11,164 --> 01:20:12,247
I know.

1122
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:15,750
I know what they were, and I know
what they are, and it's not about that.

1123
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:19,541
It's not worth it, throwing
away life just to get even.

1124
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,002
You and the lawyer have
a chance to get out.

1125
01:20:23,294 --> 01:20:24,336
To get out the right way.

1126
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,003
There's no choice...not for us.

1127
01:20:31,464 --> 01:20:33,173
On occasion, I'd have
dinner with Carol.

1128
01:20:33,714 --> 01:20:37,049
She still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the South Bronx.

1129
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:40,259
Her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years.

1130
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:44,387
Whenever we went out as a group, Carol
would walk between Michael and John...

1131
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:45,804
...grasping their arms...

1132
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:49,346
...in step between the lawyer
and the killer.

1133
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:53,055
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1134
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,014
Would you settle for a
couple of beers, Carol?

1135
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,683
If that's your best offer.

1136
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:02,686
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1137
01:21:04,061 --> 01:21:04,893
Deal.

1138
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:11,938
You look tired.

1139
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:13,480
Thank you.

1140
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:16,523
They don't give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours?

1141
01:21:20,899 --> 01:21:22,567
So, how much do you know?

1142
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:25,236
Just what the neighborhood says.

1143
01:21:26,485 --> 01:21:28,111
And what I read in papers like yours.

1144
01:21:29,111 --> 01:21:30,444
What does the neighborhood say?

1145
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:32,571
That they're gonna put
Johnny and Tommy away.

1146
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:34,904
That their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

1147
01:21:35,114 --> 01:21:36,073
You believe that?

1148
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:37,823
It's hard not to, Shakes.

1149
01:21:38,364 --> 01:21:41,701
Unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1150
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:45,034
-He did take the case.
-What else is there to say?

1151
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:49,161
You know Michael very well...

1152
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:51,869
...maybe even better than I do.

1153
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:54,705
Yeah, I thought I did.
Now, I don't know.

1154
01:21:54,912 --> 01:21:56,579
-You do know.
-I don't know!

1155
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,039
He went in there, and
he asked for the case.

1156
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,332
Now, you tell me, what the
hell kind of friend is that?

1157
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,291
The best kind.

1158
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:06,751
The kind who'll throw away
everything to help his friends.

1159
01:22:11,086 --> 01:22:12,087
What are you telling me, Shakes?

1160
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:17,422
You know this neighborhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1161
01:22:17,588 --> 01:22:19,423
Why should this be any different?

1162
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:26,967
I'm hungry.

1163
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:29,509
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1164
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:34,928
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1165
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:38,014
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1166
01:22:39,014 --> 01:22:41,681
And he just...he shut down.

1167
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:45,809
Couldn't touch him...
couldn't even breathe on him.

1168
01:22:48,933 --> 01:22:49,851
I thought it was me.

1169
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:54,145
After a while, it just
gets easier to let it go.

1170
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,438
Do you still love him?

1171
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,063
I don't think about it, Shakes.

1172
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:02,064
If I did, I'd say 'yes.'

1173
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:03,941
But you're with John now.

1174
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:08,858
Yeah...as much as
anybody can be with John.

1175
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:12,944
The man I know is not
the boy you remember.

1176
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:14,320
None of us are.

1177
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:17,321
But there's something
special about John.

1178
01:23:19,237 --> 01:23:21,323
You just have to look a
little harder to see it.

1179
01:23:26,657 --> 01:23:28,159
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1180
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:30,533
-Me?
-Yeah.

1181
01:23:32,076 --> 01:23:33,200
Cause you were Mikey's girl.

1182
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,996
He got to you first.

1183
01:23:37,453 --> 01:23:38,621
And after Mikey?

1184
01:23:39,622 --> 01:23:40,622
I think it was Tommy's turn.

1185
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:42,913
Fuck you!

1186
01:23:46,206 --> 01:23:47,247
Because...

1187
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,458
...l didn't think you'd say 'yes.'

1188
01:23:57,003 --> 01:23:58,669
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1189
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:01,296
You were wrong.

1190
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:09,840
What? Go ahead and say it.

1191
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:15,636
You work at Social Services, you
got files. You got access to files.

1192
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,511
And from time to time, we're
gonna need some information.

1193
01:24:18,677 --> 01:24:19,762
Yeah, sure...whatever...

1194
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:22,680
Wait. What?

1195
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,180
Well, what do you want?
You want information?

1196
01:24:25,597 --> 01:24:27,389
You want me to get the files?
I'll get the files!

1197
01:24:28,265 --> 01:24:29,057
What do you want?

1198
01:24:35,435 --> 01:24:36,559
You still visit John?

1199
01:24:37,394 --> 01:24:39,268
Yeah, once a week for about an hour.

1200
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,478
-Good.
-Good?

1201
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:44,395
Yeah, good. Just don't tell
him that you've seen me.

1202
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,231
Just don't tell him anything.

1203
01:24:46,313 --> 01:24:48,899
I mean, the more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

1204
01:24:50,815 --> 01:24:52,274
Shakes, what is this about?

1205
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:57,817
You want a Rolls Royce?
You don't come here.

1206
01:24:58,152 --> 01:25:00,611
You go to England or wherever
the fuck they make it.

1207
01:25:01,237 --> 01:25:03,278
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1208
01:25:03,528 --> 01:25:05,279
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1209
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:09,448
But if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere, or...

1210
01:25:09,783 --> 01:25:13,449
...some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about, there's only one place to go.

1211
01:25:13,992 --> 01:25:18,117
Right here, Hell's Kitchen!
It is the lost and found of shit!

1212
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:21,993
They lose it and we find it!
Forget about it, man.

1213
01:25:23,495 --> 01:25:26,956
Now, you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1214
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,666
Two others changed their minds.

1215
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:32,957
-Which two?
-The suits at the bar.

1216
01:25:34,832 --> 01:25:36,918
So that still leaves the
couple in the booth?

1217
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:38,417
For now.

1218
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,626
Everything else falling into place?

1219
01:25:43,127 --> 01:25:47,006
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1220
01:25:48,005 --> 01:25:48,672
I know.

1221
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:55,299
When you were sent away,

1222
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:59,134
I was always sorry I
couldn't do more for you.

1223
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,888
I didn't know you liked
pigeons so much.

1224
01:26:10,222 --> 01:26:12,306
I like anything that don't talk.

1225
01:26:14,305 --> 01:26:17,140
Michael's vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear.

1226
01:26:17,683 --> 01:26:18,850
He was aiming for guilty...

1227
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,767
...a charge of guilty against
the Wilkinson Home for Boys...

1228
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:25,436
...against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison, and Ralph Ferguson.

1229
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:29,230
I will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that.

1230
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:31,981
I will place them at
the scene of the crime.

1231
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:34,148
I will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm...

1232
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,648
...that they were there
on that deadly night.

1233
01:26:37,566 --> 01:26:41,524
I will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room...

1234
01:26:41,692 --> 01:26:45,110
...and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

1235
01:26:45,485 --> 01:26:47,236
I'm sure you all know what that means...

1236
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:49,696
...since you probably watch
as much television as I do.

1237
01:26:52,738 --> 01:26:56,531
John...John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1238
01:26:56,698 --> 01:27:00,032
...are two innocent pawns,
quickly arrested and just...

1239
01:27:02,033 --> 01:27:03,535
...as quickly prosecuted on the...

1240
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:05,910
...slightest threads of evidence.

1241
01:27:06,202 --> 01:27:08,870
Look on the bright side, he
seems to know their names.

1242
01:27:08,953 --> 01:27:10,871
I don't have to tell you. You and I
know how these things work.

1243
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:22,084
It's nice when you come around.

1244
01:27:25,626 --> 01:27:27,294
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty!

1245
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:29,169
Take it.

1246
01:27:29,252 --> 01:27:30,587
No, no, she'll do it.

1247
01:27:40,007 --> 01:27:40,758
How's work?

1248
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:44,467
I'm still there.

1249
01:27:49,093 --> 01:27:50,093
You know, Pop, l...

1250
01:27:52,179 --> 01:27:53,220
...l went down to the courthouse.

1251
01:27:55,096 --> 01:27:56,513
You know, I saw John and Tommy.

1252
01:27:57,556 --> 01:27:59,639
I started thinking back
to when we were young....

1253
01:27:59,724 --> 01:28:00,641
Where's the chicken?

1254
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:05,892
So...?

1255
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:10,643
Nothing. I was just thinking.

1256
01:28:12,478 --> 01:28:13,895
You're doing good, right?

1257
01:28:15,978 --> 01:28:17,146
Yeah. Doing good.

1258
01:28:17,522 --> 01:28:18,438
Good.

1259
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,331
What the hell do these things do?

1260
01:29:02,997 --> 01:29:03,997
They're for praying.

1261
01:29:04,749 --> 01:29:05,499
Look at all this shit!

1262
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:08,083
What, does your mother think you're
in the fucking army or something?

1263
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,042
Ain't none of it on the approved list.

1264
01:29:10,209 --> 01:29:11,834
I'm sure your Mommy
got a copy of that list.

1265
01:29:12,043 --> 01:29:13,544
My mother can't speak English that well.

1266
01:29:13,753 --> 01:29:16,878
Don't blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid, all right?

1267
01:29:22,214 --> 01:29:23,382
When are you gonna let us hear you pray?

1268
01:29:35,095 --> 01:29:36,512
Maybe he needs something to pray for.

1269
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:38,512
Put your hands on the table
and lay them flat.

1270
01:29:40,887 --> 01:29:41,680
Spread your legs.

1271
01:29:43,389 --> 01:29:45,389
Now start thinking up some prayers.

1272
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:55,976
We don't hear no praying.

1273
01:29:56,227 --> 01:29:58,894
You better start, or Styler might
lose his baton up your ass.

1274
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:00,729
Blessed art thou among women...

1275
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,605
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus....

1276
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:03,979
Pray nice and loud!

1277
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:09,400
Fucker, pray! Come on, now!

1278
01:30:11,983 --> 01:30:14,401
-Louder.
-Hail Mary...

1279
01:30:15,318 --> 01:30:16,819
Louder, fucker!

1280
01:30:19,069 --> 01:30:20,612
Pray like you're in fucking church!

1281
01:30:31,783 --> 01:30:33,742
Sorry I'm late.
I lost all track of time.

1282
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:36,910
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

1283
01:30:37,284 --> 01:30:39,077
But I want you to come along.
So, you want to just go...

1284
01:30:41,453 --> 01:30:43,162
-Where are we going?
-To his place.

1285
01:30:43,662 --> 01:30:45,121
-Where is it?
-It's in the rectory.

1286
01:30:45,329 --> 01:30:46,664
No. Shakes!

1287
01:30:47,164 --> 01:30:49,582
-Just trust me.
-I can't.

1288
01:30:56,127 --> 01:30:57,251
How was court today?

1289
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:02,752
Like the first round of a fight...
everybody just feeling each other out.

1290
01:31:04,503 --> 01:31:05,503
How did the boys look?

1291
01:31:06,505 --> 01:31:07,839
Like they wished they
were someplace else.

1292
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,465
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

1293
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:16,342
It's not too late, Father.

1294
01:31:19,176 --> 01:31:21,593
We still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep...

1295
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:23,844
...one more chance.

1296
01:31:26,804 --> 01:31:27,929
Is that chance legal?

1297
01:31:30,348 --> 01:31:31,557
Last chances never are.

1298
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:33,556
King Benny behind this?

1299
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:37,975
He's in on it, but...
he's not calling the shots.

1300
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:38,977
Who is?

1301
01:31:41,018 --> 01:31:41,685
Michael.

1302
01:31:43,686 --> 01:31:44,936
I should've smelled it.

1303
01:31:46,021 --> 01:31:48,313
The minute he went for the case,
I should've figured something was up.

1304
01:31:48,856 --> 01:31:50,064
It's a good plan.

1305
01:31:50,564 --> 01:31:53,690
Michael's got it all covered...
just about every base you look at.

1306
01:31:54,524 --> 01:31:55,523
He's got it covered.

1307
01:31:55,774 --> 01:31:56,733
Not every base.

1308
01:31:58,025 --> 01:31:59,859
You're short something, or else
you wouldn't be here.

1309
01:32:00,691 --> 01:32:02,359
You don't shit a shitter, right?

1310
01:32:02,569 --> 01:32:03,527
That's right.

1311
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:06,945
So, what is it?

1312
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:08,363
Where do you come up short?

1313
01:32:10,946 --> 01:32:11,780
Witness.

1314
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:15,240
We need somebody
to take the stand and say...

1315
01:32:15,324 --> 01:32:17,657
...they were with John and
Tommy on the night of the murder.

1316
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:19,741
So, you figured if you had a
priest, it would be perfect?

1317
01:32:20,992 --> 01:32:22,493
Not just any priest.

1318
01:32:38,707 --> 01:32:43,376
You're asking me...
you're asking me to lie.

1319
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:47,587
You're asking me to swear
to God and then lie.

1320
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:50,838
I'm asking you to save two of your boys.

1321
01:32:56,465 --> 01:32:59,799
-Did they kill that guard?
-Yes.

1322
01:33:00,967 --> 01:33:04,885
So what they said is true?
They walked in and they killed him?

1323
01:33:05,886 --> 01:33:06,510
Yes.

1324
01:33:08,137 --> 01:33:10,553
They killed him exactly like that.

1325
01:33:14,804 --> 01:33:15,805
I think I need a drink.

1326
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:19,432
Anyone want a drink?

1327
01:33:38,022 --> 01:33:39,690
This is some favor you're asking me.

1328
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:42,191
We know that.

1329
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:44,859
No, I don't think you do know.

1330
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:48,818
You said, if there was ever
anything really important...

1331
01:33:48,902 --> 01:33:50,610
...l could come to you, ask you.

1332
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,487
I was thinking more along
the lines of Yankee tickets.

1333
01:33:56,948 --> 01:34:01,407
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

1334
01:34:02,991 --> 01:34:06,199
What about the life that was taken,
Shakes? What's that worth?

1335
01:34:06,825 --> 01:34:09,200
To me? Nothing.

1336
01:34:11,993 --> 01:34:14,497
Why not?
Tell me.

1337
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:25,542
He was a guard at Wilkinsons.

1338
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:30,085
All right.

1339
01:34:30,626 --> 01:34:34,003
If Father Bobby was gonna be involved, he
deserved to know what he's getting into.

1340
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,879
If he wasn't, I trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room.

1341
01:34:39,505 --> 01:34:41,340
I thought that Carol
needed to know, as well.

1342
01:34:42,172 --> 01:34:45,007
Jesus Christ, we were just boys.
We were not tough.

1343
01:34:48,925 --> 01:34:50,134
They held us down.

1344
01:34:54,054 --> 01:34:57,720
I told him about the torture,
the beatings, and the rapes.

1345
01:34:58,179 --> 01:35:00,556
I told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed...

1346
01:35:00,721 --> 01:35:03,056
...to Father Bobby's God
for help that never came.

1347
01:35:03,849 --> 01:35:05,182
I told them everything.

1348
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:08,267
We can't fight anymore.
They just took it all.

1349
01:35:09,725 --> 01:35:14,019
John used to wail at night, hear
it all the way down the hall.

1350
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:19,522
You know he wanted to be a priest,
John wanted to be a priest.

1351
01:35:24,273 --> 01:35:27,898
Then he pulls his pants down.
I didn't even know what a blow job was.

1352
01:35:31,775 --> 01:35:35,111
I just blacked out what I could.
It was like I couldn't even breathe.

1353
01:35:36,903 --> 01:35:39,362
Then...l started to choke.

1354
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,863
He was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head.

1355
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,864
Then I blacked out.

1356
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:52,910
But I do remember when, for fun,
they'd take us down in the basement...

1357
01:35:54,118 --> 01:35:56,244
...tie two or three of us together...

1358
01:35:56,327 --> 01:35:59,995
...and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked'em.

1359
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,002
I got a decision to make.

1360
01:36:22,128 --> 01:36:23,753
I only pray it's the right one.

1361
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:29,174
It will be, Father...
whichever way you go.

1362
01:36:35,134 --> 01:36:36,092
Good night.

1363
01:36:44,928 --> 01:36:47,347
So, you were sitting down,
you were having dinner...

1364
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:50,348
...and two men entered
McHale's, correct?

1365
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:54,515
Did you see them as they approached
the table where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

1366
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:56,058
I noticed it, yes.

1367
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:58,059
Did you hear what
was said between them?

1368
01:36:59,895 --> 01:37:02,019
-Did you see them pull out their guns?
-No.

1369
01:37:02,269 --> 01:37:05,896
-Did you hear the shots?
-Yes, I heard the shots.

1370
01:37:06,104 --> 01:37:10,230
And what did they do? What was
their behavior after the shooting?

1371
01:37:11,316 --> 01:37:13,983
They walked out of McHale's
as if nothing had happened.

1372
01:37:14,608 --> 01:37:19,066
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

1373
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:23,195
Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1374
01:37:23,653 --> 01:37:26,613
-Are you positive?
-Yes, very positive.

1375
01:37:26,988 --> 01:37:29,946
Are the two men you saw at
McHale's in this room today?

1376
01:37:29,988 --> 01:37:30,948
Yes, they are.

1377
01:37:31,405 --> 01:37:32,947
Could you point them
out to the jury, please?

1378
01:37:34,323 --> 01:37:35,491
They're sitting right over there.

1379
01:37:36,867 --> 01:37:40,618
Your Honor, will the record reflect that
Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants...

1380
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:43,828
...John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
as the two men in question.

1381
01:37:44,119 --> 01:37:44,953
Noted.

1382
01:37:45,453 --> 01:37:46,828
Thank you. No further questions.

1383
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,330
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1384
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:51,997
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

1385
01:37:52,456 --> 01:37:53,331
Good morning.

1386
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:57,041
I just have a few questions. I won't
take too much of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

1387
01:37:58,249 --> 01:38:02,628
You stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner. Is that correct?

1388
01:38:03,126 --> 01:38:07,295
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1389
01:38:08,462 --> 01:38:10,129
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1390
01:38:10,505 --> 01:38:12,963
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1391
01:38:13,756 --> 01:38:15,048
What do you mean "prior"?

1392
01:38:15,297 --> 01:38:19,258
At lunch...maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch?

1393
01:38:19,841 --> 01:38:20,635
Yes, I did.

1394
01:38:21,635 --> 01:38:22,968
What did you have to drink?

1395
01:38:23,344 --> 01:38:27,010
I went shopping, and I stopped
at a place on Madison Avenue...

1396
01:38:27,178 --> 01:38:28,804
-...for some lunch.
-See, I didn't ask you where you went.

1397
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,679
I asked you what you
had to drink at lunch?

1398
01:38:31,846 --> 01:38:34,138
-A martini.
-And what else?

1399
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:38,474
Probably some wine.

1400
01:38:39,392 --> 01:38:43,559
Yes, and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink?

1401
01:38:45,976 --> 01:38:47,811
One glass, maybe two.

1402
01:38:48,478 --> 01:38:51,396
-Closer to two?
-Yes, probably two glasses.

1403
01:38:57,482 --> 01:38:58,898
It's like pulling teeth.

1404
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,901
I should've pinned the
questions to his shirt.

1405
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:09,111
And tell me, then at dinner you...

1406
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,193
Strike that.

1407
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:20,991
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1408
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,158
Objection, Your Honor!

1409
01:39:23,617 --> 01:39:25,741
What Mrs. Salinas did on the
day of the murder...

1410
01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:28,203
...has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder.

1411
01:39:28,245 --> 01:39:30,035
How much she had to
drink does, Your Honor.

1412
01:39:30,369 --> 01:39:31,203
Overruled!

1413
01:39:33,203 --> 01:39:36,707
Mrs. Salinas, what time
did you have lunch?

1414
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:38,373
About one-thirty.

1415
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,748
And what did you have for lunch?

1416
01:39:40,248 --> 01:39:43,333
It was a while ago.
Probably a salad.

1417
01:39:43,457 --> 01:39:45,458
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1418
01:39:45,624 --> 01:39:48,709
A martini, two glasses of wine
and a salad, is that correct?

1419
01:39:48,876 --> 01:39:50,335
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:39:50,627 --> 01:39:55,296
And then you had wine at dinner,
about 6 hours later, is that correct?

1421
01:39:55,629 --> 01:39:56,547
Yes, that's right.

1422
01:39:57,171 --> 01:39:58,338
How much wine did you have to drink...

1423
01:39:58,422 --> 01:40:00,924
...by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHale's?

1424
01:40:01,214 --> 01:40:05,217
-Two glasses.
-Would you say that four glasses of wine...

1425
01:40:05,382 --> 01:40:09,386
...and a martini within a 6-hour
period is a lot for you to drink?

1426
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:11,300
Yes, it is.

1427
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:21,764
Have you ever heard a gun fired,
prior to the night in question?

1428
01:40:24,974 --> 01:40:26,558
How would you describe the sound?

1429
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,766
It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1430
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:35,103
-Did the sound frighten you?
-Very much.

1431
01:40:35,271 --> 01:40:37,937
Did you close your eyes?

1432
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:42,647
At first...until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1433
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:46,941
Did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHale's?

1434
01:40:47,317 --> 01:40:51,026
Well, I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been shot.

1435
01:40:51,443 --> 01:40:55,778
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1436
01:40:56,986 --> 01:40:58,320
Yes, I did.

1437
01:40:58,487 --> 01:41:02,655
Yet, despite that fear, despite
that risk to your life...

1438
01:41:02,864 --> 01:41:06,990
...you looked at their
faces as they left?

1439
01:41:07,741 --> 01:41:09,700
-Yes, I did.
-Is that correct?

1440
01:41:11,452 --> 01:41:12,118
Yes, I did.

1441
01:41:13,035 --> 01:41:15,202
Did you look at their faces?
Did you really...

1442
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:19,203
...really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1443
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:22,955
I glanced at them when they
walked by, but I did see them!

1444
01:41:23,331 --> 01:41:27,123
You...glanced?
You didn't look?

1445
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:29,375
I saw them!

1446
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:34,835
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.
You glanced at them through the eyes...

1447
01:41:35,169 --> 01:41:39,836
...of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink.

1448
01:41:40,837 --> 01:41:43,464
-Objection, Your Honor.
-There is no need, Your Honor.

1449
01:41:43,589 --> 01:41:44,964
I have no further questions.

1450
01:41:45,172 --> 01:41:47,590
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1451
01:41:51,675 --> 01:41:53,509
It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

1452
01:41:53,717 --> 01:41:57,092
Frank Magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

1453
01:41:57,385 --> 01:42:00,386
He was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation.

1454
01:42:01,053 --> 01:42:02,596
He was also King Benny's nephew.

1455
01:42:03,513 --> 01:42:05,554
Nick Davenport
was with Internal Affairs.

1456
01:42:06,515 --> 01:42:09,183
He was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty.

1457
01:42:09,599 --> 01:42:11,849
He knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a...

1458
01:42:12,017 --> 01:42:14,768
...maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time.

1459
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:16,768
Frank, what is this shit?

1460
01:42:17,268 --> 01:42:18,977
If I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1461
01:42:19,726 --> 01:42:20,478
You make this one...

1462
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:22,686
...you're gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the Commissioner.

1463
01:42:22,937 --> 01:42:26,357
You know, you got a real hard-on for this
Styler guy. What's your beef with him?

1464
01:42:26,521 --> 01:42:28,689
-One more thing.
-I can't wait.

1465
01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:33,525
It's simple. No one knows who fed you
this information. And I mean, nobody.

1466
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:34,733
How did you get it?

1467
01:42:34,901 --> 01:42:38,234
It fell into my lap...just like
it's gonna fall into yours.

1468
01:42:45,528 --> 01:42:46,863
Christ Almighty!

1469
01:42:54,575 --> 01:42:55,950
You got everything in
here but a confession.

1470
01:42:56,117 --> 01:42:57,701
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1471
01:42:58,075 --> 01:42:59,743
My preference is that
you beat it out of him.

1472
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:01,410
There's even surveillance photos.

1473
01:43:02,285 --> 01:43:05,329
This piece of shit's pulling in about
five grand a month, ripping off pushers.

1474
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:06,829
Has been for about 3 years.

1475
01:43:07,122 --> 01:43:09,039
-More like 4.
-He ain't gonna see 5.

1476
01:43:09,164 --> 01:43:10,541
So, you got enough for conviction?

1477
01:43:10,622 --> 01:43:12,749
That ain't up to me.
That's up to a jury.

1478
01:43:16,415 --> 01:43:17,750
Show the jury this.

1479
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:21,837
What do you got there, Ness?

1480
01:43:22,253 --> 01:43:24,629
About 3 weeks ago,
the body of a drug dealer...

1481
01:43:24,796 --> 01:43:28,003
...named Indian Red L�pez was found
in an alley in Jackson Heights.

1482
01:43:28,588 --> 01:43:30,422
Three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

1483
01:43:30,505 --> 01:43:31,422
I'm with you so far.

1484
01:43:31,922 --> 01:43:34,341
This is the gun that killed him,
and these are the shells.

1485
01:43:35,006 --> 01:43:37,924
What's behind door number 3?

1486
01:43:38,634 --> 01:43:40,802
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

1487
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:47,137
-Hey, do me a favor, would you?
-What's that?

1488
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:49,304
If I ever make it onto your
shit list, give me a call.

1489
01:43:50,388 --> 01:43:52,097
Give me a chance to apologize.

1490
01:43:53,013 --> 01:43:56,723
So, you need anything else, you talk to
Frank. He knows how to get a hold of me.

1491
01:43:57,099 --> 01:44:00,226
Take care of yourself, kid.
Water gets choppy out your way.

1492
01:44:00,642 --> 01:44:01,684
I'll do what I can.

1493
01:44:03,476 --> 01:44:06,812
Hey, Ness...did you ever
think of becoming a cop?

1494
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:09,104
And leave the good guys?

1495
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:28,528
The body of Christ.

1496
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:54,079
The body of Christ.

1497
01:44:57,832 --> 01:44:59,832
Michael had done all
that could be expected...

1498
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,834
...of an Assistant District Attorney
seeking a conviction.

1499
01:45:03,584 --> 01:45:07,835
He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.

1500
01:45:08,334 --> 01:45:10,752
He just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence.

1501
01:45:10,918 --> 01:45:13,171
And he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.

1502
01:45:15,046 --> 01:45:17,381
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working...

1503
01:45:17,715 --> 01:45:20,175
...and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him.

1504
01:45:20,591 --> 01:45:21,716
Did you see their faces?

1505
01:45:22,174 --> 01:45:24,966
Yes, I looked at them,
and they looked at me.

1506
01:45:25,092 --> 01:45:26,176
Did they say anything to you?

1507
01:45:26,425 --> 01:45:29,051
No, they just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

1508
01:45:29,217 --> 01:45:31,386
Are you sure the two
defendants killed Sean Nokes?

1509
01:45:31,553 --> 01:45:32,678
I know they killed him.

1510
01:45:33,386 --> 01:45:35,680
If the plan worked, it would
be everyone's success.

1511
01:45:36,387 --> 01:45:38,389
If it failed, the fault
would fall to Michael.

1512
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:45,892
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the West Side...

1513
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,685
...remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder.

1514
01:45:50,642 --> 01:45:53,979
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1515
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:55,813
Why didn't you turn around, Mr. Carson?

1516
01:45:56,062 --> 01:45:58,897
I was concerned for my
companion's safety.

1517
01:45:59,063 --> 01:46:00,898
Mr. Carson, did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?

1518
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:05,024
Did they threaten anyone
in McHale's Restaurant...?

1519
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:08,193
I didn't see it, but I know it!

1520
01:46:08,734 --> 01:46:11,027
If you didn't see the defendant
shoot the guard...

1521
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:13,360
...then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him?

1522
01:46:37,162 --> 01:46:38,330
So, what's the emergency?

1523
01:46:42,955 --> 01:46:44,747
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
It's too risky.

1524
01:46:44,956 --> 01:46:48,291
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

1525
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:51,167
Why?

1526
01:46:52,877 --> 01:46:55,169
Shakes met with Father Bobby
2 weeks ago.

1527
01:46:55,836 --> 01:46:58,837
-He hasn't heard from him since.
-It's not an overnight decision for him.

1528
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:06,131
-What if he doesn't testify?
-Then we got a very serious problem.

1529
01:47:22,222 --> 01:47:24,222
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1530
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:29,183
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1531
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,226
He already has.

1532
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:33,683
What?!

1533
01:47:35,017 --> 01:47:38,645
I...was with him when he
talked to Father Bobby.

1534
01:47:41,853 --> 01:47:43,397
I heard everything, Michael.

1535
01:47:53,608 --> 01:47:54,694
So, you know.

1536
01:48:02,947 --> 01:48:04,364
If only you told me.

1537
01:48:09,448 --> 01:48:11,241
I think things could've been different.

1538
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,326
If you could've talked.

1539
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:22,537
Maybe...maybe we...

1540
01:48:26,747 --> 01:48:27,706
Maybe....

1541
01:48:53,257 --> 01:48:55,675
Carmen, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1542
01:48:58,301 --> 01:49:00,134
You still have a thing for Doris Day.

1543
01:49:00,593 --> 01:49:04,637
She was a good woman.
You know the strega?

1544
01:49:05,929 --> 01:49:08,388
It's hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye.

1545
01:49:09,305 --> 01:49:11,597
She needs the heads.

1546
01:49:17,266 --> 01:49:18,599
Take this to the witch.

1547
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:21,893
Now, why does she need that?

1548
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,937
-She takes the eyes.
-Wonderful!

1549
01:49:25,145 --> 01:49:28,645
Puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil.

1550
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:30,021
And then?

1551
01:49:32,106 --> 01:49:36,399
People get headaches, they go to her.
She looks into their eyes...

1552
01:49:36,606 --> 01:49:39,609
...and tells them who is
wishing the headaches.

1553
01:49:40,235 --> 01:49:43,776
She says a few words, and
the headaches go away.

1554
01:49:44,444 --> 01:49:48,779
Once in a while, the person who
wished the headaches, goes away too.

1555
01:49:49,612 --> 01:49:53,114
This guy, Addison, the one
who works for the Mayor...

1556
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,406
...he quits his job in 2 weeks.

1557
01:49:56,616 --> 01:50:00,117
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1558
01:50:00,326 --> 01:50:03,493
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1559
01:50:04,993 --> 01:50:06,578
-He knows this?
-He will.

1560
01:50:08,037 --> 01:50:10,829
The boys he buys for
parties are expensive.

1561
01:50:10,996 --> 01:50:14,331
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1562
01:50:15,664 --> 01:50:16,832
How much does he owe?

1563
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Eight grand with a heavy vig.
I paid that off.

1564
01:50:21,168 --> 01:50:25,461
-You paid?
-Addison's debts belong to me now.

1565
01:50:27,085 --> 01:50:29,587
-You hate debts.
-I hate Addison!

1566
01:50:32,379 --> 01:50:35,590
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1567
01:50:36,006 --> 01:50:37,715
And I like to play alone.

1568
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:42,926
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1569
01:50:56,222 --> 01:51:00,642
His mother named him Edward Goldenberg
Robinson, after her favorite actor.

1570
01:51:01,515 --> 01:51:02,849
To continue the Hollywood connection...

1571
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,516
Eddie Robinson took the street name
"Little Caesar"...

1572
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:09,018
...as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.

1573
01:51:09,603 --> 01:51:12,729
He had a 12-year-old son in a
private school in upstate New York.

1574
01:51:13,563 --> 01:51:15,521
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother...

1575
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:19,148
...who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

1576
01:51:19,897 --> 01:51:23,066
-I want you to give me some money.
-All right.

1577
01:51:23,609 --> 01:51:26,942
I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

1578
01:51:27,443 --> 01:51:30,778
I ain't paying it back.
Somebody else is.

1579
01:51:33,404 --> 01:51:34,738
This somebody I know?

1580
01:51:35,072 --> 01:51:38,404
-Your little brother knew him.
-Rizzo?

1581
01:51:41,156 --> 01:51:42,406
How did he know Rizzo?

1582
01:51:43,032 --> 01:51:47,450
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

1583
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:52,079
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1584
01:51:57,914 --> 01:52:00,456
Count out $8,000.
Put it in an envelope.

1585
01:52:04,457 --> 01:52:08,583
You...go back a long time, old man.

1586
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:11,460
Old men always do.

1587
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,711
Ran with the guineas, back
when the guineas were tough.

1588
01:52:14,753 --> 01:52:16,087
I ran when I could.

1589
01:52:17,337 --> 01:52:18,797
Looked good doing it, too.

1590
01:52:21,714 --> 01:52:25,715
Gave the business some style, some class.

1591
01:52:27,466 --> 01:52:30,467
Made it a call for respect, the way
you wore it...the way you talked it.

1592
01:52:32,093 --> 01:52:34,095
I always liked that about you.

1593
01:52:34,636 --> 01:52:37,971
I'm no help to you.
My tailor is dead.

1594
01:52:44,973 --> 01:52:49,308
I'll look up our friend and
collect the money he owes me.

1595
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,601
He owes you something more than money.

1596
01:52:52,143 --> 01:52:54,060
Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1597
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,312
-This is.
-What, old man?

1598
01:52:58,312 --> 01:53:00,520
What's this guy owe that
means more than dollars?

1599
01:53:01,062 --> 01:53:05,022
He owes you Rizzo. He's the man
that killed your brother.

1600
01:53:14,235 --> 01:53:16,361
They said he died of pneumonia.

1601
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:17,987
They said.

1602
01:53:25,322 --> 01:53:26,990
What is the relevance of this?

1603
01:53:27,490 --> 01:53:30,158
So, Ralph Ferguson is
a Sunday school teacher?

1604
01:53:30,366 --> 01:53:33,159
I don't know, counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1605
01:53:34,034 --> 01:53:38,202
I understand that, Your Honor. Again,
I need to put a face to the victim.

1606
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:42,204
Otherwise it's just another
name in the obituaries.

1607
01:53:42,911 --> 01:53:44,999
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1608
01:53:47,165 --> 01:53:48,456
I don't have a problem with that.

1609
01:53:49,748 --> 01:53:53,083
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1610
01:54:19,676 --> 01:54:21,762
-Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
-Good morning.

1611
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:25,387
I'd like to thank you for coming, I
understand it's been a long trip for you.

1612
01:54:26,347 --> 01:54:28,305
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1613
01:54:29,764 --> 01:54:32,141
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were such good friends.

1614
01:54:32,306 --> 01:54:34,974
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

1615
01:54:35,223 --> 01:54:37,892
We were great friends. It would
be hard to find a better friend.

1616
01:54:38,851 --> 01:54:42,644
-Would you say you were his best friend?
-I was his closest, that's for sure.

1617
01:54:43,436 --> 01:54:47,396
-How long did you know each other?
-About 17, 18 years.

1618
01:54:48,188 --> 01:54:49,521
And did you see each other often?

1619
01:54:50,023 --> 01:54:54,441
As often as we could...
weekends, holidays, vacations.

1620
01:54:56,358 --> 01:54:59,943
-What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
-He was a good man.

1621
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:02,527
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1622
01:55:03,154 --> 01:55:05,528
Objection, Your Honor, statement
is one of opinion not fact.

1623
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,945
He was asked his opinion.

1624
01:55:07,155 --> 01:55:09,280
Overruled. Please proceed.

1625
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:15,324
Mr. Ferguson...were you aware of
any enemies he might have had?

1626
01:55:15,699 --> 01:55:17,449
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1627
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:21,535
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1628
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:27,788
Is that a prison?

1629
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:30,330
No, it's a juvenile
facility for young boys.

1630
01:55:30,413 --> 01:55:33,414
Your function was what at this facility?

1631
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:35,290
Standard stuff.

1632
01:55:35,457 --> 01:55:39,542
Keep the boys in line, make sure
they got to classes on time....

1633
01:55:40,292 --> 01:55:42,793
Keep an eye out for trouble,
put them down for the night.

1634
01:55:43,877 --> 01:55:47,629
As guards, were you and
Mr. Nokes allowed to use force to...

1635
01:55:47,796 --> 01:55:49,796
...as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1636
01:55:50,379 --> 01:55:52,379
What...what do you mean, force?

1637
01:55:52,547 --> 01:55:53,423
Were you allowed to hit them?

1638
01:55:55,672 --> 01:55:56,548
Of course not.

1639
01:55:56,883 --> 01:56:00,675
Were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the Wilkinson home?

1640
01:56:02,217 --> 01:56:05,176
I'm sure something like that
may have happened. It was a...

1641
01:56:05,844 --> 01:56:09,179
...big place, but it wasn't
the common practice.

1642
01:56:09,345 --> 01:56:10,678
Let's narrow the place down.

1643
01:56:10,845 --> 01:56:14,223
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care...

1644
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:16,847
...at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1645
01:56:24,602 --> 01:56:27,060
Would you like me to
repeat the question?

1646
01:56:27,268 --> 01:56:28,185
No.

1647
01:56:30,269 --> 01:56:32,396
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

1648
01:56:33,438 --> 01:56:36,522
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems...

1649
01:56:36,689 --> 01:56:38,690
...were hit on occasion.

1650
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,400
And how were they hit?

1651
01:56:40,608 --> 01:56:42,441
-I don't know what you mean.
-A fist?

1652
01:56:42,942 --> 01:56:46,776
Open hand? Kick? Baton, maybe?

1653
01:56:47,486 --> 01:56:51,194
-Depends on what the situation called for.
-Who determined that situation?

1654
01:56:51,737 --> 01:56:52,613
The guard on the scene.

1655
01:56:53,364 --> 01:56:55,363
That's a lot of power to
have over a boy, isn't it?

1656
01:56:55,864 --> 01:56:59,448
-It came with the job, sir.
-Did torture come with the job?

1657
01:57:08,743 --> 01:57:11,204
Boys were tortured, weren't they,
Mr. Ferguson?

1658
01:57:11,287 --> 01:57:12,286
Define torture.

1659
01:57:14,413 --> 01:57:16,039
Well, let's define torture.

1660
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:19,540
Cigarette burning...

1661
01:57:21,082 --> 01:57:22,040
...random beatings...

1662
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:27,126
...solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1663
01:57:28,835 --> 01:57:32,294
-Say that took place?
-On occasion.

1664
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:35,463
-Who tortured them?
-Guards.

1665
01:57:35,671 --> 01:57:36,671
Which guards?

1666
01:57:38,506 --> 01:57:40,839
I can't remember all of them.

1667
01:57:42,674 --> 01:57:43,632
Remember one.

1668
01:57:53,095 --> 01:57:54,138
Remember one.

1669
01:58:01,306 --> 01:58:04,640
This line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case.

1670
01:58:05,182 --> 01:58:07,182
-It will, Your Honor.
-For your sake.

1671
01:58:08,184 --> 01:58:12,686
Mr. Ferguson, was there ever any sexual
abuse at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1672
01:58:16,186 --> 01:58:20,688
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1673
01:58:22,689 --> 01:58:24,148
Yes, I heard that there was.

1674
01:58:24,315 --> 01:58:25,648
I'm not asking what you heard.

1675
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:29,734
I'm asking...what you...saw.

1676
01:58:31,234 --> 01:58:32,319
Please, Ferguson, don't do this.

1677
01:58:33,028 --> 01:58:34,320
I thought you boys liked it.

1678
01:58:35,694 --> 01:58:36,986
Yes, I saw.

1679
01:58:38,696 --> 01:58:42,530
Did you and Sean Nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys?

1680
01:58:44,156 --> 01:58:45,866
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape...

1681
01:58:46,366 --> 01:58:49,199
...any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

1682
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:59,245
Counselors...approach.

1683
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,959
I just fucked your
little friend, Johnny.

1684
01:59:13,126 --> 01:59:15,084
Counselor, what the
hell is going on here?

1685
01:59:17,918 --> 01:59:20,004
I guess I called the
wrong character witness.

1686
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:23,922
Counselor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness...

1687
01:59:24,089 --> 01:59:25,256
...now, it's blown up in your face.

1688
01:59:25,757 --> 01:59:27,466
Please Mr. Ferguson,
don't do this, please.

1689
01:59:33,052 --> 01:59:35,051
Mr. Ferguson,
please answer the question.

1690
01:59:39,595 --> 01:59:42,429
-Mr. Ferguson, Sean Nokes...
-I like it nice and slow.

1691
01:59:42,972 --> 01:59:46,305
...visited your home on numerous
occasions, is that correct?

1692
01:59:46,765 --> 01:59:50,099
Did you ever leave Sean Nokes
alone with your child?

1693
01:59:50,598 --> 01:59:51,391
A child?

1694
01:59:51,974 --> 01:59:55,309
Yes, in other words, would your
ex-wife ever leave Sean Nokes alone...

1695
01:59:55,934 --> 01:59:57,268
...with your child?

1696
01:59:57,433 --> 01:59:58,767
There would be no reason for that.

1697
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,480
There would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child. It wouldn't come up.

1698
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:06,563
Never came up?
Did she ever voice any concern?

1699
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:09,899
We have a statement explaining
why she would never allow...

1700
02:00:10,982 --> 02:00:14,650
...Sean Nokes to be in a
room alone with your son.

1701
02:00:15,484 --> 02:00:16,651
-Objection!
-Sustained.

1702
02:00:26,071 --> 02:00:27,614
You ain't gonna touch me ever again!

1703
02:00:38,118 --> 02:00:38,868
Yes....

1704
02:00:50,121 --> 02:00:51,331
Yes?

1705
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:57,125
Yes, what?

1706
02:01:02,794 --> 02:01:06,128
Yes, Sean Nokes had
experiences with some boys.

1707
02:01:09,712 --> 02:01:13,006
-Were you there?
-Yes.

1708
02:01:14,382 --> 02:01:18,008
-Did you observe these experiences?
-Yes.

1709
02:01:20,717 --> 02:01:23,010
Did you do more than observe?

1710
02:01:23,302 --> 02:01:25,470
I was drinking then....

1711
02:01:28,221 --> 02:01:31,805
Were there any other guards
around during these experiences?

1712
02:01:32,846 --> 02:01:33,722
Yes.

1713
02:01:36,057 --> 02:01:38,267
-With you and Mr. Nokes?
-Yes.

1714
02:01:39,392 --> 02:01:42,643
-On more than one occasion?
-Yes.

1715
02:01:54,857 --> 02:01:58,940
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think
that Sean Nokes was a good man?

1716
02:02:00,357 --> 02:02:01,484
He was my friend.

1717
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:07,527
A friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after?

1718
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:21,741
I have no further questions.

1719
02:02:27,535 --> 02:02:28,952
I want this to be over.

1720
02:02:31,453 --> 02:02:32,912
I want this to be over.

1721
02:02:36,373 --> 02:02:37,790
Witness is excused.

1722
02:02:39,791 --> 02:02:40,583
Mr. Ferguson...

1723
02:02:42,585 --> 02:02:46,585
Mr. Ferguson, if I were you...

1724
02:02:46,751 --> 02:02:48,459
...l wouldn't stray too far from home.

1725
02:02:49,294 --> 02:02:51,545
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

1726
02:02:54,379 --> 02:02:57,130
Michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time.

1727
02:02:57,797 --> 02:03:01,673
Playing prosecution and defense attorney,
he exposed Ferguson for what he was...

1728
02:03:01,883 --> 02:03:04,091
...and still kept John and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes...

1729
02:03:04,175 --> 02:03:05,674
...hidden from the eyes of the court.

1730
02:03:06,593 --> 02:03:11,012
Little Caesar, who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket...

1731
02:03:11,594 --> 02:03:13,220
...called in the Henry Addison loan.

1732
02:03:15,096 --> 02:03:17,096
It was a loan Addison couldn't
afford to pay back.

1733
02:03:17,848 --> 02:03:20,515
And it gave Little Caesar
the only reason he needed...

1734
02:03:20,764 --> 02:03:22,307
...to even his score for Rizzo.

1735
02:03:53,153 --> 02:03:56,278
Davenport wasted little time on
following up on Adam Styler.

1736
02:03:57,112 --> 02:03:59,363
He was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death...

1737
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:02,531
...of the Queens drug dealer, and eight
counts of corruption and bribery.

1738
02:04:17,996 --> 02:04:19,330
That's six for me, two for you.

1739
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:25,582
Most people play this game
in the summer.

1740
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:28,374
It's easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

1741
02:04:29,041 --> 02:04:30,626
I give a fuck about most people!

1742
02:04:36,086 --> 02:04:39,254
You're gonna have a heart attack...
and I'm not breathing in your mouth.

1743
02:04:40,754 --> 02:04:42,214
Well, I'm not going to marry you either.

1744
02:04:45,923 --> 02:04:49,050
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

1745
02:04:49,841 --> 02:04:53,259
A spic be living in the White House by
the time it reaches their fucking brains!

1746
02:04:53,676 --> 02:04:56,595
Snyder came through big.
He's not half bad.

1747
02:04:57,052 --> 02:04:59,095
The way you told it, I thought
he could hardly stand up.

1748
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:01,929
He's a drunk, but he's not a fool.

1749
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:04,347
We only win when John and Tommy walk.

1750
02:05:05,099 --> 02:05:07,598
Then you'll have to get them
out of the shooting hall.

1751
02:05:07,766 --> 02:05:11,266
You have to put them some place else.
And only a witness does that for you.

1752
02:05:11,558 --> 02:05:14,601
Now, he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker!

1753
02:05:15,018 --> 02:05:18,351
What if he doesn't show? What if
we have to go on the way we are?

1754
02:05:19,603 --> 02:05:21,437
The street is the only one that matters.

1755
02:05:22,064 --> 02:05:25,397
Court is for uptown people
with suits, money...

1756
02:05:25,563 --> 02:05:29,024
...lawyers with three names. If you
got cash, you can buy court justice.

1757
02:05:29,773 --> 02:05:32,440
But on the street, justice has no price.

1758
02:05:32,607 --> 02:05:36,068
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

1759
02:05:36,235 --> 02:05:40,738
-Out here, the bitch got eyes.
-We need both.

1760
02:05:42,612 --> 02:05:44,321
Then you need a witness.

1761
02:06:31,589 --> 02:06:34,924
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you are to disregard...

1762
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:36,426
...the testimony of Ralph Ferguson.

1763
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:40,343
His entire testimony is
stricken from this record.

1764
02:06:40,844 --> 02:06:42,636
That concludes the people's case,
Your Honor.

1765
02:06:42,803 --> 02:06:44,511
-The people rest?
-The people rest.

1766
02:06:45,137 --> 02:06:46,513
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1767
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:54,015
Your Honor, I don't...
I don't know.

1768
02:06:54,182 --> 02:06:54,974
You don't know?

1769
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:57,475
Well, I'm not sure that...
we're waiting...

1770
02:06:58,642 --> 02:07:01,643
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Present
a witness or be prepared to sum up!

1771
02:07:24,945 --> 02:07:25,694
Everything good?

1772
02:08:02,084 --> 02:08:04,753
I found it very interesting
attending morning Mass.

1773
02:08:08,377 --> 02:08:10,919
Your Honor, the defense
calls Father Robert Carillo.

1774
02:08:19,965 --> 02:08:21,716
Father, do you know most of
the people in your parish?

1775
02:08:22,299 --> 02:08:23,385
I know all the people in my parish.

1776
02:08:23,549 --> 02:08:25,926
Do you know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?

1777
02:08:27,427 --> 02:08:30,429
-How long have you known them?
-Since they were boys.

1778
02:08:31,262 --> 02:08:32,596
They were both students of mine.

1779
02:08:32,763 --> 02:08:33,429
Remain standing.

1780
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,597
-How long have you been there?
-It'll be twenty years this spring.

1781
02:08:39,181 --> 02:08:40,099
I'm a priest.

1782
02:08:40,266 --> 02:08:41,767
In the case of the people
of the State of New York...

1783
02:08:41,849 --> 02:08:43,807
...against John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1784
02:08:44,808 --> 02:08:47,143
...do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth...

1785
02:08:47,393 --> 02:08:49,895
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

1786
02:08:51,562 --> 02:08:52,312
I do.

1787
02:08:52,813 --> 02:08:57,230
Acting pastor, serve Mass daily,
listen to confessions....

1788
02:08:59,649 --> 02:09:03,358
Do you recall where you were on the
night of November first this past year?

1789
02:09:03,815 --> 02:09:06,274
-Yes, I do.
-Where was that?

1790
02:09:06,525 --> 02:09:10,111
I was at the basketball game at
the Garden: the Knicks vs. the Celtics.

1791
02:09:10,778 --> 02:09:13,779
And when did the Knicks game begin?

1792
02:09:16,155 --> 02:09:18,155
-About 7:30.
-What time did it end?

1793
02:09:18,989 --> 02:09:20,323
Between 9:30 and 10:00.

1794
02:09:21,447 --> 02:09:22,782
Do you remember who won that game?

1795
02:09:23,615 --> 02:09:25,158
Sad to say, it was the Celtics.

1796
02:09:25,449 --> 02:09:28,660
Kevin McHale and Robert Parish were
a little too much for our boys that night.

1797
02:09:28,952 --> 02:09:30,285
Even if it was All Saints Day.

1798
02:09:31,535 --> 02:09:33,953
Next time, you give me a call,
I'll try my guy.

1799
02:09:34,037 --> 02:09:34,995
I'll try that.

1800
02:09:37,955 --> 02:09:39,664
Father Carillo,
were you at the game alone?

1801
02:09:41,539 --> 02:09:42,873
No, I went there with two friends.

1802
02:09:43,873 --> 02:09:45,208
And who were those two friends?

1803
02:09:47,209 --> 02:09:49,042
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

1804
02:09:51,002 --> 02:09:54,752
-The two defendants?
-Yes, the same two defendants.

1805
02:09:55,879 --> 02:09:59,754
Father Carillo, at 8:25 p.m.,
the time the police say...

1806
02:10:00,338 --> 02:10:02,339
...victim Sean Nokes was murdered...

1807
02:10:02,547 --> 02:10:06,174
...were you still with Mr. Reilly and
Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

1808
02:10:06,508 --> 02:10:07,841
Yes, I was.

1809
02:10:08,216 --> 02:10:11,842
And what time did you, Mr. Reilly,
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1810
02:10:13,511 --> 02:10:16,844
It was around 10:30...a little later.

1811
02:10:17,513 --> 02:10:20,513
They dropped me off in front of the
rectory, near where they'd picked me up.

1812
02:10:21,681 --> 02:10:23,099
Did the two defendants tell
you where they were going?

1813
02:10:24,057 --> 02:10:26,848
No, they didn't, but I imagine,
after a night spent with a priest...

1814
02:10:27,058 --> 02:10:29,016
...they went looking for the
first open bar they could find.

1815
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:34,726
So then, Father, if the two defendants
were with you at 8:25...

1816
02:10:34,893 --> 02:10:38,019
...the night of the murder, they couldn't
have shot and killed Sean Nokes...

1817
02:10:38,186 --> 02:10:40,562
...as the prosecution contends.
Isn't that correct?

1818
02:10:42,105 --> 02:10:44,398
Not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the Garden.

1819
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:48,900
He was not shot from there.

1820
02:10:52,067 --> 02:10:53,776
And he was not shot by those boys.

1821
02:10:55,944 --> 02:10:58,027
No further questions, Your Honor.

1822
02:10:58,736 --> 02:11:00,154
Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.

1823
02:11:00,654 --> 02:11:01,614
Thank you, Your Honor.

1824
02:11:07,283 --> 02:11:09,282
Did you buy the tickets for the game
Father, or were they given to you?

1825
02:11:09,449 --> 02:11:11,117
-No, I bought them.
-On the day of the game?

1826
02:11:11,409 --> 02:11:13,616
I went to the box office
about a week before.

1827
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,994
Did anyone know you were going to the
game, other than the two defendants?

1828
02:11:17,286 --> 02:11:18,202
I don't think so.

1829
02:11:18,910 --> 02:11:21,371
Was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets?

1830
02:11:21,454 --> 02:11:22,246
No.

1831
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:24,955
-No one saw you buy the tickets?
-That's right.

1832
02:11:25,289 --> 02:11:27,289
-Did you get a receipt?
-No, I didn't.

1833
02:11:27,581 --> 02:11:30,456
Paid by check?
Mastercard? Visa?

1834
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:34,251
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1835
02:11:36,251 --> 02:11:38,878
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

1836
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:39,795
Very much.

1837
02:11:41,337 --> 02:11:43,588
And there isn't anything you
wouldn't do for them, am I right?

1838
02:11:44,213 --> 02:11:46,755
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1839
02:11:47,797 --> 02:11:51,132
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1840
02:11:51,965 --> 02:11:53,632
Something along those lines, yes.

1841
02:11:54,132 --> 02:11:57,093
And is it true then, as a good father,
you would want to protect them...

1842
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:58,594
...from something they
shouldn't have done.

1843
02:11:58,801 --> 02:12:02,803
As much as I would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did.

1844
02:12:03,512 --> 02:12:06,680
-Like a murder?
-Yes, like a murder.

1845
02:12:07,972 --> 02:12:11,599
Let me get this straight then.
No one knew you were going to the game.

1846
02:12:11,763 --> 02:12:14,224
No one saw you at the game. No one
saw you buy tickets for the game.

1847
02:12:14,474 --> 02:12:15,892
There's no record you even
bought tickets.

1848
02:12:15,975 --> 02:12:18,019
You have no receipt for the tickets.

1849
02:12:18,309 --> 02:12:22,020
-Am I correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

1850
02:12:22,644 --> 02:12:24,271
Then how do we really know, Father?

1851
02:12:24,687 --> 02:12:25,896
How do we know...

1852
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:28,897
...you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder?

1853
02:12:30,272 --> 02:12:33,898
I'm telling you as a witness...
and as a priest. We were at the game.

1854
02:12:34,065 --> 02:12:37,859
Yes, as a priest, and a priest
wouldn't lie? Am I right?

1855
02:12:38,526 --> 02:12:41,027
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1856
02:12:43,903 --> 02:12:45,403
I always keep the stubs.

1857
02:12:50,363 --> 02:12:51,155
Do you want to see them?

1858
02:12:58,534 --> 02:13:00,784
Why is that, Father?
Why do you keep the stubs?

1859
02:13:01,534 --> 02:13:04,368
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1860
02:13:06,828 --> 02:13:08,746
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

1861
02:13:08,996 --> 02:13:13,290
No. No one ever has. But there's
a first time for everything.

1862
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:26,086
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1863
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:30,754
Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

1864
02:13:38,092 --> 02:13:41,675
I've never recovered from seeing Father
Bobby take the stand and lie for us...

1865
02:13:41,925 --> 02:13:43,760
...to even the score for John and Tommy.

1866
02:13:45,218 --> 02:13:48,261
He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson's...

1867
02:13:48,844 --> 02:13:50,930
...and the evil that had lived
there for too long.

1868
02:13:51,596 --> 02:13:53,597
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

1869
02:14:00,934 --> 02:14:03,726
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1870
02:14:03,935 --> 02:14:07,768
...do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilty or not guilty?

1871
02:14:07,936 --> 02:14:08,937
Not guilty.

1872
02:14:09,104 --> 02:14:11,729
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1873
02:14:11,896 --> 02:14:16,564
...do you find the defendant, Thomas
Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1874
02:14:16,856 --> 02:14:17,941
Not guilty.

1875
02:14:18,815 --> 02:14:21,941
Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

1876
02:14:42,698 --> 02:14:44,991
Hi, how are you?
Could I get a hot dog?

1877
02:14:46,242 --> 02:14:50,244
Mustard and relish...a lot of relish.

1878
02:14:53,287 --> 02:14:54,746
Give him two napkins.

1879
02:15:00,623 --> 02:15:01,957
You did good in there, counselor.

1880
02:15:04,499 --> 02:15:05,959
So, what happens to you now?

1881
02:15:06,293 --> 02:15:07,917
What happens?
I walk away.

1882
02:15:09,835 --> 02:15:11,836
Wait a few weeks,
I'll hand them my notice.

1883
02:15:13,002 --> 02:15:15,003
After the way I handled this case...

1884
02:15:15,879 --> 02:15:17,879
...they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1885
02:15:20,673 --> 02:15:24,466
So, you switch to the other side and work
as a defense lawyer. The money's better.

1886
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:28,175
There's always gonna be more
bad guys than good, Mikey.

1887
02:15:30,135 --> 02:15:32,803
And can you imagine the work you'd
get from John and Tommy's crew?

1888
02:15:33,886 --> 02:15:35,178
That's a house and a pool.

1889
02:15:37,721 --> 02:15:41,888
Not for me. I've seen
all the law I want to see.

1890
02:15:43,348 --> 02:15:46,016
-It's time for something else.
-Like what?

1891
02:15:46,517 --> 02:15:47,851
I'll let you know when I know.

1892
02:15:49,058 --> 02:15:51,601
You know, you're too old to
play for the Yankees...

1893
02:15:51,684 --> 02:15:53,061
...and you're too young to take up golf.

1894
02:15:53,519 --> 02:15:55,353
Why are you shooting holes
through all of my plans?

1895
02:15:55,519 --> 02:15:56,562
You gonna make me panic.

1896
02:15:58,312 --> 02:15:59,647
You'll work it out.
You always have.

1897
02:16:05,857 --> 02:16:07,442
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1898
02:16:09,568 --> 02:16:12,776
I just want to shut my eyes and not
have to see the places I've been.

1899
02:16:15,693 --> 02:16:16,737
I'm weary...

1900
02:16:21,281 --> 02:16:22,323
I don't know.

1901
02:16:25,407 --> 02:16:27,615
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

1902
02:16:29,241 --> 02:16:31,200
Well, don't disappear on me,
counselor.

1903
02:16:32,783 --> 02:16:34,577
I may need a good lawyer one day.

1904
02:16:34,784 --> 02:16:35,910
You can't afford a good lawyer.

1905
02:16:38,911 --> 02:16:40,413
I may need a good friend, though.

1906
02:16:43,789 --> 02:16:46,123
I'll find you when you do.
Count on it.

1907
02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:49,416
Always have.

1908
02:16:56,084 --> 02:16:59,628
A full month had passed since the
acquittal, and no one had made contact.

1909
02:17:00,212 --> 02:17:02,879
In those few weeks, our lives had
reverted back to what they'd been...

1910
02:17:03,047 --> 02:17:04,881
...prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

1911
02:17:05,504 --> 02:17:08,841
Carol had returned to her
stack of social service files...

1912
02:17:09,049 --> 02:17:10,467
...helping troubled teens
and single mothers.

1913
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:14,967
John and Tommy went back to the
streets, running the West Side Boys.

1914
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,886
I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.

1915
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:22,888
Michael, as he'd promised,
resigned from his job...

1916
02:17:23,096 --> 02:17:25,305
...after working the losing
end of a "can't miss case".

1917
02:17:30,557 --> 02:17:32,307
I don't know how to fucking thank you!

1918
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:39,436
I can't believe what you did.
I can't believe we got away with it!

1919
02:17:39,602 --> 02:17:42,478
It wasn't me. That was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1920
02:17:42,645 --> 02:17:45,270
When I first heard he was taking the
case, I was gonna have him burned.

1921
02:17:46,313 --> 02:17:48,981
I figured, he's a friend, and if you've
gotta be sent away on a murder rap...

1922
02:17:49,147 --> 02:17:49,814
...who better to do it?

1923
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:52,649
Well, the way he was handling the case,
I thought he sucked as a lawyer.

1924
02:17:52,857 --> 02:17:54,275
I started feeling sorry for the bastard.

1925
02:17:55,484 --> 02:17:56,943
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1926
02:17:58,027 --> 02:17:59,486
Get over here, counselor!

1927
02:18:00,443 --> 02:18:02,694
You are the real Count!

1928
02:18:02,862 --> 02:18:05,154
Alive and well and
living in New York City!

1929
02:18:07,321 --> 02:18:09,656
You fucking maniac! All right!

1930
02:18:11,864 --> 02:18:13,365
What is this, a gay bar?

1931
02:18:15,034 --> 02:18:16,367
It was until you came in!

1932
02:18:16,659 --> 02:18:18,201
Why don't you give me a
kiss to go with that hello?

1933
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:26,704
Get out of the way.

1934
02:18:32,372 --> 02:18:33,290
Let's have a drink.

1935
02:18:39,168 --> 02:18:40,502
The Four Gladiators!

1936
02:18:41,918 --> 02:18:45,670
The "Four Gladiators", worst quartet
to ever hold a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1937
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:48,671
But what was that name that
Shakes wanted to call it?

1938
02:18:48,921 --> 02:18:52,132
Genius wanted to call it,
"The Count and His Cristos."

1939
02:18:52,381 --> 02:18:54,632
-Nice!
-Well, you know, it's so sweet, isn't it?

1940
02:18:56,258 --> 02:18:58,259
Hey, that would've sent albums
flying out of the store.

1941
02:18:58,424 --> 02:19:00,842
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

1942
02:19:01,009 --> 02:19:02,717
That kid at the deaf school don't count!

1943
02:19:07,762 --> 02:19:08,887
One song for Carol.

1944
02:19:09,595 --> 02:19:11,847
-I retired a long time ago.
-Come on, you mutts!

1945
02:19:12,222 --> 02:19:14,223
Don't you guys have to go out
and shoot somebody?

1946
02:19:19,892 --> 02:19:22,018
We always got time for a song!

1947
02:19:23,477 --> 02:19:25,226
Just kidding, you know what I'm saying?

1948
02:19:26,851 --> 02:19:28,436
You pick it, Mikey.
Nothing too slow.

1949
02:19:28,812 --> 02:19:29,645
Start us up.

1950
02:19:33,398 --> 02:19:35,731
-How many songs do you know?
-One.

1951
02:19:41,567 --> 02:19:46,236
"Walk...like...a...man!"

1952
02:19:49,237 --> 02:19:51,237
"Walk like a man..."

1953
02:19:51,405 --> 02:19:52,613
"...fast as you can..."

1954
02:19:53,114 --> 02:19:56,446
"Walk...like a man, my son..."

1955
02:19:57,574 --> 02:20:00,824
"Go tell the world...
forget about the girl!"

1956
02:20:01,116 --> 02:20:02,825
Don't forget about the girl!

1957
02:20:17,081 --> 02:20:19,415
On March 16, 1984...

1958
02:20:19,582 --> 02:20:22,708
John Reilly's bloated body was found
face up in a tenement building...

1959
02:20:23,207 --> 02:20:25,500
...right next to the bottle of
boiler gin that killed him.

1960
02:20:26,084 --> 02:20:29,794
At the time of his death, he was a
suspect in five unsolved homicides.

1961
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:32,587
He was two weeks past
his 29th birthday.

1962
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:41,090
Thomas Marcano died on July 26, 1985.

1963
02:20:41,257 --> 02:20:43,716
He was shot at close range 5 times.

1964
02:20:44,091 --> 02:20:46,509
The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.

1965
02:20:46,968 --> 02:20:50,136
There was a crucifix and a picture
of Saint Jude in his pocket.

1966
02:20:50,511 --> 02:20:51,970
He was 29 years old.

1967
02:20:54,345 --> 02:20:57,430
Michael Sullivan lives in a small
town in the English countryside...

1968
02:20:57,598 --> 02:20:59,264
...where he works part-time
as a carpenter.

1969
02:20:59,972 --> 02:21:02,807
He no longer practices law,
and he has never married.

1970
02:21:03,475 --> 02:21:05,184
He lives quietly and alone.

1971
02:21:07,976 --> 02:21:12,144
Carol still works for a Social Service
agency and lives in Hell's Kitchen.

1972
02:21:12,686 --> 02:21:13,811
She has never married...

1973
02:21:14,186 --> 02:21:16,812
...but is a single mother supporting
a growing 12-year-old son.

1974
02:21:18,021 --> 02:21:22,356
The boy, John Thomas Michael
Martinez, loves to read...

1975
02:21:22,815 --> 02:21:24,400
...and is called Shakes by his mother.

1976
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:30,860
It was our special night, and we
held it for as long as we could.

1977
02:21:31,401 --> 02:21:32,776
It was our happy ending.

1978
02:21:33,777 --> 02:21:36,196
And the last time we would
ever be together again.

1979
02:22:25,757 --> 02:22:27,882
The future lay sparkling ahead...

1980
02:22:28,257 --> 02:22:30,424
...and we thought we would
know each other forever.
