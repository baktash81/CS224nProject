00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,834
I do not know if he told you
something from me.

180
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,600
So you're the famous Benny.

181
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,334
Only now I became aware of
happened to my brother and ...

182
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:43,500
I wonder if you
you can tell me something.

183
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Already imagine how he fell

184
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I also would like to talk,
but now I can not.

185
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,334
You know, I'll give you my address.

186
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,000
And one thing
I do not usually do.

187
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,199
If you want to ...

188
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,234
What are you doing with
my wife stupid.

189
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:09,234
Rest assured my love,
he is a relative.

190
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,400
- I was going away is not it?
- Yes

191
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,500

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Ai is the address.

193
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Take care of yourself.

194
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
And oh man, that
I help you?

195
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,734
I'm looking for Mrs.
Lupita, she lives here, no?

196
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,065
It is not now

197
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,100
Moreover Cum
you need to know

198
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,134
that do not receive
customers at home.

199
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,034
Relax boy, I'm not customer
I'm Benjamin Garcia.

200
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,200
- The brother of her.
- Uncle Benny.

201
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
U.S.?

202
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,499
I am also Benjamin,
I am your nephew!

203
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Enter Uncle, do not get there.
It can take between.

204
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,799
Do not want anything to drink?

205
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,300
No boy, I better
expect that his mother arrives.

206
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Sit there Uncle, do not be
al standing, sit down.

207
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,199
Listen only,

208
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,234
It is true that got rich
there "Gringolandia"?

209
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,800
My father said that was
filling with money.

210
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,734
More or less.
Better tell me about you.

211
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:02,234
How was the relationship between
you and your father?

212
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,199
- Remember him?
- How not.

213
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,665
If my father was the most badass
this damn town.

214
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,733
They say it was the most fucked

215
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,234
But with women
even more weapons.

216
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,234
And to say he killed
more than 20 jerks.

217
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,251
Well, better tell you.

218
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:17,234
How old are you?

219
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,199
I? 16

220
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,199
That this ...
stop being a liar.

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,834
Actually I'm 14, I
I do not know if I see older.

222
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,199
Oh 'yeah. "

223
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,199
What year in school?

224
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
Better not talk that uncle in
I'm not really good for the school.

225
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,734
Ever wonder what
will be when you grow up?

226
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:39,300
Of course, what else?
a badass like my father.

227
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,599
Hi mom.
Have you seen who's here?

228
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,634
Uncle Benny, the brother of my father.
the United States.

229
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:50,599
Yes we already know.
Are you all right?

230
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes my namesake and I were
talking a few things.

231
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,799
Right.
You did your job?

232
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Sure mom, Uncle Benny helped me
to do, is not it, uncle?

233
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,900
Oh boy, who believes
his grandmother, eh?

234
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,200
Walk goes to sleep
it's late.

235
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,334
We see his uncle,
My hour has arrived.

236
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,601
Soon we find ourselves.
And drink some brejas.

237
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,000
- Ok namesake, I'm staying here.
- Ok then.

238
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,000
How can my brother

239
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,100
may have finished
well that way.

240
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,700
Oh, when I met her
brother, he was an asshole done.

241
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,234
But despite all
always loved a lot.

242
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,234
You know who killed him?

243
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,199
No idea.

244
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,234
His brother had many enemies.
It could have been anyone.

245
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,199
And as my nephew
This absorbed.

246
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,234
When Peter died, he
was very small.

247
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,199
But it made him the hero,

248
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,299
In fact I am terrified
who live here

249
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,199
wants to follow in his footsteps.

250
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,299
And you think that the
What you do is

251
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,199
a good example for
my nephew?

252
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,299
What are you talking about, idiot.

253
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Do not fret Lupita, but you
think work bitch

254
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,900
in a brothel
can be good for a ...

255
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,299
You know something
Benjamin Garcia?

256
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,834
You're worse than his brother,
asshole. - Lupita ...

257
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,334
It goes right where you came from,
ie, the whorehouse!

258
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,000
Vai

259
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,899
Sorry Lupita
I did not want ...

260
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
Go to shoeing
his mother, idiot!

261
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,000
Damn "brother," looks just like
you just ... man.

262
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
Drug dealer, murderer

263
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,934
Pimp, and killed worst
a mongrel dog.

264
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:33,100
What happened to you?
Brother.

265
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,934
But I swear
the little virgin of Guadalupe.

266
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,951
I'll ... I'll try
help his wife

267
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,960
that can lead to
the front of your child.

268
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,100
For some reason that
things happen, brother.

269
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,434
I swear that Deuzinho Holy
is a witness

270
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,500
This time it'll fail.

271
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,100
And I end up going in
very same hell if you do not.

272
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey affiliate.

273
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,599
And Lupe?
Remains that hot?

274
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,699
What was the Godfather, is talking
the widow of my brother.

275
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,299
Oh, affiliate, a
thing is one thing

276
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,000
and another thing is another thing.

277
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,699
Now that is true,
she is hot.

278
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,000
Ah, but as my brother and
my nephew look.

279
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
God forbid
is equal to it.

280
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,299
Large Benjamin Garcia

281
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,334
Because you've got
was crying, comrade.

282
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:33,334
Look at the Fat Matta.

283
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,900
How are you?

284
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,299
How will my friend.

285
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,334
I am no longer the Fat
My friend Benny Matta

286
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,334
Now I know the whole race
The Cochiloco as

287
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,299
How will Mr. Rogaciano.

288
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,334
Cochiloco looks
only the little man

289
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,334
As for business,
what works?

290
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,351
Here as well pissed off, that
returning to the city

291
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,299
and do not compliment the
fuck your best friend!

292
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,834
Where have you seen
such ingratitude!

293
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,335
I swear I was gonna
hello Gordo

294
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,851
but I'm here with
My Godfather ...

295
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,500
I am no longer the Fat
Matta, friend Benny.

296
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Now I'm The Cochiloco,
clear?

297
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Okay, but if ...

298
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
Benny fucking asshole.

299
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,399
Like when we were
kids, man.

300
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,899
You're blood brothers,
you can fill my bag

301
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,700
well when you want, man.

302
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,634
Here, these two
are my colleagues

303
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,599
The Huasteco Meritito of Tampico

304
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
And this one is a fagot
catchy as fuck is a doll.

305
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Yes, we've had a taste
to know us.

306
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,999
You see her here
sons of bitches one,

307
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,999
Let me be clear to you.

308
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,934
This guy, seeing as they are,
dwarf and primed, is a brother!

309
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:46,034
If one of you put your hand,
you will understand me!

310
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,999
- How about that, it was clear!?
- As water Cochiloco.

311
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Heck no, sorry
By yesterday, my friend.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,999
It has been passed.

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
And then, let's drink to celebrate?

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,034
Why, Cochiloco, I'm working
here with my Godfather.

315
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,999
Do not even think about leaving him in the hand.

316
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,099
He'll give you permission,
is not Rogaciano

317
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
will leave him in the suit?

318
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,999
No.

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,200
- Let's go.
- Let me change clothes.

320
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Damn mobsters.

321
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,234
There goes precious.

322
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,199
Cochi Thank you!

323
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Me and Benny in
known each other since kids

324
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,900
is not the same guy?

325
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,299
Ever since then he wanted to go
the other hand "Imigrantinho".

326
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,400
We made friendships that
he advocated

327
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,200
big guy an idiot,
the "ears".

328
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,234
What happened to this guy?

329
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,165
What happens to everyone.

330
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,234
Those who do not have to
the other side as you,

331
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,299
If they put in
business and screwed.

332
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,800
That "White Girl" and Jesus
they have in their Santa Gloria.

333
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,234
Listen Cochi,
tell me the truth.

334
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,300
What happened to my brother?

335
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,600
I mean just to take the head
and stop thinking about it

336
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,734
His brother worked for the
Reyes as all of us here.

337
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,799
Was badass same.
Fucker same.

338
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,399
But one day we were
working for the city

339
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
and shot dead.

340
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,234
Sons of bitches.

341
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,965
If it's any consolation,

342
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,899
The run with interests
these fucking, is not it?

343
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,200
Thanks, man.

344
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,134
Hey, did not come to
Benny feel sadness.

345
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,899
We came to party,
and as mentioned ...

346
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,934
Let's drink, in memory of
crazy devil of a fellow law.

347
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,934
- Cheers!
- A real badass.

348
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,451
Gloria bring another bottle,

349
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,710
You know what filly?
Give me that I take.

350
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:38,100
I have a son to care for.

351
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,700
See Benny, I present
Mrs. Lupita Soliz.

352
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,534
- She was the wife of his brother ...
- Yes, yes, since we met.

353
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,499
Missy and I, is not it?

354
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,700
What a pleasure to see him "Cowboy."
Even more in good company.

355
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,700
What caused her to
so that the case?

356
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Listen, now returned,
what will make money?

357
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,800
I wanted to do an English language school

358
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,300
but as I see
how are things.

359
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,834
I think I'll end up
returning to the other side.

360
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,365
Do not be stupid Benny.

361
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,400
Go back along with the
Yankees to end

362
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,134
bringing you the
toes, fuck.

363
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,700
Look.

364
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
This country has a lot
opportunities

365
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,000
to have money, buddy.

366
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,699
Or not?

367
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,699
Look at this, the Holy
Patron of pure gold.

368
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,334
And let me tell you, if you need
you can serve it ...

369
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,900
Not Cochi,
thank you but ...

370
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,899
Hello?

371
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Sir, what happened?

372
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,100
In half an hour we are there.

373
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,100
Let monkeys that Mr. Reyes
comrades in need.

374
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,899
Benny.

375
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
- Anything to give me
a cry, buddy.

376
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,500
Ok Cochi.

377
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,100
- Hey Cochi, Cochi!
- Write down the account, Camilo.

378
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Still bored
Lupita me?

379
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
And there?

380
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,100
You'll want something else or
goes straight to deal with the lady?

381
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,600
No, neither, thank you.

382
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,400
If you will not eat or fuck.
Go fuck your mother so expensive.

383
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Just right.
"Cowboy".

384
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,300
It is affiliated, this shit
every day is worse.

385
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Here we do not stop flies.

386
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Remember that before
you go "Gringolandia"

387
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Would put up a
garage?

388
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,299
Why not leave the
Godfather business?

389
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Because this fucking country,
does not want

390
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,334
and yes you can.

391
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:05,500
By a miracle I did not have
Reyes to sell this bodywork.

392
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,799
So who are these Reyes
put them up and down?

393
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
They're criminals farmers

394
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,334
we all know
as Reyes (Kings) in the north.

395
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:17,000
The head is the old Joseph

396
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,800
A son of a bitch,
directing all

397
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:22,734
the murky business
area and all around,

398
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:25,500
Trafficking, kidnappings,
prostitution.

399
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,000
Smuggling and how fucking dirty
you can imagine.

400
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,500
But Comrade, is protected,
from far, far above.

401
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,834
- And the other?
- Brother, Mr. Pancho.

402
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:41,000
The mere badass San Francisco.

403
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,299
What is the problem between the two?

404
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,800
The thing is rotten
when Joseph decided

405
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:48,500
his son Jesus,
would be the successor.

406
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,834
The other Reyes, Pancho
was pissed off.

407
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,799
And declared war on his brother.

408
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
And since then,
waging a war

409
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,334
by region
seems to have no end.

410
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:00,799
Oh, this movie is good.

411
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,799
What movie shit affiliate.

412
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
This war has made the narco
more dead than the revolution,

413
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,834
You should not have offered gig
Cochiloco this friend is not it?

414
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:14,000
Godfather that this would be the
last thing I would do.

415
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Look affiliate.

416
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,034
All I have in this life.

417
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,700
It is this bodywork is yours.

418
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,834
But it will not make the burrada
follow in the footsteps of his brother.

419
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:33,000
What was Godfather?
Trust me.

420
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,799
But since they said
we are partners, and ...

421
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,000
There is a way of ...
borrow some money?

422
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000
<i> TAKE CARE OF U.S.!
SANTA MARIA. </ I></i>

423
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,334
What is it?
Why is the honor?

424
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:04,800
No, here only sister, wanted
smoking the peace pipe.

425
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,700
They are very beautiful, thank you.

426
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,000
- Between.
- Thank you.

427
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,534
That was when we went to Oxaca

428
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,499
He said that on vacation.

429
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,000
Disappeared for 13 days
and when he had appeared

430
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:27,534
received a shot in the shoulder
and bleeding from foot to head.

431
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,700
Since we could not even
visit the Cathedral.

432
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,499
And you married?

433
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
Offered at each instant,
but whenever

434
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,534
the time came, he
arranged a pretext.

435
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:41,700
After all I do not
doubted that he loved me.

436
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,499
He did have good taste.

437
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
Stop playing, why
I see myself all over.

438
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
But the truth is that
when it was brand new

439
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,534
I think it came
to stop all traffic.

440
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:56,700
Ah, nothing to see beautiful, if you
still stops anything.

441
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,499
Calm "Cowboy."

442
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,534
I'm even more confused.

443
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,499
What confused or anything.

444
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,700
The same feels from here
there, sit back and forth.

445
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,400
What is it boy?

446
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,234
I know where you been?

447
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,199
- For al.
- For al ...

448
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,234
Not been drinking
again is not it?

449
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:24,199
Only a "Caguama" mother.

450
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You go straight to the
bed and tomorrow you

451
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,399
do not wake up to
school, you will see that!

452
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,900
You have a good mother
understood the hint.

453
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Oh let them to continue
where they were.

454
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,334
- We see Uncle Benny.
- Yes

455
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,000
Good fun with my mother.

456
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
What a dumb kid.

457
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
Just 14 years,
imagine when grow.

458
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,334
To me it makes me shiver, that
looks like my brother.

459
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:53,299
They talk just like it.

460
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
In fact you
also seems a lot.

461
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,934
You know what I was thinking
just now when you kiss me?

462
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,434
Hey, you know Lupita?
I think it'll go away.

463
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:04,399
Because it's getting late and ...

464
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,600
- No, no, no, no,
will not go away "Cowboy."

465
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
I know what I'm talking about.

466
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,100
Come.

467
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,100
This guy is lucky.

468
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh my love.

469
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,200
- Oh, it was good.
- Oh yeah?

470
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,700
You will see my love.

471
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,034
I'll start working

472
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:47,034
And I will care for your child.

473
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,999
Thank you my devil.

474
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,534
How come my cat,
as my Devil?

475
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,600
Oh sorry, my mistake.

476
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,000
And where did you sleep last, comrade?

477
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,799
I went to visit my mother and ...

478
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,834
got there late, and
I was there along with it.

479
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,799
I know ... your mother.

480
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,799
Yes and no, your mother ...

00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,834
I no longer suck the finger affiliate ...

482
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,851
<i>I have three women  gentlemen, </ i></i>

<i>The three  love them too </ i></i>

00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:32,534
Ai is looking for you,

00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,334
<i> Why are the cream and the can, </ i></i>

489
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,299
What was mama?

490
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,299
Oh Benny, I am a
major problem.

491
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,199
Big problem?
What happened to my baby?

492
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,734
The fucking his nephew did
a pentelhada and is being held.

493
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,000
Like so detainee?
No kidding ...

494
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,000
And soon they need to be with
you and I can not go.

495
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,834
You can fix this for me?

496
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,601
Of course, my love, do not worry.

497
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:56,299
But I have no money.

498
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,334
Here I 3.000 I went forth
and more than the 5.000 Camilo gave me.

499
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,299
I think that's enough.

500
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,834
Yes, yes, do not worry, I
I'll take care of my nephew.

501

<i> Bianca is the one that moves
Speaking is very little good. </ I></i>

00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:17,200
<i> Mari smelling green eyes
His tail is pure will. </ I></i>

505
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,499

<i> And I have a black veins
but this makes me mad. </ i></i>

507
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,000
With 8.000 pesos think
that will not give Mr. Garcia.

508
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,834
Do you know who tried to steal this
offender of his nephew?

509
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,799
At the very same Mayor,

510
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,334
His nephew is a repeat offender
no other remedy

511
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,834
consign it to the correctional
Amaya is not so?

512
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:48,000
There is no way to say it best, boss.

513
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,334
Commander, I know it's
serious lack of the boy.

514
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:59,000
But there would otherwise
to solve this?

515
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,299
See, Mr. Garcia,

516
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,500
It'll remember how it works
things in Mexico.

517
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,299
And more or less as
will leave the big problem?

518
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,500
Because you and understanding
you just

519
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800

I'll leave ...

520
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,799
- 50 short stories.
- 50,000 pesos!?

521
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,834
Where will I get
that amount?

522
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,799
Your boy is already booked.

523
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,000
If you do not get this money
until 12, I have to do.

524
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,799
That was Benny, what's the urgency?

525
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Cochi Yes, I'm stuck
and a big big problem ...

526
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,834

527
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:46,834
Hey gang!, All for the slut
that gave birth, walk.

528
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,700
Come on!

529
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,699
What kind of problem?
Deleting someone?

530
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,734
No, I would never do that Cochi.
My nephew is in prison.

531
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,734
And I needed 50.000
to help my ...

532
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,699
My sister in law.

533
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,900
Do not tell me who walks
giving her a deal.

534
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,799
Damn Benny.

535
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,000
I had heard this bedtime
to press, but the coined face ...

536
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,799
Do not think badly Cochi, is
to help my nephew.

537
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,400
Oh yeah ... do not fucking like

538
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,834
Now follows that you

00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,351
She is very
hot, man!

540
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,799
Do not be silly Cochi.

541
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,799
It is something urgent that money and ...

542
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,834
And you said that if
I needed to work ...

543
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,000
What would count on you and ...

544
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:35,000
See Benny.

545
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,000
The life of "drug."

546
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,300
In fact gives
very good money.

547
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,634
But it is not easy
this bitching.

548
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,599
Needs of many
balls, buddy.

549
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I have thought well Cochi,
and indeed there is no other ...

550
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:50,634
are seen as
things outside al.

551
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:52,599
So you're right.

552
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
I'll introduce you to the boss.

553
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,134
But I warn you eh, a
Once inside buddy,

554
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:00,634
There is no turning back.
It was clear!?

555
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,800
Oh yes, I thank you
very, Cochi.

556
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Look.

557
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
For now stay informed
Material

558
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,734
This is the same ship
to the gringos.

559
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,800
- No I have not ...
- Come on man!

560
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,599
Ouch!
Cochinho!

561
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,999
The grass is very good.

562
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,500
This is the real treasure
Green Mother Nature!

563
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,034
- And that his fucking al!
- Oh yes.

564
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Bennny Hey, you do not know with
they are getting into the face.

565
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,434
RINCÃOZINHO SKY.
REYES FAMILY OF FIVE.

566
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,600
We came to see the Boss.

567
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,034
Rest assured Benny.

568
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,200
The boss will not eat it.

569
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,534
Just listen, my mouth shut.

570
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:00,499
- Ok?
- Ok

571
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,034
The boss is full of money.

572
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:05,801
This is one of their properties.

573
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:08,534
He made a fortune in business.

574
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,499
Because yours is yours.

575
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,499
- Roosters fighting and cattle.
- Oh yeah?

576
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Imagine, all
early morning wake up

577
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,100
Milking cows and give
feed their cocks.

578
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm guessing you do not know
enjoy how lucky you are.

579
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:26,100
Estufe breast ...! Thus
seen more badass.

580
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,299
Pass me wait.

581
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,500
I'll look it up and remember,
mouth shut!

582
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,500
Mr. ..
Benjamin Garcia to serve you.

583
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,500
Come in.

584
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Sit down, is at home.

585
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,900
Thank you.

586
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
So, you who are
Peter's brother?

587
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,034
Yes sir.

588
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,200
The famous Devil.

589
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,000
A good element, but
too crazy and impulsive.

590
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,834
They told me you lived
long time in the United States.

591
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,399
"Oh yes sir."

592
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,365
So you agree with me.

593
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:54,434
I always say that the gringos
fucked with this country.

594
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:58,399
That the Yankees cursed children
whores, robbed us all.

595
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,399
Compliance with these assholes
presidents of shit we had.

596
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
The only thing is to know
kneel and lick their feet

597
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:10,100
to come to that later
take the bottom of their tails.

598
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,434
According to them
this is capitalism.

599
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,399
Not realized
that people like me.

600
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,199
We have the form of tools you!
good and beautiful.

601
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,599
Oh father.

602
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,599
Increasingly you
speaks like a politician.

603
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,634
The gringos are
our best customers.

604
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,151
Lives bored talking about them.

605
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,599
His great son of a bitch!

606
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,634
Who do you think is
who knows more than me, huh?

607
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:35,151
Not back to me
disrespecting you jerk!

608
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:38,300
Go away, send it to
your fucking mother.

609
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,399
Damn kid.

610
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,600
But I got the blame for
consent to it too.

611
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
But sometimes
and passes the line ...

612
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,799
One thing I want you to know.

613
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,334
Those who work with me are
as part of my family.

614
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:02,834
But in this business,
there are rules and principles.

615
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,799
That must be followed.

616
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,834
If you do not want to end
shot in the head.

617
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,499
Got it?

618
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,534
Yes, yes, yes sir.

619
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,700
A, honesty.

620
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Two, full honor.

621
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,999
And three, silence.

622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,999
Absolute silence,
open your mouth too.

623
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
It is a good way to take
a gateway to hell.

624
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,999
- Is that clear?
- Yes sir, yes.

625
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
And another thing
was forgetting

626
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,000
has to keep
enough discretion.

627
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,551
and do not walk around assuming
how these suckers.

628
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:41,200
it is known that are
miles away.

629
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,199
Look.

630
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,199
My sons will Jesus
be your boss.

631
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,199
It is my only son and love
with all my soul.

632
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
If there's
thing with it

633
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,900
responds with its
life, it is clear!?

634
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,699
Yes, yes, yes sir.

635
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll forward it,
to equip.

636
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,600
Ai soon you will pay me.

637
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,899
Just be careful Garcia.

638
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,934
Be careful, this business
gives a lot of money.

639
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,899
But there are many temptations.

640
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,400
If you're smart, will
careful not to indulge

641
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:19,600
with one of these
crap we sell.

642
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,100
Already said the new Pope.

643
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,100
"Put garbage in the body,
is living in mortal sin. "

644
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,600
- Of course!?
- Yeah, yes sir, yes.

645
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,334
- May God bless you.
- Thank you Sir.

646
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:38,834
And that does not assure
I'm going to disappoint.

647
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:41,799
You're an asshole,
son of a bitch!

648
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,300
Be aware that the next
Since putting his hand over

649
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,700
I cut my son's
your balls asshole.

650
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,134
And you know
I'm not talking

651
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:49,534
figuratively twat.

652
00:41:49,535 --> 00:41:52,099
Oh my queen, the boy
I lacked with respect

653
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,834
Reyes is not a liar,
Come here my love, come on.

654
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:58,000
That his father will apologize.

655
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,300
Oh, you damned old twat

656
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,700
it is better to apologize
with my son

657
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:06,100
it will not see me asshole.

658
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:08,800
- Sorry my son.
- Yes father.

659
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,800
There you saw your father
Bread is a God.

660
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,599
See, this here queen.

661
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,599
I want to introduce you to Benjamin.

662
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,634
The brother of the devil,
and will work with us.

663
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,599
Oh, happy young man.

664
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,800
- Excuse Bosses.
- License.

665
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, thank you my love,
are beautiful, the dress.

666
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Where did you go to work?

667
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,100
In a farmer to
want to take care of cattle.

668
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,399
The old man is a good person.

669
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,600
I even said some money.

670
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,600
Have you got a killer with
the Cochiloco not it?

671
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,600
You know what?

672
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,399
Take your money.

673
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,434
What do think of Garcia?
End up like his brother?

674
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:09,399
Do not confuse beautiful.

675
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,934
One thing is something
and another is something else.

676
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,434
You saw that I walked
looking for work.

677
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:17,399
And here there is something else.

678
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,934
And that gives me very afraid
because it already took me one.

679
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:24,399
No, I promise you that we will
save some money.

680
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,434
We pay the debts, and soon the three
together we are going to the U.S..

681
00:43:27,435 --> 00:43:29,399
You will see.

682
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,434
But swear that will not end
equal to his brother.

683
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:34,434
For Virgemzinha of Guadalupe.

684
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:36,600
Come my love.

685
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,499
So, Benny.

686
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,434
Welcome to the business, we
make our first delivery.

687
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,500
Be very smart,
to learn face.

688
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,200
Ok Cochi.

689
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,899
Hello Mr. Neme.

690
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,934
- Hello Cochi.
- Why the long face?

691
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,899
The week was so bad?

692
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,600
I got my bag
full of this business.

693
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,500
Five nights unable to sleep
and just took the cost, man.

694
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,799
I'm thinking that the crisis is
catching me up with straw.

695
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,834
There claim Neme increasingly
that step in your motelzinho

696
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:41,399
What I see full of fiery,
or that fucking ...

697
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,834
With or without crisis people
stop sending coals.

698
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,299
And that?

699
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,365
It's my partner, eh?,
Benny.

700
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,866
It will be up when you leave care
vacation or retire, huh?

701
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:53,299
And treat it.

702
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,500
Benjamin Garcia,
to serve you sir.

703
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,799
What do you want Neme?

704
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,000
20 bundles, a
quarter of marijuana

705
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,834
ecstasy, a package of
heroin, 12 stones

706
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,600
And 200 goals that you know
that are fashionable, is not it?

707
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,000
Thankfully, the crisis
You took the Neme.

708
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,500
You do not want syringes,
yohimbine, porn movies,

709
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,334
I brought one of a
Swedish with a donkey ...

710
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:20,500
- God damn it.
- You fuck.

711
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,500
How much will it stay?

712
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,300
Oh, man.

713
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,299
You are there for their fucking.

714
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,000
Right.

715
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,834
Next week Mr. Neme,
see if the lava.

716
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:45,000
I'll save the water for
gargle his comrade.

717
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,134
The more or less
worth all the briefcase, Cochi.

718
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:58,700
Yes it costs some money, Benny.

719
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,000
But that for the
Boss is bananas.

720
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
The real business
is import

721
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:05,834
and export
in large scale.

722
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:08,000
Rather that it gives a lot of money.

723
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,234
The bad thing is that with
this fucking crisis

724
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,400
The power is greatly increased.

725
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,700
Now any child
Neighbor purchase

726
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:17,900
a gun and starts
fighting in the region.

727
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,400
kill the chicken
the golden eggs.

728
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,000
Look Cochi.

729
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,834
Quiet, calm down,
I do not get cramped.

730
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,851
Let me see, hide
the briefcase false.

731
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:41,000
<i>I'ma rancher  player and navigator, </ i></i>

732
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,000
<i>'m going to have
never again, </ i></i>

733
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,000
<i> left me with no money
and without belt, </ i></i>

734
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,334
<i> Around the world you made me run. </ i></i>

735
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:55,851
<i>You  likes dancing </ i></i>

736
00:46:55,852 --> 00:46:58,110
<i> you dance to the beat </ i></i>

737
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,239
<i> you go to Laredo, </ i></i>

738
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,500
<i> wants more and more. </ i></i>

739
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,100
As will Cochiloco,
how's the gig?

740
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,599
Okay Commander.
And you?

741
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,599
What are you doing with
that damn Immigrant.

742
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,565
He began working with the Lord
Joseph and I am teaching the business.

743
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,999
Explain to him and
on the outside the maneuvers law

744
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,799
even more the "how" ...

745
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,334
Do not worry Captain,
I'll let you know.

746
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,500
Your damn right
Nahuales, see you around.

747
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,834
Ai Cochi ...
What a shock I got this tyrant.

748
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,101
This face womanizer
a has fig.

749
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey Cochi, by chance
Speeds not have some?

750
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Gotta stay awake

751
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Look there in the glove compartment a
jar to the Commander Benny.

752
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,434
Thank you guys,
behave well.

753
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:57,600
Even more you Immigrant.

754
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,534
Damn Benny, you're more
white as a dead man.

755
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:12,700
Let's all drink
to return to their color.

756
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,465
What is not in
Salon Mexico for that

757
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:17,499
Lupita to see me
come into trouble.

758
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
I'll take a
place category

759
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:22,300
not that pissed pub
where his wife works.

760
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,634
That is not that expensive
I'm short the dollar,

761
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:28,599
Take a gift of Reyes.

762
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,599
Yes, but this money is the
Sir, is not it?

763
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Of course it is, do not be silly

764
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:36,400
you think he will notice
if ferramos a bit.

765
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,599
And if he finds Cochi?

766
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,800
This is also part of the business,
not risk free skin.

767
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,100
However, we do not have to leave
to pick one and do not abuse it.

768
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:51,500
That, thanks for the touch.

769
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,800
<i> COCK OF GOLD. </ i></i>

770
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,834
And then like the site?

771
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:15,851
Okay fuck.

772
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,000
It is very good.

773
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,299
And oh man, what
think of the gig?

774
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,500
Like everyone else, is concerned
get the hang of.

775
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,299
And as with Reyes?
The boss has treated you well?

776
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,300
Actually I thought
it was more tyrant.

777
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,300
but it seemed to
be a good person.

778
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:35,299
Good person shit.

779
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,334
Mr. Joseph is the largest of the great son
bitch who ever walked this land.

780
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:41,299
So rather than something else.
A mere mere killer.

781
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,334
No, that St. Jude and
Malverde the patron saint

782
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:46,299
the store for many years.

783
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,334
The day that the Lord Joseph
make us miss, screwed everything.

784
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:52,299
If the fall in business
hands of the asshole J.R.

785
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,934
In less than one month, the Panchos
fuck all and get with the money.

786
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:57,299
It is.

787
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,834
We must be very careful
these kids, be smart ok?

788
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,900
If I find
of these Panchitos

789
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,900
a shot of meth
eyebrows and ears.

790
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,334
I told my Benny was pretty cool.

791
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,500
- Health by Benny!
- Cheers!

792
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,234
And oh, let's do a
welcome as it should, is not it?

793
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:16,799
He will want a potrancona.
Gata! come here ...

794
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,834
Cochiloco, if my wife
find out, cut my bag.

795
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:21,799
Do not be a fag!

796
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,000
Look at this cat, man!

797
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,000
And treat it.

798
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,300
I promise you my love
it'll work.

799
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:38,000
And I will care for your child.

800
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:40,934
Put your clothes quickly
if we're screwed.

801
00:50:40,935 --> 00:50:43,799
- Hurry up!
- But Cochi still not finished.

802
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,834
Pentelhadas later work
bosses are waiting, fast.

803
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm coming my love.

804
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,799
What was Cochi, what's the rush?

805
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,834
Because the first is the basic
escangalhado and down as well ...

806
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,799
- The brunette was ...
- Take this.

807
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,766
Not Cochi, you know
that kind of crap ...

808
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,565
Come smell that shit!

809
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,600
If J.R. and the Boss
see us in this state

810
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:04,934
they can in castrate.

811
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:07,000
- Come on, go for it.
- Let's see ...

812
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,999
Yes?

813
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,200
Calm J.R.
Yes let's go there.

814
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,200
Do not worry.

815
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,534
Yes it is clear that
he wants to live.

816
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:24,534
Yes, we will be there
before the two.

817
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,499
Even more.

818
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,700
Now it Cochi,
what is it?

819
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,034
I'm feeling
like new shit.

820
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:35,200
Then it was time for
his baptism, Benny, get ready.

821
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,200
Clean your nose face.

822
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
What has been expensive, where
is your brother?

823
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
- First the money, is not it?
- Cursed "soprão" shit.

824
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,500
Sell ??your brother for 1000 pesos.

825
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:03,799
It is not even there.

826
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,799
I am poor, man.

827
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,000
You no longer
remember what it is.

828
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,834
Also, my fucking brother
never wanted to give me a hand.

829
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:16,000
Ah! makes nonsense of "loose
warm soup before I "

830
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,299
Came a few hours,
should be there.

831
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,500
Better be there,
if not hit with you.

832
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,334
I swear it's there, inside.

833
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:28,299
You and your mouse,

834
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,500
And remember, we are the rule.

835
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,934
Prepare your weapon, Benny.

836
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,100
And take the tape.

837
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,000
If someone running away,
goal lead.

838
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,000
Cucaracha!
(Cheap)

839
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,000
Cucaracha!

840
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,999
Where did he go, girl?

841
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,999
Do not be stupid and tell me
where Cucaracha.

842
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Do not be stupid
Cucaracha!

843
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,034
is not going to kill out in three
his entire family.

844
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:08,499
A!

845
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,999
- Two!
- Calm down!

846
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,200
- Cochi, I'm here.
- Tie this idiot.

847
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,999
No, no, no, please.

848
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
for the old days,
let me say goodbye

849
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,700
my wife
and my children, huh?

850
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:26,034
Go, give you one minute
from now.

851
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:28,200
Bless me,

852
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,434
Take care of my children.

853
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:36,100
- Let's go, let's face!
- No!

854
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,100
See Cucaracha.

855
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,100
You know who you screwed,

856
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,400
But by our old friendship,
I will give you chance to get revenge.

857
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,100
The jerk that sold you.

858
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,100
Thanks, Cochi.

859
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
I always thought you
was a man of law.

860
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,900
There you go, no nonsense
will pay double, man.

861
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,000
Take care of him Benny.

862
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,200
Panfilo!

863
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,700
Panfilo!

864
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,500
Panfilo!

865
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,800
Panfilo Damn, we got together,
together we're going, you idiot.

866
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,834
Thank Cochi.

867
00:55:10,835 --> 00:55:13,000
Fuck you but ...

868
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Do not get me to the boss.

869
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,734
if you want to fill my
Lead with my brother,

870
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:19,999
but not delivered to me
those sons of bitches.

871
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,600
Sorry Cucaracha

872
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,600
I was ordained clearly
to take you live, go!

873
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:27,000
You expect one of those fuck

874
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,100
Come on!
Go on!

875
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,600
Do you think
they are what?

876
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,399
Two hours waiting
you like idiots.

877
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,900
This talk later
what matters first.

878
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
What was Cucaracha,

879
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,534
Many years worked
for me without complaining.

880
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,051
I always gave you
good money.

881
00:56:04,052 --> 00:56:06,534
So why the feds went to see?

882
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:07,999
Not?

883
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,999
What you told them?
See ...

884
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,700
If you mean in detail
what you "blew" to them

885
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,534
It will save you, man.

886
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,999
- I swear that nothing Sir.
- Nothing.

887
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I hope this is right,
if not beyond to fuck

888
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:25,800
I'll fuck your kids,
What do you think?

889
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:29,034
For the little virgin Santa,
I swear I did not say anything.

890
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,200
If we know everything, you idiot!

891
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Okay, okay,
Cucaracha

892
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:37,034
I believe in you,
I believe in you.

893
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:38,999
Only in this business

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,200
there are rules and principles that
must be respected and fulfilled.

895
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,500
You know what happens to
the "soprões" is not it?

896
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,200
Cochiloco, give me the knife.

897
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,000
You take the head,
hold on!

898
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,284
No!
No!

899
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,200
Open, open!

900
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,534
By now he has stolen.

901
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:06,700
Go!

902
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,000
And that to take
the idiot that is stupid!

903
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
- Come on my son.
- Yes father.

904
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,100
What was my love?
What happened?

905
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,100
Not tell you beautiful.
Look at my hands?

906
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,534
Certainly had to
do something horrible is not it?

907
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I do not.

908
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,999
The boss who was more
crazy as a goat.

909
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,999
And I swear that was the most
horrible I have ever seen.

910
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,500
I imagine, but the
way the situation is

911
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:18,034
you need to handle and have
will still work.

912
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:21,051
- We are not better than before?
- It is.

913
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:23,999
Actually I do not know
I can be beautiful.

914
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
See my king, we used
the unfavorable circumstances,

915
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:30,001
But there is always a limit in the life
that are difficult to bear.

916
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I do not know.
things that have no other way.

917
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
- How will you.
- How are you, Dona.

918
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:42,201
You need to be discreet.

919
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:46,204
I'll take one or two.

920
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200

<i> few moments later

939
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:42,500

What did he say?

945
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:30,100
He said that leaves us
all for $ 75.000.

946
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,934
- Including grenades and bazooka.
- Everything?

947
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:34,951
Then, talk to
let's go, go there.

948
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:36,899
Let's take everything you.

949
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,899
It is a pleasure to do business
friends in your country.

950
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,100
But if they want something,
Here is my card.

951
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:45,399
- Only connect.
- Oh yes.

952
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,600
Pleasure.

<i> SCHOOL HEROES
BICENTENNIAL. </ I></i>

954
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:53,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
social justice

955
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,000
It was, is and will be the eternal
divide our Mexico.

956
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,334
But today in celebration of
bicentenary of independence.

957
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:09,101
And the centennial of the revolution.
That gave us homeland and pride.

958
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:14,985
And thanks to the enormous generosity
Mr. and Mrs. Mari Jose Reyes.

959
01:02:14,986 --> 01:02:18,834
What with the big heart and
patriotism that God gave them.

960
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,000
Donated this wonderful school
for our city.

961
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,334
The whole community
St. Michael the Archangel

962
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,799
But beyond all
Mexican childhood.

963
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,834
What is the future of our country
will be eternally grateful.

964
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:37,000
God Bless
Messrs.. Reyes.

965
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,000
What do you think of the new
Heroes of the Fatherland, Cochi?

966
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,800
And now to conclude
This solemn act

967
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:02,600
respectfully interpret
Our National Anthem.

968
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:06,851
<i> Mexicanos, the cry of war </ i></i>

<i> the roaring sound of the cannon. </ i></i>

972
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,000
- How's Texan.
- How will Cochi.

973
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,799
How's life treating you.

974
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,000
As the saying goes, I
defend tooth and nail.

975
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,799
- And you?
- I am very well

976
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,834
You are bringing me all merchandise
or you want me to tell?

977
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:05,799
What was Cochi, when
was that screwed up?

978
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
When you brought
good merchandise.

979
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,800
Let me see,
let me prove it.

980
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,102
Go on son.

981
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,000
You are very good.

982
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,000
- And the Opium?
- Look my dear Cochi.

983
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,500
I'll give you a good
advice as a friend.

984
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,800
Trust is good, but
not to trust is better.

985
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,500
You do not change over the years,
Benny open the bag.

986
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,000
It's okay,

987
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,500
Take my little one,
save money.

988
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,500
Hey, get off the goods

989
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,500
Dear Cochi.

990
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,501
Just have to speak well
Texan of their merchandise.

991
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:01,000
Oh we are, so long,
let my little one.

992
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,000
Take a look at the quality
the Texan sells us.

993
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,100
What is this guy?,
it's actually American?

994
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,434
Born in Brownsville that
his parents are from Reynosa

995
01:05:20,435 --> 01:05:22,099
The guy thinks gringo.

996
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,134
however is more Mexican
the nopales (cactus).

997
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:28,951
- All that money was for him.
- Yeah, caraio.

998
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:32,600
The Texan is what is known
in the middle like Coyote.

999
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,434
He is buying months in the mountains
peasants of their crops

1000
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:41,434
Poppy and coca and sells the
boss 10 times its price.

1001
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:44,951
He thinks that the problems
field would be solved

1002
01:05:44,952 --> 01:05:48,600
Instead of taking the fucking
intermediate assholes.

1003
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,600
What's wrong with
this idiot now.

1004
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,365
- Good afternoon, "my friends"
- What's wrong Mendoza?

1005
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,934
- For the road closed?
- With the news that we had ...

1006
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:18,600
3-18 in a KM-20
the highway is closed.

1007
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:20,865
Leave babaquises 3-18
Come on ...

1008
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:23,034
Let us pass
we're in a hurry.

1009
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:24,899
In fact, I'm sorry Cochi.

1010
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,934
A truck turned and was ugly,
will be closed for several hours.

1011
01:06:28,935 --> 01:06:30,899
Why not take
the Nopalera? (Cactus)

1012
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,100
Nopalera whore
man who gave birth

1013
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:35,800
're kidding me ...

1014
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,000
Sorry Cochi,
Orders are orders.

1015
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,000
Watch Benny, are Panchos!
cover-up!

1016
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,000
Follow that shit, do not let
the bastard escape.

1017
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,500
Do not kill me, I will give you any
thing to forgive me.

1018
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,500
Give me a chance, man.

1019
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,000
Damn Benny

1020
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,000
Nor would I do better,
looks just like the left.

1021
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,334
I thought it was not
balls for this gig.

1022
01:08:15,335 --> 01:08:18,500
My respects, man!

1023
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,000
We must give thanks to God
things have gone well.

1024
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,334
These goods had already
committed to the gringos.

1025
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,299
Could not fail.

1026
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,334
Now it behaved
males as well.

1027
01:08:32,335 --> 01:08:34,299
Thank you Sir.

1028
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,334
If not for fucking
my brother, jealous and sucker.

1029
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:40,299
But it is already
moving line.

1030
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,800
I think if we do not
intimidated his uncle Francisco

1031
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:44,334
the thing could get worse.

1032
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:47,400
Yes my son,
so I'll send

1033
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:49,500
him the bodies of
my nephews.

1034
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,799
To see if the sucker is tame.

1035
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,834
And now his bloody Pancha?
Who's the bitch now asshole!

1036
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:58,799
Have J.R. leaves,

1037
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Do not disturb her cousins,

1038
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:03,100
his grandmother,
respect the family.

1039
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,000
And you, that they may see

Here you are.

1041
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800

01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:16,800
money in the first
thing to see!

1043
01:09:16,835 --> 01:09:19,399

- What was the mother?
- Won the lottery?

1049
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,100
How are you?
The promise is debt.

1050
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
Thinking of you,
Look what I brought,

1051
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:13,434
I bought a TV
to see novel.

1052
01:10:13,435 --> 01:10:15,600
To forget this
reality as precarious.

1053
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,600
You are so beautiful,
thank you my son.

1054
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,934
Let me see here,

Take it.

1056
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,434
Already following the same steps
his brother, is not it?

1057
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:29,899
No, not that that mother would never ...

1058
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,434
With this appearance that has
can not be anything else.

1059
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:36,934
But do not give me the same grief
that he gave his brother, huh?

1060
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:39,951
- Do not worry mother.
- Between my son.

1061

It will give me a gift?

The son of a neighbor brought
across a "ualman"

1070

Sure mom, I'll bring

Not one bit my queen.

1119

Money will be what
more will be left.

1120
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,334
Not thinking that my future
wife stays that way.

1121
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:02,500
Where have you seen such barbarity.

1122
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:11,500
Oh godson, I'm afraid you
My dream became reality.

1123
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,299
And I walked very critical.

1124
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,299
That's the least I can
do for you Godfather.

1125

1131
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,199
Do not cry my queen, stay there

1132
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,199
It will not make any crap,
I'm going to fly there

1133
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,400
- What is Affiliate? Are you okay?
- Pretty soon explain.

1134
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,400
Now, just missing the customers.

1135
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
And then when the
Mr. Camilo arrived

1136
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:53,400
given the dollars and
said he did not!

1137
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,899
That was not enough,
missing interests.

Pimp?
That's what he said?

1141
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,399
And not only that, then it was
that pig in the ass

1142
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,600
If the girls were not
there to hold me killed.

1143
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,600
Do not worry, beautiful, not
worry, I'll talk to him.

- Do not tell me?
- I say.

1165

Mr. Camilo found it
and charred

1166
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:05,299
and only recognized
the gold tooth.

1167
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
These Panchos are idiots

1168
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:10,100
Not had time to talk

Do not be fool, or you tell me
or I'll pluck face.

1184
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,834
In fact I did nothing Cochi.

Do not be stupid Mendoza.

If you speak the truth Cochi,
maybe I can help you.

Thank you.

1191

That's all you paid
the Panchos, man?

1196
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,100

You know what I realized Benny?

1208
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,300
As I said
the master Jose Alfredo ...

1209
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,300
"Life is worth nothing"

1210
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,300
For the 3000 bloody fucking
weights this fellow

1211
01:20:57,301 --> 01:20:59,400
tells us almost
for the Grim Reaper.

1212
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,500
Tell me the truth Cochi.

1213
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,500
Do not feel anything, to kill
someone like that way?

1214
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,999
I mean,

1215
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,999
Not afraid
to end up in hell?

1216
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Hell fucking no,
hell is here on Merit.

1217
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,034
Have not remember when
we was a kid.

1218
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:24,999
The hunger that we had the cold,
the misery in which we lived?

1219
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,034
Or like right now, which faces
As we walk, thus killing

1220
01:21:29,035 --> 01:21:32,200
Only because it has a
decent way of living.

1221
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,500
I do tou think that this shit
Life itself is damn hell.

1222
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,200
Yeah, you're right.

1223
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,500
What was Cochi, will not
I leave at home?

1224
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,000
No, we're at my house
so you know my wife.

1225
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,434
You know what? I am with the stomach
Cochi rough, look upon my state.

1226
01:22:06,435 --> 01:22:10,034
Therefore, it takes a breja,
and know my wife.

1227
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:11,600
Come on.

1228
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,299
Come on family!

1229
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,334
All in single file, ok?

1230
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:23,334
Let's greet Uncle Benny.

1231
01:22:23,335 --> 01:22:24,999
Come on.

1232
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,200
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

1233
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,200
The youngest, Princess,

1234
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,200
The glutton, the mariachi.

1235
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:40,534
And the spoiled, my firstborn,
the Cochiloquinho.

1236
01:22:40,535 --> 01:22:42,199
Look.

1237
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,734
The future of all my future.

1238
01:22:44,735 --> 01:22:46,199
Benny.

1239
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,234
Cochi Ah!
Lady, very pleased.

1240
01:22:49,235 --> 01:22:51,199
- Nice to meet you.
- Walking.

1241
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,199
- To bed bunch.
- Good evening.

1242
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,234
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1243
01:22:56,235 --> 01:22:59,000
Even more younger.
They are all beautiful.

1244
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,900
Let's have a drink.
Come on.

1245
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,200
You're in your home
Benny, what you want?

1246
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:07,300
Anything.

1247
01:23:07,335 --> 01:23:09,400
Let me see.

1248
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,400
Health compadre.

1249
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,000
Cochi be seen to believe.

1250
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,000
One thing is one thing and
anything else is Benny.

1251
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,799
What do you think?

1252
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,000
Who lived in a cave
and ate human flesh?

1253
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,299
No, but ... see it ...

1254
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,800
Do not misunderstand me Cochi,
but ...

1255
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:38,100
is like two
people simultaneously.

1256
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:41,299
Well, if it is not in
business of "Narco".

1257
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:44,334
How else
I support my children?

1258
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:47,500
If I'm in is
there is no other.

1259
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,000
There is something not
explain.

1260
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,299
The boss is pissed off.

1261
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,300
Minimal cut
his head is knowing ...

1262
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,299
Hey! their children's mother.

1263
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,500
Keep your knees
the head and hands.

1264
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,500
Beware
any trick.

1265
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,834
Now what's the problem
with this idiot?

1266
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:21,000
He'll fuck in Cochi.

1267
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,399
As I was talking
with Mr., Captain.

1268
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,000
The arrest of these dangerous
drug traffickers.

1269
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,600
It is a sample that collaboration
between the three levels of government.

1270
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,899
It's working very well.

1271
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,700
And the struggle that is
undertaking

1272
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:39,934
The President of the Republic
against organized crime.

1273
01:24:39,935 --> 01:24:41,899
You are going the right way.

1274
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,900
And now yes, even though
not enough, we gain.

1275
01:24:44,901 --> 01:24:46,900
Here the commander Mancera

1276
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:48,900
head of our heroic
A group of policemen.

1277
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:52,100
Give the details
joinhas on these.

1278
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:57,100
Here my Captain, we first
Eugenio Matta Cochiloco alias.

1279
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,900
It is considered the operator
cartel and main

1280
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:02,500
distributor of drugs
in the region.

1281
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,934
Once we have the Benjamin Garcia

1282
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:06,899
Best known as Benny.

1283
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,900
For many years
was dedicated to import

1284
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:10,900
and export
prohibited substances.

1285
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,934
It relates to a network
trafficking of people in the U.S..

1286
01:25:14,935 --> 01:25:18,100
- Then we ...
- Let me see ... Commander

1287
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,899
That both sustained
these charges have

1288
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,934
because it seems that you have the
more dangerous than experts and parents

1289
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:26,951
You know that Captain
this type of offender.

1290
01:25:26,952 --> 01:25:29,899
has many features,
prominent lawyers

1291
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,899
That help them ... so ...
- Yes, yes I understand.

1292
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,934
Could you give me permission to speak
alone with inmates please.

1293
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:38,100
Yes, yes of course.
Mancera.

1294
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,500
So young ...

1295
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:50,301
then mean that you
are more dangerous

1296
01:25:50,302 --> 01:25:52,502
that "El Chapo"
and "Los Aretes" together.

1297
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,799
Look comrades.

1298
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,799
What interests me most
The Reyes are to me.

1299
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,834
They say you four
working for Mr. Joseph

1300
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:06,851
So now you
I will not say anything.

1301
01:26:06,852 --> 01:26:09,834
In any case I
make you an offer.

1302
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:13,000
Do not laugh!
You never know.

1303
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,799
For both Dodge Capi.

1304
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,799
Go right to the point,
what you offer?

1305
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,834
We have an attractive program
protected witnesses

1306
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:27,000
Copied from the American model
that works very well.

1307
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,834
If you want to "sing"
for whatever reason.

1308
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:32,799
Look for me.

1309
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,000
Offered his freedom and protection.

1310
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,000
In exchange for their testimony
Reyes against.

1311
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,000
What do you think about it?

1312
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,834
Think about it,
think that one never knows ...

1313
01:26:48,835 --> 01:26:51,834
Life takes many turns,
who knows best ...

1314
01:26:51,835 --> 01:26:55,000
Someday I might need.

1315
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,500
Consider also that ...

1316
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:03,600
better a "Soprão" Thursday
a corpse first.

1317
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,000
Excuse me.

1318
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,000
Damn federal.

1319
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,500
You two are nothing more than
a pair of ungrateful.

1320
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,834
Have you forgotten who was
you put in their place?

1321
01:27:30,835 --> 01:27:32,299
Idiots.

1322
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,299
Even more you Felix

1323
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,300
What?, Already forgotten
how put

1324
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:39,334
in its campaign to
win the election?

1325
01:27:39,335 --> 01:27:42,334
It would have been better if I even have
I competed for Mayor.

1326
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:44,265
As advised my wife.

1327
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:46,534
In fact my love would
better than this sucker.

1328
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:48,299
Please understand Mr. Joseph

1329
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,300
The Federal Government
we have pressed

1330
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:52,400
this business with the
combating organized crime.

1331
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:55,299
and ... not seen the amount
commercials on TV?

1332
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,334
The Federal Government works for
you, in the fight against crime

1333
01:27:58,335 --> 01:28:01,351
organized, if not
seem, we are winning.

1334
01:28:01,352 --> 01:28:04,500
The nozzle Jesus calcd this seems
a charlatan deformed.

1335
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,300
You are a true
Sucker Felix

1336
01:28:07,301 --> 01:28:09,300
that the Federal Government
shit.

1337
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:11,351
This campaign is only
to deceive the people.

1338
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,299
To justify what they
they are stealing.

1339
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,500
And the federal agent who came
Cara is the area of ??Mr. Joseph

1340
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:19,802
And from time to prime
we still got

1341
01:28:19,803 --> 01:28:22,003
not unaware
is the same guy?

1342
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,299
There is no way to say it
Mr. Joseph best

1343
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,500
And why not pick up my
nephews or my fucking brother?

1344
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,300
Have learned
that the next day

1345
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:33,300
tried to fuck
our merchandise?

1346
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:35,301
But if screwed,
because here my kids

1347
01:28:35,302 --> 01:28:37,334
Are a cock and hairy.

1348
01:28:37,335 --> 01:28:40,351
And they did pretty well,
males as they are.

1349
01:28:40,352 --> 01:28:43,360
- Not true comrades?
- Yes sir!

1350
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:46,299
So motherfuckers, which of
two twisted kidding?

1351
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:50,299
No, no, no, do not think
Mr. Joseph it, please.

1352
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,299
And your kids are going
actually measure.

1353
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,800
See, the other day
sought by the agent Mendoza

1354
01:28:56,801 --> 01:28:59,100
and since then it appears.

1355
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,299
Do not be a liar!
Felix.

1356
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,300
Here my boys
are unable to

1357
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,334
go to shit without
my permission.

1358
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,299
Vai who were the Panchos.

1359
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,899
And neither you, nor do you
something to get them.

1360
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,100
But Mr. Joseph, this
once was the Federal Police

1361
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:14,200
the next will be
the whole army.

1362
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:17,334
But it is not true that you
are more than Felix suckers.

1363
01:29:17,335 --> 01:29:19,299
How many times do I have to repeat

1364
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,334
We found a way with some
of my colleagues and judges,

1365
01:29:22,335 --> 01:29:25,334
and this will not be more than one
"Kick ass to straighten."

1366
01:29:25,335 --> 01:29:27,299
But listen right.

1367
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,299
If they do not want
The blood flows the river.

1368
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,334
Treat my brother, if not,
do not answer for my actions.

1369
01:29:32,335 --> 01:29:34,299
It was clear!?

1370
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,334
I promise to Mr. I and my friend
here we put hands to work.

1371
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:39,500
- It's not even Mancera?
- Yes, yes sir Joseph

1372
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,800
So comrades,
Who of you

1373
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:54,800
Mendoza performed without
my permission?

1374
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,500
No, no.

1375
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,834
What is happening
you look beautiful.

1376
01:30:04,835 --> 01:30:07,500
Oh Benny, I am very
worried about my son.

1377
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,500
I'll tell you a secret

1378
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,000
But be well caladinha.

1379
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,000
There is already a time ...

1380
01:30:19,301 --> 01:30:23,500
I've been dipping into a little
Sir's just some money.

1381
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,800
And I think that in a short
time we

01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:30,300
enough to get us
three together in the U.S..

1383
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:32,302
What do you think?

1384
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,303
Hey Benny you need
be careful that

1385
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,302

catch kill you.

1386
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:40,503
I'm no sucker baby,

1387
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,799
Oh love, that God hears you.

1388
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,000
Hopefully we can
actually get out of here.

1389
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,800
<i>Little brother  ONLY
YOU SEE </ i></i>

1390
01:30:54,801 --> 01:30:58,500
<i>WHO HAS THE BIGGEST  PICA
NO WIG, SHORT THIS ... </ i></i>

1391
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,834
Have you seen what is written here?

1392
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:04,799
Even idiots know how to read.

1393
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,834
This proves that lacked
you have balls, right?

1394
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:11,434
Not withstood the pressure.
And as it endured

1395
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,834
My son went to bring some Reynoza
Yes comrades who have balls.

1396
01:31:14,835 --> 01:31:16,834
Let's see how expensive
you will stay.

1397
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,799
This is fucking war.

1398
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,300
I swear on my sacred
Mama to

1399
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:24,500
I will kill my brother
and all their offspring,

1400
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,834
Me there kinship.

1401
01:31:26,835 --> 01:31:28,834
And take this shit here.

1402
01:31:28,835 --> 01:31:30,965
Take,

1403
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,600
Delivered to $ 3.000
each of these fucking widow

1404
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:36,734
so that the buried.

1405
01:31:36,735 --> 01:31:39,000
Now!
Come on!

1406
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,500
Have you heard my father,
bunch of idiots.

1407
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,000
What crap,
take it hence.

1408
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,434
Have I got cat.

1409
01:31:52,435 --> 01:31:54,434
Hello Benny, how was it?

1410
01:31:54,435 --> 01:31:57,600
Well, my love,
Boss has solved all ...

1411
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,434
And this guy my love,
what happened?

1412
01:32:00,435 --> 01:32:03,600
The damn kid
readied again.

1413
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,600
Here's what he kept in
bottom of his bed.

1414
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,434
I have a feeling that
he got into something quite serious.

1415
01:32:11,435 --> 01:32:13,434
Did not happen
something with it?

1416
01:32:13,435 --> 01:32:16,600
No, my love,
if not we already know.

1417
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,100
Do not worry that
I'll pick it up.

1418
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,100
He'll have to listen.

1419
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,899
Benny speaks, brought "goals"?

1420
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,034
What?, I look like a
dealer or what man?

1421
01:32:49,035 --> 01:32:50,899
Not that.

1422
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Hey kid, you know some
thing about my nephew?

1423
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,934
The boy goes missing since
yesterday and the mother is very worried.

1424
01:32:57,935 --> 01:33:00,100
Say what you know
I give you 10 bucks.

1425
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,934
If they are "targets" may be over
remembering something.

1426
01:33:02,935 --> 01:33:04,934
If you are underage drug!

1427
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:07,065
I'm big boy.

1428
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,934
Take to remember,
now "drop soup."

1429
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:14,899
The guy befriended
the Panchos Francisco.

1430
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,934
The guy spends time assuming
that after working with them

1431
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:19,934
Fill with money and women.

1432
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:22,100
Damn kid.

1433
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,600
Hey, will not tell
I told him that.

1434
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,899
Do not worry kid.

1435
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,899
If you see him, tell him
go flying home, did he?

1436
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:33,400
So Benny,
you know it?

1437
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:36,100
if you want an assistant,
I'll be at your service.

1438
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,000
What the fuck.

1439
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,000
<i>SAN FRANCISCO . </ i></i>

01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,500
Here imp.

1441
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,500
In order to learn.

1442
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,300
His mother is looking for you
like crazy

1443
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,334
and you waste time with ...

1444
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:37,734
- Come on, let's go.
- Did not you see I'm busy?

1445
01:34:37,735 --> 01:34:39,800
Going you will already reach you.

1446
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:43,334
Look here bitch, stop playing
and if we do not take him by force.

1447
01:34:43,335 --> 01:34:46,334
Let the devil in peace buddy.

1448
01:34:46,335 --> 01:34:48,334
It will mess with the four?

1449
01:34:48,335 --> 01:34:50,500
Stay calm face.

1450
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,000
My uncle is not a problem.

1451
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,434
That's right,
saved by the bell, buddy.

1452
01:34:57,435 --> 01:34:59,000
Let Benny.

1453
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,800
Your uncle give you your
damn bottle imp.

1454
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Damn offenders

1455
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,334
What was beautiful?

1456
01:35:28,335 --> 01:35:30,299
Yes me already.

1457
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,500
Worry no more.
Kiss Queen.

1458
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,000
Any idea who
is getting expensive?

1459
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,299
Boy you are stupid or what?

1460
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,500
The feel badass
impressing the dealer?

1461
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,334
You have to think that this
is not a joke.

1462
01:35:48,335 --> 01:35:50,334
Think of your father.

1463
01:35:50,335 --> 01:35:52,299
Or me.

1464
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,500
I bet if you do not go fast
it'll end up like your father.

1465
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,300
Or what?

1466
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,501
Want to follow the tradition of
there is pure fool in the family?

1467
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,799
Listen up comrades

1468
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,799
With this rather my
cousins ??will get screwed.

1469
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,000
From now on
work in three groups.

1470
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,834
You Garcia, form
a double with Sgt.

1471
01:36:22,835 --> 01:36:24,799
Yes sir.

1472
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,000
You Huasteco, you
work with the Sardo.

1473
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,300
Cochiloco, like the one
more reliable

1474
01:36:30,301 --> 01:36:32,834
for my father,
work with me.

1475
01:36:32,835 --> 01:36:37,000
The doll and this guy they call
of Mariate will lend a hand.

1476
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,000
- Do you agree?
- Yes sir.

1477
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,300
I J.R. with its
license would not be

1478
01:36:43,301 --> 01:36:45,834
I can and
Doll could ...

1479
01:36:45,835 --> 01:36:47,799
Stop bitching Huasteco.

1480
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,800
Already have an opportunity
where again

1481
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:51,834
you to be together
and her boyfriend.

1482
01:36:51,835 --> 01:36:54,351
And then get making
shit they do.

1483
01:36:54,352 --> 01:36:56,834
But while doing
my son is sending.

1484
01:36:56,835 --> 01:36:59,299
- It was clear!?
- Yes Boss.

1485
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,334
So fuck it all, do not pay
so that they are here as idiots.

1486
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:03,900
Walk.

1487
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,799
- And then, as was his father?
- So I like son.

1488
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
Behave like
around a little man

1489
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:17,834
to be worthy
heir to his father.

1490
01:37:17,835 --> 01:37:19,499
That father.

1491
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,000
Oh if your grandmother
alive

1492
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:24,534
would now be
crying with joy.

1493
01:37:24,535 --> 01:37:26,200
It is.

1494
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,799
Without a lot of freshness,

1495
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,500
The owner should any
money for the Boss,

1496
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,000
The order of José is that we
a sustinho to rectify.

1497
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,000
- Any questions?
- Negative.

1498
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,500
Come on then.

1499
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,500
You can stay here, I alone
take care of the order of the Master.

1500
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,000
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

1501
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,000
Ready.
On to the next.

1502
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:27,000
- As fast?
- Affirmative.

1503
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,000
Hey my Sergeant, if not
indiscretion, as he did?

1504
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,500
Oh!
Fuck!, Damn it!

1505
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,500
- Cigarette, My Sergeant.
- Negative.

1506
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,299
And a "beer"?

1507
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:57,334
Back there is a "Cooler" and
icy, do not feel like one?

1508
01:38:57,335 --> 01:38:59,300
Nor.

1509
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,600
You're not here right
not, "My Sergeant?"

1510
01:39:01,601 --> 01:39:03,200
No.

1511
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,634
And if not indiscreet,
Sergeant where's mine?

1512
01:39:07,635 --> 01:39:09,800
Oaxaca.

1513
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,599
And he was in the army?

1514
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,634
Hey man, let's get ready,
My name is Benito Juarez.

1515
01:39:16,635 --> 01:39:19,599
I like what I call the
"Benefactor of the Americas."

1516
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,600
And to make it more clear.

1517
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,134
I did not let the army
to go making friends.

1518
01:39:24,135 --> 01:39:27,400
And yes to a
shitload of money for it.

1519
01:39:27,635 --> 01:39:29,765
Yes?

1520
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,834
Ah! and not
problems between us.

1521
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:35,799
You can go calling me
or Mr. Sergeant,

1522
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,600
And do not fucking gringo,

1523
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,800
"My Sergeant"
and all that shit.

1524
01:39:40,835 --> 01:39:42,800
Clearly, boring?

1525
01:39:42,801 --> 01:39:45,000
It's good, Sgt.

1526
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,500
What, Cochi?
Already missing me?

1527
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:58,334
Where are you!? Hold on
Cochi, I'm already going fast!

1528
01:39:58,335 --> 01:40:01,299
Cochi!
Cochi!

1529
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,500
Something happened man?

1530
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,334
What happened Cochi,
how are you?

1531
01:40:28,335 --> 01:40:31,334
The Panchos screwed in Benny.

1532
01:40:31,335 --> 01:40:34,100
Fucked with everything.

1533
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,334
But how could they do
Cochi this with you?

1534
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:39,299
What happened?

1535
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,500
The sons of bitches
we got distracted.

1536
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,500
When I had the reaction even
able with those there, but ...

1537
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,500
Francisco and those damned
took children in the leather.

1538
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,700
Where is J.R.?

1539
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,800
J.R. and Doll are in there.

1540
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,100
Go take a look at them.

1541
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,800
<i> BROTHER TURNS GIVES LIFE,
LET'S GET YOU </ i></i>

1542
01:41:31,801 --> 01:41:33,834
<i> AND YOUR GROUP
OF assholes, OS Panchos. </ I></i>

1543
01:41:33,835 --> 01:41:37,000
Apparently the son of
Boss liked the duiker.

1544
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,400
Look left to his nephew.

1545
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,700
Sergeant No way, we
have to take it to Mr. Joseph

1546
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,400
Now we will see what is good.

1547
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,199
It is.

1548
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,400
I'll end up with all this
garbage, I promise you my son.

1549
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:02,000
I will kill them like rats
the children of Francis.

1550
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,100
Francis son of a bitch.

1551
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,400
Tell me, damn it!,
what my son ...

1552
01:42:11,401 --> 01:42:13,934
was doing,
where they were!?

1553
01:42:13,935 --> 01:42:16,934
We actually took
Boss on the road.

1554
01:42:16,935 --> 01:42:19,899
The Panchos were many.

1555
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,899
But I say with all my heart,
J.R. defended himself valiantly.

1556
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,900
Who valiantly
my balls asshole

1557
01:42:24,901 --> 01:42:26,934
you do not think
knew my son?

1558
01:42:26,935 --> 01:42:29,100
If it was a weapon of God.

1559
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,934
I pity you if you are not
telling the truth to me.

1560
01:42:33,935 --> 01:42:35,499
- Huasteco.
- Yes Boss.

1561
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,200
You have weapons and ammunition
as sufficient

1562
01:42:37,201 --> 01:42:39,234
to break a bitch that
gave birth to my brother?

1563
01:42:39,235 --> 01:42:41,934
Yes Sir, the bodega
is full.

1564
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:44,100
For now they will get screwed.

1565
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,599
Mr. Joseph!

1566
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,634
I just find out, not
imagine how much I regret.

1567
01:42:51,635 --> 01:42:53,599
My most sincere
Dona Mari condolences.

1568
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,800
- Dona Mari sorry.
- Shut up your damn it!

1569
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,799
What a tragedy.
My God.

1570
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,834
This is a day of mourning
throughout San Miguel.

1571
01:43:03,835 --> 01:43:06,799
Losing the lives of so
a brilliant young man,

1572
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
With a promising
political future.

1573
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:10,834
You also
shut up you idiot!

1574
01:43:10,835 --> 01:43:12,799
Yes, yes, forgive me.

1575
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,799
This will be a war comrades.

1576
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,799
If my brother thinks
this is going to stop me.

1577
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,834
For now screwed, because I
show who has the biggest yet.

1578
01:43:20,835 --> 01:43:24,799
We must remain calm Mr. Joseph
war is not suitable for anyone.

1579
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,300
I pledge before
you and our Lord

1580
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:29,834
I and the commander
let's take the blame

1581
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:33,834
so that justice is done and
avenge the death of his son.

1582
01:43:33,835 --> 01:43:36,399
And you you have to
Mancera say about it?

1583
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,834
I warn you not to
stop my nephews?

1584
01:43:38,835 --> 01:43:41,799
- Investigations are ...
- Idiot! You more than ...

1585
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,499
nobody is to blame for death
my son. Had he done

1586
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,834
If my husband, nothing
this would have happened.

1587
01:43:46,835 --> 01:43:49,834
Dona Mari Sorry but can not
blame it on me about everything.

1588
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:53,000
The problem that her husband
has many enemies in the region.

1589
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,299
Thank you dear,

1590
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,500
You always read
my thoughts.

1591
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:16,500
And you have Felix
something to add?

1592
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,300
Then go to the bitch
who bore him and look

1593
01:44:19,301 --> 01:44:21,834
another police chief who
has fucking balls.

1594
01:44:21,835 --> 01:44:23,399
Yes sir.

1595
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,600
Excuse me gentlemen.

1596
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,799
And you!
You face!

1597
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,799
You and I have a lot to
talk, but in the meantime.

1598
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,300
Go to the whore who
the bore and take this

1599
01:44:37,301 --> 01:44:39,834
bunch of assholes that
no good.

1600
01:44:39,835 --> 01:44:43,000
- Get the fuck out!
- Sir.

1601
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,834
Holy shit.

1602
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh my old.

1603
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,799
What happened to Uncle Benny?

1604
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,934
Have you seen what they readied the
their fellow man?

1605
01:44:58,935 --> 01:45:01,000
Killed J.R. and Dolls.

1606
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,334
Now let's see if I obey.

1607
01:45:03,335 --> 01:45:06,334
Benny you need to be careful.

1608
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:08,299
There have hope.

1609
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,300
Mr. Joseph swore
would end

1610
01:45:10,301 --> 01:45:12,334
the Panchos, and
spoke quite serious.

1611
01:45:12,335 --> 01:45:15,299
So, will stay inside.

1612
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,299
Until the dust down,
and will get pretty ugly.

1613
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,334
And it will take a lot of blood,
this one is pretty serious guy.

1614
01:45:21,335 --> 01:45:24,334
The ways of the Lord
we all know.

1615
01:45:24,335 --> 01:45:25,900
They are inscrutable.

1616
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,334
But there are no certainties here on earth

1617
01:45:28,335 --> 01:45:30,335
as in heaven
we must comfort.

1618
01:45:30,336 --> 01:45:33,299
Even in moments of more pain.

1619
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,334
Who would dare to deny
a young man so kind.

1620
01:45:36,335 --> 01:45:39,351
With a heart of gold
as our dear Jesus

1621
01:45:39,352 --> 01:45:42,500
If you find out how your
namesake, the right of the father.

1622
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,299
The sky my children are not
only for the Saints

1623
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:49,334
And yes for men as
Our dear Jesus Reyes.

1624
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:52,500
Rest in peace, so be it.

1625
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,000
Revenge Lord.

1626
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:21,400
Revenge is the only one that I ask.

1627
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:24,399
I do not mean figuratively.

1628
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,400
As the lead

1629
01:46:26,401 --> 01:46:30,600
bring those sons of bitches
that took me.

1630
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:46,799
Who will take care of my children,
compadre.

1631
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,434
Let's see how life treats
my poor orphans.

1632
01:46:50,435 --> 01:46:53,651
Do not think so Cochi.

1633
01:46:53,652 --> 01:46:55,265
Nothing will happen.

1634
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,300
Do not play
Benny misunderstanding

1635
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:59,500
you saw how the Boss
I was looking.

1636
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,500
You know what hurts me
this life?

1637
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,800
What I can not even
know your affiliate.

1638
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,600
I'll just make a
asks my friend.

1639
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,899
If Mr. Joseph will declare
war on his brother.

1640
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:19,499
Who here is the most fucked
on the subject of guns?

1641
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,900
Stop it man,
with all the money

1642
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:23,934
that the Employer has
can bring anyone you want.

1643
01:47:23,935 --> 01:47:26,100
Until the very same Guanajuato.

1644
01:47:26,901 --> 01:47:28,900
You'll never forgive myself.

1645
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:31,600
And you're right.

1646
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,800
Think positive friend.

1647
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,800
Your children need you.

1648
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,399
Cochi, Cochi.

1649
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,600
A robust face
with hog's face told me

1650
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:44,899
you need to go flying
for your home.

1651
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,600
- Hey!
- Saw guy?

1652
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,899
No, no!

1653
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,100
No!
Cochiloquito.

1654
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,400
No.

1655
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,400
Cochiloquito.

1656
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,700
<i> ANYWAY, BY SON
SON, TOOTH FOR TOOTH. </ I></i>

1657
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:40,101
Take care of my wife,
will be great for it, Benny.

1658
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,934
I'll leave to your care.

1659
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:45,899
Yes Cochi.

1660
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,899
What are you doing?

1661
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,100
Benny Justice, only justice.

1662
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,399
Let me go with you.

1663
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,600
No, this fight is between the
son of a bitch and I José.

1664
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,399
I told you, is not it?

1665
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:07,600
This fucking life is
Benny very same hell.

1666
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:28,900
Sorry for the delay, but you
know how the situation is.

1667
01:49:28,901 --> 01:49:31,401
I had to do
other six funerals.

1668
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:33,402
Better let us pray.
Our Father who ...

1669
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:36,600
<i> not worthless life. </ i></i>

1670
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,600
<i> life is worth nothing. </ i></i>

1671
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,800
<i> always starts crying. </ i></i>

1672
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,800
<i> And so it ends up crying. </ i></i>

1673
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,800
<i> So that in this world. </ i></i>

1674
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,800
<i> life is worth nothing. </ i></i>

1675
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,399
Listen up comrades.

1676
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,600
After the disaster that occurred
in the family,

1677
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,400
The only one who stayed and finished
the group of rats

1678
01:50:13,401 --> 01:50:15,700
they are my brother
and their children.

1679
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,500
So I promised my son
when he was in person.

1680
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,834
And I will carry it for him!

1681
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:26,000
And you damn Benny!

1682
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:28,500
Stop thinking about shit.

1683
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,834
Because your friend Cochiloco that
also was like a son to me.

1684
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:35,834
This has been fucked by Panchos.

1685
01:50:35,835 --> 01:50:38,000
It was clear?

1686
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:41,334
And now let you put
this doleful face fucking.

1687
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:43,299
You do not feel anything.

1688
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:46,000
You are here only
dirty money.

1689
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:52,400
If they knew what we would
to take back our son.

1690
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,900
All my fucking fortune.

1691
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,400
But as this is not possible.

1692
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,900
I have an offer for you.

1693
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,900
I'll give you $ 100,000.

1694
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,400
For the head of each asshole
who murdered my son.

1695
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,400
Do the math buddies.

1696
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,900
Each one may take more
half a million dollars.

1697
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,400
One thing not in
dreams you have seen.

1698
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,400
But one thing I will tell you

1699
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,400
I want the heads of these idiots.

1700
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,200
Further, not only the head
of my nephews

1701
01:51:27,201 --> 01:51:29,400
As the head of my brother.

1702
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,700
I also want to head
of an asshole

1703
01:51:31,701 --> 01:51:33,900
well you know
very knowledgeable.

1704
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:36,699
The head of those who betrayed us.

1705
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:40,900
And by that, I'll give
$ 200,000 more.

1706
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:45,100
But one thing warn you,

1707
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,900
Pity the fool who
I want to do with

1708
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:49,934
face sucker
and wants to betray me.

1709
01:51:49,935 --> 01:51:53,100
Beware, because this
time I will not kill a child.

1710
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:57,600
This time I will do
chopped the whole family.

1711
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:00,100
Do you agree?

1712
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,100
Let my old lady.

1713
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,800
Young.

1714
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,600
When my old
said that we want

1715
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:13,800
the heads of the killers
my son.

1716
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,800
He said figuratively,
really want their heads!

1717
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,599
<i>SAN FRANCISCO . </ i></i>

1718
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:31,634
Hey gentlemen, do not get me wrong.

1719
01:52:31,635 --> 01:52:34,599
But I saw that you are kind of assholes

1720

A day passed
seriously measure

1841

And Mr. Joseph and the J.R.
not forgiven.

1842
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,600
You always knew it

1843
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,600
Not only knew but also
were there when it happened.

1844
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,434
And how they killed my brother
those sons of bitches?

1845
02:02:42,435 --> 02:02:44,951

know everything?

02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:50,600
This guy is my fight.

1848
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,900
Well, some pushing,
I'll tell the whole truth.

1849
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,600
When his brother to the Reyes
killed worse than a dog.

1850
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,100
Remember the Cucaracha, is not it?

1851
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,399
It was just like

1852
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:08,600
But his brother instead of his tongue.

1853
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,600
Mr. Joseph cut the bag.

1854
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,834
What my brother did for
that kill it?

1855
02:03:16,835 --> 02:03:19,000
The error was his brother Benny.

1856
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,834
It was not that fucked
or more and less

1857
02:03:21,835 --> 02:03:24,000
With Dona Mari.

1858
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,899
The very same wife of Sir.

1859
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:31,100
- Dona Mari?
- Not only once, huh?

1860
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,600
Goddamn Devil.

1861
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,900
His brother was a figure.

1862
02:03:37,901 --> 02:03:39,900
I do not think he had a wife

1863
02:03:39,901 --> 02:03:42,900
who had not spent
by his bed.

1864
02:03:42,901 --> 02:03:47,101
Go to the son that The Imp
does not go mad like him.

1865
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,600
How can you have spoken to
my nephew comrade.

1866
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,000

they call it?

1867
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,300
You were doing your game,
is not it, comrade?

1868
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:04,000
Do not kill me man.

1869
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,500
I would not say anything.

1870
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,200
You is not equal to Reyes
to kill me like a dog

1871
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,600
You're right Huasteco.

1872
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:23,100

take risks, face.

Okay, I'm going there.

1876
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,800
You'll be right there, Huasteco?

1877
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,434
Take this money my son.

1890
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,000
Hey, boy it's time son.
