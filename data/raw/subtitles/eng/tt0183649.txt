00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:35,588
There are an estimated 8 million people
in the five boroughs of New York.

3
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,299
12 million in the
greater metropolitan area.

4
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,469
There are almost 10 million
telephone exchange lines.

5
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:44,138
Over 50 phone services.

6
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:47,433
3 million New Yorkers
are cell phone users.

7
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:50,853
It used to be a mark of insanity
to see people talk to themselves.

8
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:56,776
Now it's a mark of status. And speed dial
is quickly replacing the drop of a coin.

9
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,570
Despite increased usage
of cellular devices...

10
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,365
...an estimated 4.5 million residents
and 2 million visitors...

11
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:07,745
...still utilize pay phones
on a regular basis.

12
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,336
This is the telephone booth
at 53rd and 8th...

13
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:19,757
...perhaps the last vestige of privacy
on Manhattan's West Side.

14
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:23,218
It is the last booth of its type,
still in regular operation.

15
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,221
Up to 300 calls daily originate here.

16
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:30,934
This location has been burglarized
41 times in the last six months.

17
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,687
Verizon has scheduled this structure
to be torn down...

18
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,691
...and replaced with a kiosk
as of 8 a.m. Tomorrow.

19
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,651
Hardly two blocks away...

20
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:44,031
...meet the man who is to be
the final occupant of that booth.

21
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,492
Donny. Donny. Donny, listen to me.

22
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:50,329
I said I'd get you magazine coverage,
and I'm getting you in a magazine.

23
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,498
Look, you gotta trust me.
No means yes to these people.

24
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,500
Get What's Up? Magazine
on the line.

25
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:56,793
Yeah, I heard you.

26
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,129
Donny, I got What's Up? Magazine
on the line.

27
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:01,590
They wanna know about you,
so I'm hanging up.

28
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,635
This is Erica or Lars.
I can't tell the difference.

29
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,511
- You got Stu.
- We said no.

30
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,222
I didn't hear you,
so I'm giving you a second chance.

31
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,016
- We don't do magicians.
- Magicians?

32
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,728
Donny G is an artist who happens
to look like a supermodel.

33
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,898
- The New Guys is offering him the cover.
- New Guys wants him?

34
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,567
And I haven't told my client,
my favorite client...

35
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,112
...that I am making this call, all right?
He wants New Guys.

36
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:26,239
I want you and I can make him
come around...

37
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:29,659
...but you'll lose us if I don't
hear from you by end of business.

38
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:32,370
Get New Guys. Tell him What's Up?
Is offering a cover.

39
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,955
Okay. Big Q.

40
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:38,418
Adam, I know three people looking
for dog walkers. That could be you.

41
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,921
"Sit. Stay. Don't worry, Fluffy,
I'll clean your shit and wipe your ass."

42
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,174
- You got Stu.
- What's up with my party, Stu?

43
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:47,177
I was just telling my assistant
to get my favorite client...

44
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,596
...on the phone,
and here you are. Nice.

45
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:55,310
Listen. Seriously, we gotta look
at a new night for your release party.

46
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:58,771
There are two premieres, a fundraiser.
All the happening places are booked.

47
00:04:58,813 --> 00:04:59,898
If we move the date...

48
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,568
Voodoo on you-do, motherfucker,
from Big Q to Big Stu!

49
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,904
- Big Q, be reasonable.
- Motherfucker, I'm a gangster!

50
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:09,782
- I don't gotta be reasonable!
- You're cutting out.

51
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:13,953
Next time I'm gonna kill your cracker-ass
if you keep talking about me like that!

52
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:15,330
Right?

53
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:18,958
N.Y.P.D. Blue, 11 o'clock.

54
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,587
Stuey, the hardest working
PR guy. How's business?

55
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:25,214
How many times I have
to tell you, Wyatt? I'm a publicist.

56
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:26,924
- Tickets.
- Tickets.

57
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,177
Four for Britney Spears, right?

58
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:31,387
You put the "Ho"
in show business, Stuey.

59
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:34,599
It's Stu. What do you got for me?

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,854
They just checked Mrs. Sharp
into Bellevue again.

61
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:42,440
- Page Six. Tell Britney I send my love.
- All right.

62
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:44,275
Enjoy the show.

63
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:48,404
Hold on a sec. Page Six, this is Lana.

64
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:51,949
Bless you. Lana, it's Stu Shepard.
Bless you.

65
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,909
- Is it you or your boss calling?
- It's me.

66
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:56,203
I'm looking for some
mutual back-scratching.

67
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:00,166
You get my privileged N.Y.P.D. Blue
info and I get you to save my ass.

68
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,959
Not now, Stu. I'm a sick woman.

69
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,086
This is going
to make you feel better.

70
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,174
Tony-winning producer Jeffrey Sharp
tossed his wife back into drug rehab.

71
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:10,468
Nice. What do you want
for that little tidbit?

72
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,013
You better be nice to me while I'm on
the way up and taking your calls.

73
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:17,558
The higher the monkey climbs,
the more you see of his ass.

74
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:18,934
Have a heart, Lana.

75
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:23,022
Listen, today my half-wit assistant
faxed you regarding my favorite client.

76
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,316
Great singer,
about to turn great actress.

77
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,861
- Another little Miss Tits and Ass?
- Look, I'm on cell, no names.

78
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:32,364
That was strictly in-office information.
You didn't print it, did you?

79
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:35,159
- I got it.
- All right, tell me Richard didn't see it.

80
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:37,161
He didn't put it in the column?

81
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,621
Stu's on the phone,
scared he's gonna lose his job.

82
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,166
His office sent you something
by mistake. He wants it.

83
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,544
You tell him T.F.B.
Put that at the top of the column.

84
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,463
- Stu, it ran, sorry.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,965
- Oh, God. Oh, no.
- I'm really sorry.

86
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,884
Yes!

87
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:56,221
What's Up? Magazine offered Donny G
a photo in "What's Hot and Happening."

88
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:59,099
- Fuck them. Make them sweat.
- He's on a conference call.

89
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:02,769
He could take a while. Yeah, can he call
you back? Okay. All right, bye.

90
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,146
- Pretty smooth.
- Thank you.

91
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:06,440
If you can absorb
everything I teach you...

92
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:10,110
...focus and get a new wardrobe,
you can make it big in public relations.

93
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,820
- I got a sense.
- Cool. Cool. Cool.

94
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,155
- Up, T?
- How you doing, man?

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,198
Mario's!

96
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,869
Hey! Hey! Hey! Not so fast, Stu!

97
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:22,456
How come you run every time
you go past my place, huh?

98
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:24,708
- Because I'm busy, Mario.
- Yeah?

99
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,169
Well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?

100
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:31,131
One lousy mention in the Post,
you expect to eat for six months? No!

101
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:34,634
Mario, maybe I could throw
the hippest party this month your way.

102
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:37,387
- Stu.
- No, I couldn't. My clients would kill me.

103
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,308
- What hip party?
- It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.

104
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:44,227
- There'll be local TV coverage...
- Nine and 11.

105
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,604
MTV, BET, VH1.

106
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,524
But I promised other clients,
people who actually pay me.

107
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:52,110
- No, you owe me.
- It's gotta be the night of the 18th.

108
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:55,321
Toss in a buffet for 80 people,
record company will pick up the booze...

109
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,157
...and I will deliver you celebrities.

110
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:00,285
Anything you want, okay?

111
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,746
Expand the menu, wallpaper
those bathrooms, for God's sake.

112
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,707
You only get one shot
with celebrities.

113
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:08,376
Thank you. Thank you, Stu!

114
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,211
- That was fucking brilliant.
- Listen.

115
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,673
Call Big Q. Tell him we got him
the hippest place in town on his date.

116
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,008
- Call What's Up?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,426
We'll take their offer.

118
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:18,970
Messenger a bottle of Jameson's
to Lana at Page Six...

119
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:21,472
...with a note saying... Write this down.
- Got it.

120
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:25,476
- Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu.
- "Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu."

121
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,562
- All right, no harm being gracious.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:30,106
Okay. Actually, better off,
deliver it over yourself.

123
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,275
- Get to know the players.
- I'll do that.

124
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:33,776
Thank you for teaching me.

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,821
- And, Adam, don't you have a suit?
- Actually, no.

126
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:38,906
Here. Get yourself one.

127
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,118
- I'm gonna start paying you soon.
- Yeah, I hope so.

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,204
- You got a bunch of messages.
- I'm late for a meeting. Hold them.

129
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:46,414
- All right.
- All right.

130
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,209
- See you, Stu!
- See you, Adam!

131
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:21,448
- Excuse me.
- I'm trying to make a call here.

132
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,910
This is for you. Half-pepperoni,
half-mushroom, extra crisp.

133
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:27,538
You ever heard of delivering
a pizza to a phone booth?

134
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:29,123
I don't think so.

135
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:33,377
Gentleman occupying phone booth,
53rd, between Broadway and 8th.

136
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,838
It's a mistake.

137
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,091
What am I supposed to do
with the pie? It's all paid for.

138
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,218
There's a homeless guy
around the block.

139
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:45,222
Give him the pizza and say "You can turn
away, but you can't make it go away."

140
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:48,350
He'll think I'm trying to poison him.
They always get that idea.

141
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,978
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?

142
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:54,481
That language is uncalled for.

143
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,525
Holy shit!

144
00:09:56,608 --> 00:10:00,237
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.

145
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,489
Fuck off.

146
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:07,995
Here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself.
You look like you could use a good meal.

147
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,223
Hello.

148
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:32,936
Pam, could you believe some nut case
just tried to deliver me a pizza?

149
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:37,107
Why are you always in the same
phone booth, same time, every day?

150
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:41,319
- Well, it's quitting time, right?
- Thank God, we were mobbed today.

151
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,571
So how's your day?

152
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:45,740
It's getting better
by the minute, sweetheart.

153
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:48,201
Who's the most famous person
you publicized today?

154
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,453
- You.
- Really?

155
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:54,124
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson
was looking for actresses for his film.

156
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:58,128
And I said the possibilities
were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...

157
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:00,880
...and my favorite client, you.

158
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,173
You didn't really do that.

159
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:04,592
First step toward being noticed
is being mentioned.

160
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,886
I just got out of a
conference at the City Hotel.

161
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,721
I was thinking you
could come down.

162
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:12,976
There are a couple of people and a few
martinis I'd like to introduce you to.

163
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,936
- Stu, l...
- Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.

164
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,480
It's about time we talked
about your career. Come on.

165
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:23,236
I feel awful but I promised my scene
partner that I would rehearse for class.

166
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:26,614
We're doing a scene from Jerry Maguire.
I'm playing Renee Zellweger's part.

167
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:29,492
That's great. Look, I rescheduled
a meeting to see you...

168
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:31,577
...but I guess I can reschedule it back.

169
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:34,122
- Are you mad?
- Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.

170
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,873
Maybe tomorrow.

171
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,417
Yeah, later.

172
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,127
- Look, Stu...
- What?

173
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,962
Big kiss.

174
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,630
You too.

175
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:55,768
- Yeah.
- Isn't it funny?

176
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,437
You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody...

177
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,232
...but a ringing phone has to be
answered, doesn't it?

178
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,400
What?

179
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:05,236
I hope you realize
how you've hurt my feelings.

180
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:08,990
- Who the fuck is this?
- Don't think about leaving that phone.

181
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,701
- Wrong number, pal.
- It was a perfectly delicious pizza.

182
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:14,036
You're certainly going
to wish you had accepted it.

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,581
Naturally, this is part of the gag.
The pizza bit. That was funny shit.

184
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:21,001
Well, its purpose was to keep
your strength up for what's coming next.

185
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,338
- What's coming next is I'm hanging up.
- Oh, no, you won't.

186
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,383
- You're going to learn to obey me.
- Obey you?

187
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:30,135
- Who is this?
- Someone who enjoys watching you.

188
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,303
Watching me?

189
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:35,766
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today.
Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.

190
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,811
Where...? Where are you?

191
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:43,273
There are hundreds of windows out there.
Why don't you check them out?

192
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:50,698
- So, what am I doing now?
- You're scratching your head.

193
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:54,451
Now you're brushing your hair back.

194
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:58,413
That's not very nice, Stu.

195
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:00,624
Did you call me Stu?

196
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,379
- Who's Stu? I don't know any Stu.
- Why, do you prefer Stuart?

197
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,548
A lot of people in this
neighborhood know me.

198
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:11,510
Stuart Shepard, 1326 West
51 st Street, Third Floor, front.

199
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:14,721
- Go mind-fuck some other guy, pal.
- I know Pamela McFadden too.

200
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,808
It's not in your best interest
to disconnect me.

201
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:20,352
Someone could get hurt.

202
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:23,397
What's the matter, Stu?

203
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,233
If you're some fucked-up,
failed actor I wouldn't handle...

204
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:30,028
...or some prick intern I fired, I will
hunt you down and I will crush you.

205
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,030
You will never work in this town.

206
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:33,573
I can turn people into gods...

207
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:37,410
...and I can turn you into a total
fucking loser if you weren't one already.

208
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:40,831
Do you hear me?
Am I upsetting you? Hello.

209
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,084
Oh, you think I'm gonna, what?
Pay you off or something?

210
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,003
- Tell me what you want.
- Now you want to talk to me.

211
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,256
Did Adam at my office
put you up to this?

212
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,175
No, I thought this up all by myself.

213
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,843
Keep thinking. I'm hanging up.

214
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:58,682
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you.
Talk to you later.

215
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:01,184
What the...?

216
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:06,523
The callback feature
cannot be activated...

217
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,566
Motherfucker.

218
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:40,640
- Tell me what you want.
- I want your complete attention.

219
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:45,686
- Are you an actor?
- Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.

220
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,189
- It's tough when you're not known.
- Tell me about it.

221
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:52,610
You don't have to hunt me and crush me.
I can't get work in this town as it is.

222
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:56,197
I've done some off-Broadway, some
off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.

223
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,242
Now I wait tables, clean toilets,
anything to make the rent.

224
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm a walking cliche.

225
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:03,287
I can help you.
I can get you auditions.

226
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,706
Auditions? You're not an agent.
You're a publicist.

227
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,251
Yeah, but I have contacts.
I know agents. I can get you an audition.

228
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,379
- Really?
- Yeah.

229
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:14,674
Well, there is someone
I'd like you to call.

230
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:15,925
Name it.

231
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,262
Try the number you dialed
when you first got into the booth.

232
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,973
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

233
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,142
Lucky you then,
because I wrote it down.

234
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,854
I can see every number you pressed.
Let's see if Pam is still at work.

235
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,148
- No.
- Then I guess I'll have to do it.

236
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:34,360
- Look, don't!
- Too late. It's already ringing.

237
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:38,906
- I'll put her on speaker so you can hear.
- You're fucking kidding me.

238
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:42,868
Stu, I never kid.

239
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:51,543
- Hello.
- Well, hello, Pam.

240
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,880
- Hi, who's this?
- It's a good friend of Stu's.

241
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:57,966
- And he hasn't got many.
- You know Stu?

242
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:01,220
I know he lies.

243
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,305
- Who is this?
- Don't worry about that.

244
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,142
Stu's listening in. He can hear
what we're saying about him.

245
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:10,604
- Stu, is that true? Are you there?
- Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!

246
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,773
She can't hear you, Stu.

247
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:17,194
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been
totally honest with you.

248
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:18,862
- What do you mean?
- Don't do this.

249
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:21,615
- Stu has been lying to you.
- Pam, hang up.

250
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,951
Now, why would a man
who has a cell phone...

251
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:27,496
...call you every day
from a phone booth?

252
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:32,709
- Because he said it's quiet.
- Pam, that's just stupid.

253
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,420
It's because his wife checks
his cell phone bills.

254
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:40,842
- No record of his calls to you.
- Jesus Christ.

255
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:44,846
- He said he wasn't married.
- Oh, he's married.

256
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,767
Her name is Kelly. I've never seen her
but she sounds lovely.

257
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,603
Why do you think
he invites you to the City Hotel?

258
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,730
- Cheap rooms for cheap girls.
- Asshole.

259
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,816
He's telling you all this
so you'll sleep with him.

260
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:59,486
- He's lying, Pam. Don't listen.
- I know that, okay?

261
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,113
I may be from Montana,
but we have men there also.

262
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,616
I wasn't planning
on sleeping with him.

263
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:07,160
I just don't know a lot
of people here right now.

264
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:10,372
And he's cute and he said
that he would help me.

265
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:15,085
- You never asked me if I was married.
- He's never made anyone a star. Bye.

266
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,420
Hello?

267
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:18,671
Back to you, Stu.

268
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:21,633
Gotta hit this trick before
the next bitch takes my score.

269
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:26,679
- Go away.
- Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.

270
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:35,480
This motherfucker,
you don't eyeball me. Bitch.

271
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,483
Why are you doing this?
Did I ever harm you? Did l...?

272
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,402
- Now, let's call Kelly.
- She's not home.

273
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,822
Oh, but I'm sure
she's at the shop on Columbus.

274
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,574
How the fuck do you
know all this shit?

275
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:51,913
Speed dial her. Press "auto one."
That's her button.

276
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,707
- What am I supposed to say?
- Why don't you try the truth?

277
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:57,710
- You're cheating.
- I'm not cheating on Kelly. I never have.

278
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,213
- Then what do you call it?
- Look, you're a guy...

279
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,924
...sometimes you want to know
it's a possibility.

280
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,800
It's like having a beautiful home...

281
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,136
...but you still dream
of that quick vacation.

282
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,932
You know, some nice hotel room
with a great view, maybe a pool.

283
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,017
It's just a fantasy.
You never leave home.

284
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,354
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.

285
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,190
- I'm sure they'll both appreciate that.
- Fuck you.

286
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,984
Hey, that kind of language
is uncalled for.

287
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,154
You can't take up the whole booth.
This here's my business.

288
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,239
This is not the only phone
in New York.

289
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:30,242
It's the only one on 8th Avenue
that's working.

290
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:35,080
- Bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost.
- Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get...

291
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,001
Goddamn it, man! You done made me
hurt my dick hand.

292
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm sure you're just as good
with the other hand. Yeah, go away.

293
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:48,302
I'll be back, motherfucker.
I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!

294
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,598
I was worried for you. I thought she was
gonna put an eye out with that hand.

295
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,559
Whoever you are, you're obviously
a very intelligent man.

296
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,354
I know what stress does.
It's all I can do from going crazy myself.

297
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,523
- You're calling me crazy?
- No, you're going through a difficult time.

298
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,192
Look, please don't call my wife.

299
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,694
Let me give you
my office number. We'll talk.

300
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,781
I know a reasonable photographer
who will do some headshots.

301
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:11,617
Stu, do you really think
that I'm an actor?

302
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,621
I'm not an actor.
I have no use for you, Stu. None.

303
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,665
I would just like you to tell Kelly
the truth about yourself.

304
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,252
So are you going to call Kelly
and tell her about Pam?

305
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,588
- Or do I have to?
- No!

306
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,175
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.

307
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,140
Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?

308
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,106
- Hello.
- Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.

309
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,400
- Stu?
- Yeah.

310
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,404
- Where are you?
- I'm in a phone booth.

311
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:54,075
Baby, I just got this call from this guy
who said you'd be calling me...

312
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:57,829
...from a booth to tell me
something important.

313
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,290
There's a lot of prank calling
going on today, baby.

314
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,001
- Tell her you invite women...
- Shut up.

315
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,086
...to have drinks at discreet hotels.

316
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,089
I'm not talking to you, baby.

317
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,382
Someone's got company.

318
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,551
- Who's that woman?
- Bitch got a cell phone!

319
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,221
- Some hooker is trying to use the phone.
- He just called me a hooker.

320
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:19,768
- Are you sure there's nothing wrong?
- We are escorts. Escorts.

321
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,770
Tell her you want to sleep
with other women.

322
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,647
There is this person
and he's saying things about me.

323
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,149
Things that might not be true.

324
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:30,570
And if he calls you... Get the fuck out
of here before I call the cops!

325
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,614
Honey, I want
to sleep with other women.

326
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,366
Look, Kelly, whatever he says,
don't believe him.

327
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,703
- I haven't done anything.
- Only because Pam had to rehearse.

328
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:40,788
Shut the fuck up!

329
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:45,501
Stu, I don't know what you're
talking about, but you're scaring me.

330
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,003
I'm sorry, baby.

331
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,882
Can you just come over
to the store so we can talk in person?

332
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:54,343
- I feel kind of weird.
- Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.

333
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,387
- Come on!
- Yeah, bitch!

334
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:58,181
- I love you too.
- "I love you."

335
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:01,184
Get out of here before
I have you deported to Jersey.

336
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,519
- You're a fucking ass!
- And you're a dirty skank.

337
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:08,816
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Your mama is a skank, bitch!

338
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,694
You didn't tell your wife
the truth, did you, Stu?

339
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,071
And you can tell she really loves you.

340
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,324
Must be nice to have
a pretty girl care for you.

341
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,367
Why screw up her life?
She never did you harm.

342
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,202
Everybody does harm.

343
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,371
That's it. This mind-fuck is over.

344
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:28,336
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.

345
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:32,798
What are you going to do about it
with your goddamn binoculars?

346
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,550
I never said I had binoculars.

347
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,887
I have a highly magnified
telescopic image of you.

348
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:41,223
Now what kind of device
has a telescopic sight mounted on it?

349
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,018
What? You mean like a rifle?

350
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:47,646
A.30-caliber bolt-action 700
with a carbon-one modification...

351
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:50,983
...and a state-of-the-art
Hensholdt tactical scope.

352
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:55,487
- And it's staring straight at you.
- Yeah, how's my fucking hair?

353
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:59,533
At this range, the exit wound ought to be
about the size of a small tangerine.

354
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:03,454
Nice try, pal. Go to hell.

355
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:08,042
Now, doesn't that just
torque your jaws?

356
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,252
I love that.

357
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:12,921
You know, like in the movies
just as the good guy...

358
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:15,632
...is about to kill
the bad guy, he cocks his gun.

359
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,177
Now why didn't he have it cocked?

360
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:22,389
Because that sound is scary.

361
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:23,932
It's cool, isn't it?

362
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:27,686
Look, you shoot a gun here
and there'll be pandemonium.

363
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:30,272
Do you hear me?
There will be cops all over this block.

364
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:35,527
Do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.

365
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,779
That won't help you.

366
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:39,614
Three.

367
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:46,288
Stu, look at everybody.
Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.

368
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,707
Here come the cops.

369
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,669
Sniper on the roof.
Gunfire, hit the deck.

370
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:56,465
Stu, you still with me?

371
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:58,842
Stand up and be a man.

372
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:05,265
So do you mean you would whack me
for no particular reason?

373
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:11,271
No, I have plenty of reasons,
and you keep giving me more.

374
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,858
- Shall I take care of him?
- No! No. Shit, no.

375
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,652
It would be so easy.

376
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:19,404
Here.

377
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,114
Here.

378
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,328
Stu, you just gave that gentleman
$ 10 to walk away.

379
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,748
You saved his life.
You do have a sensitive side.

380
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,711
- How much to let me go?
- Let's see how sensitive you really are.

381
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:38,756
I'm aiming at you right now.

382
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,678
Can you feel it, the heat of it?

383
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,139
Come now, Stu, you can feel it.

384
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,516
Concentrate.

385
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:51,144
Concentrate.

386
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,021
Take a look at where I'm going.

387
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,817
You're doing so much better
than the others.

388
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,778
You read about the German porn king
shot 10 days ago...

389
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,613
...at 38th and 8th?

390
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:06,242
He thought he was an artist and wouldn't
admit he was just a pedophile.

391
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,786
Believe me, he had plenty
of chances to come clean.

392
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,082
You must have read about the corporate
executive shot at 47th and 10th.

393
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:16,085
What you didn't read
was that he cashed in all of his stocks...

394
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,547
...just before the bottom fell out,
while all the little guys lost everything.

395
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:23,092
Now if he had been willing
to make amends...

396
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,553
...share the money,
things might have been different.

397
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:30,641
Please, tell me,
where am I aiming now?

398
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,020
- Below the shoulder.
- Which one?

399
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,147
The right shoulder.

400
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:39,358
- Love to love you too, baby!
- That's phenomenal, Stu.

401
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,611
You're doing so much better
than the others.

402
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:45,823
What do you remember
about those killings, Stu?

403
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,032
I don't know.

404
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:49,952
Well, you think of yourself
as a smart guy, Stu. Try.

405
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:53,747
- They got shot. I don't know, all right?
- Okay, I'll give you a hint.

406
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:57,418
Wallets, watches, everything
was left on their bodies.

407
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:00,504
Because they weren't robberies.
They were executions.

408
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,298
They didn't have to be.

409
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,258
What did I do
to deserve this? Why me?

410
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:09,013
If you have to ask,
then you're not ready to know yet.

411
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:12,516
- Right here. Shit. Come on.
- Jesus. You, in the booth.

412
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:13,684
- Come on.
- Now what?

413
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,395
You got any idea how much pain
you're making in my life?

414
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:18,105
- Hey, look at me.
- Look, I hear you!

415
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:21,191
Look me in the eye.
Hang up the phone and walk away.

416
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:23,902
- Don't do it.
- I got my own problems.

417
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,946
I'm your problem.
You know why?

418
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,783
My girls keep yapping at me,
"Leon, he won't share the phone."

419
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,243
"Leon, he told us to fuck off."

420
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,330
"We're gonna make you nuts unless you
make him get off the fucking phone."

421
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,543
- I'm trying to run a fucking business.
- I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.

422
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,629
No, you don't understand me.
I got the G-string union here.

423
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,089
They're breaking my balls.

424
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:46,800
I gotta live with their shit,
but not yours.

425
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:50,762
So I'm saying this once, nice, all right?
Hang up the phone. Walk away.

426
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:53,390
- He did say it nicely.
- He got a cell phone up in there too.

427
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,393
- It ain't even like he need a phone!
- I can't get off the call!

428
00:25:56,435 --> 00:26:00,021
Shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit?
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

429
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:02,691
They ain't gonna fucking stop,
till I get their way.

430
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:07,529
- I'm getting a fucking headache, pal.
- All right. I'll pay you to go away.

431
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:10,657
I don't want your money. I want you
to hang up the phone and get out.

432
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:14,828
- $ 120. It's all yours.
- Everybody has their price, right, Stu?

433
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,789
You're gonna give me $ 120
to rent the booth the bums piss in?

434
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:20,709
- Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
- Something ain't right with him.

435
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,169
Look at that sweat pouring off
that son of a bitch.

436
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:26,673
- This one sick mother we started with.
- It's probably catching too.

437
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:27,924
- Yo.
- He's got AIDS.

438
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:30,635
- How long you want to rent the booth?
- Indefinitely.

439
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,761
- Indefinitely?
- Yes.

440
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:34,514
Do I look like a asshole?
Let me tell you something.

441
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:38,101
- $500 gets you indefinitely.
- Wait up! Hold the fuck up!

442
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:43,481
How come he's defying you, huh?
What, you got bitch in you now?

443
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:49,279
- Did I say shut the fuck up?
- Yeah, now talk to him like that!

444
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,322
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?

445
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:55,368
- Do you need help?
- Look, I'm handling it.

446
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,328
- Come on!
- I can help you, Stu.

447
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,790
I wasn't gonna kill you before,
but you changed my fucking mind.

448
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:05,962
I would take off if I was you.
He gonna kick your ass.

449
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:08,881
- He gonna kick your ass.
- Get the fuck out!

450
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:11,092
Can you get out of here?
Will you go away?

451
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:14,011
- He looks very angry.
- Come on. I, look...

452
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:15,388
- Hang up.
- Get rid of him.

453
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,515
- Hang up the phone!
- We can work this out!

454
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,183
- Get rid of him!
- Hang up the phone.

455
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:22,395
I got a watch.
It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.

456
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:24,605
Yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.

457
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:27,733
You got five seconds to get off
the fucking phone. Five.

458
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:31,320
- Batter up.
- Four.

459
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:33,614
I can stop him.

460
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:34,991
Three.

461
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:39,370
- Just say the word, Stu.
- Two. One.

462
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:41,080
No, no. Don't. Don't.

463
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:44,500
Fuck.

464
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,627
This will count as a hang up.

465
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,464
I can make him stop.
Just say the word. Can you hear me?

466
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:51,549
- Yes.
- What?

467
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:54,510
Yes!

468
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:56,554
- Whose street is this?
- That's right, baby.

469
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,098
Oh, my God.

470
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:01,267
Baby, you bleeding?
You must've cut yourself...

471
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,018
- What's wrong?
- You cut yourself.

472
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:07,690
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Baby? Leon? Leon!

473
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,608
- He was fucking shot!
- Oh, my God!

474
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,111
- Motherfucker!
- He's shot!

475
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,737
Leon!

476
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:16,657
Somebody call an ambulance!

477
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,243
- Call 411!
- 911, dumb bitch!

478
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:21,412
He ain't breathing.
Call the meat wagon!

479
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:24,415
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shot him.

480
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:27,376
- Why'd you fucking shoot him?
- You said, "Yes."

481
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,795
"Yes, I can hear you,"
not, "Yes, kill him!"

482
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,422
You ought to be more careful
with what you say.

483
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:34,550
Oh, my God.

484
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,927
- Motherfucker, why?!
- It wasn't me!

485
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,930
- Where's the gun? Do you see a gun?
- Fuck you!

486
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,642
You pumped one into him, bitch!
I saw it! He's got a Glock!

487
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:46,520
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Daddy got a Glock!

488
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:49,982
What Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock!
It's a telephone!

489
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:54,653
You shot my man, daddy!
They gonna skin and fry your ass!

490
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:59,741
You shot my baby, daddy!
Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!

491
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,868
Please, come on! Come in here, bitch!

492
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:03,203
Better run, motherfucker!

493
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,665
The cops is coming and I hope
they fry your ass down!

494
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:08,583
I'm not going anywhere, am I?

495
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,921
If you had dealt with the man decently,
this might not have been necessary.

496
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:16,049
Look, I offered him money.
I offered him my watch.

497
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:18,843
But not your respect,
which is what he really wanted.

498
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:22,973
You were dismissive like you dismissed
the nice pizza guy.

499
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:27,185
You are guilty of inhumanity
to your fellow man.

500
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:29,020
I'm not guilty of a goddamn thing.

501
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:32,857
Take responsibility
for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.

502
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:36,277
I love this fucking spin. You shoot
the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?

503
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,238
Well, looked that way from up here.

504
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:41,241
I don't know what I did to
you but whatever it was, I'm glad.

505
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,451
I wish it had been worse.
I wish you died!

506
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:48,081
- Yes, finally some honesty.
- Just tell me who you are.

507
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:51,960
No one you'd ever notice.
I don't run in your circles.

508
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,837
- And what is it you do?
- I watch.

509
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:57,799
- You watch?
- Yes, well, what else is there to do...

510
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,260
...when life turns on you and you've
retreated into some small room?

511
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:02,679
You look out your window.

512
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:06,724
You see people come in and out of this
phone booth. The same ones every day.

513
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:09,894
You make up names for them.
You imagine their stories.

514
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:14,107
But eventually, you get tired
of imagining and follow one of them.

515
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,151
And you hear all of his lies.

516
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:20,238
And you decide that his sins
should be punished.

517
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,034
Some guy shouting into a cell phone full
of self-importance isn't gonna notice me.

518
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:30,331
But I noticed that German porn king,
and I noticed that corrupt executive.

519
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,541
And I noticed you, Stu.

520
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:37,755
- I'm flattered.
- Operator 553. What is your emergency?

521
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:39,006
Will you please respond?

522
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,593
What was so interesting about a guy
in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?

523
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,679
The Stu Show. Better than TV.

524
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:48,307
Look, how'd I get so lucky to be
picked up by a killer with a rifle?!

525
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:52,812
You had it made.
Kelly at home, Pam on the side.

526
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:56,857
I saw Pam once. I followed her
to her restaurant. Lovely.

527
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,401
Life has given you
more than your fair share, Stu.

528
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,946
But it appears you don't appreciate it.

529
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:04,949
Look, look, listen,
appearances can be deceiving.

530
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,911
I may look confident, but I'm really,
actually just crying out for help!

531
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,371
Help! You know?

532
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:15,918
I'm trying to help you, Stu,
but you won't help yourself.

533
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,882
- Fuck.
- What's the matter, Stu?

534
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,262
- You shot me!
- It's time you learn, Stu.

535
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:31,058
- Deception can't go unrewarded.
- Deception! What fucking deception?

536
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:36,939
"Are you in need of immediate police
or medical response?"

537
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,651
Shit. You bugged the fucking booth.

538
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,195
That's how you knew.
That's how you knew about Pam.

539
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,449
- You picked the wrong person to lie to.
- Look, I didn't pick you.

540
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,202
It must have been
your flashy suit that attracted me.

541
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:53,205
I get fucked on account of my clothes?
That why you killed Leon?

542
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,248
I didn't kill Leon because
of the way he dressed.

543
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,210
And those other two guys as well?
Did they dress too nice?

544
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:01,546
You must feel really expensive
when you walk out the door.

545
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,131
All right, here come the cops.

546
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,841
What are you gonna do? Run?

547
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,260
No, I'm not a coward
like some people I know.

548
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,222
- You can get away if you run now.
- You'll blame me for Leon.

549
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,433
No, no, I'll confess I shot him
with my fucking phone.

550
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,144
Well, then I urge you
to keep one thing in mind, Stu.

551
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:19,606
Take a look at your chest. You saw how
accurate I can be, how lethal.

552
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,650
Kill me now,
and you give yourself away.

553
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,194
Not with a silencer.
It would take these guys...

554
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:27,739
...the rest of the day to figure out it
wasn't one of their own men that did it.

555
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,367
You can be shot 41 times
for pulling out your wallet.

556
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,454
Throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands raised.

557
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,581
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, what if they open fire?

558
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,501
They won't. Look around you, Stu.

559
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,003
Do you see the tourists
with the video cameras?

560
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,922
The ones hoping the cops
will blow you away...

561
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,966
...so they can sell the tape
to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?

562
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,761
Don't worry, they'll keep
the police on their best behavior.

563
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:55,183
So long as you don't take
hostile action, you should be safe.

564
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,726
Safe? You call this safe?

565
00:32:56,851 --> 00:33:01,314
I got a whole fucking precinct here
with guns pointed my way.

566
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:07,195
With both hands raised,
moving slowly, step out of the booth.

567
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,073
If we see any signs of a weapon
we will respond.

568
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,908
You won't because there isn't any!

569
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,035
Put down the phone
and raise your hands!

570
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,329
Look, I can't.
I'm on an important call.

571
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,414
Verify this information for me.

572
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,958
The guy in the booth
shot that guy over there...

573
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,002
...and stuck around
to make a phone call.

574
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,713
Yeah, that's what the hookers
are saying.

575
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,466
All right, give me the horn.

576
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:37,433
- Sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply.
- I'm busy, all right. Come back later.

577
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,853
- Very good, Stu.
- Step out of the booth...

578
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,357
...and raise your hands.
I am giving you an order.

579
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,859
I give the orders here, Stu, don't I?

580
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,278
This guy is looking for us
to kill him, captain.

581
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:51,989
Suicide by a cop?
Well, that's not gonna happen.

582
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,116
Get that body out of here fast.

583
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,619
Somebody get the body.
Tell the ambulance to get the body.

584
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:01,540
Thousands of people die every day,
but you put one dead body...

585
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,335
...in the middle of a busy street
and it makes people crazy.

586
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:09,965
Look at these guys.
You can smell the fear.

587
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,345
- Ten cops.
- This reminds me of Nam.

588
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,472
- Vietnam?
- Yes, Vietnam.

589
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,725
I was too young to go,
but I've seen pictures.

590
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,771
Well, pictures can't do it, Stu.
You can't imagine the fear, the stench.

591
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,649
Napalm-charred bodies, children
leaving grenades in your boots.

592
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,320
- Then you got blamed for the war.
- I came home and people spit on me.

593
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,655
Yeah, this country
owes you an apology.

594
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,659
Look, I just had this vision of you,
of a kid, coming back from the war...

595
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,413
...inured to the killing,
not able to get work, isolated.

596
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,999
I think that could be made
into an affecting story...

597
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,418
...and, you know, one
that everyone understands.

598
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,004
And I think cops
are on the side of vets.

599
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,674
You are pathetic, Stu.
Why don't you wake up?

600
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:56,720
Napalm-charred bodies?
I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!

601
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,639
Stop fucking with my head, please!

602
00:34:58,889 --> 00:34:59,973
I'm gonna go talk to him.

603
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,933
Shouldn't we wait
on the ESU negotiator?

604
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:05,354
They could take 20 minutes.
I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.

605
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,813
I'm gonna handle this.

606
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,401
Sir! I'm taking out my weapon.

607
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,904
Putting my weapon down on the car.

608
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,989
- The captain's going in.
- I'm not armed.

609
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,367
- Yeah, neither am I.
- My name is Ramey.

610
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,411
- Captain Ed Ramey.
- All right.

611
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,455
- What's yours?
- I don't want to be friends.

612
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,750
I don't know. It looks like
you could use a friend right now.

613
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,753
- Tell him you've already got a friend.
- I already got a friend.

614
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,962
Is that who you're
talking to on the phone?

615
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,759
Look, I just want to hear
your side of it. That's all.

616
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,304
I ain't got no side of it,
and I didn't shoot anybody.

617
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,348
You see a fucking gun
anywhere? Look.

618
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,225
It's in your back pocket!
I see it! He been...

619
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,855
Sir, do you have the weapon
in your pocket?

620
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,776
No. I got a cell phone and I got
cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.

621
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,612
Then what are you doing
in a phone booth making calls?

622
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,156
- You want to see it? Here.
- Hey!

623
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,325
Don't reach for that! Hold your fire!

624
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,453
I don't need to see it.
I know what's there.

625
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,040
I got plenty of witnesses over here
who saw you use it.

626
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,042
They didn't see it
because it didn't happen!

627
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,754
- Shut them up!
- He's dead, but it didn't happen?

628
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,341
- Then who did it?
- Mustn't tell him, Stu.

629
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,926
- I don't know.
- You were the closest one to him.

630
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,387
- You must've saw it happen. Help me.
- No.

631
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,266
- This guy is getting on my nerves.
- Look, stay the fuck out of this.

632
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,310
Who do you keep talking to
on the phone?

633
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,521
- Nobody.
- Your friend, your parent, your lover?

634
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:34,442
- Who?
- Careful, Stuart. Careful.

635
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,486
My psychiatrist.

636
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,032
- Excellent. I should've thought of that.
- I see. What's this doctor's name?

637
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,200
It would be really helpful to us
if we knew.

638
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,038
He says not to tell you, all right?
It's privileged information.

639
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,498
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.

640
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,336
- Yeah, whatever you fucking say.
- I respect your right to privacy.

641
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,131
I've been through therapy myself.
The department provided it for me.

642
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,634
I know it's not good form for a cop
to be saying that, but sometimes...

643
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:05,014
...you know, circumstances, stress...
I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.

644
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,767
Tell him not to come any closer.

645
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,103
Don't come any closer. Stop there.
Go back a few steps.

646
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,397
- Go back to where you were!
- Okay. No problem.

647
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,359
- That's right.
- So you got some intimacy issues.

648
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,238
I got those too. All I want to know is,
what happened, man?

649
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:25,284
- Tell him to read you your rights.
- I want you to read me my rights.

650
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,119
Stop asking questions.

651
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,956
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

652
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,752
If you cannot afford one,
an attorney will be provided for you.

653
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:38,547
All right? So now, can you at least
give me your first name?

654
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,674
- Just your first name.
- Don't tell him.

655
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,178
It's my right
not to have any first name.

656
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:47,055
- No gun, no name.
- That's right.

657
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,767
- You're highly underprivileged.
- Demand your lawyer.

658
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,644
And go get my lawyer too. All right?

659
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,856
I want an attorney brought
down here to negotiate my surrender.

660
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:58,525
- Just brilliant, Stu.
- I understand that, but...

661
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,029
...it's gonna be difficult to get a lawyer
to come and risk his life.

662
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,406
- Once you hand over the gun...
- How can I?

663
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:06,742
You won't let me put my hand
in my pocket?

664
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,995
We'll take it out for you.
All you have to do...

665
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:14,249
...is step out with your hands raised.
Nothing will happen to you.

666
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:16,334
- It's not gonna work.
- Stu, Stu.

667
00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:17,961
- What?
- Ask him a question.

668
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:21,047
Ask him if his wife
got tired of sleeping with him.

669
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:25,760
- I... Fuck. I can't do that.
- Oh, sure you can, Stu.

670
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:28,597
Ask him if he couldn't get it up,
if he couldn't satisfy her.

671
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,433
- Are you gonna step out of the booth?
- I can't. No.

672
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:35,312
- You're not stepping out of the booth?
- Ask him.

673
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:38,815
- Is that a no?
- Ask him!

674
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:41,860
- Both your lives depend on it.
- Sir?

675
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:48,867
Captain, you couldn't satisfy your wife
sexually?

676
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,290
- Excuse me?
- Ask him if he abuses himself now?

677
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,418
- Does he masturbate on lonely nights?
- Fuck. For God's sake!

678
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,670
Say it!

679
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:04,424
Say it or I will blow him away!

680
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,345
- So do you whack off now?
- Hey!

681
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,893
I'm gonna see about
that lawyer for you, okay?

682
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,605
- Yes.
- Just relax.

683
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:24,986
- Stu, I think you hurt his feelings.
- I wanna know who's on that phone.

684
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:29,574
I want a techie here. I need
to talk to somebody about that phone.

685
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:32,952
Do you think we went too far, Stuart?
Should we give ourselves up?

686
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:35,455
Maybe I'd like someone
to negotiate my surrender.

687
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:39,125
- I'm sure we can work that out.
- I won't just spill my guts to anyone.

688
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:43,379
Could you get me national news?
I mean, you've got connections, right?

689
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,965
- Sure.
- Could you get Larry King down here?

690
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:47,967
Why the fuck would Larry King
come here?

691
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:52,054
Because you're friends.
Who else could you get, huh?

692
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:55,224
Could you get Tom Brokaw?
How about Dan Rather? Diane Sawyer?

693
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:58,978
- Look, I, I, I don't know. They're busy.
- I, I, I busy.

694
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:02,106
How about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel?
Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?

695
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:06,068
Al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.

696
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:10,239
Face it, Stu, you're smalltime.
And you've got a credibility problem.

697
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,159
Don't fucking worry about
my credibility! All right?

698
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,119
What about yours?

699
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:20,541
Look, it's our friends from channels
two and five. Your local news, Stuart.

700
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:23,586
You couldn't do this for your clients
if your life depended on it.

701
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:26,130
But me, I've made you famous.

702
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:29,383
Stick your head out so they can get
a better angle on you.

703
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:32,511
- They're here to cover me dying.
- How ungrateful.

704
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:34,847
Those cameras will make the police
very careful.

705
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,767
- So come on, smile a little for them.
- Can you tap into that phone call?

706
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,602
- Should be no problem.
- Except...

707
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:44,398
...we'll need a warrant
if he's on the line with his shrink.

708
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,026
Fuck that. I'm not gonna
jeopardize this on a technicality.

709
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:50,320
Look, tracing,
that's not a violation, right?

710
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:53,699
- As long as we don't listen in.
- Okay, this is what I want you to do.

711
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,952
I want you to find who he's talking to
and their current location.

712
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:59,288
All right? We get that?

713
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,790
I want somebody to find out
what's going on.

714
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:06,295
Look across the street and see what
everybody in New York is looking at.

715
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,464
You're the man, Stuart.
You're the center of attention.

716
00:41:09,548 --> 00:41:14,261
Wait till this goes national:
ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...

717
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,722
You're gonna hit
the whole alphabet, Stu.

718
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,890
I'll be forgotten about in a week.

719
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:21,393
No one ever remembers
the names of the victims.

720
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:25,397
It's the killers that get the cover
of Time magazine. Right?

721
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:29,943
Think about it. You'd be famous.
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...

722
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,696
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
Name a victim. You can't.

723
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,615
Anyway, I don't deserve
to be the center of attention.

724
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,160
- It ought to be you they're covering.
- That attention would embarrass me.

725
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:43,123
- I know exactly the spin to put on this.
- How terror inspires your creativity?

726
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:47,210
Listen, this could be a media frenzy,
all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...

727
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,629
...I mean, Larry King
if you still wanted him.

728
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:54,676
That approach seems predicated upon
me surrendering without killing you.

729
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:59,973
Listen, we can make you sympathetic,
sit with a writer, bang out a book.

730
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:04,561
You know, movie of the week.
Get America on your side.

731
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:07,605
All right, you killed Leon
because he was gonna kill me.

732
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:10,692
You killed Leon to protect me.
All right?

733
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:13,945
In a city where nobody looks out
for anybody, you took a stand.

734
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,363
I'm your best witness.

735
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:18,783
So you want me to trust you
to get me out of this?

736
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:22,161
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me.
Trust me.

737
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:26,457
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.

738
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:39,804
- Oh, shit. Here comes Braman.
- I'll take care of him.

739
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:44,350
Hey. Should've waited for me
to initiate contact with the suspect.

740
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:46,727
I established a rapport.
Let you know if I need help.

741
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,729
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?

742
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:51,691
Or do you want to leave this
to a professional?

743
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:54,443
Until a professional gets here,
I'll handle it.

744
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:59,198
You're a funny guy. All right, you get
somebody else killed, it's on your head.

745
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:01,409
Got it?

746
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:04,704
This is what I want to do, okay?
This is the City Hotel here.

747
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:08,999
I want three guys in the lobby here.
And five sharpshooters up here.

748
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,168
See if you can get me two
in the subway.

749
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:15,339
What the fuck?

750
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:19,260
- Not going to answer it?
- I can't. I can't reach for the phone.

751
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:21,804
- The cops will think it's a gun.
- I'll bet it's Kelly.

752
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:24,473
She's probably heard what you did.
She's sick with worry.

753
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:26,767
I'm not gonna make her
feel any better, am I?

754
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,478
Well, you could ask her
to forgive you, Stuart.

755
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:34,942
You could confess your sins
and beg for absolution, come clean.

756
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,653
You're in this position
because you're not telling the truth.

757
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,655
I'm in this position
because you got a gun!

758
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:44,660
No. Stuart, that is the sin of spin.
Avoidance and deception.

759
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:49,456
You're being given a chance here
to make things right. Now, talk to her.

760
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:53,669
- Look, I can't. Please.
- I am telling you to answer that phone!

761
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,797
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- You can't cross in front of here!

762
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,924
Answer it!

763
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:02,719
- Look, I can't. Please.
- Don't make me hurt you!

764
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:05,389
- Talk to your wife!
- It's not her calling.

765
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:12,187
- How can you be so sure?
- It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!

766
00:44:12,104 --> 00:44:15,983
Damn, you got me!
You continue to impress.

767
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:18,360
You could shoot me,
but you want them to do it!

768
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:20,195
- Yes, well, that's an option.
- Yeah.

769
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:21,988
- Captain.
- Yeah?

770
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:24,616
This lady says the perp's her husband.
Here's her ID.

771
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:27,994
- I couldn't believe when I saw this.
- Who do you think he's talking to?

772
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:33,750
I don't know. I spoke to him
earlier today and I told him...

773
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,628
...that there was a man who called me.
- A man?

774
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:39,256
Did this upset him, that
you were talking to other men?

775
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:43,426
Yes, he did seem a little upset,
but it's, no... It's not like that.

776
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:47,514
- I didn't even know who this guy was.
- Who's his psychiatrist?

777
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:50,267
- He doesn't have one.
- That you know of.

778
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:54,437
I've been with him three years, married for
one. I'd know if he was in therapy.

779
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:57,440
I wish to God he had been.
I saw somebody after my divorce.

780
00:44:57,482 --> 00:45:00,568
It kept me from picking up a gun,
doing something I would regret.

781
00:45:00,652 --> 00:45:04,114
- Look, Stu didn't kill anyone.
- Ma'am, under the circumstances...

782
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:07,826
...you need to consider whether your
husband is who you thought he was.

783
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:11,037
'Cause according to these witnesses
over here, he has a gun...

784
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,666
...he has used that gun and let's pray
to God that he doesn't use it again.

785
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:15,917
Captain?

786
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:20,046
If you can think of any dispute
he's having currently, please, tell me.

787
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:24,550
We're clearing City Hotel. I can stage
an assault unit within feet of the booth.

788
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,179
We've also got sharpshooters
securing rooftop positions.

789
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:30,640
- Let me know when you're in position.
- Absolutely.

790
00:45:30,723 --> 00:45:32,225
What about that wire tap?

791
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:35,436
We're working on it.
You gotta hold tight a while, all right?

792
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:38,356
- Yeah, no problem. No problem.
- Okay.

793
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,695
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.

794
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,907
- Does he like being called Stuart or Stu?
- Stu. Call him Stu.

795
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,909
Stu. Okay.

796
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:52,370
Come with me, please.

797
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:57,708
Stu.

798
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,293
I have your wife with me.

799
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,213
That's how you knew
she wasn't calling. You deceived me.

800
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,298
- Stu!
- She's not my wife.

801
00:46:04,423 --> 00:46:06,842
Are you okay?

802
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:10,304
- Can you just talk to me?
- Yes, talk to her, Stu.

803
00:46:10,346 --> 00:46:11,847
Look, she's not my wife!

804
00:46:12,598 --> 00:46:16,602
She's some fucked-up, failed actress
I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!

805
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:19,688
You aren't making this up?
You are his wife, right?

806
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,567
Yes, here's a photograph of us
together.

807
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:26,195
I don't know what he's talking about.

808
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:29,114
Stu. Listen to your wife.

809
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,826
- She only wants what's best for you.
- She's not my wife!

810
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,746
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.

811
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:39,416
- We just want to know what happened.
- Yeah, very good.

812
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:44,088
Go home, you fucking lunatic!
You hear me? Go home!

813
00:46:44,046 --> 00:46:47,049
Please don't make things worse.
Just come out.

814
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:49,218
Just do what they tell you to do.

815
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:52,221
Your wife is a crazy actress stalker
and you don't know her.

816
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:55,057
- That's an interesting match.
- Get her out of here!

817
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:58,602
- Enough. I don't want to agitate this.
- You out of your fucking mind?

818
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:02,272
- Come on, get the woman out of here!
- No. I don't know what's going on.

819
00:47:02,314 --> 00:47:08,195
He's bleeding... We... We're fine.
This morning everything was fine.

820
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:10,322
You just stay here.
Just stay here, okay?

821
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:13,617
- Okay.
- I think she did some good.

822
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,662
- You got a number of that lawyer?
- No, we don't have a lawyer.

823
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:19,581
He asked for his lawyer to come
negotiate his surrender.

824
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:23,627
- Well, we never needed one.
- Well, you need a good one now.

825
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:27,464
Look, you'll do me best
by staying near here. Okay?

826
00:47:27,506 --> 00:47:29,466
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.

827
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:33,095
- I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
- Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.

828
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:35,430
You know, get her some coffee
or something.

829
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:38,600
You're gonna lose this guy.
You need some kind of redemption.

830
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:41,853
- What are you seeing a shrink for?
- Get the fuck out of my face!

831
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:45,607
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm not stepping down!

832
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:48,026
You okay?

833
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:51,446
Yeah, I'm fine.

834
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,491
You'd think she didn't know
she was being watched.

835
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:58,286
- What?
- But beautiful women always know.

836
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:02,165
- You talking about Kelly?
- That false indifference, superior air...

837
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:05,835
...it's just a tease.
They want eyes on them.

838
00:48:05,877 --> 00:48:09,381
Why does she put on her makeup,
do her hair, dress so nicely?

839
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:11,674
Not for her husband
that she hardly ever sees.

840
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:14,928
No, it's for somebody else to notice.
I notice.

841
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,764
What are you doing?
Stay away from her. Leave her alone.

842
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:19,974
I'm giving her what she wants.

843
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:24,312
I bet you've never looked at Kelly
the way I am right now.

844
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,651
- Don't you dare fucking hurt her.
- Don't I dare?

845
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:31,694
I'm not the one
who has hurt her, Stuart.

846
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:34,739
What they can't know is what we do
to them in our minds. Right?

847
00:48:34,822 --> 00:48:37,992
- You sick fuck!
- The perfect violation.

848
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,954
- Leave her out of this.
- How many times...

849
00:48:42,038 --> 00:48:47,043
...have you had sex with Pam
in that hotel bedroom in your head?

850
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:50,922
Would you really miss Kelly
if she was gone?

851
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:54,759
That's it. Not another word.
I'm not talking to you.

852
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,011
Your choices put other people
in jeopardy.

853
00:48:57,094 --> 00:49:00,264
When are you gonna learn that?

854
00:49:00,348 --> 00:49:04,268
This is funny. Stuart, look uptown.

855
00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:08,189
These geniuses are still
at the juncture box trying to tap in.

856
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:11,859
Only I have installed an encryption
device at both ends of the line.

857
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,653
There's no chance of a trap trace...

858
00:49:13,736 --> 00:49:18,783
...so now they've gotta try some fancy
LoJack instrument. It's really sad.

859
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,911
I hope you weren't
pinning your hopes on those morons.

860
00:49:21,952 --> 00:49:24,997
Truth is, I'm on a wireless A.D.S.
With a cloned number.

861
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,335
It'll take a half an hour to find out
I call forwarded through Philadelphia.

862
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:34,006
And let me tell you, this will all be over
before they can get a dial tone.

863
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:37,635
We can't get a trace or break into the
line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.

864
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:41,222
I knew there was something weird
about this. You keep working on it.

865
00:49:48,187 --> 00:49:51,649
Stu. Stuart, come on,
you're behaving like a child.

866
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,525
Still gonna give me
the silent treatment?

867
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:57,905
Hello. Stuart, don't do this, please.
Come on.

868
00:49:57,905 --> 00:50:00,741
My sainted mother used to do this.
She used to dish this out.

869
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:03,410
Stuart, please don't do this.

870
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:06,872
Stuart, you're bringing back
my unhappy childhood.

871
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:12,377
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me!
I can't take it! Stu, please...

872
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:15,714
I'm kidding.
I had a very happy childhood.

873
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:20,469
Hey, there's our girl again.
I wasn't planning on killing her...

874
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,096
...but plans change.

875
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:25,933
Just tell me
what the fuck you want from me.

876
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:30,395
Hello. There you are.
I thought I was talking to myself again.

877
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:33,065
Anything you want. I'll do it.
Just tell me.

878
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:38,945
Tell Kelly about the real Stu,
about your little motel.

879
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:43,450
- And then you'll let us go?
- Why not?

880
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:48,371
- Kelly!
- That's a start.

881
00:50:48,455 --> 00:50:50,207
- Baby!
- Hold her back!

882
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,666
- Hey!
- Talk to me!

883
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,169
- Grab her! Keep her back!
- Yes?

884
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:55,587
I'm listening.

885
00:50:57,047 --> 00:50:58,715
Kelly, I called some woman.

886
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:02,135
- Every day.
- Every day.

887
00:51:02,218 --> 00:51:06,890
I was attracted to this other woman.
And I called her and...

888
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:13,355
- I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to sleep with her.

889
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:19,903
No. I wanted to fuck her.

890
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:28,328
- Say it. Say it!
- And I wanted to fuck her.

891
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:34,626
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever you did, I don't care.

892
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:37,921
Please, just come out of the booth.
Okay?

893
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:42,800
That's all I did. That's all I did.
I'm sorry.

894
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:49,015
All right, I've done what you asked.
That's it. I've had enough of this.

895
00:51:49,098 --> 00:51:51,350
I haven't.

896
00:51:51,434 --> 00:51:56,814
- You said you'd let us go.
- I changed my mind.

897
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:59,984
You miserable fuck. You can't do this.
You can't do this to me.

898
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:03,696
Look, I took all your shit.
I did everything you fucking asked.

899
00:52:03,738 --> 00:52:05,323
You lied to me.
I'm done with this.

900
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:09,827
I've fucking had enough.
You can go fuck yourself! Later.

901
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:12,455
- He hung up.
- Maybe they already got a trace.

902
00:52:12,538 --> 00:52:15,333
ESU, ESU?

903
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:20,713
- I'm giving myself up!
- He's coming out!

904
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:23,507
- Heads up!
- I want to see you toss away your weapon!

905
00:52:23,758 --> 00:52:26,552
Throw the weapon outside the booth!
Stay where you are!

906
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,014
- First, the weapon!
- Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!

907
00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:32,767
- There's no fucking gun!
- Stay right where you are!

908
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,855
I want you to turn around. Interlock
your fingers behind your head. Okay?

909
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:43,152
- Please give them the gun!
- Kelly, no!

910
00:52:43,736 --> 00:52:46,572
Get back! Kelly!

911
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:49,533
- Freeze!
- Get back! Get back!

912
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:51,660
- Get back!
- Okay! Okay!

913
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,831
I gotta answer it.

914
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:57,958
Freeze! Don't move.

915
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,461
Hold your fire!

916
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,423
Hold your fire!

917
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,092
Hold your fire.

918
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:12,389
- Hold. Hold.
- Please.

919
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,518
- Go ahead. Answer it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

920
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:18,479
He's coming out!

921
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:20,355
Answer the phone.

922
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:27,988
- You fucking coward.
- Hi, Stu.

923
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:32,117
Now, you've had your little tantrum
and you said some things in anger...

924
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:34,411
...that I am willing to forget.

925
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:38,290
Get her back in the car!
I want her in the car.

926
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:41,293
If he's not the shooter,
then who the fuck is?

927
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:47,382
Captain, what the fuck
is up with the phone calls?

928
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,217
- So can we start over?
- You lied.

929
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:52,679
You can't know the pain of betrayal
until you've been betrayed.

930
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,640
Sniper in one of these buildings.
I want you to talk to ESU.

931
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:58,185
I want you to get one of these guys,
this building.

932
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:02,856
Start looking up there from window
to window till you find the perp. Okay?

933
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:06,985
I want you to do it quickly, and
I want you to do it quietly. All right?

934
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,530
Where's the ESU sergeant?

935
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,115
You said we could go.

936
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,451
- You said you'd let us go.
- Relax, Stuart.

937
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:16,578
Nobody gets it right the first time.

938
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:20,331
You've done better than others.
You will get a chance to end this.

939
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,959
- I'm just not finished yet.
- Yeah, well, I am.

940
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:25,336
- There's nothing keeping me.
- Besides the fear of death?

941
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,881
I dive out and you've got one shot.
I'm gonna be dancing.

942
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,551
- You think you can get me?
- I could go for some target practice.

943
00:54:31,593 --> 00:54:34,304
One shot, they look for you.
Second shot, you give yourself away.

944
00:54:34,387 --> 00:54:36,347
Go on, Stuart, hang up!

945
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:39,809
Trust your fate to friendly men in flak
jackets with automatic weapons.

946
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:44,355
I'm sure you can patch up that little
misunderstanding about the dead body.

947
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:46,899
- Cops can't prove I killed anyone.
- You had motive.

948
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,569
- No weapon.
- Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.

949
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:50,903
No gun and I walk.

950
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,989
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

951
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:57,535
Yeah? You murder a guy and you
forget where you stashed your gun?

952
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,663
Why don't you lift the
plastic ceiling panel and feel around?

953
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,251
Peekaboo!

954
00:55:10,464 --> 00:55:14,051
What's up next to the florescent bulb?
Check it out, Stu.

955
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:16,721
Cops see me reach for something,
they'll blow me away.

956
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,472
There's only one way to find out.

957
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:22,310
Look, the slugs in that dead guy,
they came from your rifle.

958
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:25,396
They're not gonna match a handgun.
I've seen enough cop shows.

959
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:28,858
Hollow points fragment on impact,
Stuart. There's nothing to match.

960
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:31,694
- Only there's no gun up there.
- Don't take my word for it.

961
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:35,990
See for yourself.
There are rounds left in it.

962
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:38,951
- I totally couldn't give a shit.
- Come on. Don't disappoint me.

963
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:42,746
Use your imagination. You'd shoot me
if you got the chance, wouldn't you?

964
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:45,958
With a big fucking smile on my face.

965
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,627
There's the spirit.

966
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:52,339
Now, what if I told you I was just
above the theater, four floors up?

967
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:55,217
See the pink curtains?

968
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:57,928
There you go, Stuart. Yes.

969
00:55:58,012 --> 00:55:59,680
Yoo-hoo!

970
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:02,391
Yoo-hoo!

971
00:56:06,228 --> 00:56:08,105
Why would you do that?

972
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:13,068
Because it's fun.
The odds are even now, Stuart.

973
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,028
Isn't that what you wanted?

974
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:17,906
You know where I am,
and you have a gun.

975
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:22,494
If you have it in you,
you can take me down.

976
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:25,873
Fuck!

977
00:56:25,998 --> 00:56:30,335
- They'd kill me before I got a shot.
- Oh, you're probably right.

978
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:31,795
I'm not really there anyway.

979
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:36,008
You would've just spoiled
some nice lady's curtains.

980
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:42,848
Looks like someone watches the news.

981
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:47,978
- Who?
- The motel.

982
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:52,816
- Oh, God.
- I think she could use a new headshot.

983
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:55,277
- Don't!
- Then take down the gun.

984
00:56:55,402 --> 00:56:59,322
- Look, this has nothing to do with her!
- She has everything to do with this.

985
00:56:59,322 --> 00:57:02,033
You're here and she's here
because you called her.

986
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:06,621
Now, take it down!
Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.

987
00:57:06,663 --> 00:57:08,999
- Take down the gun!
- Hey, everybody, get ready.

988
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:12,002
Hold on, hold on.
Let's just see what he does, all right?

989
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:13,461
Let's see what he's doing.

990
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:19,175
There's nothing there.

991
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:23,263
Nothing but your fingerprints on the
finest cop killer money can buy.

992
00:57:23,263 --> 00:57:27,392
- Come on, Stu. Let's see it.
- Fuck, no! It's staying there.

993
00:57:27,392 --> 00:57:29,644
Fine, then someone
will have to take your place.

994
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:32,147
Come on, Stu,
you're in a perfect position.

995
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:34,983
- How do you figure?
- You get to choose between them.

996
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:39,696
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose?
One of them can take your place.

997
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:41,531
Don't do this!

998
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:45,618
You've got to be more in touch with your
feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!

999
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,704
- It's true!
- But you lie to her.

1000
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:49,289
It's complicated.

1001
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:53,084
Then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart,
by removing temptation. I say Pam.

1002
00:57:53,126 --> 00:57:55,878
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault.
This is all my fault!

1003
00:57:55,962 --> 00:57:57,338
She's innocent!

1004
00:57:58,297 --> 00:58:02,885
Ticktock, ticktock.
Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.

1005
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:04,345
- You decide.
- No, please!

1006
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,265
Come on, Stu.
Don't you get the game yet?

1007
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:10,393
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.

1008
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:13,729
Blond or brunette? Time's running out.

1009
00:58:13,855 --> 00:58:17,817
You or them? Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?

1010
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:20,194
Come on, Stu!

1011
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:22,655
Stop this.

1012
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:26,117
- I can't take this anymore.
- What are you doing? Get up!

1013
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:29,036
- I was looking for my ring. Look...
- Get up, Stuart!

1014
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:33,624
Stand up and be a man.
You're embarrassing yourself.

1015
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:37,837
Captain! I got it. Listen.

1016
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:43,008
The rifleman reports subject pulled
a small, dark object out of his pocket.

1017
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:46,095
All right. You're looking at a suicide
on national fucking TV.

1018
00:58:46,137 --> 00:58:48,055
You gonna let me take this over?

1019
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:50,474
Tell everybody to hold on,
to hold their fire.

1020
00:58:50,558 --> 00:58:53,853
Everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.

1021
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:59,358
- Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me.
- You can't do this.

1022
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:03,529
Stu.
No more spinning, no more excuses.

1023
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:08,492
What're you doing? Look, listen.
Listen, please listen to me.

1024
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:09,952
No more delays, Stuart.

1025
00:59:10,077 --> 00:59:12,746
Look... I'm on my knees
begging you not to kill me.

1026
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:15,249
I will if you keep up
this pathetic spectacle.

1027
00:59:15,374 --> 00:59:17,418
Excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.

1028
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:20,087
From up in your high window,
you could kill anyone.

1029
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,132
- Yes, I know that, Stuart.
- All right, and...

1030
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,759
You could pick off any of the cops,
with your rifle.

1031
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:27,553
Shut up and stand up!

1032
00:59:27,678 --> 00:59:29,763
Look, why threaten Kelly?

1033
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:32,474
You liked how she sounded
on the phone at the store.

1034
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:35,185
Please don't hurt her.
Don't fucking hurt my wife.

1035
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:38,313
This doesn't have to end with me
shooting you. You leave no choice.

1036
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:41,358
- Now, get up!
- All right.

1037
00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:45,404
Okay, how does this end?
Tell me how this ends.

1038
00:59:45,445 --> 00:59:47,322
The stage is almost set.

1039
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:50,826
People are gonna be eating dinner
watching you die.

1040
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:54,204
We got a sniper situation here.

1041
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:56,331
What about that phone call
to your store?

1042
00:59:56,415 --> 00:59:59,668
I got a phone call this afternoon.
I think it was a prank call.

1043
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:02,546
He told me Stu would be calling me
from a phone booth.

1044
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:04,965
How long will it take
to get a record of her calls?

1045
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:08,051
If he's using that secure line,
we won't know more than now.

1046
01:00:08,093 --> 01:00:12,055
Say he didn't. Let's assume he's
a human, makes mistakes like all of us.

1047
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:15,350
I need to get that number.
I've been waiting for that number.

1048
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:18,687
It was a guy.
He sounded like mid-30's.

1049
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:22,565
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer
if you got back in the car, okay?

1050
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:24,526
- Please get back in the car.
- Thank you.

1051
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:28,363
I want you to divert incoming ESU
units to Broadway and hold them there.

1052
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:30,615
- Want me to clear the streets?
- Yeah.

1053
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:34,369
No, no, no. I don't want the sniper
to be aware of any of our movements.

1054
01:00:34,411 --> 01:00:36,121
He's already got position on us.

1055
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:38,832
Let's not let him know
we know too much, okay?

1056
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:41,543
- Hey, Jonah.
- Yeah.

1057
01:00:41,626 --> 01:00:43,253
Don't look up.

1058
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:48,466
Get me sharpshooters
looking at those windows.

1059
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,261
- You got it, captain.
- I'm gonna buy us some time here.

1060
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:52,929
All right.

1061
01:00:59,352 --> 01:01:02,605
Stu! It's okay if I come out
and talk to you for a second?

1062
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:04,565
- I don't know.
- This guy is so lonely.

1063
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:09,278
- All he wants to do is talk.
- You're walking through a bad dream...

1064
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:12,407
...and you can't wake up.
- Now he's really testing my patience.

1065
01:01:12,448 --> 01:01:14,575
You wanna wake up, Stu?

1066
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:19,872
I wanna, but I got issues
I can't talk about.

1067
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:25,086
- That your psychiatrist on the phone?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.

1068
01:01:25,086 --> 01:01:28,214
That was pretty brave what you did.

1069
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:31,634
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.

1070
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:35,346
- It was liberating, right?
- Should've been.

1071
01:01:35,388 --> 01:01:38,557
Maybe if I could be more honest
with my wife then...

1072
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:41,435
...I don't know,
something would've turned out different.

1073
01:01:41,477 --> 01:01:43,229
Oh, please.

1074
01:01:43,354 --> 01:01:47,274
- Trust is the key. You trust me, Stu?
- Get this man a seat on Oprah.

1075
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:51,362
I wanna, but I got the issues
I can't talk about.

1076
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:53,906
Yes, lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.

1077
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:56,116
Look, don't come any closer.

1078
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,953
Hey, I don't wanna cause
or make anything harder for you.

1079
01:01:59,036 --> 01:02:02,957
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the
street, you've got lives in your hands.

1080
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,335
I told you it's a private conversation.
What the fuck do you want?

1081
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:10,089
I wanna let you know that it's safe
outside the booth.

1082
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,424
- It's not.
- It's always, "Get out of the booth!"

1083
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:15,469
I like it in the fucking booth!
All right? It's my world.

1084
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:18,097
This is my booth, and
I'm not coming out. All right?

1085
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:20,099
- Never.
- We're not gonna force you out...

1086
01:02:20,516 --> 01:02:22,893
...because there could be
some miscalculation...

1087
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:26,355
...and then I would never find out
why this happened.

1088
01:02:26,897 --> 01:02:32,903
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid
that I'm gonna be standing by...

1089
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,990
...and my men are gonna shoot
some guy...

1090
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:43,622
...and when we find out what's in his
hand, once we turn over his body...

1091
01:02:43,538 --> 01:02:46,166
...and we see what he was
threatening people with...

1092
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,836
We realize that it was just
a little black Bible.

1093
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:54,174
- Or a cell phone.
- Don't push me, Stu.

1094
01:02:57,386 --> 01:02:59,137
I'm not gonna let that happen here.

1095
01:02:59,596 --> 01:03:01,848
I wanted to make a phone call.
One lousy call...

1096
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:04,101
That's enough, Stu.

1097
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:08,688
- You got some bad news on that call?
- The worst.

1098
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,816
I bet you want to jump off the edge.

1099
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,694
- I've been falling ever since.
- I'm gonna push him over the edge.

1100
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:16,363
Just say the word.

1101
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:18,073
It's time to land.

1102
01:03:18,406 --> 01:03:21,952
- When you hit bottom, you die.
- I'm your safety net.

1103
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:25,163
Oh, please, say the word.

1104
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:28,625
If I tell you what you wanna know,
you'll die too.

1105
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,960
Exactly.

1106
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:35,632
- I'm going.
- Good.

1107
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:40,887
But, Stu, we put a call out
to your lawyer.

1108
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,181
Your wife, she gave us the number.

1109
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:51,356
And I got my best men working
on bringing him down. Okay?

1110
01:03:51,814 --> 01:03:53,858
That's it. The captain gets a bullet.

1111
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:55,818
Get out of here!
Hear what I said, asshole?

1112
01:03:55,902 --> 01:04:00,240
- Get out of here, go on, now! Go!
- Enough of this sideshow, Stu.

1113
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,410
- Your sins have caught up to you.
- So this is all some religious thing?

1114
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:08,039
That explains it. Bible-crazed killer
picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.

1115
01:04:08,122 --> 01:04:10,708
- Tell me what you want, then.
- What everyone wants...

1116
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,127
...for the bad guy
to get what he deserves.

1117
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:15,463
Go for the gun.

1118
01:04:15,546 --> 01:04:17,757
- Kill myself?
- Yes.

1119
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,176
It would be a rare, unselfish act.

1120
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,558
- We got hostile action.
- Nothing is hostile until I say it is.

1121
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:30,520
- Look, I can't find it.
- Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!

1122
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:32,855
All right! Look, I found it. I got it.

1123
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:36,150
- Then let's see it. Let everyone see it.
- The cops'll kill me.

1124
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:39,946
Yes.
You're talking prime-time material now.

1125
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:41,906
- All this shit just to watch me die?
- No.

1126
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:47,495
To get you to do what's right.
If you wanna save yourself, confess.

1127
01:04:47,453 --> 01:04:50,081
- I already told Kelly everything.
- Everything?

1128
01:04:50,164 --> 01:04:53,334
No. No more excuses
and half-truths, Stuart.

1129
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:57,379
You look out into those cameras
and you bare your soul.

1130
01:04:57,379 --> 01:05:00,216
TV seems to help bring out
the worst in people.

1131
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:02,051
You should be fine.

1132
01:05:02,218 --> 01:05:05,804
- How're those techs doing? Anything?
- No, not yet. Not yet.

1133
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:10,517
We haven't found your lawyer yet,
Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?

1134
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:14,939
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.

1135
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:17,775
Come on, humble yourself
in front of your loved ones...

1136
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:22,488
...and millions of strangers and me.
It's do-or-die time.

1137
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:24,698
What, you couldn't find anyone
worse than me?

1138
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:27,951
Not a murderer or a child molester
but a publicist...

1139
01:05:27,993 --> 01:05:30,496
...who has fantasies
about pretty little actresses.

1140
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:33,373
Who spends money on Italian suits
and dry cleaning...

1141
01:05:33,415 --> 01:05:37,002
...so people think he's important.
Who doesn't waste time being nice...

1142
01:05:37,002 --> 01:05:39,421
...to people who are of no use to him.
These are my crimes?

1143
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:44,885
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.

1144
01:06:08,658 --> 01:06:11,286
I've never done anything for anybody...

1145
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:14,039
...who couldn't do something for me.
I string along...

1146
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:17,501
...a kid with promises
that I'll pay him money.

1147
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:19,711
I keep him around because he
looks up to me.

1148
01:06:19,794 --> 01:06:24,216
Adam, if you're watching, don't be
a publicist. You're too good for it.

1149
01:06:24,216 --> 01:06:30,472
I lie in person and on the phone.
I lie to my friends.

1150
01:06:30,388 --> 01:06:34,768
I lie to newspapers and magazines who
sell my lies to more and more people.

1151
01:06:34,768 --> 01:06:40,315
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies.
I should be fucking president.

1152
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:45,111
I wear all this Italian shit because
underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.

1153
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:47,864
I think I need these clothes,
and this watch.

1154
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:52,911
My $2000 watch is a fake,
and so am I.

1155
01:06:52,994 --> 01:06:56,080
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.

1156
01:06:56,164 --> 01:06:58,041
I valued this shit.

1157
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:05,548
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam.
Kelly, that's Pam.

1158
01:07:07,008 --> 01:07:09,427
- Somebody got a 20 on this Pam?
- Don't blame her.

1159
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:11,971
I never told her if I was married,
and if I did...

1160
01:07:12,013 --> 01:07:13,848
...she would've told me to go home.

1161
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:20,188
Kelly, looking at you now,
I'm ashamed of myself.

1162
01:07:21,856 --> 01:07:28,029
I mean, I work so hard on this image,
on Stu Shepard, the asshole...

1163
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:33,075
...who refers to himself in third person,
that I only proved I should be alone.

1164
01:07:33,951 --> 01:07:37,997
I've been dressing up as something
I'm not for so long...

1165
01:07:37,997 --> 01:07:41,792
...l'm so afraid you won't like what's
underneath.

1166
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:47,256
But here I am.
I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.

1167
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:51,385
I love you so fucking much.

1168
01:07:57,516 --> 01:08:03,272
I take off this ring because it only
reminds me of how I've failed you.

1169
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,275
And, I don't wanna give you up.

1170
01:08:06,317 --> 01:08:10,571
I wanna make things better,
but it may not be my choice anymore.

1171
01:08:11,238 --> 01:08:13,949
You deserve better.

1172
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:32,760
- You're not gonna let me go.
- No.

1173
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:36,764
You never were.
I know a thing about lies.

1174
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:38,849
I know a thing or two
about liars as well.

1175
01:08:38,932 --> 01:08:41,852
Then why the confession?

1176
01:08:47,733 --> 01:08:50,319
I didn't do it for you.

1177
01:08:51,945 --> 01:08:54,114
- Right there.
- Yeah, got that.

1178
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:58,410
Captain, captain. The call to his wife
originated at 2:17...

1179
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:00,871
...at a hard line from the old
Barkley Hotel.

1180
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:03,248
- You got a room?
- 604.

1181
01:09:03,582 --> 01:09:06,335
Second window from the corner.
ESU units holding.

1182
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:08,378
Bring them in from 52nd Street.

1183
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:12,090
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape,
every goddamn point of exit.

1184
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:15,093
- ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd...
- Stu!

1185
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:18,013
- Your lawyer's coming down now!
- Doors, fire escapes...

1186
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:19,473
Now!

1187
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:22,476
At least you'll die
with a clean conscience.

1188
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,062
No, you're the one that's gonna die!
Listen, you can hear them now.

1189
01:09:26,104 --> 01:09:27,856
They're coming to get you. Know why?

1190
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:30,483
- Because I sent them!
- You can't stop lying, can you?

1191
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,736
I can't stop lying?
They're coming up the stairs.

1192
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:34,654
They're coming to get you.
Look around.

1193
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,740
That room's getting smaller
every second.

1194
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:38,283
Inch by inch! You know what?

1195
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,411
It's not gonna be any bigger
than this fucking goddamn booth!

1196
01:09:41,494 --> 01:09:44,164
- They're in position, in position.
- Get them to move!

1197
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,589
- There's nobody there.
- There's nobody there?

1198
01:09:52,672 --> 01:09:55,717
They're coming through that fucking
door to put you out of your misery.

1199
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,386
You got a couple seconds left.
What're you gonna do?

1200
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:01,264
If this is true, I have to take someone
with me, don't I?

1201
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:04,934
Since Kelly is the most important thing
in your life, I'll take her.

1202
01:10:04,976 --> 01:10:07,604
Then take me! Take me.
This is about me!

1203
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:10,982
I'm the fucking one you want!
Take me!

1204
01:10:11,024 --> 01:10:13,735
This is about me! Come on!

1205
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,903
Take me! It's me you want!

1206
01:10:52,356 --> 01:10:54,692
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.

1207
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,986
We're too late.
The psycho heard us coming...

1208
01:10:57,069 --> 01:10:59,113
...and slashed his throat
with a knife.

1209
01:10:59,196 --> 01:11:02,742
- What's his condition?
- Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.

1210
01:11:02,742 --> 01:11:05,327
Get him down here.
I don't want nobody dying on me.

1211
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:06,912
All right.

1212
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,583
- Kelly, where's Kelly?
- Your wife's fine, all right?

1213
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,668
All right, try not to sit up.

1214
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,839
- What hit me?
- Rubber bullet.

1215
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:20,175
Figured if somebody's gonna
shoot you, it might as well be us.

1216
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:22,428
Thanks.

1217
01:11:22,595 --> 01:11:24,805
- Did you get him?
- You did.

1218
01:11:25,097 --> 01:11:27,766
- I didn't do anything.
- Give yourself some credit.

1219
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,437
Got yourself out alive.
Doesn't always happen that way.

1220
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,316
- Are you okay?
- It's okay. I'm okay.

1221
01:11:36,442 --> 01:11:38,777
God. I was so afraid.

1222
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,321
I thought I wasn't ever
gonna see you again.

1223
01:11:41,405 --> 01:11:43,323
Me too.

1224
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:45,075
We've got things to talk about.

1225
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:47,744
I only want to talk about
what you want to tell me.

1226
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,207
I want to tell you everything.
Everything.

1227
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,502
Get that gurney over here.
Get over here.

1228
01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:57,671
We lost him.

1229
01:11:59,798 --> 01:12:01,425
- I want to stand up.
- I got him.

1230
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,677
- Sure you can hold on?
- I gotta see him.

1231
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,971
- You don't want to see this.
- Yes, I do.

1232
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:07,806
- Take it easy.
- Yes, I do.

1233
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:11,268
- Allow me. Allow me.
- Go ahead.

1234
01:12:16,815 --> 01:12:19,401
You recognize him?

1235
01:12:19,484 --> 01:12:22,612
Yeah. He was down here trying
to deliver me a pizza...

1236
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:24,906
...10 minutes before I got the call.

1237
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,534
I told him to fuck off.

1238
01:12:27,617 --> 01:12:29,327
That's enough these days.

1239
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,877
Just give it a minute.

1240
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,254
We'll be driving,
and you'll be flying.

1241
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,756
Whatever you say.

1242
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:47,762
What a piece of shit.

1243
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,793
Nice shoes.

1244
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:25,216
Italian.

1245
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:30,263
You hung up, Stu.

1246
01:13:30,304 --> 01:13:33,099
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

1247
01:13:34,684 --> 01:13:37,645
I feel bad about the pizza guy.

1248
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:41,566
But I couldn't miss seeing
you and Kelly reunited.

1249
01:13:41,607 --> 01:13:44,694
You don't have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.

1250
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:48,531
I just hope
your newfound honesty lasts.

1251
01:13:48,573 --> 01:13:53,369
Because it if doesn't,
you'll be hearing from me.

1252
01:14:21,772 --> 01:14:23,941
Isn't it funny?

1253
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:28,654
You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody.

1254
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:33,784
But a ringing phone
has to be answered, doesn't it?

1255
01:14:35,661 --> 01:14:38,288
Doesn't it?

1256
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:03,313
Hello?

1257
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,333
[ENGLISH]
