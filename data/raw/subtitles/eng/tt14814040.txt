1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,789
[narrator] Have you ever wanted
to be noticed so badly,

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,624
you didn't even care what it was for?

3
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:55,389
You just wake up every day thinking,
"I want to be seen."

4
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,397
To be completely honest, Danni Sanders
might actually be the worst person

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,857
we've ever covered on this show,
and we covered Hitler.

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,902
[Danni] I wanna be important.

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,006
[contributor] Okay, guys. Today,
we're talking about white privilege.

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,157
So you know
we need to talk about Danni Sanders.

9
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,826
…acting like she was the victim.

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,745
I think that
that turned a lot of people off to her.

11
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,206
[Danni] I wanna have purpose.

12
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,293
So I was just gonna bleach the front bits,

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,878
but I'm really not trying to get mistaken
for Danni Sanders.

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,339
[Danni] I wanna be known.

15
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,682
I wanna be loved.

16
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,149
[presenter 1] And the award
for Most-Anticipated Death…

17
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,877
- [presenter 2] Danni Sanders!
- I can't wait for her to kick the bucket.

18
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,421
- [presenter 2] Don't...
- In fact, I'll do it for you.

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,880
- [mimics gunshot]
- That's a little far.

20
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,698
I'm not gonna go that far. It's a fine.

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,991
Not for me. I own guns.

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,827
[Danni] I wanna matter.

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,463

24
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,716

[clears throat]

32
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,193
- Danni.
- Yeah?

33
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,487
Had a chance to read
that article you sent me.

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,988
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,072
What did you think?

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,408
Well, you've titled it, "Why am I so sad?"

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,701
That's just a working title.

38
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,287
"In a world surrounded by those
who seem to have it all,

39
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,248
I've settled on a few reasons
for my own feelings of emptiness.

40
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,085
The first is that
I currently live in Bushwick."

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,754
J-Train Bushwick.
L-Train Bushwick would be fine.

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,840
Just, like, somewhere you can get
a decent match a, you know?

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:58,387
"Reason number two,
my lack of a private office at work."

44
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,848
Open-concept spaces
really drown out my inner voice.

45
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,850
Finally,
and this one really stuck with me.

46
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,268
Okay.

47
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,104
"Missing 9/11."

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,230
Yeah.

49
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,817
I was on a cruise with my parents
when it happened.

50
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:18,824
In general, I think we try to avoid
expressing any kind of FOMO about 9/11.

51
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,576
[sighs]
Did you read that article on The Cut?

52
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,245
The one...

53
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,290
It talked about how it was the single
most formative trauma experience

54
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,375
for "zillennials."

55
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,085
And since I wasn't there,

56
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,337
I didn't get to share that bond
with my peers.

57
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,464
You know, like,
I didn't even know anyone that died.

58
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,428
Okay. And you don't feel like it comes off
a little tone-deaf? Offensive even.

59
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,055
- Can't tone-deaf be, like, a brand though?
- Oh, no.

60
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,100
- Isn't that what Lena Dunham does?
- You don't wanna be like Lena Dunham.

61
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,728
I don't feel like
you take me seriously as a writer.

62
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:53,191
That's because you're not a writer.
You're a photo editor.

63
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,277
One who's very late on their deadlines.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,196
Deadlines that should take priority
over personal goals.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,574
I've just been having
a difficult time focusing lately.

66
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,661
And I've been having a difficult time
ending this conversation. And we're done.

67
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,746
Okay.

68
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,040
Gonna load up
the Head space app after that.

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,252
- Hi, Harper.
- Interesting article pitch.

70
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,378
Thanks.

71
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,340
Hey, Susan,
I just uploaded the new draft for Tuesday.

72
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,136
Thank you. Oh, and great work
on that RBG retrospective.

00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,406
I can't believe you got that quote
from her personal trainer.

74
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,599
Thank you.
I was thinking of using it as my sample

75
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,517
to apply for a couple writers' retreats.

76
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,395
[Susan] Oh, a retreat.
Yeah, you would be a shoo-in.

- Not with those nails.

Yeah, I can't take a pic right now, but...

No, no, no. Danni, from work.

148

- Danni. Yeah. What's good?
- What are you doing here?

149
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,142
- Do you live in Bushwick?
- Me? No. Fuck no.

150
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,644
- I'm so...
- No. No, I'd never live here.

like, all the time.

00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,597
- A little.
- Harold, what?

337
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,724
What's the name
of that colleague of yours? The ENT?

338
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,435
- Richard?
- No, no, no. Mom. They're gonna be fine.

339
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,519
- I'm calling Helen.
- No.

340
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,230
Yeah. Her husband's cousin
was at the Boston bombing.

341
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,150
Well, he was at least
in Boston at the time.

342
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,903
Actually, I think he used to go
to a support group.

343
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,571
That'd be good for you, emotionally.

344
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,740
- Peanut.
- Yeah?

345
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,409
Wanna make things
a little bit easier for you.

346
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,454
- Just any way I can.
- Thank you.

347
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,001
Feels like Christmas.

348
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:38,339
We might not have ever had
another Christmas together.

349
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,818
- I just wanted to say good night.
- Okay. Night.

350
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,613
Love you.

351
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,036
I love you too.

352
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,582
I know I haven't said this
as much as I should,

353
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,586
but I just want you to know
I'm so proud of you.

354
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,256
[Harold] Me too, Peanut.

355
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,594
So…

356
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,722
Sweet dreams.

357
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,441

358
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,991

["Bonnie and Clyde (Akse Remix)" playing]

360
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,503
[tourists chattering]

361
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,842
[sighs]

362
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,349
[Danni chuckles]

[violin playing "La Marseillaise"]

364
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,824
Starting my morning right.
Now, where's my baguette? Baguette emoji.

365
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,368

366
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,550

[explosion]

368
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,125
Danni.

369
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,586
I have to be honest.
I don't even know what to say.

370
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,338
What?

371
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,590
I can't even fathom
what you've been through.

372
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,510
And I don't want you to feel pressure
to come back to work right away.

373
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,846
No, really. I wanna be here.

374
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,724
If you're sure, but you set the pace.

375
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,520
If you need to leave early,
take a mental health day,

376
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,814
you don't even have to ask, just go.

377
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,066
- I will.
- And, Danni...

378
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,944
I know we've had our conflicts.

379
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,114
And I'm so sorry
I was ever gonna fire you.

380
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,657
But I want you to know,

381
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,344
- the fact that you're standing right here…
- You were gonna fire me?

382
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,663
…In front of me instead of being
curled up in a ball somewhere,

383
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,291
mainlining gummy worms,
which is what I would have been doing,

384
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,086
that's incredible.

385
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,338
You are so strong.

386
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,550
Isn't she so strong, everybody?

387
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,593
- [colleague] Yeah.
- [Susan] Mm-hmm.

388
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,220
Yeah.

389
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,473
You go, girl! You go, woman.

390
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,935
[chuckles] Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

391
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,396
Mmm. It means the world.

392
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,524
- [chuckles]
- Okay, good.

393
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,777
Let me know if there's anything else
I can do. Anything at all.

394
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,029
- Okay.
- Okay.

395
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,329
Actually.

396
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,333
I was thinking, um…

397
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,089
Maybe writing a piece about my experience,

398
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,218
it... it might help me
work through the pain.

399
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:57,973
Of course. Depravity would be honored
to give you a platform.

400
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,641
All right.

401
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,274
[sighs]

402
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,027
So, it was a totally normal day at first.

403
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,571
It was sunny. It was clear.

404
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,033
I was at the Arc having
a cute little, quiet morning to myself,

405
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,368
before I went to breakfast
with the other writers.

406
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,206
And I don't know.

407
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,251
I saw this weird guy in this big jacket.

408
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,881
Then suddenly,
I was hit with this feeling.

409
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,802
Like something horrible was gonna happen.

410
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:35,969
Oh, Jesus.

411
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,763
I knew I needed to leave.

412
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,476
So I turned around to go,
and as I was walking away,

413
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,811
- boom!
- [all gasp]

414
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,771
That's when it hit.

415
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,442
So you're a psychic.
Like the Lady of Galadhrim.

416
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,402
Or it was God.

417
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,656
Excuse me.
This is a non-denominational workspace.

418
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,990
Well, I didn't say which god.

419
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,784
- Didn't you?
- Whoa. Whoa.

420
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,915
My bad. [chuckles]
It's just my ears are still ringing.

421
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,708
Because of the terrorists?

422
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,418
[Colin] Yo, Danni.

423
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,713
Come here for a sec.

424
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,424
Yes. Co... I come.

425
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,178
Danni, um…

426
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,640
We just wanted to invite you
to queer bowling.

427
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,475
- Aw!
- Like, if you wanted to come.

428
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,978
- Everybody's a little bit gay. Right?
- [chuckles]

429
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,146
Aren't we?

430
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,816
I have to...

431
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,945
Sorry. I was just... just chatting
with my gay friends.

432
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,614
Wow.

433
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,450
I, uh… I got you this.

434
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,955
You know, for, like, a feel-better gift.

435
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,624
It's a joint.

436
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,835
Thank you.

437
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,045
I'm really glad you're not dead.

438
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,340
Me too.

439
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,429
[chuckles] Ha.

440
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,270
[Danni] My name is Danni Sanders,
and on April 10th, I almost died,

441
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,023
but something, or someone, saved me.

442
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,611
Maybe it was a guardian angel,
or God, or Alan Rick man's ghost,

443
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,574
but I don't think that I believe
in any of that.

444
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,283
More likely, it was me who saved me.

445
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,636
Not that I believe in myself either.

446
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,413
But if all of this
has taught me something…

447
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,081
[chuckles]

448
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,625
…it's that maybe I should.

449
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,544
Oh, my God.

450
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,965
This is me. Exclamation mark.

451
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,136
[intermittent buzzing]

452
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,139
[ghostly voice] Neuf.

453
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,534
[phone vibrates repeatedly]

454
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:09,790
- I will never forget what I saw that day.
- [guinea pig squeaks]

455
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,213
What did I see that day?

456
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,094
Okay. Survivor of bombing.

457
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,514
Ew.

458
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,598
Oh, my God.

459
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,523
That's good. That's a good idea.

460
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,905
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom. Hi, Mom.

461
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,532
- How are you, Danni?
- Hi, Mom. Yeah.

462
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,409
- No, I just had a quick question.
- Uh-huh?

463
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,493
What...

464
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,997
Do you remember what the name
of the support group is

465
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,790
that Helen's husband used to go to?

466
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,143
[survivor 1] …and the sounds were coming,
like, 30 seconds apart.

467
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,187
I'm sure it was just
a wheel on the tracks.

468
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,982
Everyone else was just, you know, annoyed.

469
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,068
I physically started shaking.

470
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,364
I got off the train.
I just walked uptown from Canal.

471
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,951
I mean, I felt like such an idiot.
And I was late.

472
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,663
- I was not getting back on that train.
- [chuckles]

473
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,707
[leader]
Loud noises can be very triggering.

474
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,141
I think a lot of us struggled with that.

475
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,629
[survivor 2] I make my kids mute
the TV when they're gaming.

476
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,759
They hate it.
But I can't get any work done

477
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,179
when I'm hearing gunfire
or... or explosions.

478
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,056
You let your kids play those?

479
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,435
You don't think that's normalizing
a culture that glorifies gun violence?

480
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,396
Okay, why don't we all just take a second

481
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,983
and welcome our new addition.

482
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,569
Hi.

483
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,279
Hi.

484
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,490
- [leader] What's your name?
- Danni.

485
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,413
I was in Paris last week
when the bombings hit at the Arc.

486
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,460
Oh. I am so sorry. Do you...

487
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:25,133
Do you wanna share anything about how
you're... you're feeling, or your thoughts?

488
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,511
Oh. [chuckles]

489
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,516
I was just hoping to listen today.

490
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,769
Of course. Of course, Danni.
In your own time.

491
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,730
We're all survivors here.

492
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,567
Charles, why don't you speak for a bit?

493
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,405
Charles is one of our newer members.

494
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,241
He just returned from the UK.

495
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,244
He's also a bombing survivor.

496
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,204
He was at the Ariana Grande concert.

497
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,418
Look, it's not easy…

498
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,711
Okay?

499
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,923
I mean, it's been years for me,

500
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,384
and I still have to talk
about it every week.

501
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,682
I'm sorry. That's not comforting. Um…

502
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,268
It's not like...

503
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,564
Your life doesn't end. Okay?

504
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,026
I know that it probably feels
like that right now.

505
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,654
It's just…

506
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,241
Everything changes colors.

507
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes. That's... Exactly.

508
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,415
I never would have thought
to put it like that.

509
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,043
What is it for you?

510
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,839
Maybe purple.

511
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,592
What's yours?

512
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,054
Red.

513
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,850
It's like everything is red forever.

514
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,772
And on one hand,
it's really vivid and intense.

515
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,861
But on the other,
everything feels completely…

516
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,239
Monochrome.

517
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:14,951
You relate to that, Danni?

518
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,997
I just...

519
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,918
Sort of understand the monochrome bit.

520
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,922
That's how everything is for me too.
But mine's like…

521
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,051
Gray all the time.

522
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,931
And how does it feel
when the world looks that way to you?

523
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,433
I don't know.

524
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,810
Doesn't really feel like anything.

525
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,773
Just sort of numb.

526
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,613
Ugh.

527
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,782
[chuckles]

528
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,743
See you next week.

529
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,579
Yeah. I will 100% be back.

530
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,374
Rowan, I am so sorry to do this to you,

531
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,626
but my daughter is such
a huge fan of yours.

532
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,754
Would you mind taking a quick photo
with me for her?

533
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,466
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks. I really appreciate it.

534
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,097
Where's my ChapStick? Maybe I dropped it.

535
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,598
Oh!

536
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,768
You guys almost forgot this last chair.

537
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,396
- Here.
- Oh, you're so sweet. [chuckles]

538
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,605
So, um…

539
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,193
I'm Danni, by the way. Danni Sanders.

540
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,780
- Rowan. Welcome to group.
- Thanks.

541
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,785
Thanks for sharing today.
I know the first meeting can be hard.

542
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:44,624
Do you guys do, like,
post-group coffee or…

543
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,960
Actually I have to run
to this school rehearsal thing.

544
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,396
- No worries, no worries.
- Next time.

545
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

546
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,423
Maybe we can swap Insta handles
or numbers?

547
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,966
Sure. Yeah.

548
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,718
Okay. Yeah.

549
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,642
Here. Just text me anytime, okay?

550
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,810
Oh, thank you.

551
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,187
Bye. I'll talk to you later.

552
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,897
- See ya, Charles.
- [Charles] See ya.

553
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,533
I'm actually free right now
if you wanna go grab that coffee.

554
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,119
Oh, gosh.

555
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,248
I forgot I have this thing
that I have to do. So…

556
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,875
Yeah. Okay.

557
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,836
Cool. Hey, did you want my Insta handle?

558
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,546
Uh…

559
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,634
It's "godisawomanmann."
Two Ns. "Godisawomanmann."

560
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,718
[Danni] Okay.

561
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,332
[contributor]
Today we're talking about Rowan Aldren,

562
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:54,069
a teen gun-safety activist,
poet and social influencer.

563
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,547
After surviving the Oak Valley
school shooting in North Carolina,

564
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,658
Rowan came to New York to partner
with the We've Had Enough organization

565
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,662
to begin her fight for gun reform.
Here's a look.

566
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,788
[Rowan] Two miles.

567
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,042
You can be two miles from a gunshot
and still hear it.

568
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,504
That day,
even if you were nowhere near it,

569
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,924
I swear, you heard those bullets
loud enough to fear 'em.

570
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,386
Two miles.

571
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,515
But the 23 at my school
carried much farther.

572
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,394
Maybe that's just how it sounds
when a child dies a martyr.

573
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,147
And yet, it was quiet.

574
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,775
Quieter than it should have been.

575
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,821
We needed a riot
and all we got was a funeral hymn.

576
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,324
And someone saying, "Hey,
couldn't one of you have tackled him?"

577
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,247
Two miles. And yet not a word.

578
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:52,794
I look up at the people in power
and ask how thick are your walls

579
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,088
that you can't hear what I heard?

580
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:01,010
Well, here, behind our walls,
our lives were taken turn by turn.

581
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,640
Have we earned your sympathy yet, sir?

582
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,770
There is more than one person at fault
for what happened to us.

583
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,983
There is more than one person
who pulled the trigger on that gun.

584
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
And I have had enough.

585
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,362
Enough pain. Enough corruption.

586
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,489
Enough death. Enough destruction.

587
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,493
Enough sleepless nights,
still watching my friends die.

588
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,206
Enough of listening
to our politicians lie.

589
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,374
Enough!

590
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,084
[crowd cheering]

591
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,136
[Danni] Hey.

592
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,766
- Hey.
- That is such a cute hairpin. I'm dead.

593
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,603
- Oh, thank you. I made it myself.
- Cool.

594
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,397
- So... No, you.
- So...

595
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,167
I was just gonna say thank you
for meeting me.

596
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,984
Yeah, of course. Of course.

597
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,279
How are you... How are you doing?

598
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,614
I'm good. Yeah.

599
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,034
- I mean, I'm managing, I guess. Yeah. But…
- Yes.

600
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,705
Do you have family around?
You know, like, in New York?

601
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,875
Yeah. My dad cries
whenever he sees me now though.

602
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,544
And my mom keeps shipping me

603
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,088
wellness supplements
that she reads about on goop.

604
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:24,260
Okay, um, well, what about your friends?

605
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,223
I mean, I'm seeing you, right?

606
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,809
Right.

607
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:32,977
So, you know…

608
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,990
Hey, are you... are you cool
if we, maybe, walk somewhere?

609
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,076
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

610
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,911
[Danni] That's a good idea.

611
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,484
[Rowan] I'm glad you reached out.

612
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,794
It's gonna be great to have someone
in group who's not, like, 50.

613
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,047
Oh, that's... No, I'm...
I don't think I'll...

614
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,843
That was just, like,
a onetime thing for me. But...

615
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,886
The support group? Why?

616
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,391
I don't know.
Therapy never really worked for me.

617
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,605
It's not therapy, okay?
It's better. It's... It's family.

618
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,528
Besides, I mean, who's gonna help me
explain TikTok references to the boomers?

619
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,614
Is TikTok a... Is it a topic
that comes up a lot in meetings?

620
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,700
- Oh, you would be surprised.
- [chuckles]

621
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:34,581
So, listen. I was kinda hoping I might
be able to get your advice on something.

622
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,500
Full disclosure, I stalked you online.

623
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,546
That poetry you do, it's crazy.
It sounds just like Hamilton.

624
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,883
Yeah, it's... it's called spoken word.

625
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,801
Cool, cool, cool. I'm a writer too.

626
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:47,886
Oh, cool.

627
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,013
Yeah. And I actually have
this article due right now

628
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,576
for the magazine that I'm working at.

629
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,433
And I feel really stuck.

630
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,893
Like, I just...

631
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,688
I don't know if you could
give me any tips, or…

632
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,440
It's about what happened?

633
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,567
And I brought my laptop.

634
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,487
I don't know. We could hole up
at one of those little writer-y cafés.

635
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,655
You could be my coach.

636
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,325
- Sure.
- Thank you. Okay.

637
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,828
You know, actually,
I wanted to take you here first.

638
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,331
I think it could be super helpful.

639
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,375
Before you write, you have to deal with
why you're feeling stuck.

640
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,504
- Oh, okay, so... And then we'll go write?
- Yeah. Come on.

641
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,589
Okay.

642
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,259
What is this place?

643
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,595
[Rowan]
How do you feel about breaking things?

644
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,515
Fuck the Senate for not passing
that background check bill last week.

645
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,435
[panting]

646
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,561
Now you try.

647
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,481
Oh. Um…

648
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,316
Okay.

649
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,781
Fuck the bombing in Paris.

650
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,617
No, you're not mad enough, okay?
You have to feel it.

651
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:58,456
Okay. What if I don't...
What if I don't feel angry?

652
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,459
All right, then what do you feel?

653
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,462
Well, I don't know. [scoffs]

654
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,884
Numb.

655
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,052
Still numb.

656
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,598
Use that. Smash the numbness.

657
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,978
[whispers] Smash the numbness.

658
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,442
Good. Again.

659
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,155
Yes. Okay, you feel that?
Keep going. Let it out!

660
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,243
That's it. Let it out.
Yell if you want to.

661
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,287
Fuck you.

662
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,463
[Danni laughs]

663
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,220
[breathes heavily]

664
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:05,356
Look, what you asked before...
That is how I write.

665
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,692
You have to attack it.

666
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,862
That is what's gonna make
people pay attention. Okay?

667
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,573
No more scrolling past headlines.
No more distractions.

668
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,993
We do that with our truth.

669
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,456
If you're not okay, that's okay.

670
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,043
You know as... as fucked up as it sounds,

671
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,212
your pain is your biggest asset.

672
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,051
[grunts]

673
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,722
Yeah.

674
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,686
[panting]

675
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,944
Oh, my God.

676
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,989
Okay.

677
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,786
I'll never forget what I saw that day.

678
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,039
But the truth is,
you don't need to hear it.

679
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,333
All you need to know is…

680
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,170
I am not okay.

681
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,591
What happened in Paris changed me.

682
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:18,346
But what I've realized since
is that my pain can actually be an asset.

683
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,807
It can stop you all
from scrolling past headlines,

684
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,103
distracting yourselves with baby goats
and SHEIN ads and ASMR videos.

685
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,646
It can make you pay attention

686
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,733
and, in turn, truly ask yourselves,
"Am I okay?"

687
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,527
Am I okay?

688
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,906
[Danni] Now, my own sadness, my anger...
They may stem from something

689
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,784
more traumatic
than you'll ever experience,

690
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:43,121
but that doesn't mean
your pain isn't just as real.

691
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,205
Yo.

692
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,666
[Danni] It doesn't mean
you're not waking up every day

693
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,502
feeling numb and useless and alone.

694
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,838
I think a lot of us are.

695
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,923
So I wanna invite you.

696
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:58,177
Take this opportunity to share your truth,
share your pain.

697
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,472
You've got nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

698
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,849
Let's make the world wake up

699
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,351
and pay attention
to the fact that we're all hurting,

700
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,937
and it's time to stop being so afraid.

701
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,940
We Stan a fearless queen.

702
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,569
- Hey, Danni. Booch?
- Sure.

703
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,445
Oh, my God. Cheers.

704
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,364
Cheers.

705
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,616
[colleagues chuckle]

706
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,495
So as BLM and Me Too came before us,

707
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:31,460
let us usher in a new era of honesty
on the Internet. #I Am Not Okay.

[school PA] This is a lockdown drill.

710
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,968
All students and teachers
please follow lockdown procedure.

711
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,900
[Danni] Here's the article.
It would mean a lot if you reposted.

712
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,735
Couldn't have written it without you.

713
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,737
Dancing girls emoji,
sparkling heart emoji.

714
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,537
[Rowan] Congrats, @TheDanniSanders.

715
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,833
If you haven't read her article yet,
it's up on Depravity right now.

716
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,382
#I Am Not Okay.

717
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,490
[Maddy] I feel empty all the time.

718
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,301
[Hana] I can't sleep
because our planet is fucked.

719

[overlapping voices reading posts]

720
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,371
- I am not okay.
- I am not okay.

721
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,081
I am not okay.

722
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,458
We are not okay.

723
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,377
[multiple voices] #I Am Not Okay.

724
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,424
Danni, you had a big week.

725
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,550
[Danni chuckles]

726
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,636
Do you wanna talk a little

727
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,973
about how it felt
to publish such a personal piece?

728
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,350
Uh…

729
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,018
Honestly…

730
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,190
It's been amazing.

731
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,611
It's just so freeing
to finally admit that I am not okay.

732
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,032
And it's so crazy
to see all these celebrities

733
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,703
using my hashtag
to talk about their trauma.

734
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,663
Did you see Kendall Jenner's post?

735
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,123
- You did?
- Oh, yeah.

736
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,959
I had no idea
that she was so discriminated against.

737
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,296
You always hear these horror stories

738
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,299
of people in the spotlight
getting all this hate, but I don't know.

739
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,009
Doesn't seem to be happening to me.

740
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,680
Well,
you should still be prepared if it does.

741
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,851
I think what Rowan is trying to say is,

742
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:57,231
some people on the Internet just
aren't as nice as we'd like them to be.

743
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,901
I think I can handle, like,
one troll on Twitter.

744
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,031
I've been through a lot worse, right?

745
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,159
Right. Yeah, of course.

746
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,417
So, wait. Did I hear you guys were doing,
like, a kickball game on Saturday?

747
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,504
Yeah. It's kind of the best time.
You should come.

748
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,548
Yeah, sure. I'm down.

749
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:27,803
You know, I owe you a major,
major thank you for posting my article.

750
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,890
You're one of the main reasons
that it blew up.

751
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,475
I mean, you and Kendall.

752
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,602
No, I'm... I'm happy to help.

753
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,190
And listen, I didn't... I didn't mean
to sound pessimistic or anything in group.

754
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,941
- I just... I...
- Oh, no.

755
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,570
I know the Internet likes
to turn victims into villains sometimes.

756
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,366
And I am an expert at blocking,
so I am here if you need me.

757
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,450
Thank you.

758
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,497
So, what are these mysterious rehearsals
you're always walking to?

759
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,041
Oh, uh, this thing called Act Up
at my school.

760
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,334
It's, um...

761
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,257
Well, they call it a talent show
for the most talented kids in New York.

762
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,214
No pressure or anything.

763
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,133
No pressure? Rowan,
you're literally the most talented person

764
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,803
- that I have ever met in my entire... Yes.
- Oh, my God. No.

765
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,222
- What do you mean, "no"?
- It's a lot to juggle, okay?

766
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,433
It's... I've got another rally
coming up next week,

767
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,894
- and I always get so anxious.
- Really?

768
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,479
I have really bad stage fright.

769
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,939
- I don't believe that.
- No, I do.

770
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,359
I mean, back at Oak Valley,
Cora, my sister...

771
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,570
She literally had to, like,
hype me up before every book report.

772
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,947
That's cute.

773
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,991
Yeah. She would, like,
blast cheesy oldies music in her car.

774
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,994
- Like, dad tunes?
- Yeah. Like, Avril Lavigne.

775
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,914
Did you just say
that Avril Lavigne is oldies?

776
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,127
I can't. I didn't know you had a sister.

777
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,295
- She older or younger?
- I'm right here.

778
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,922
She's... She's older.

779
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,050
You're so lucky.

780
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:52,096
I've always wanted a sister.
Being an only child is so boring.

781
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,391
Does she, like, sneak you beers
and all that fun stuff?

782
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,353
Uh, no. Actually, she's, um…

783
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,191
She... She died in the shooting.

784
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,699
Shit.

785
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,412
I'm gonna... I'll see you later.

- Damn.
- You can clap.

791
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,358
That's an appropriate response.

792
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,152
Thanks, everyone.

Who's there? It's me.

795
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:57,411
Um, I just wanted to say that, um,
your article gave me the courage

796
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,389
- to finally speak up to my DnD Discord.
- [phone vibrates]

797
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,416
I told them about my trypophobia.

798
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,002
It means I have a fear of small holes.

799
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:09,048
Um, like this cookie is terrifying to me,

800
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:13,052
but you've given me the strength
to eat the cookie.

801

Hey. Yo, Kevin.
Mind if I steal Danni for a sec?

802

It's Kelvin. It's like the base unit
of thermodynamic temperature.

- Hi, Colin.

All right, so listen. This...

809
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,911

It's like a party.

If you can get...
If you can get me on that list.

Yeah, I'll get you on that.

I'll send you the deets.
DM me your number.

- Okay.
- All right, late.

Bye.

819
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,021
So, I guess
you're officially a writer now.

820
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,023
Hmm, I guess so.

821
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,776
Did I, uh, hear you're getting an office?

822
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,404
Well, Susan just told me. Crazy, right?

823
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,657
- That is... That is crazy.
- Let me go talk to her.

824
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,325
You know, I meant to ask you.

825
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,120
What was the name of that retreat
that you went on?

826
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,204
L'Esprit Nouveau.

827
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,141
Cool. Where'd you hear about it?
I've been looking for journalism programs.

828
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,205
I just haven't really found one
that's right for me.

829
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,022
I read this article. It was like,
I don't know, I can't remember exactly,

830
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,592
"Top Ten Famous Writers' Retreats"
or something, you know.

831
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,968
- Well, yeah. Super easy.
- Yeah.

832
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,555
It was honestly so beautiful.
So, so beautiful.

833
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,808
Before, you know, it all went down.

834
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,892
Right, right.

Oh, nice. Which one?

837
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,859
Which cathedral?

838
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,863
Notre-Dame.

it... it was obviously
a really awesome opportunity,

but mainly I'm just so happy to be alive.

[Danni] Firecrackers!

1187

They're firecrackers!
They're firecrackers!

1188
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,452
Fucking snowflakes!

1189
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,829
[Danni] Check it out, it's okay!

1190
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,831
[officer] Move out, come on. Let's go.

1191
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,000
Rowan? What's happening?

1192
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,169
It's okay, Rowan.

1193
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,547
Rowan, it's okay. It's just firecrackers.

1194
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,631
Can you do something?

1195
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,133
Rowan.

1196
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,426
Stop taking photos!

1197
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,510
Rowan?

1198
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,805
Can you tell us what's happening?

1199
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,812
[reporter] Is the movement over?

1200
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:21,689

[Sean] Apparently, the brand
of firecracker was "Truth Bomb."

1204
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,100
- Gets the libs every time.
- [Gregory] Rowan Aldren is a pussy.

1205
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,417
So much for "bravery."

1206
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,896
[Ron] The libtards have a leader
as weak and stupid as they are.

1207
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,440
[Red Wave] LOLOL. Guess we don't
even need guns to win boogaloo.

1208
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,883
Just throw firecrackers
and the snowflakes will surrender.

1209
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,320
[Matthew] Rowan Aldren clearly faked
being in a school shooting

1210
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,804

[footsteps approaching]

01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,607
Hi.

1213

Hey.

Hey.

Liquid Valium.

1217
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,596
Brought you some hot cocoa.
I'll bring it to you.

1218

No mini marshmallows.

- Thanks.

1220
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,527
Well, that was embarrassing.

Stop. It wasn't.

1222
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,451
You don't have to... I know I fucked up.

1223
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,179
I know no one's gonna
take me seriously anymore.

1224
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,205
Rowan, that is... that is not true.

1225
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,290
I am supposed to be setting an example,

1226
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,085
but I couldn't, and I just...

1227
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,297
I feel so weak.

[sobs]

1229

And if I'm weak,
then that just weakens what I stand for.

1230
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,975
And everything, everyone I fought for,

1231

- Ro.

crucify me for this.

Look at you.

1234
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,778
You need to...
Remember what you said to me? You...

1235
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:36,323
That the Internet loves
to turn villains into victims.

- No, no.

for being there today.

About Paris.

I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

1304

Remember your first day back at work?

1305
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:34,311
You talked about how sunny and clear
it was all morning before the bombings.

1306
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,232
Well, I remembered reading
it was raining right before the attacks.

1307
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:39,984
That's weird, right?

1308

for your brilliant article,

1312
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,705
you said you went and toured Notre-Dame.

1313
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,374
Which I found odd,

1314
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,794
considering it's been closed to the public
since half of it burned down.

1315

Okay.

1316
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,715

about writing, except yours.

does nobody fact-check anything anymore?

Uh, no. I'm not done.

But I didn't have proof. Until I saw this.

You went through my computer?
Why would you do that?

1326
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:34,288
You know what? Because I didn't like you.
I never trusted you.

1327
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,333
The way you acted when you came back
from Paris was sus as hell.

1328
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,561
And yeah, I was probably jealous
that you got an office.

1329
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,961
But you know what I didn't do?

1330
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:45,007
Lie about being in a fucking
terrorist attack to get one for myself.

1331
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,652
I didn't know. How was I supposed to know
that there was going to be a...

1332
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,637
I just was lying about a trip,
that was it, to get Colin's attention.

1333
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,264
So what? You thought this was better

1334
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,808
than admitting you lied
in a couple of Instagram stories?

1335
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,978
I don't know. I don't know. I just...

1342
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,758
I'm gonna give you two options here.

1343
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,219
You can either wait for me
to write an article exposing you,

01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,679
which would be really good for my career…

1345
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,018
Or I will give you the opportunity
to tell everyone yourself.

I don't...

to make your decision.

1357

there's nothing that will make

1527
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,027
Why do people like you get movies
on Netflix and Hulu,

1528
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:44,614
and people like me get told
to sit tight and wait for change?

1529
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,659
No, you don't know what that's like!
You can't take the mic!

1530
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:50,870
This is my time slot.
One more minute, right?

1531
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:52,664
[scattered whoops and cheers]

1532
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,123
[clapping]

1533
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,128
I have had everything stolen from me.

1534
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:02,048
Their breath, stolen.

1535
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:06,761
My breath, perpetually holding, wondering
if someone near me might be holding...

1536
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,764
I'm sorry.

1537
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,182
Is my trauma showing?

1538
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:14,018
Because I don't plan
on slowing or sitting down.

1539
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:17,730
This is my time to take back the words
that you stole from my mouth.

1540
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:21,276
You have never seen anything destroyed
except yourself!

1541
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,238
And that is of your own doing.

1542
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:33,246
So hell no. I am not okay.

1543
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,752
I think about her every single day.

1544
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:48,303
You know when the newspapers wrote
about my sister,

1545
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,929
they misspelled her name?

1546
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,935
And now you think her place
is something you can claim?

1547
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,442
Her body is in the ground,
and you think you're the same?

1548
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:13,244
I hope you realize that by doing this,
you've only given me more to say.

1549
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,915
So maybe one day I'll forgive you…

1550
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,086
But we will never be okay.

1551
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:28,051
[applause]

1552
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:46,736
Yes!

1553
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:48,696
Yes!

1554
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,133
You did that. You did it.

1555
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,612
