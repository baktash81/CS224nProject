1
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,260
<i>Welcome back to the 1958 World Cup</i>

2
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:25,595
<i>the greatest sporting event
on Earth.</i>

3
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:28,298
<i>We are live in Gothenburg,
only moments away from</i>

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,634
<i>the start of the final match
of Group 4</i>

5
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:33,537
<i>Brazil versus the Soviet Union.</i>

6
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,438
<i>- It's so much more
than just a game for Brazil.</i>

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,741
<i>And with all their losses
in the last decade</i>

8
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,577
<i>the country's spirit
has been just crushed.</i>

9
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,346
<i>We've even seen some Brazilian
fans committing suicide</i>

10
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:46,016
<i>by jumping from the upper
tiers of the stadium.</i>

11
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,752
<i>- But let's be honest,
the Soviets are the reigning</i>

12
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:51,354
<i>Olympic champions
and Brazil, I mean</i>

13
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,089
<i>Brazil should be counting
their blessings</i>

14
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,925
<i>they even qualified
for the World Cup.</i>

15
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,826
<i>- Brazilians are about
to enter a stadium</i>

16
00:00:56,828 --> 00:00:59,362
<i>filled with Europeans
all rooting against them.</i>

17
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:00,797
<i>They don't stand a chance.</i>

18
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,532
<i>They're young,
they're unorthodox</i>

19
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,634
<i>they got no discipline, and
they're mixed race to boot.</i>

20
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,904
<i>- It's just sad really and now
with all their player injuries</i>

21
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:10,707
<i>they are forced to play
a 17-year-old reserve.</i>

22
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,809
<i>You almost have
to feel sorry for Brazil.</i>

23
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:15,645
- <i>Lack of confidence has been a
real problem for the Brazilians</i>

24
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:18,348
<i>and starting a 17-year-old
is hardly the answer.</i>

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,650
<i>In fact, reports
from the locker room say</i>

26
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,952
<i>the teenager was sick
to his stomach</i>

27
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:23,587
<i>upon learning
he would be starting.</i>

28
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,222
<i>Not exactly the confidence
boost Brazil was hoping for.</i>

29
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,125
<i>- The 1958 World Cup in Sweden.</i>

30
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:31,995
<i>It's Brazil versus
the Soviet Union,</i>

31
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:36,266
<i>the World Cup debut for
17-year-old Edson Nascimento</i>

32
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,002
<i>the youngest player to ever
play in the tournament.</i>

33
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,772
<i>And Ullevi Stadium
is absolutely booming</i>

34
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:45,141
<i>50,000 screaming fans.</i>

35
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:47,911
<i>Millions more tuning in
from around the world.</i>

36
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:51,214
<i>In only a few moments, it
will be up to this youngster</i>

37
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>and his South American
brothers to keep</i>

38
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:56,519
<i>their nation's hopes
and dreams alive.</i>

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,328
-<i> Today, July 16th, 1950</i>

40
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,864
<i>perhaps the most important day
in our lifetimes</i>

41
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,533
<i>for only in a few hours' time,
11 of Brazil's</i>

42
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:13,970
<i>graceful warriors will play
right here in Rio de Janeiro</i>

43
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:16,239
<i>at the newly-built
Maracana Stadium.</i>

44
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,042
<i>Brazil is tied to win
and the whole city has been</i>

45
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,111
<i>shut down to prepare
for celebrations</i>

46
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:23,046
<i>on a scale never before seen.</i>

47
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:25,849
<i>- Come on, Dico, let's play!
- Yeah, come on, Dico.</i>

48
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,222
- I'm done shinin' shoes!

49
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,883
-<i> We need a new ball!</i>

50
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,953
-<i> Today's World Cup finals!</i>

51
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:08,024
<i>We bring you the even
bigger big event</i>

52
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:11,394
<i>you've all been waiting for!</i>

53
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,064
Welcome,<i> Senhoras e Senhores</i>

54
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:18,201
to the famous Rubens Arruda
street stadium!

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,740
-<i> Today's very important game.</i>

56
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:26,142
- Keepy uppy.
No, bounce!

57
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:36,252
-<i> Keepy uppy!</i>

58
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:42,692
- Over the roof.

59
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,394
- I got this.

60
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,254
<i>- I got it!
Come on!</i>

61
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,157
- Keep away!

62
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,627
- Come on, guys.

63
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,762
- Get out of here.

64
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,500
-<i> Dico!</i>

65
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,812
- Ah, Zoca!

66
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:39,115
- It was a bad pass
and Dico tripped.

67
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,017
<i>And the sun was in my eyes.</i>

68
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,519
<i>No fair!</i>

69
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:11,281
- Hmm.

70
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:17,220
- I finished shining shoes
and was walking Zoca home

71
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:19,422
when he slipped
and fell in the river.

72
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,304
- But you were playing football!

73
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,397
-<i> You should know better.</i>

74
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,632
You both go change and get back
to shining shoes.

75
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,534
- But, mom,
what about the World Cup?!

76
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:34,170
<i>- Don't even think about it.
- The score is still tied 1-1!</i>

77
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,539
<i>The crowd in here is now
chanting, "Brazil must win!"</i>

78
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,774
<i>And here comes Brazil now</i>

79
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,242
<i>giving it everything
they've got.</i>

80
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:41,511
- Go, go, just one, go.

81
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:45,114
-...<i> Here with a header!</i>

82
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,325
<i>80 minutes in,
the match is still tied 1-1.</i>

83
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,095
<i>Over 200,000 fans now on their
feet, crammed into every seat.</i>

84
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,197
<i>Some eager fans are even
watching from their roof.</i>

85
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,100
<i>And Uruguay's Ruben Moran now
lines up for the quarter kick.</i>

86
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,637
<i>Here it is.
Uruguay shoots!</i>

87
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,840
- Dico, Dico, what's the score?

88
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,675
- Still 1-1.
Final minutes.

89
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:14,811
- He said still tied 1-1.

90
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:18,147
- The match is winding down.
Fofinho.

91
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,923
- Hey, guys!
What's the score?

92
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:27,957
- Shh!

93
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,525
- Get lost, Zoca.

94
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,829
- I'll tell ma you were here,
listening to the World Cup.

95
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,364
- Okay, just stay quiet.

96
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,836
<i>- He shoots and it's goal!
Uruguay moves ahead.</i>

97
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,906
- What happened, Dico?
What happened? Did we score?

98
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:45,375
- Score against Brazil. 2-1.

99
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,512
<i>- And now suddenly
all the pressure is on Brazil.</i>

100
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,447
- Ugh!
- Come on, Brazil.

101
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:58,087
- <i>He's driving the ball forward
as fast as he can! Oh, no!</i>

102
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,658
<i>The final whistle.
We are defeated 21.</i>

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,794
<i>Brazil has lost the 1950 World.</i>

104
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:07,330
<i>All 200,000 fans</i>

105
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:10,400
<i>have fallen
into a deafening silence.</i>

106
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:25,415
<i>- Come on, guys, let's go.
I thought we were gonna win.</i>

107
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:05,488
- I'll win a World Cup
for Brazil,<i> pai. I promise.</i>

108
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,603
- If you're smart, Dico.

109
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,774
You listen to your mother.

110
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:27,110
You focus on school

111
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:29,152
and avoid the football
like the plague.

112
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:46,596
- Yes, I get it.
Football is romantic.

113
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:49,198
I should know.
I met your father at a game.

114
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:54,070
<i>5 goals he scored
with his head that day.</i>

115
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:56,005
Hmm.

116
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,941
Then we got married
and I told him

117
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,779
if he was so good with his head,
he wouldn't play football.

118
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:04,614
<i>They paid him nothing
and dropped him</i>

119
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:06,716
<i>as soon as he hurt his knee.</i>

120
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,718
No insurance, no severance.

121
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,487
You think your father
wanted to be a janitor?

122
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,723
<i>Spend the rest of his life
scrubbing toilets?</i>

123
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:14,757
-<i> Celeste!</i>

124
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,958
-<i> Coming!</i>

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,228
Now, Dico, can I trust you
to finish this

126
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,297
so I can hang the wash?

127
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,740
-<i> The Bauru Youth Club?</i>

128
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:33,409
<i>Man, that tournament's
for street kids. Why bother?</i>

129
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,244
- 'Cause de Brito's
gonna be at the final.

130
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,747
- Waldemar de Brito, the scouts?

131
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,749
- Yeah, it says here
he's looking for players

132
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,117
<i>for the Santos Football Club.</i>

133
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,686
Puxa! Once he sees me
play like Di Stefano!

134
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:45,054
I'm going pro, baby.

135
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:46,856
<i>Wait till he sees me
play like Puskas.</i>

136
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:47,857
- And I'll be like Mazzola!

137
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,125
- And I'll be like Pele!

138
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,296
- Who the heck's "Pele"?

139
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:54,964
- The goalkeeper for Vasco.

140
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,802
- Bile,<i> imbecil!</i>
His name's Bile!

141
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,704
<i>- What idiot would think
Bile's name was Pele?</i>

142
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,806
-<i> We can call this boy Pele.</i>

143
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,975
- Hey, Pele, stop this shot!

144
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,215
- Senhor Jose,
I'm sorry for my son.

145
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,617
- Me? But he just...
- Shh, Dico.

146
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:17,220
Shut your mouth.

147
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,888
I won't bring him again.

148
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,425
- Hmm.

149
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,133
<i>- "Copa da juventude
de Bauru."</i>

150
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:32,935
- A tournament?
Are you crazy?

151
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:34,437
You promised<i> mae</i>
you'd be shining shoes!

152
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,905
- Na! Zoca!

153
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,075
- Maybe he's right, Dico.
What if your mom finds out?

154
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:40,309
- Hey, come on.

155
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:43,346
Let's show these snobby
<i>riquinhos</i> how we play.

156
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:44,981
- Fine, but I'm out.

157
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:47,750
<i>I don't want mae to kill me.
I'm innocent!</i>

158
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,585
- Come on, let's do this!

159
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:53,422
<i>- Welcome to Round 1
of the Bauru Youth Club.</i>

160
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,629
-<i> Sign up here.</i>

161
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,299
-<i> To me. I'm open!</i>

162
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,235
- Why does it go so far?

163
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,670
- It's full of air!

164
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,440
-<i> Vai, Dico, vai!</i>

165
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:27,256
-<i> Goal! 1-0.</i>

166
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:35,932
-<i> Vai, Dico, vai!</i>

167
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,170
- That's the match.

168
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:44,840
<i>And on Field Number 1,
The Kings also advanced</i>

169
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:46,542
<i>to the second round.</i>

170
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,044
- Kings!

171
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,783
-<i> Sorry, they don't match.</i>

172
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,052
The only thing I had
were my mom's bed sheets.

173
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:57,553
- Wait. You knit these?

174
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,255
- Well, sewed technically.

175
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:01,624
- Hey, your sewing
is pretty good, Yuri.

176
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:03,459
- Yeah, I use a double hem.

177
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,762
-<i> A little more.</i>

178
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:08,698
- I guess I could
take this out a bit.

179
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,499
-<i> Vai!</i>

180
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,336
Shirts make me feel
all trapped inside!

181
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:22,144
-<i> Goal!</i>

182
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,120
-<i> A goal on Field Number 2.</i>

183
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,829
- Everyone's over there
watching the Kings.

184
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,599
<i>- And final seconds now
on Field Number 1.</i>

185
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,502
- Goal! And there's
the final whistle!

186
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,171
<i>The Kings win 8-0.</i>

187
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,407
<i>Come back tomorrow
for the finals</i>

188
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,310
<i>where the Kings will
take on Team Number 7.</i>

189
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:57,213
- Hey, They are called
"The Shoeless Ones!"

190
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,757
- We need football boots.

191
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,393
- Boots? How're we gonna
pay for boots?

192
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,774
- I got an idea.

193
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:34,183
- Go!

194
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:40,589
Hurry! Hurry!
Throw it, under the fence!

195
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,026
Thiago!

196
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,227
-<i> Go, Thiago!</i>

197
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:55,538
- Ladies and gentlemen!

198
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,607
Toasted! Salted!
Packed with vitamins!

199
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,144
Today's special!
Buy two get a free shine!

200
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:05,314
- Free shoe shines!
Free shoe shines!

201
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:07,216
<i>Who wants a shine?</i>

202
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:10,086
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up!</i>

203
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:12,922
<i>Fresh from the Amazon!
Step right up!</i>

204
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:16,359
- Peanuts! Peanuts!
Peanuts here.

205
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:23,099
- Wow, he scrubs floors
and shines shoes!

206
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:25,634
Hey, Pele, how much for a shine?

207
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,638
- Don't call me that.
- Or what?

208
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,275
- Or you've got problems.
- Who? Fatty and his sister?

209
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:34,877
- Hey, Yuri is not a girl.

210
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,413
- Then why is he knitting,
4 eyes?

211
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,349
- Sewing technically.

212
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,952
- Throw it away.
- <i>Now..</i>

213
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:48,057
How much for a shine, Pele?

214
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:15,117
- Your teacher did this to you?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,489
Is this true, Zoca?

216
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,894
How dare she?

217
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,230
You and me are gonna have a word

218
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:29,632
with that woman tomorrow
after school!

219
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,567
- Tomorrow? No, I can't!

220
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,969
Uh, I mean, you have work.

221
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:35,237
- Celeste...

222
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,110
Let me talk to his teacher.

223
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,312
You go to work.

224
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,890
You know..

225
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:59,028
...when I was your age,
I used to get in fights.

226
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,465
Especially when the older boys
called me names.

227
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:08,037
But with time, I learned,
a good player knows

228
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,906
that fighting comes
from insecurity.

229
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:15,177
The point is, Dico

230
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,114
if you wanna play professionally

231
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,250
you can't be ashamed
of who you are.

232
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,788
-<i> I couldn't believe it.</i>

233
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,424
<i>Not only did he keep
the fight a secret</i>

234
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,726
but he knew all about
the tournament.

235
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:34,830
And he even said he hoped I'd
become a pro football player.

236
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:36,999
- Wow, that's great, Dico.

237
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,915
- What happened to your glasses?

238
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,209
- I don't want them
to call me names.

239
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:53,249
- <i>Bingo!</i>
- What? They're used.

240
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,251
And gigantic, you kidding me?

241
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,519
- Any other complaints?

242
00:16:56,521 --> 00:17:00,289
<i>- Senhoras e Senhores,
welcome to the final</i>

243
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,024
of the bout Juventude!

244
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:07,596
<i>Today's match, the Kings,
led by Captain Jose Altafini</i>

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,634
<i>versus The Shoeless Ones</i>

246
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:14,036
<i>led by Captain Pele!</i>

247
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,274
-<i> Acalme! Hey! Acalma!</i>

248
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,975
They're just trying
to get you mad.

249
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:21,677
- It's working.

250
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,214
<i>- And please,
give a warm welcome</i>

251
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:30,119

Waldemar de Brito!

252
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:33,822
<i>He is scouting for
the Santos Football Club!</i>

253
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,190
- Wow.

254
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,395
-<i> Teams, take the field.</i>

255
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:40,429
-<i> Kings!</i>

256
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:42,631
- Okay, everyone know the plan?

257
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:47,269
- When in doubt?
- Do what they do!

258
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:51,206
- Alright, boys.
May the best team win!

259
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,777
- Block the angle!
Block it!

260
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,514
-<i> Goal! Jose Altafini.</i>

261
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:01,116
<i>And the Kings,
off to a quick lead.</i>

262
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,021
<i>The Kings up, 2-0.</i>

263
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,225
- Watch where you're going,
Thiago!

264
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,628
<i>- The Shoeless Ones,
all tripped up!</i>

265
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,265
<i>- Goal! The Kings
in perfect form!</i>

266
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,337
<i>A beautiful give-and-go!</i>

267
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:24,873
<i>Goal! Altafini 6-0.</i>

268
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,508
- Nice moves, Pele.

269
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,811
- Hey, hey, let it go.
It's not worth it.

270
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,016
-<i> Acalme,</i> Dico.

271
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,399
- Dico, what are you doing?

272
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,867
-<i> I hate these boots.</i>

273
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:06,548

278
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,646
- Okay.

279
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:47,750

no time to waste.

280
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,284

- Don't worry, Dico.
It's okay.

299
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:12,768
-<i> Pele! Pele!</i>

300
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,102

00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,193
-<i> Wow.</i>

302
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:42,931

-<i> Hey, boys, come here.</i>

304
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:48,737

their peanuts back.

307

00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,546

311
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:41,283
- Come on, guys, jump it.

312
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:50,632
Thiago!
- Thiago, come on.

313
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,876
Come on! In here.

314
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:03,879
Down there, down there.

315
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:13,989
- You okay?

316
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,612
- I think it's sprained.

317
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,603
- You could get outta here,
you know?

318
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,072
- We're both getting outta here.

319
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:31,673
- Just give it a minute to rest.

320
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,642
- No, not the cave.

321
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:37,145
I mean, you could get out
of<i> here</i> here, Dico.

322
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,716
<i>What you did today...</i>

323
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:48,290
<i>- Come on!
It's gonna collapse!</i>

324
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,825
- Help, Dico! Help!

325
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:53,261
- Come on! Come on!
- I can't! I'm stuck!

326
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:16,485
Help!

327
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:38,974
<i>No, Thiago.</i>

328
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:41,243
No! Thiago!

329
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:42,344
Please!

330
00:25:57,127 --> 00:26:00,662
- So we stole the peanuts
to buy football boots.

331
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:03,932
But if I hadn't said we needed
the stupid boots

332
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:07,202
Thiago wouldn't have died.

333
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:14,443
It's all my fault,<i> mae.</i>

334
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:17,145
I killed him.

335
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:19,081
I killed him.

336
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:25,654
<i>- It's okay, Dico.
You didn't know.</i>

337
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:31,026
- I'm gonna be good now,<i> mae.</i>

338
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:35,630
I'm gonna study
and do good in school.

339
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,999
I promise.

340
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,104
-<i> Shh! Okay.</i>

341
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:14,369
<i>"Waldemar de Brito,
football scout."</i>

342
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:27,549
I think it's time
he'll work with you

343
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:29,451
in the clinic after school.

344
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,399
- No!

345
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:48,436
That thing.
Just do this.

346
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:53,408
Yes.

347
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:56,044
- Bloopers!

348
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:02,217
Yuck!

349
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:30,011
- You know, when I was a kid

350
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:34,316
I had a mango tree
just like that.

351
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,188
I taught myself

352
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,258
how to practice with the fruit.

353
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:45,927
Green for shooting.

354
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:49,130
Ripe for finesse.

355
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,899
-<i> Yuri! Yuri! Yuri, here!</i>

356
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,266
<i>- Es culpa.
Es culpa.</i>

357
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,002
Ugh!

358
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:24,225
-<i> 12 is to 4 as..</i>

359
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,331
- Nice and soft.

360
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,266
Okay?

361
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:40,268
Whoa! Soft.

362
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:42,704
Let's do it again.

363
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,474
Again.

364
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:48,042
<i>Whoa!</i>

365
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,611
<i>Whoa.</i>

366
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:50,845
<i>That's it.</i>

367
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:53,248
<i>Acalme. It's okay. Breathe.</i>

368
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,685
<i>Don't try so hard.</i>

369
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,487
<i>Just enjoy yourself.</i>

370
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:05,126
<i>Everything else will come.</i>

371
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,762
Hey!

372
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:08,857
<i>Yes!</i>

373
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:20,301
<i>Yeah.</i>

374
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:37,118
<i>That's it.</i>

375
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:47,362
Try that one.

376
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,900
<i>Good.</i>

377
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:53,868
Now this one.

378
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,336
- It's way too high.

379
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,372
- Do what comes natural to you.

380
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,852
That's alright.

381
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,854
It'll come.

382
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:17,492
<i>- No one can kick that
high except with the header.</i>

383
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:20,128
- No, not a header.
With your feet.

384
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,629
<i>- Tomorrow, I'll just
head something.</i>

385
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:22,864
-<i> Yeah.</i>

386
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:27,869
- Hey, Dico!

387
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:29,137
-<i> Dico.</i>

388
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,272
This is Mr. Waldemar de Brito.

389
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:37,211
- How would you like to try out
for the Santos Football Group?

390
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:52,627
- Thank you,<i> mae.</i> Thank you.

391
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,940
- You've had enough, Maria.

392
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:08,076
Go help your brother
try on his new pants.

393
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:10,411
- Okay. All set.

394
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:17,785
- What's wrong, Dico?

395
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:20,388
- I don't think
I can do this, Maria.

396
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,156
Maybe I should just say no.

397
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,324
-<i> How'd you get the cake?</i>

398
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,560
<i>- An advance</i>
<i>from Senhora</i> Altafina.

399
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:26,961
<i>How'd you acquire the pants?</i>

400
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:28,229
- I took an advance
for the cleaning.

401
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,465
- But<i> mae</i> bought you a cake.

402
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,233
- Yeah, they're giving up

403
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,534
a lot for this, aren't they?

404
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,905
You're right.

405
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:40,008
We have to be strong
for them now.

406
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,943
- He's only 15, Dondinho.

407
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,645
He's never even left Bauru.

408
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,680
- Tchan tchan tchan tchan!

409
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:53,187
-<i> Zoca.</i>

410
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:58,760
I'll be back before
you know it, okay?

411
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:01,229
- It's time to go.
- I love you guys. Be good.

412
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:04,265
- Go on,<i> meu filho.</i>

413
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,334
You go make us proud.

414
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:21,315
-<i> Stay safe, meu filho!</i>

415
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,172
- Welcome to Santos!

416
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:47,208
<i>Each of you will be evaluated</i>

417
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,243
<i>based on your execution</i>

418
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:51,512
of proper form and discipline!

419
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:54,415
Number 1 and number 2.

420
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,685
There's no magic
in football, boys!

421
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:01,355
<i>Whatever primitive style
you played at home, forget it!</i>

422
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:04,025
<i>Here, you'll learn to master
the techniques</i>

423
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:06,661
of the best teams in Europe!

424
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:09,130
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

425
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:12,533
That's exactly
the kind of monkey business

426
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,168
I'm talking about!

427
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,304
Ball on the ground!

428
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:18,106
<i>Ball on the ground, boys!</i>

429
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:20,274
<i>- Okay, okay!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>

430
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:22,143
<i>Okay, okay, okay,
back off, boys! Back off.</i>

431
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:23,478
<i>This is the list
for the pro team now.</i>

432
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,247
<i>For the pro team.</i>

433
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:28,216
<i>And here's the list
for the junior team, boys.</i>

434
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:30,818
<i>Junior team.</i>

435
00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:34,422
- Yeah! Whoo!

436
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,492
-<i> And the youth team.</i>

437
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:42,163
<i>Okay, congratulations, everyone.</i>

438
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:44,766
<i>Welcome to the club.
Now, shower up.</i>

439
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:46,501
<i>Come on, here we go!</i>

440
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:48,569
<i>- "Edson 'Dico' Arantes
do Nascimento."</i>

441
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,671
<i>- Now, the side-flip
is for accuracy.</i>

442
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:54,142
<i>But for power, use the instep
here, with the laces out.</i>

443
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:55,676
<i>Not the toe. Laces out.</i>

444
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:59,180
You see what happens when you
play with that primitive style?

445
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,648
<i>We lose.</i>

446
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,519
<i>Watch how Hungary beats us
in the '54 quarter final.</i>

447
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:07,588
<i>No showmanship,
no beating their mark.</i>

448
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,191
They just master the formations.

449
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,528
<i>- Let's go, Dico!
Let's go, Dico!</i>

450
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,597
<i>Let's go!</i>
- Man, let's go. Let's go.

451
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,332
<i>Come on, Dico! Come on, Dico!</i>

452
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:53,201
<i>Come on, Dico! Let's go!
- Let's go!</i>

453
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:55,303
<i>Let's go, team!
- Come on!</i>

454
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:57,839
- Laces out. Laces out.

455
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:06,013
- Come on, man.
- Boy.

456
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:08,616
-<i> He never scores.</i>

457
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:57,298
-<i> Well, well.</i>

458
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,369
Leaving so soon?

459
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:04,939
- Mr. de Brito?
What are you doing here?

460
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:07,508
- I was going to ask
the same of you.

461
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,446
- I'm no good, Mr. de Brito.

462
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:14,415
I can't play
like the other guys.

463
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,684
And if I don't
go back to school now

464
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,686
I'll end up cleaning toilets.

465
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,023
- Mm-hmm.
And what's wrong with that?

466
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:24,091
- Cleaning toilets?
- No.

467
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,793
What's wrong with not playing

468
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:28,262
the way the other guys do?

469
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:31,399
- Coach says the way
I play is primitive.

470
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:32,867
- It is primitive.

471
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,237
It has a long and rich history.

472
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:39,907
- Then why does coach hate it?

473
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:42,209
- Well, uh..

474
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:43,978
...it all started

475
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,547
in the beginning
of the 16th Century.

476
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:48,783
- Huh?
- Come on.

477
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:50,351
- If you don't wanna know,
I'll...

478
00:40:50,353 --> 00:40:53,087
- No, no, no, Mr. De Brito.
<i>I do wanna know.</i>

479
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:55,056
Please. Tell me.

480
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:59,427
- Okay, like I was saying

481
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,697
it was the beginning
of the 16th Century.

482
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,367
<i>The Portuguese arrived</i>

483
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,971
<i>to Brazil with African slaves.</i>

484
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:12,473
<i>But the Africans' will
was strong.</i>

485
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,844
<i>And many escaped to the jungle.</i>

486
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,647
<i>To protect themselves</i>

487
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,349
<i>the runaway slaves</i>

488
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:23,985
<i>called upon the ginga.</i>

489
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:26,053
<i>The foundation of Capoeira,</i>

490
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:28,656
<i>the martial art of war.</i>

491
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:33,861
<i>When slavery
was finally abolished</i>

492
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:37,298
<i>the Capoeiristas
came out of the jungle</i>

493
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,899
<i>only to find that Capoeira</i>

494
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,669
<i>was outlawed
throughout the land.</i>

495
00:41:43,473 --> 00:41:45,906
<i>They saw football
as a perfect way</i>

496
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:48,109
<i>to practice the ginga</i>

497
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:51,278
<i>without being arrested.</i>

498
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,716
<i>It was the ultimate
form of ginga.</i>

499
00:41:55,718 --> 00:41:57,151
<i>And before long</i>

500
00:41:57,153 --> 00:42:01,222
<i>the ginga evolved, adapted</i>

501
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:04,425
<i>until it was
no longer just ours.</i>

502
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:07,695
<i>But the rhythm
within all Brazilians.</i>

503
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:12,666
<i>But by the 1950 World Cup</i>

504
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,369
<i>most believed our ginga style</i>

505
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:18,606
<i>was to blame for the loss</i>

506
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:21,342
<i>and turned against
anything associated</i>

507
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:24,345
<i>with our African heritage.</i>

508
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:30,051
And just like your coach

509
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:32,353
has been trying to remove<i> ginga</i>

510
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:34,622
from your play..

511
00:42:34,624 --> 00:42:37,258
...we've been trying
to remove it from our self

512
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,827
as a people ever since.

513
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,101
But the<i> ginga</i>
is very strong in you, Dico.

514
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:51,572
So you can
either show us what happens

515
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:54,108
when you have the courage

516
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,610
to embrace who you truly are.

517
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:01,749
Or you can get on that train..

518
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:04,919
...and you will never know.

519
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:43,557
<i>- Keep it moving, boys!
Let's go! Come on!</i>

520
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:45,025
<i>Go get ahead!</i>

521
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,897
<i>I said move up, Joao!</i>

522
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:53,100
-<i> Hey, hey! Whoa!</i>

523
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,047
-<i> Francis! It's yours!</i>

524
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,116
<i>Nascimento stay back!</i>

525
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:21,095
Open your eyes!

526
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,531
<i>Come on!
Get up! Let's go!</i>

527
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,513
<i>Come on! Get up!
Let's go, boy!</i>

528
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,636
Wait for the formation!

529
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:50,551
-<i> Goal!</i>

530
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:01,161
-<i> Hey, kid!</i>

531
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:03,297
Get over here!

532
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:10,838
What the hell was that?

533
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,806
- I'm sorry.

534
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,144
- Do it again.

535
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:41,669
- "Santos, Cubatao,
Edson Nascimento, 4 goals."

536
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,540
<i>- You the kid
that scored 4 goals?</i>

537
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:50,177
Zito, midfielder.
Pro team.

538
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,478
So, uh..

539
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,049
You know what the best part
of scoring 4 goals is?

540
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:57,985
You get to run out
and bring me coffee.

541
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:00,454
Ancient Santos tradition.

542
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:06,093
And put some gas into it, huh?

543
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:09,063
<i>- The youngster,
Edson Arantes do Nascimento</i>

544
00:47:09,065 --> 00:47:10,264
<i>nicknamed Dico</i>

545
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:12,199
<i>moved up
to the junior team after</i>

546
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:14,068
<i>a few unbelievable matches</i>

547
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,135
<i>at the youth level.</i>

548
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,337
<i>Oh! What a move!</i>

549
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:18,305
<i>He passes one! That's another!</i>

550
00:47:18,307 --> 00:47:20,274
<i>Now through the middle!
The shot!</i>

551
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,910
-<i> Goal!</i>

552
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:47,401
-<i> You're not there, kid.</i>

553
00:47:47,403 --> 00:47:49,136
<i>That's the wrong list, Dico.</i>

554
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:50,804
<i>Welcome to the pros.</i>

555
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:53,240
- <i>From a kid who, as word
has it, was on the verge</i>

556
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:54,975
<i>of being cut
from the youth team.</i>

557
00:47:54,977 --> 00:47:57,111
<i>And now, suddenly,
top scorer of the pro team</i>

558
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:58,312
<i>halfway through the season.</i>

559
00:47:58,314 --> 00:48:00,414
<i>Fans now starting
to come out in hordes.</i>

560
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:03,784
<i>As Santos racks up the wins,
everyone eager to watch</i>

561
00:48:03,786 --> 00:48:05,386
<i>the 15-year-old phenom</i>

562
00:48:05,388 --> 00:48:08,822
and his magical style of play.

563
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:11,024
<i>Oh my! This kid
is something else! A fake!</i>

564
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:12,159
<i>Another fake!
Now he's back the other way!</i>

565
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:13,861
<i>He ditches off of Zito!</i>

566
00:48:13,863 --> 00:48:15,362
<i>Back to Nascimento. He's got
himself into a pickle now!</i>

567
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:16,730
<i>Three defenders.
He changes direction.</i>

568
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:18,932
<i>No, no! Wait a minute!
He's still got the ball!</i>

569
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:21,702
<i>From outside the box!
Goal!</i>

570
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:31,845
- Yes?
- Delivery for Dona Celeste.

571
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:37,050
- For me?
There must be a mistake.

572
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:38,952
- It's a gift,<i> mae!</i>

573
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:41,221
- Dico!
- <i>Dico!</i>

574
00:48:41,223 --> 00:48:43,457
- Dico! Dico, Dico!
- Maria.

575
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,459
- Hey!
- Hey, buddy!

576
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,828
<i>- It's going to be
in the kitchen.</i>

577
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:51,732
<i>- It's going in my room
because there's more space.</i>

578
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:54,468
<i>- Don't touch the stove, Maria.
- Where's the fire?</i>

579
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,503
- Hey, hey, it's not a toy.

580
00:48:56,505 --> 00:49:00,140
- You do realize there is
no gas in Bauru, right?

581
00:49:00,142 --> 00:49:01,775
- Don't break their hearts.

582
00:49:01,777 --> 00:49:03,811
We can just use it as a table.

583
00:49:05,147 --> 00:49:07,047
- For you,<i> pai!</i>

584
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:10,284
- Hey! Whoa! Wow!
- <i>It's a radio.</i>

585
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:11,752
- Yeah. I know what it is.

586
00:49:11,754 --> 00:49:13,220
- Now you can
listen to my games.

587
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:16,089
-<i> Oh, no, no, not in my house.</i>

588
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,491
Listen to your games?

589
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:19,893
Are you trying to give your
mother a heart attack?

590
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:23,096
- We can listen to Team Brazil
invitations tomorrow!

591
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:25,432
- Don't you listen, Zoca.
- Aah,<i> mae!</i>

592
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:27,401
- Besides, you have school
and your father works.

593
00:49:27,403 --> 00:49:28,469
- Oh,<i> mae!</i>

594
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:30,037
<i>- Does that mean nothing to you?</i>

595
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,339
- Come on, Maria. I'm 16.

596
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:34,508
There's no way
I'm making the selection.

597
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,710
- Mm-hmm. He's right.

598
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:38,545
No point to listen..

599
00:49:38,547 --> 00:49:41,181
...just to be disappointed.

600
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:44,384
<i>- Radio Bandeirantes announces
the list of invitations</i>

601
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:46,019
<i>to the national selection.</i>

602
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:48,856
<i>22 of our very best pro players</i>

<i>Gilmar. Bellini.

<i>Didi. Zagallo. Garrincha.
Nilton Santos.</i>

607
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,870
<i>Orlando. Zito. Vava.</i>

608
00:50:02,872 --> 00:50:06,173
<i>Castilho and Mazzola,
who at 19 years old</i>

609
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,108
<i>would be
the youngest member selected.</i>

610
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,811
<i>But also making the list,
16-year-old Dico Nascimento.</i>

611
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:15,148
- What's going on out there?

612
00:50:18,888 --> 00:50:22,256
Dico? You look sick.
Are you okay?

613
00:50:24,994 --> 00:50:26,894
-<i> Let me get this straight.</i>

614
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:29,096
<i>Top scorer gets coffee?</i>

615
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:31,698
<i>The youngest player gets lunch?</i>

616
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,902
And the shortest
cleans the showers.

617
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:37,137
- Yep. Always
the Santos traditions.

618
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:38,972
- Man.

619
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:41,074
You think maybe Zito
was making them up?

620
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:47,281
But, man, that's incredible.

621
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:49,363
You're playing with Zito
and the pro team.

622
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:53,420
- It's not the same
as with you guys.

623
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:58,425
I miss Thiago.

624
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:00,427
- Me too.

625
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:02,496
- Where's Fofinho?

626
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:08,035
- We robbed a store.
- What?

627
00:51:08,037 --> 00:51:11,705
- I got away, but Fofinho
got one year in jail.

628
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:14,808
- Yuri.
- I know. I know.

629
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,978
<i>It's just... you know
how things go around here.</i>

630
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:23,850
Hey, but I've been listening
to all your games.

631
00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:26,386
I still can't believe
you made the selection.

632
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:27,955
- You heard?

633
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,490
It's pretty much the greatest
thing that ever happened to us.

634
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:35,162
We're all going to be
pulling for you out there.

635
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:46,139
<i>- That was a critical time
for our country, meu filho.</i>

636
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:50,644
Ever since we lost
the cup in '50

637
00:51:50,646 --> 00:51:53,714
we've become ashamed.

638
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:57,084
The spirit
of our people is dying.

639
00:51:57,086 --> 00:51:59,219
<i>But now you can change all that.</i>

640
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,490
I had Yuri stitch it on for you.

641
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:06,760
-<i> Pele?</i>

642
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:07,828
- Yeah.

643
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,062
- But that's what
those rich kids

644
00:52:09,064 --> 00:52:10,831
called me to make fun of me.

645
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:11,999
- No.

646
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:13,467
It's what the people called you

647
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,235
when they saw you
play with<i> ginga.</i>

648
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:18,238
And when I saw you
had something I did not.

649
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:21,675
Years ago, Dico

650
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:26,046
<i>When I first became
a professional footballer..</i>

651
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:31,218
<i>...I wanted to play</i>
<i>with the ginga</i> so beautiful

652
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:36,123
<i>Brazilians would
erupt with pride.</i>

653
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:39,559
<i>But when I finally got my shot</i>

654
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,894
<i>I was filled with doubt.</i>

655
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:45,432
<i>And it ended my career.</i>

656
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:48,669
- But why?

657
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:51,238
- Because I stopped believing.

658
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:57,277
Doubt can turn
a beautiful<i> ginga</i> move

659
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,513
into a dangerous one.

660
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:03,216
<i>But you have to be stronger
than I was, Dico.</i>

661
00:53:03,218 --> 00:53:06,119
When people say mean things
about you and how you play

662
00:53:07,256 --> 00:53:08,422
you must never feel...

663
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:12,092
- Ashamed,<i> pai.</i>
I got it.<i> Calma.</i>

664
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:31,378
<i>- Tickets, please!
Rio de Janeiro!</i>

665
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:54,134
Stay strong,<i> meu filho.</i>

666
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:18,658
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Watch this. Watch this.

667
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,233
So, you're that kid that thinks
he can dribble like me, huh?

668
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,473
Hmm, then you've got style.

669
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:37,010
<i>The name's Garrincha.
- Hi. Dico.</i>

670
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,546
- This is Castilho.
- Castilho. Hey.

671
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:45,085
- That's Mauro.

672
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:47,053
- Hey, Mauro. Dico.

673
00:54:47,055 --> 00:54:49,523
- Vava.
- Hey, Vava.

674
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,124
- Uh, Zito you know, right?
- Yeah.

675
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:56,897
- <i>Hey, Zito.</i>
- And Didi.

676
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:59,032
- See you on the bench, kid.

677
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:01,735
- The bench? But coach hasn't
picked the lineups yet.

678
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:03,904
- Uh, you sure about that?

679
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:06,239
- There's your competition.

680
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,841
<i>Mazzola.</i>

681
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:10,083
Good luck convincing coach
to start you over him.

682
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,416
<i>- Wow! He scrubs floors
and shines shoes.</i>

683
00:55:16,418 --> 00:55:18,418
Pele.

684
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,188
<i>And I'll be like Mazzola.</i>

685
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,323
- It's Jose Altafini.

686
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:26,426
- Yeah. But he goes by Mazzola.

687
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:27,794
'Cause he says
he plays just like

688
00:55:27,796 --> 00:55:29,963
the legendary Italian striker.

689
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:32,098
- Well, my family's Italian

690
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,568
and I was trained
in that style of play.

691
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,303
So I am confident I will bring

692
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:39,272
some of the sophistication
and class

693
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:41,174
some others
of the team may lack.

694
00:55:48,217 --> 00:55:51,484
- Garrincha, do you really
think your<i> ginga</i> style

695
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:53,887
<i>will hold up against
the Europeans?</i>

696
00:55:56,058 --> 00:55:58,225
- I..

697
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:02,896
- I don't see what's so bad
about<i> ginga.</i>

698
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:05,966
- Listen! Listen! It's okay.
<i>Silencio! Silencio!</i>

699
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:07,400
<i>Okay, okay, listen.</i>

700
00:56:07,402 --> 00:56:10,170
<i>No one here
wants to relive 1950.</i>

701
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:12,606
I can assure you that
this team will be civilized

702
00:56:12,608 --> 00:56:14,875
both on and off the field.

703
00:56:14,877 --> 00:56:18,645
We will only show
our best face in Sweden.

704
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:21,248
Alright. Let's take the photo!

705
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:37,664
<i>Brazil is at a crossroads.</i>

706
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:40,433
<i>We either go down
in history as the savages</i>

707
00:56:42,504 --> 00:56:44,704
<i>or we enter the ranks
of the civilized.</i>

708
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:49,209
The President spoke those words
to me this morning.

709
00:56:52,881 --> 00:56:55,115
And I promised him

710
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:58,718
that this team, that my team

711
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,155
unlike those of the past

712
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:05,258
would not make fools
of ourselves and Brazil.

713
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,530
And you...

714
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:12,365
You may be 16 years old

715
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,734
but you are now a sportsman
for this great nation.

716
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:21,574
<i>Ginga</i> style might have worked
for you back in Santos

717
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:24,110
but it will never hold up
at an international level.

718
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:26,346
- But, coach...
- I don't wanna hear it!

719
00:57:26,348 --> 00:57:29,282
It won't happen again.

720
00:57:29,284 --> 00:57:30,684
<i>Say it.</i>

721
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:31,851
- It won't happen again.

722
00:57:31,853 --> 00:57:34,020
- What?!
- It won't happen again.

723
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:43,797
- Get him a haircut
and some proper clothes.

724
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:51,905
-<i> According to insider reports</i>

725
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:54,507
<i>Coach Feola is struggling
with his new recruits</i>

726
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,343
<i>during their
first month of practices.</i>

727
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:58,678

729

<i>and the disgrace of '54</i>

730
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,586
<i>the coach was left
with few options</i>

731
00:58:06,588 --> 00:58:10,090
<i>outside of inexperienced
and unconventional players.</i>

732
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:12,092
<i>The bulky midfielder, Zito</i>

733
00:58:12,094 --> 00:58:14,394
<i>bent-legged striker,
Mane Garrincha.</i>

734
00:58:14,396 --> 00:58:16,629
<i>And the youngster,
Dico Nascimento</i>

735
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:19,299
<i>who made headlines
last month for his outburst</i>

736
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:22,802
<i>at the inaugural banquet much
to the chagrin of Coach Feola.</i>

737
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:26,139
<i>Teaching Brazilians to play the
same disciplined formations</i>

738
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:28,942
<i>of the European teams
seems challenging enough.</i>

739
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:31,845
<i>But the coaching staff appears
to also be encouraging</i>

740
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:34,481
<i>a more refined
presentation off the field.</i>

741
00:58:34,483 --> 00:58:36,016
-<i> Why all the fuss?</i>

742
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:37,851
- It's about
changing that image.

743
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:39,452
We don't want
to arrive in Sweden

744
00:58:39,454 --> 00:58:41,755
and have the world say,
"Oh, there's Brazil."

745
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:44,591
- Yes. But you are Brazilian,
aren't you?

746
00:58:44,593 --> 00:58:46,926
- No.
You're not listening.

747
00:58:46,928 --> 00:58:49,396
I'm-I'm talking about the way
others see us and how we play.

748
00:58:49,398 --> 00:58:51,231
<i>- Then how do you account
for the reports</i>

749
00:58:51,233 --> 00:58:53,833
<i>of the team playing lousy
in practices?</i>

750
00:58:53,835 --> 00:58:56,069
- Certain players still are not
up to international standards.

751
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:57,570
<i>- And you think they can be
by Sweden?</i>

752
00:58:57,572 --> 00:58:59,239
- Maybe we're lousy

753
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:02,108
'cause we're not playing
the way we know how.

754
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,443
- I really hope
you're not saying

755
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:05,912
what I think you're saying.

756
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:08,715
- I mean, what if we just
didn't get it right in '50?

757
00:59:14,456 --> 00:59:16,823
- All I know is that coach

758
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,092
picks the starting lineup today.

759
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:22,429
Show him you can play
the way Jose plays

760
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:24,764
and you might have a shot.

761
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:26,499
But if you play with<i> ginga...</i>

762
00:59:29,004 --> 00:59:31,871
- I know, it's just my dad..

763
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:33,106
- Your dad what?

764
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:37,377
- Nothing. Forget it.

765
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:55,728
<i>- I want to see good,
clean football, boys!</i>

766
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,430
<i>Short, sharp passes!</i>

767
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,475
<i>You've got Vava on the wing!</i>

01:00:10,712 --> 01:00:12,912
<i>Take it from him!
Take it!</i>

770
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:22,322
<i>Alright now! Spread it out,
move! Here we go!</i>

771
01:00:22,324 --> 01:00:24,757
<i>Zito! You gotta block
that out!</i>

772
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:31,197
<i>Keep the ball moving here!
Let's go!</i>

773
01:00:36,671 --> 01:00:38,671
<i>Nascimento!</i>

774
01:00:39,774 --> 01:00:41,941
<i>No! No!
What are you thinking?</i>

775
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:55,889
-<i> Dico!</i>

776
01:00:57,459 --> 01:00:59,592
<i>Dico!</i>

777
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:16,809
-<i> Breathe.</i>

778
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:26,319
-<i> Dico?</i>

779
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:29,622
<i>Are you okay?</i>

780
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,824
- I had a small collision.

781
01:01:31,826 --> 01:01:33,893
-<i> What?</i>

782
01:01:33,895 --> 01:01:35,762
<i>What do you mean?</i>

783
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,532
<i>Dico?</i>

784
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:42,135
- It's my knee.

785
01:01:42,137 --> 01:01:45,171
<i>It's my knee, mae.</i>

786
01:01:45,173 --> 01:01:47,106
<i>They don't know when
I can play again.</i>

787
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,841
- What happened?

788
01:01:48,843 --> 01:01:51,878
<i>- I should have
stayed in school.</i>

789
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

790
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:56,716
<i>I'm so sorry, mae.</i>

791
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:59,586
- No, Dico.

792
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:00,853
Dico?

793
01:02:02,824 --> 01:02:05,792
We made that choice together.

794
01:02:05,794 --> 01:02:07,160
And it was the right choice.

795
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:14,100
Your father and I
love you no matter what.

796
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:15,635
-<i> Te amo, mae.</i>

797
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:42,962
<i>- Okay.
Let's have a look.</i>

798
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:46,165
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

799
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:48,501
Hey!

800
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,637
It's still too swollen to say.

801
01:02:52,974 --> 01:02:54,741
Keep ice on it for a few days.

802
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:57,310
- And then

803
01:02:57,312 --> 01:02:59,279
he can play?

804
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:02,215
- Maybe next season.

805
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:05,084
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

806
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,120
<i>We'll take another look
in Sweden.</i>

807
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:10,189
<i>If he's going.</i>

808
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:11,858
<i>- It's too late
to replace him now.</i>

809
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,660
<i>Start him on rehabilitation.</i>

810
01:03:13,662 --> 01:03:15,428
- Better bag some ice
for the flight.

811
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,896
- Shh! Everyone quiet!
This is it!

812
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:19,299
<i>- In our World Cup
will be, Brazil.</i>

813
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:21,601
<i>Brazil's struggled immensely
with their team's image</i>

814
01:03:21,603 --> 01:03:23,736
<i>ever since they lost in 1950.</i>

815
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:26,606
<i>Then in '54 shamefully stormed
their opponent's locker room</i>

816
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:29,409
<i>with broken bottles after
losing in the quarter-finals.</i>

817
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:31,978
<i>The big question now was could
they remake themselves?</i>

818
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,314
<i>Well, they brought in
Coach Vicente Feola</i>

819
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,682
<i>for just that purpose.</i>

820
01:03:35,684 --> 01:03:36,816
<i>And the reports we've received</i>

821
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:38,651

822
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:41,220

for a special report</i>

864
01:05:45,346 --> 01:05:47,947
<i>on the wonders of
Swedish culture and cuisine</i>

865
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:50,283
<i>after these messages
from our sponsors.</i>

866
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:56,456
- Bunch of fascists,
if you ask me.

867
01:05:56,458 --> 01:06:00,159
<i>They even got a King.
Gustaf VI Adolf.</i>

868
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:03,062
I mean, who's got a number
in the middle of their name?

869
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,333
Hey, hey, hey,<i> calma.</i>

870
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:09,402
Drink, it'll help with the pain.

871
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:12,371
<i>I added some of my special
herbs to speed up the healing.</i>

872
01:06:12,373 --> 01:06:14,207
<i>We'll teach that white doctor</i>

873
01:06:14,209 --> 01:06:16,442
<i>to doubt the ancient arts.</i>

874
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:18,778
The referees here keep
the ball after every game.

875
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,747
Do you believe that?

876
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:24,650
I'll be damned if they keep
the winning ball this time.

877
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:28,187
That ball's coming home with me
whether they like it or not.

878
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:36,162
<i>- The referee signals
and the first match</i>

879
01:06:36,164 --> 01:06:38,464
<i>of Group 4 is underway!</i>

880
01:06:38,466 --> 01:06:40,166
<i>Brazil versus Austria.</i>

881
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:42,335
<i>That's Holla out
to right wing Walter Horak</i>

882
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:43,903
<i>Austria, of course,
not as strong</i>

883
01:06:43,905 --> 01:06:45,872
<i>as they were 4 years ago
when they took Bronze</i>

884
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,507
<i>in the '54 cup.</i>

885
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:02,889
<i>- Earlier today, Brazil pulled
off a surprising upset</i>

886
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:05,258
<i>against Austria in Group 4.</i>

887
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,794
- Gentlemen! Let's go
out to the field.

888
01:07:08,796 --> 01:07:12,865
<i>- And here in Group 3, Sweden
trouncing Mexico, 3 to nil.</i>

889
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:14,700
-<i> I have to admit,</i>

890
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:17,436
<i>it looks a lot better
than I expected.</i>

891
01:07:17,438 --> 01:07:21,274
But it's still extremely weak.

892
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:22,375
- So you'll clear him?

893
01:07:22,377 --> 01:07:24,777
- It'll be excruciatingly
painful for him.

894
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:27,647
- I'll take that as a yes.
- We should talk about this.

895
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:29,448
- Get him on his feet.
- It's too dangerous.

896
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,883
Even the slightest attack...

897
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:34,220
<i>- At Rasunda Stadium,
Sweden continues to dominate</i>

898
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:36,556
<i>with a 2-0 win
over Hungary today</i>

899
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:38,724
<i>securing their place
in the quarterfinals.</i>

900
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,193
<i>And in Group 4,
Brazil, a heavy underdog</i>

901
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:43,462
<i>coming into the tournament
managed to edge out</i>

902
01:07:43,464 --> 01:07:45,565
<i>Austria in their first match</i>

903
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,800
<i>then survived England
in a scoreless tie.</i>

904
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:50,069
<i>The first we've seen
in World Cup history.</i>

905
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:51,938
<i>The match was a proper bloodbath</i>

906
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,840
<i>leaving three of Brazil's
starting players injured.</i>

907
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:57,643
<i>Joel, Dino Sani, and striker</i>

908
01:07:57,645 --> 01:08:00,546
<i>Jose Altafini,
nicknamed "Mazzola"</i>

909
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:02,348
<i>who's leg injury
will prevent him</i>

910
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:06,018
<i>from playing in today's match
against the Soviet Union.</i>

911
01:08:08,523 --> 01:08:11,057
- Come on, Joao.

912
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:13,559
<i>- The Soviets
are big and aggressive.</i>

913
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,629
- Easy, Zoca!

914
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,731
<i>- Only started
one black player before today.</i>

915
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:20,866
<i>But these injuries
will force his hand.</i>

916
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:23,970
<i>And we've just received word
that Feola will give the nod</i>

917
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:26,606
<i>to defensive midfield reserve,
Zito</i>

918
01:08:26,608 --> 01:08:28,708
<i>bent-legged right winger,
Garrincha</i>

919
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:32,078
<i>and 17-year-old
Edson Nascimento</i>

920
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,513
<i>who comes in to replace Mazzola.</i>

921
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,415
<i>And who apparently is himself</i>

922
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,317
<i>recovering from a sprained knee.</i>

923
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:41,387
- Let's go.
Pull yourself together!

924
01:08:41,389 --> 01:08:43,055
You cannot go
on camera like this.

925
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:44,223
Caralho!

926
01:08:44,225 --> 01:08:46,425
<i>Clean yourself up.</i>

927
01:08:46,427 --> 01:08:48,294
Come on. You've got
to stand up straight!

928
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:49,762
Up straight!

929
01:08:49,764 --> 01:08:52,231
<i>Try to look older than you are
for once, for God's sake.</i>

930
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:54,900
You watch Didi
and Zagallo for the shifts.

931
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:56,435
<i>You've seen Mazzola run them.</i>

932
01:08:56,437 --> 01:08:58,738
And lace your goddamn boots up!

933
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,007
-<i> Hey, Dico, there you are.</i>

934
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:03,776
- Listen, you must protect
that knee at all costs.

935
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:04,910
It's very weak.

936
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,779
And don't even
think about<i> ginga.</i>

937
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,514
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

938
01:09:08,516 --> 01:09:11,817
Lace up your boots. Are you
trying to get yourself killed?

939
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:14,186
Let's go.

940
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:41,414
<i>- See, the way it works
is they are here to see us.</i>

941
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,716
Not the other way around.
Come on. Field's this way.

942
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:45,758
You might wanna think about
tying those.

943
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:50,456
<i>- This marks the first
World Cup appearance</i>

944
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,857
<i>for Mane Garrincha.</i>

945
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:54,293
<i>There's our trusty
midfielder, Didi</i>

946
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:56,929
<i>who towers over
the young Dico Nascimento.</i>

947
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:59,031
<i>He is dwarfed
by even his teammates.</i>

948
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,967
<i>Clearly the youngest player
they've seen in a lineup.</i>

949
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:05,471
<i>And the crowd here having
a grand time at his expense.</i>

950
01:10:05,473 --> 01:10:08,240
- Don't listen to them, Dico.

951
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:50,416
<i>- The Soviet Union very
physical out of the gates!</i>

952
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:52,084
<i>It's almost as if they're
playing pinball</i>

953
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:54,086
<i>with the smaller Brazilians
and enjoying it!</i>

954
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,355
<i>Our heroes now see a hole
in the Soviet defense.</i>

955
01:10:56,357 --> 01:10:57,890
<i>Garrincha pops one
through the middle.</i>

956
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:01,327
<i>The shot, goal! Goal!</i>

957
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:03,295
<i>Brazil takes the lead, 1 to 0!</i>

958
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:06,732
<i>A stroke of luck for Coach
Feola and Team Brazil!</i>

959
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,834
<i>The middle changes
in the Brazilian lineup</i>

960
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,770
<i>seem to have confused
the Soviets.</i>

961
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:13,506
<i>And newcomers Garrincha
and Vava capitalize</i>

962
01:11:13,508 --> 01:11:15,007
<i>unlike the young Nascimento.</i>

963
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:17,243
<i>The Soviets have really
had their way with him.</i>

964
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:20,379
<i>He'll have to do a better job
to stay out of their way</i>

965
01:11:20,381 --> 01:11:23,115
<i>if he intends to walk out
of here on his own two feet.</i>

966
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:36,395
-<i> Dico! Dico!</i>

967
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,631
<i>- And there's another
missed pass for Brazil.</i>

968
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:40,466
<i>But nonetheless,
the Soviets have</i>

969
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:42,701
<i>yet to capitalize
on these turnovers.</i>

970
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:45,204
<i>And with only a few minutes
remaining in the match</i>

971
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:47,773
<i>it appears Brazil may just
edge away with this one</i>

972
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,241
<i>which would pit them
against France</i>

973
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:50,843
<i>in next week's semi-final.</i>

974
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:12,792
- Hey! Hey!
Hey!

975
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:26,445
- <i>And the crowd wanted a whistle
on that push from Nascimento</i>

976
01:12:26,447 --> 01:12:28,447
<i>who shows his frustration
after losing the ball.</i>

977
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:29,849
<i>He hesitated
on his dribble there.</i>

978
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:31,917
<i>The kind of mistake that can
easily lead to injury.</i>

979
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:33,786
<i>And here's France now,
Raymond Kopa</i>

980
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:35,354
<i>lays one out for Just Fontaine.</i>

981
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,256
<i>Fontaine passes it on. Goal!</i>

982
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,126
<i>A goal for France.</i>

983
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:44,063
<i>We are on the boards first
with the goal from Vava</i>

984
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,865
<i>but now France strikes back</i>

985
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:48,467
<i>and that has got
to demoralize Brazil.</i>

986
01:12:48,469 --> 01:12:50,336
<i>As the teams head
to the locker rooms</i>

987
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:52,905
<i>after a very physical
first half.</i>

988
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,846
<i>- When I say 4-2-4,
I mean 4-2-4.</i>

989
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:03,616
<i>No 4-3-3, you understand?</i>

990
01:13:03,618 --> 01:13:06,118
<i>If you understand
what I'm saying, then you say</i>

991
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,621
"Yes, coach, I'll do it.
Can you say it?

992
01:13:08,623 --> 01:13:09,788
- Yes, coach, I'll do it.

993
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,957
-<i> Eso.</i>

994
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:16,195
<i>Look. You wait for the set,
then you release.</i>

995
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:18,163
<i>- Where's the center line?
Where is it?</i>

996
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:19,965
-<i> Not tomorrow, today!</i>

997
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:25,404
<i>Come on! Up! Up!</i>

998
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:30,276
- <i>Let's go! We only get one shot here.
Let's make it count.</i>

999
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,351
- I can't play like you.

1000
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:44,823
If your leg is better,
you should go back in.

1001
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:51,830
- It's not my leg.

1002
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,767
<i>My head is not right.</i>

1003
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,336
- Your head?

1004
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:03,409
- My whole life

1005
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:05,611
all I ever wanted
was to be European.

1006
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:08,981
<i>Since we've got here,
I realize that</i>

1007
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:12,751
I'm Brazilian

1008
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,088
and always will be.

1009
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:27,566
That day back in Bauru

1010
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:30,002
you showed everyone
that they're part of us.

1011
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:32,938
The ginga

1012
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,073
<i>it was beautiful.</i>

1013
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:38,544
That's what we need now.

1014
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:43,582
-<i> The World Cup semi-final.</i>

1015
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:45,351
<i>France and Brazil neck and neck</i>

1016
01:14:45,353 --> 01:14:46,719
<i>at the start of the second half.</i>

1017
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:48,721
<i>Today's winner will advance
to Sunday's final</i>

1018
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:50,255
<i>where they will
likely face Sweden.</i>

1019
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,224
<i>France, of course,
favored over Brazil</i>

1020
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:55,027
<i>the only team from outside
Europe still in competition.</i>

1021
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:01,967
-<i> Hey, hey, hey!</i>

1022
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:32,331
- Watch the knee!
The knee!

1023
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,932
- Stay back! Stay back!

1024
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,063
-<i> Goal, Brazil!</i>

1025
01:16:04,065 --> 01:16:06,698
<i>What a drive and what a finish!</i>

1026
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,368
<i>The 17-year-old
with a humdinger of a shot</i>

1027
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,204
<i>giving Brazil a leg-up
in this second half!</i>

1028
01:16:12,206 --> 01:16:13,739
<i>Garrincha now approaching
the area,</i>

1029
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:15,240
<i>knocked away by Jonquet.</i>

1030
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:17,643
<i>A loose ball in,
Brazil comes away with it!</i>

1031
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:18,811
<i>Brazil turning the tides</i>

1032
01:16:18,813 --> 01:16:20,893
<i>now advancing the ball
back downfield.</i>

1033
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,951
<i>That's Didi feeding the ball
down the middle.</i>

1034
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:28,821
<i>It's a chip.
Nascimento shoots! Goal!</i>

1035
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:31,223
<i>Goal! Goal!</i>

1036
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,862
<i>Goal, Brazil!</i>

1037
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:38,130
<i>The young Nascimento comes up</i>

1038
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:40,899
<i>with two dazzling goals
back to back!</i>

1039
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:53,712
<i>And now the youngster
is back at it</i>

1040
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,414
<i>right over Marcel!</i>

1041
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:57,583
<i>A touch and some kind of double fake.
Never seen that before.</i>

1042
01:16:57,585 --> 01:16:59,218
<i>Marcel grabbing
at the lad's shirt.</i>

1043
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,019
<i>And now he makes Piantoni!</i>

1044
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,654
<i>Orlando letting it
roll by to Vava!</i>

1045
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:05,190
<i>A little touch to the give
and go back to Nascimento.</i>

1046
01:17:05,192 --> 01:17:06,558
<i>He stepped right over it!</i>

1047
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,627
<i>Kaelbel didn't even
see it go by!</i>

1048
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,763
<i>He shoots!
It's a goal! Goal, Brazil!</i>

1049
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,298
<i>Goal, Nascimento!</i>

1050
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,936
<i>An other-worldly display
by the 17-year-old phenom!</i>

1051
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,473
<i>- And believe it or not,
ladies and gentlemen</i>

1052
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:26,178
<i>Brazil is on their way
to the 1958 World Cup final!</i>

1053
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:47,065
- He's fine.

1054
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:53,238
And, uh, he scored three goals.

1055
01:17:57,178 --> 01:18:01,580
- Listen up. I got four days to
get you in shape for the final.

1056
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:03,282
<i>Everyone take notes.</i>

1057
01:18:03,284 --> 01:18:06,151
Sweden has been shifting
from Pyramid

1058
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:08,387
5-3-2 to 3-2-2-3.

1059
01:18:08,389 --> 01:18:11,390
And sometimes
to<i> metodo</i> 2-3-2-3.

1060
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:13,292
We play straight 4-2-4.

1061
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:16,828
But if we're gonna
beat these guys

1062
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:20,465
we're gonna have to shift
formation as they do.

1063
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:22,334
<i>And this is how
we're gonna do it.</i>

1064
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:25,804
If they go to 5-3-2,
then we go to 3-4-3!

1065
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,340
<i>Let's go. Next!</i>

1066
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:31,577
<i>Whatever they run,
with the method of 3-2-3</i>

1067
01:18:31,579 --> 01:18:33,245
<i>we match with the 4-3-3.</i>

1068
01:18:33,247 --> 01:18:34,680
There's nobody
in the field over here.

1069
01:18:34,682 --> 01:18:35,781
Vada! Vada!

1070
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:38,984
Everybody is here
and nobody is here!

1071
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:41,119
- Never follow. Not ever.

1072
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:43,255
<i>- But, coach, isn't that
their shift to 3-4-3?</i>

1073
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:46,692
<i>- No. Skoglund sweeps to start
Sweden's counterattack.</i>

1074
01:18:46,694 --> 01:18:48,427
<i>Didi, sweep only.</i>

1075
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:52,531
What is that? I said 4-5-1!
Didi slide over!

1076
01:18:52,533 --> 01:18:54,066
<i>You're running the 4-5-1!</i>

1077
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:59,071
Garrincha, roll out! You gotta
be ready for that on the wing!

1078
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:00,672
- Coach?
- <i>What?</i>

1079
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:02,941
- I don't understand how
I'm supposed to be on the wing

1080
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:04,376
and covering Skoglund
at the same time.

1081
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:06,011
- Because you...

1082
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:13,118
- <i>The Swedes have the edge over
Brazil in almost every regard.</i>

1083
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,454
<i>Experience, sophistication,
strategy and strength</i>

1084
01:19:15,456 --> 01:19:17,189
<i>and even dirty play.</i>

1085
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:18,690
<i>Last week, we saw
West German captain</i>

1086
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:21,059
<i>Fritz Walter's illustrious
career come to an end</i>

1087
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:22,594
<i>after this severe collision</i>

1088
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:24,463
<i>with Swedish midfielder
Sigge Parling.</i>

1089
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:25,998
<i>Well, come Sunday's final</i>

1090
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,499
<i>expect Parling's sights
to be set on</i>

1091
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,234
<i>the young Edson Nascimento.</i>

1092
01:19:30,571 --> 01:19:32,904
<i>- Nascimento scored
an impressive hat-trick</i>

1093
01:19:32,906 --> 01:19:35,040
<i>in 20 minutes in the
semi-final against France.</i>

1094
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:37,042
<i>Coach Raynor, any concern
he'll do the same</i>

1095
01:19:37,044 --> 01:19:38,810
<i>against Sweden
in Sunday's final?</i>

1096
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:40,712
- No, no.
That's not possible.

1097
01:19:40,714 --> 01:19:44,483
No. Our boys will eliminate him
from the equation.

1098
01:19:44,485 --> 01:19:47,052
<i>- Coach Feola,
Coach Raynor's offense</i>

1099
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:50,289
outsmarted West Germany,
Hungary.

1100
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:52,324
Do you have any plans
to contain them?

1101
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:53,592
- Well...
- They can't.

1102
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:57,095
We will come out strong,
score early

1103
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:58,297
and Brazil will panic

1104
01:19:58,299 --> 01:20:00,265
just like they did in 1950.

1105
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:03,869
<i>They were undisciplined then and
they are undisciplined now.</i>

1106
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:06,772
But what do you expect?
They're abnormal.

1107
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:08,674
- You're referring
to their mixed race?

1108
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:11,543
- No. I mean they are literally
abnormal.

1109
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:12,477
-<i> Can you elaborate?</i>

1110
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,280
- Well, yes, in fact, I can.

1111
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:17,816
Djalma Santos, full back.

1112
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:20,018
<i>He mangled his hand
in an accident</i>

1113
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,454
<i>while working in a factory
as a teenager.</i>

1114
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:26,091
<i>The right winger, Garrincha,
born with a deformed spine</i>

1115
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:28,226
<i>and one leg shorter
than the other.</i>

1116
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:30,595
<i>The reserve, Castilho</i>

1117
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:33,598
<i>he's colorblind
and missing a finger.</i>

1118
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,634
Challenging for a goalkeeper,
I imagine.

1119
01:20:41,975 --> 01:20:44,710
<i>- I heard about
the press conference.</i>

1120
01:20:44,712 --> 01:20:47,546
<i>Everyone here
is really down about it.</i>

1121
01:20:47,548 --> 01:20:50,315
But this is exactly
what happened in '50.

1122
01:20:50,317 --> 01:20:53,251
You can't let the doubt
get to you.

1123
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:56,488
<i>I heard the guys
are calling you Pele now.</i>

1124
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,524
- Yeah. Jose started it.
It's silly.

1125
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:03,028
- This is a sign.

1126
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,697
Now is the time for Pele.

1127
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,233
- But Sweden's gonna be
all over me,<i> pai.</i>

1128
01:21:08,235 --> 01:21:10,802
And did you see what they did
to Fritz Walter?

1129
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:11,937
They're brutal.

1130
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,205
And smart.

1131
01:21:14,508 --> 01:21:16,775
-<i> Dico.</i>

1132
01:21:16,777 --> 01:21:20,412
You believed in yourself
against France.

1133
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:22,681
<i>Now you must inspire your team</i>

1134
01:21:22,683 --> 01:21:25,617
<i>to believe in themselves..</i>

1135
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:27,519
<i>...in Brazil..</i>

1136
01:21:27,521 --> 01:21:28,754
<i>...in the ginga.</i>

1137
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,990
- Hey, Garrincha!

1138
01:22:04,992 --> 01:22:06,158
- What the heck, Pele?

1139
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:20,806
- Hey! Lighthouse, no bounce!

1140
01:22:20,808 --> 01:22:24,009
- Come on, kid!
Time to wake up. Take a seat.

1141
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:25,076
Have some breakfast.

1142
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,033
- You won't be able
to do it alone.

1143
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:38,924
-<i> Zito, come on.</i>

1144
01:22:44,765 --> 01:22:46,631
-<i> Hey, where did that ball go?</i>

1145
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:50,168
- Come on, guys.

1146
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,336
-<i> To the lighthouse.</i>

1147
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:02,848
-<i> Nice one.</i>

1148
01:23:25,639 --> 01:23:26,771
-<i> Anyone see it fall?</i>

1149
01:23:26,773 --> 01:23:27,906
-<i> Not me!</i>

1150
01:23:27,908 --> 01:23:29,040
-<i> Keepy uppy!</i>

1151
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,175
-<i> Alright! Game on!</i>

1152
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:31,676
<i>Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

1153
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:33,211
<i>Let's go!</i>

1154
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,028
- I'm sorry, sir.

1155
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,963
- Wake up, kid.
To the lighthouse!

1156
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:01,139
-<i> Yeah!</i>

1157
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:05,243
<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

1158
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:13,485
-<i> Outside!</i>

1159
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:16,021
-<i> Calma. You can do it.</i>

1160
01:24:16,023 --> 01:24:17,722
-<i> Long ball!</i>

1161
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:21,726
-<i> Didi! You got Pele long!</i>

1162
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:26,431
<i>- Run, Pele!
Get there! Jump!</i>

1163
01:24:33,507 --> 01:24:34,539
- I can't swim!

1164
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:35,707
- I got you, Pele!

1165
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:41,846
I got you.

1166
01:24:43,951 --> 01:24:46,017
<i>- Grab my hand.
Here you go.</i>

1167
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:53,091
- We were so close!

1168
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,400
- Here he comes.

1169
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,282
- You see?
That's how it's done.

1170
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:22,187
- Tomorrow you will play
for the Jules Rimet trophy.

1171
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,863
And if you play the way
you played this last week

1172
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:33,331
you will lose.

1173
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:43,508
And it will be my fault.

1174
01:25:49,049 --> 01:25:53,652
The truth is that
shifting formations

1175
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,553
may work miracles for Sweden

1176
01:25:55,555 --> 01:25:58,323
but it is not us.

1177
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:08,366
What I saw at the hotel today

1178
01:26:08,368 --> 01:26:09,634
that's how we play.

1179
01:26:13,073 --> 01:26:16,074
They say that we don't all play
the same. It's true.

1180
01:26:17,711 --> 01:26:20,845
We certainly don't all
look the same like they do.

1181
01:26:23,316 --> 01:26:25,276
But that's what makes us
who we are.

1182
01:26:26,653 --> 01:26:28,420
We have one thing in common.

1183
01:26:28,422 --> 01:26:29,454
The ginga.

1184
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:32,123
The joy and expression
of Brazil.

1185
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:36,354
So when you take
the field tomorrow

1186
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:43,334
forget everything that
I told you this last week.

1187
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:46,137
I don't want the world to see
a bunch of scared Brazilians

1188
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:47,372
trying to play like Sweden.

1189
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:50,809
I want them to see Brazil,
just as we are.

1190
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:01,086
I don't know if we will win

1191
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:08,426
but I do know

1192
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:11,396
that we will show them
a beautiful game.

1193
01:27:19,539 --> 01:27:20,839
What are you all
sitting around for?

1194
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:22,874
I did not say that
practice was canceled!

1195
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:27,679
<i>- Let's go, Brazil!
Alright.</i>

1196
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:30,448
- <i>After a night of heavy rains,
it's a brisk summer morning</i>

1197
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,250
<i>with clear skies
here in Stockholm.</i>

1198
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:33,818
<i>Fine weather for football</i>

1199
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:38,556
<i>as Sweden prepares to host
the 1958 World Cup final.</i>

1200
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:40,658
<i>The Nordic Titans of Europe
will take on</i>

1201
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,695
<i>the less-experienced
but ever-flamboyant Brazil.</i>

1202
01:27:43,697 --> 01:27:45,230
<i>Two teams with nothing in common</i>

1203
01:27:45,232 --> 01:27:47,432
<i>other than, perhaps,
their yellow jerseys.</i>

1204
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:49,300
<i>But of course,
per the King's decree</i>

1205
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:51,236
<i>Brazil will be forced
to wear blue today</i>

1206
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:53,037
<i>against the heavily-favored
home nation.</i>

1207
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:55,273
<i>How many goals
will Sweden win by?</i>

1208
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,374
<i>No one can say.</i>

1209
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:57,675
<i>But everyone agrees</i>

1210
01:27:57,677 --> 01:27:59,677
<i>Brazil will need nothing
short of a miracle</i>

1211
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,313
<i>to take home
the Jules Rimet trophy.</i>

1212
01:28:36,349 --> 01:28:38,616
<i>Over 50,000 already
in attendance</i>

1213
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:41,119
<i>and millions more tuning in
from around the world</i>

1214
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:43,288
<i>for the biggest
sporting event on earth.</i>

1215
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,522
<i>No team from outside Europe</i>

1216
01:28:44,524 --> 01:28:47,125
<i>has ever won the cup
on European soil.</i>

1217
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:49,794
<i>But that doesn't stop the rest
of the world from watching</i>

1218
01:28:49,796 --> 01:28:52,964
<i>and hoping that one day
that may change.</i>

1219
01:28:52,966 --> 01:28:55,600
<i>There's the King of Sweden,
Gustav VI Adolf</i>

1220
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,635
<i>with Queen Mountbatten
arriving in their box.</i>

1221
01:28:57,637 --> 01:29:00,004
<i>And now the entrance
of our host, Team Sweden.</i>

1222
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:01,606
<i>British-born manager,
George Raynor,</i>

1223
01:29:01,608 --> 01:29:03,208
<i>pulled players
from not just Sweden</i>

1224
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,676
<i>but other European countries.</i>

1225
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,711
<i>A bit of a European
all-star team, really.</i>

1226
01:29:06,713 --> 01:29:09,681
<i>And on the other side
Coach Feola and Team Brazil.</i>

1227
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:11,883
<i>And there's our young star
Nascimento</i>

1228
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:14,586
<i>now being called "Pele"
by his teammates.</i>

1229
01:29:14,588 --> 01:29:17,155
-<i> Fofinho, it's Pele!</i>

1230
01:29:17,157 --> 01:29:18,590
-<i> But make no mistake.</i>

1231
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,391
<i>Brazil will need
the rest of the team</i>

1232
01:29:20,393 --> 01:29:22,994
<i>to step up today against
the indomitable Swedes.</i>

1233
01:29:22,996 --> 01:29:25,697
<i>The entire nation
has shut down for the day</i>

1234
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:28,533
<i>as every Brazilian
from every walk of life</i>

1235
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:30,575
<i>comes together to watch
the big game.</i>

1236
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:07,906
<i>- And there's
the starting whistle.</i>

1237
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,608
<i>It's Zagallo to Vava,
Vava to the young Nascimento</i>

1238
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:13,144
<i>back to Nilton Santos,
and Parling lays into him.</i>

1239
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:15,780
<i>Watch out! Oh my.
No card there.</i>

1240
01:30:15,782 --> 01:30:17,348
<i>So either the referee
missed that one</i>

1241
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,983
<i>or he's going to let
Parling play rough.</i>

1242
01:30:18,985 --> 01:30:20,318
<i>Garrincha looking for Nascimento</i>

1243
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,452
<i>but he's marked
by three yellow shirts.</i>

1244
01:30:21,454 --> 01:30:22,787
<i>Garrincha passes to Zito.</i>

1245
01:30:22,789 --> 01:30:24,355
<i>Stolen away by Skoglund!</i>

1246
01:30:24,357 --> 01:30:25,723
<i>Sweden' first possession.</i>

1247
01:30:25,725 --> 01:30:27,058
<i>And now Raynor
calls for the shift!</i>

1248
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,127
<i>Here we go, the Swedes
moving quickly down field.</i>

1249
01:30:29,129 --> 01:30:31,262
<i>Passing it down to Parling,
a quick touch over to Hamrin</i>

1250
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:33,731
<i>Hamrin back to Liedholm and now
Hamrin breaks down the right wing.</i>

1251
01:30:33,733 --> 01:30:36,000
<i>Liedholm sends it to Parling,
Parling punches a swift pass</i>

1252
01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:37,535
<i>through Brazil's back bone
and into the area.</i>

1253
01:30:37,537 --> 01:30:39,637
<i>Simonsson down the middle,
Hamlin with a cross hitch.</i>

1254
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:41,272
<i>Simonsson, just wide!</i>

1255
01:30:41,274 --> 01:30:43,975
<i>A brilliant attack
from the Nordic Titans!</i>

1256
01:30:43,977 --> 01:30:46,144
<i>- And Sweden's applying
pressure early on.</i>

1257
01:30:46,146 --> 01:30:47,979
<i>Gilmar will take the goal kick.</i>

1258
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:50,581
<i>Trapped by Nascimento and now
finally with an opportunity.</i>

1259
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:52,283
<i>And here he goes,
spinning his way</i>

1260
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:53,952
<i>through Liedholm and Axbom.</i>

1261
01:30:53,954 --> 01:30:55,053
- Now's the time,<i> meu filho.</i>

1262
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:56,421
<i>- And Pele is back
the other way.</i>

1263
01:30:56,423 --> 01:30:58,089
<i>Nascimento trying
to do it all on his own!</i>

1264
01:30:58,091 --> 01:30:59,924
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

1265
01:30:59,926 --> 01:31:02,327
<i>A huge jolt from Parling.</i>

1266
01:31:02,329 --> 01:31:05,897
- <i>Sweden removing Pele from the
equation just as promised.</i>

1267
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:08,399
<i>They are determined
to stop his one-man show.</i>

1268
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:11,669
<i>And Pele still down holding on that
right knee he recently injured.</i>

1269
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:15,173
- <i>Brazil down a man and
Sweden looking to capitalize!</i>

1270
01:31:15,175 --> 01:31:17,041
<i>Kurt Hamrin plays the ball
up field to Liedholm</i>

1271
01:31:17,043 --> 01:31:18,209
<i>Liedholm straight to Lofgren.</i>

1272
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:20,144
<i>Now he's alone in the area.</i>

1273
01:31:20,146 --> 01:31:23,014
<i>Goal! Sweden!</i>

1274
01:31:23,016 --> 01:31:25,984
<i>Liedholm! Less than 4 minutes
on the clock.</i>

1275
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:27,752
<i>And this is big!</i>

1276
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:31,422
<i>- Everyone expected Sweden
to come out early</i>

1277
01:31:31,424 --> 01:31:33,658
<i>but no one expected it
this early.</i>

1278
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:37,562
<i>Confidence, our clear weak
point ever since 1950.</i>

1279
01:31:37,564 --> 01:31:41,232
<i>And it's hard not to think
of that tragic loss now.</i>

1280
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:43,701
<i>- The fans remembering
Coach Raynor's prediction</i>

1281
01:31:43,703 --> 01:31:46,671
<i>that an early score
would seal the victory.</i>

1282
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:50,208
<i>The King, the Queen,
George Raynor and Team Sweden</i>

1283
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,543
<i>they all want
the Jules Rimet trophy</i>

1284
01:31:52,545 --> 01:31:54,812
<i>to stay on friendly shores.</i>

1285
01:31:54,814 --> 01:31:57,615
<i>And stay it will
from the looks of things</i>

1286
01:31:57,617 --> 01:32:01,686
<i>as the victory celebrations
begin here in Rasunda Stadium</i>

1287
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:05,690
<i>even the eleven Brazilians
on the field can't deny the...</i>

1288
01:33:12,592 --> 01:33:13,858
- Pele!

1289
01:33:16,162 --> 01:33:18,963
<i>- Nascimento threw Sweden's
iron defense</i>

1290
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:21,899
<i>off their marks freeing up
the lad's teammates</i>

1291
01:33:21,901 --> 01:33:24,035
<i>and Brazil evens the score.</i>

1292
01:33:24,037 --> 01:33:26,170
<i>A most unexpected turn.</i>

1293
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:30,675
<i>And this is a Team Brazil like
we've never seen them before.</i>

1294
01:33:30,677 --> 01:33:32,844
<i>Just exuding confidence.</i>

1295
01:33:46,025 --> 01:33:48,025
<i>- It's Liedholm to Gren,
back to Gustavsson</i>

1296
01:33:48,027 --> 01:33:49,293
<i>and now over to Hamlin.</i>

1297
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:51,229
<i>Hamlin pushing it
forward to Simonsson.</i>

1298
01:33:51,231 --> 01:33:53,898
<i>And now Raynor sends his defense
forward in a full attack!</i>

1299
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,567
<i>It's Bergmark forward
to Liedholm marked by Orlando.</i>

1300
01:33:56,569 --> 01:33:57,969
<i>He passes to Simonsson.</i>

1301
01:33:57,971 --> 01:33:59,237
<i>Simonsson back to Liedholm</i>

1302
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:00,571
<i>and now it's Gustavsson again.</i>

1303
01:34:00,573 --> 01:34:03,574
<i>He sends it into the area
looking for Simonsson.</i>

1304
01:34:03,576 --> 01:34:04,942
<i>- It's Gilmar coming
out of the goal.</i>

1305
01:34:04,944 --> 01:34:05,977
<i>Gren crosses.</i>

1306
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:21,025
-<i> Vava!</i>

1307
01:34:21,027 --> 01:34:23,528
<i>- Vava now marked by Axbom,
Borjesson comes in</i>

1308
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,796
<i>for the stop but now Vava</i>
<i>dishes it</i> out to Garrincha.

1309
01:34:25,798 --> 01:34:28,399
<i>Bergmark's there, Garrincha
fakes, leaves the flank planted.</i>

1310
01:34:28,401 --> 01:34:29,867
<i>Garrincha now all alone!</i>

1311
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:31,035
Svennson comes out to challenge.

1312
01:34:31,037 --> 01:34:32,737
<i>The cross.
It's Vava!</i>

1313
01:34:32,739 --> 01:34:35,139
<i>Goal, 2 to 1!</i>

1314
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:37,308
<i>Brazil has taken the lead.</i>

1315
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,912
<i>Sweden caught off guard twice.</i>

1316
01:34:40,914 --> 01:34:43,447
<i>The Nordic Titans fall behind.</i>

1317
01:34:43,449 --> 01:34:46,017
<i>Brazil, 2.
Sweden, 1.</i>

1318
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:50,588
<i>And now, the entire Rasunda
Stadium in a state of shock.</i>

1319
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:52,957
<i>Expect Sweden to move fast
and strong</i>

1320
01:34:52,959 --> 01:34:54,792
<i>after that slap in the face...</i>

1321
01:35:04,504 --> 01:35:06,037
<i>Stolen away by Garrincha!</i>

1322
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,706
<i>Brazil regains control!
Garrincha dishes to Vava.</i>

1323
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,341
<i>Vava fakes Gren,
shakes off Bergmark</i>

1324
01:35:10,343 --> 01:35:12,310
<i>a beautiful, blind dish to Didi.</i>

1325
01:35:12,312 --> 01:35:14,478
<i>Brazil working
in perfect harmony.</i>

1326
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,681
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
something is shifting.</i>

1327
01:35:16,683 --> 01:35:18,349
<i>Brazil is coming alive!</i>

1328
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,293
<i>Now in complete control!</i>

1329
01:36:02,295 --> 01:36:04,862
<i>And it appears they're smiling!</i>

1330
01:36:11,037 --> 01:36:13,838
- Finally the world can see
Brazil's beauty!

1331
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,173
Our heroes
now in perfect harmony!

1332
01:36:16,175 --> 01:36:20,044
<i>It's beyond football.
It's the most beautiful game!</i>

1333
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:22,173
<i>- Ladies and Gentlemen,
the unthinkable!</i>

1334
01:37:22,175 --> 01:37:24,675
<i>Brazil, 3.
Sweden, 1.</i>

1335
01:37:24,677 --> 01:37:27,778
<i>The fans here in Sweden,
indeed, all of Europe</i>

1336
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:31,849
<i>even the King and Queen now
applauding the South Americans.</i>

1337
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:35,119
<i>George Raynor's strategy
no match for Brazil!</i>

1338
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:40,124
<i>And here comes Brazil!</i>

1339
01:37:40,126 --> 01:37:41,225
<i>Nascimento fakes Hamrin</i>

1340
01:37:41,227 --> 01:37:43,027
<i>Bergmark coming in for support.</i>

1341
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,462
<i>Now Nascimento sends the cross.</i>

1342
01:37:44,464 --> 01:37:46,797
<i>Pele sends a long cross
to the left wing.</i>

1343
01:37:46,799 --> 01:37:49,633
<i>It's Zagallo,
from the corner of the box.</i>

1344
01:37:49,635 --> 01:37:51,969
<i>Svennson dives.</i>

1345
01:37:51,971 --> 01:37:53,704
<i>Goal!</i>

1346
01:38:32,111 --> 01:38:35,246
<i>- Only seconds now
left on the clock</i>

1347
01:38:35,248 --> 01:38:38,182
<i>and it's Didi with
a cross to Nascimento...</i>

1348
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:59,970
<i>Brazil wins the 1958 World Cup!</i>

1349
01:40:14,647 --> 01:40:18,215
-<i> June 29th, 1958</i>

1350
01:40:18,217 --> 01:40:21,886
<i>the day Brazil won
our first World Cup.</i>

1351
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,721
<i>When the final whistle blew</i>

1352
01:40:23,723 --> 01:40:26,457
<i>I fainted
right there on the field.</i>

1353
01:40:26,459 --> 01:40:28,626
<i>When I finally opened my eyes</i>

1354
01:40:28,628 --> 01:40:31,562
<i>everything felt like a dream.</i>

1355
01:40:31,564 --> 01:40:35,733
<i>It had only been 18 months
since I first left home</i>

1356
01:40:35,735 --> 01:40:38,836
<i>but it felt like years.</i>

1357
01:40:38,838 --> 01:40:41,972
<i>My mother and father
came out to meet me.</i>

1358
01:40:41,974 --> 01:40:44,975
<i>And dad reminded me
of the promise I made</i>
