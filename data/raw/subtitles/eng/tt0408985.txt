1
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,403
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Georgia.

2
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,656
Sister Abernathy is singing
three times as loud as you...

3
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,158
and she just had her tonsils out, sugar.

4
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:22,040
How you gonna account for that?
- I'm sorry, Reverend, I thought I was.

5
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,042
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

6
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,504
Now, as an incentive for us all
to be in full voice...

7
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,300
on Sunday, our very own
Senator Dillings will be here...

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,970
to help us kick off our Community
Redevelopment Program. Amen.

9
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,638
Amen!

10
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,769
Hi, ma'am.

11
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,437
Okay.

12
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,193
Okay, here we go.
Domino, Lean Cuisine.

13
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,405
You take the paper towel, right?
Oh, and mayonnaise.

14
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:37,950
That's it.

15
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,034
That's it?
- Yes.

16
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,178
Hey, little mama, that pretty.
- Check it out, man. Yeah.

17
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,265
Let me holla at you for a sec.
Don't you got no time for nobody?

18
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,619
Hey, Miss Byrd.

19
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,789
Hey. Any problems with the car today?

20
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,417
Some gunshots.
Nobody mess with the car, though.

21
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,920
Okay, Darius, so you come by
in exactly 75 minutes and I'll be ready.

22
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,755
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

23
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>Yeah! Welcome back!
Welcome back to Emeril Live!</i>

24
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,098
<i>Emeril Lagasse here. We're
making chicken four ways tonight.</i>

25
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,185
<i>Wait till you see this dish
that I got coming up right now for you.</i>

26
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,604
Poulet Tchoupitoulas.

27
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,981
<i>Poulet Tchoupitoulas.</i>

28
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,357
<i>Oh, yeah, baby!</i>

29
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,819
<i>You can't see this at home,
but he is happy, this chicken.</i>

30
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>He's clapping for Doc Gibbs
and the Emeril Live Band!</i>

31
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,157
<i>He's just... Oh, yeah.</i>

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>You gotta split him in half...</i>

33
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,123
<i>and then we're gonna make
what I call a paste.</i>

34
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,293
<i>This chicken, skin-side down...</i>

35
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,836
Skin-side down.

36
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,632
<i>Now, for this Poulet Tchoupitoulas...</i>

37
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,176
<i>maybe some of this fum√© blanc
would work.</i>

38
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,304
<i>So, a little splash like this. Okay?</i>

39
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>Or a big splash!</i>

40
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,683
<i>Like that!</i>

41
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,814
<i>Bread pudding with onions,
with sweet corn, and andouille sausage.</i>

42
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,399
<i>Okay? Oh, yeah.</i>

43
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,694
<i>'Cause the Poulet Tchoupitoulas with
the bread pudding.</i>

44
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,862
<i>Bam!</i>

45
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,823
Look at that! That's looking good!

46
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,708
I don't suppose you're gonna have any?

47
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,586
Lord, no.
I don't eat nothing but my Lean Cuisine.

48
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,006
What is that book, anyway?

49
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:03,345
How do you like them greens?
- Oh, man, it's the bomb!

50
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,848
Well, good.
I mixed them this time, you know.

51
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,516
Collard greens...

52
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,186
and of course, your favorite,
turnip greens.

53
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,649
And I got plenty for your grandpa.
- Cool, thanks.

54
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,866
Sugar!

55
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,411
I just got these pants.

56
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,499
Always doing this.

57
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,069
Darius, what are you doing?

58
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,405
That is my private property.

59
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,241
I was just looking. What is it?
- It's nothing.

60
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,619
It's just what it says, just possibilities.

61
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,621
Just things I'm interested in.

62
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,956
Including this guy?

63
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,709
He your boyfriend?
- No.

64
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,295
He's just an idea.

65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,422
I mean, he's a real guy...

66
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,050
Why are you snooping around
my stuff, anyway?

67
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,141
So, what's his name?

68
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
Who?

69
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,646
None of your business.

70
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,732
I'll tell you what his name is.
His name is lucky mother...

71
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,900
What?

72
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,152
I know you might as well
go ahead leave my house now...

73
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,029
if you're gonna be using
that kind of language.

74
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,864
I'm sorry,
but short of you telling me his name...

75
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,533
I don't know anything better to call him.

76
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,951
His name is Sean.

77
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,454
- Sean Williams.
- Sean Williams, huh?

78
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,623
And you better not say anything
to anybody.

79
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,749
I ain't.

80
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,259
There he is, there he is.
Okay, I'm not gonna say anything.

81
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,970
You just talk to him.
- No, I'm not going to talk to him.

82
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,891
...just to say hello. All right?

83
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,185
Go and talk to him. Stop him.

84
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,606
Good morning, Miss Byrd.
- Mr. Williams.

85
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,568
What was that? Was that power flirting?

86
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,861
I don't know.

87
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,864
Oh, my, my, my.
You could crack a walnut with that ass.

88
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,031
Girl, stop!

89
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,911
Don't you have somewhere to be?

90
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,121
You know what we need to do?

91
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,332
We need to get you out of these
frumpy clothes and into something...

92
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,794
that shows off the real estate a little bit.
- No. Rochelle! This is a workplace.

93
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,421
Seriously. Then you need
to go down there...

94
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,839
and you need to talk to Mr. Big Stuff...

95
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,924
and you need to tell him
what you want for Christmas.

96
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,302
You just sit in his lap...
- Hey! Rochelle, come on, now.

97
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,179
What? No...
What are you worried about?

98
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,346
That they're going to fire you
in this place?

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,598
Take your coffee and go!

100
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,184
You're the best damn worker they got
in this whole damn place.

101
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,352
They're not gonna fire you.
You're just scared.

102
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,189
You're scared of some man
getting a hold of all that booty of yours!

103
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,523
Would you stop?

104
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,526
He could hold my booty.

105
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,488
Sean!

106
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,657
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

107
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,951
<i>stop in our health clinic
on the second floor...</i>

108
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,078
<i>to make sure your holidays...</i>

109
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,955
Right. This piece goes here.

110
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,375
There we go.

111
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,714
It's still crooked, but, yeah, that's good.

112
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
It's good, huh?
- No, no, no.

113
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:32,721
"Lip of shelf to fit
between grill bottom and leg brace."

114
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,935
That was supposed to be put on last,
but that's all right.

115
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,061
Thank you.

116
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,076
Miss Byrd.
- Georgia.

117
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,915
You had some light bulbs to change
or something, remember?

118
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,253
Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, light bulbs.

119
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,297
Light bulbs.
You know, they be relying on me...

120
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,382
Hey, I'll see you later.

121
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

122
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,766
Is there something I can help you with?

123
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,769
That's quite a nice grill.

124
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,565
Stainless steel, huh?
- Yeah. Durable.

125
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,278
Easy to clean?
- You just hose it down.

126
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,405
Just hose it down, huh?

127
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,665
Are you on your break?
- Yes.

128
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,711
Well, that's why I'm here.
I wanted to ask you something.

129
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,004
Ask me what?

130
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,511
Do you think I'll get my store discount
if I buy this thing?

131
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,931
Well, of course.
Of course you get your store discount.

132
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,142
But I just sold you a grill last week,
remember?

133
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,812
Yeah. But that was a hibachi.
That was for traveling.

134
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,109
I think somebody should've told you
when you got this thing...

135
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,821
that you're supposed to have a lawn
or a backyard or something.

136
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,867
Okay, how about a little more lifting
and a little less talking?

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,038
That looks good. Smells good, too.

138
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,041
All right, there you have it.

139
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,504
<i>A simple Creole roasted duck hash
en croute.</i>

140
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,632
Now, what you can do with this here...

141
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,593
is you can take a little bit
of the parsley...

142
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,013
and onion if you like,
if that's what you like.

143
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,683
But here's what I like to do.
Now, this is only for the brave ones.

144
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,645
For those
who don't get a lot of heartburn.

145
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:49,775
I like to kick some of that hot sauce
on there, spice it up something.

146
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,110
Please, come on and enjoy some.

147
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,532
Excuse me.

148
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,202
Now, I made this special for you.

149
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,703
I left the pine nuts out...

150
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,248
'cause I know they get up
under your bridgework sometimes.

151
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,624
Aren't you sweet?

152
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,292
Thank you.
- Excuse me.

153
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:12,047
Are you bucking for General
of the Salvation Army or what?

154
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,882
Stop feeding the moochers.

155
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,510
We always have...

156
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,096
our Wednesday morning
sales demonstration, Mr. Adamian.

157
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,473
No, no.
That's exactly the kind of thinking...

158
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,017
that put this store in Chapter 11
in the first place.

159
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,354
Now, Mr. Kragen, he's trying
to change the culture around here.

160
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,940
And by culture, I mean money.

161
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,359
Now, if you care about
your future here...

162
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,070
I suggest
you get with the program, Miss Byrd.

163
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,281
Have you read this? Kragen's awesome.

164
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,700
Everybody got one.
- Read it again.

165
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,369
Yeah. Yup?

166
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,037
Yup. Yup.

167
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,416
Well, then, hire another Santa.
Of course, he has to be fat.

168
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,792
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

169
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,545
<i>today's pre-Christmas sales
are on the second level.</i>

170
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,969
Georgia. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

171
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,346
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,473
No. I'm sorry.

173
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,518
I'm kind of in my own little world
up here.

174
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,896
What brings you to cookware?

175
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,732
It's that smell, to tell you the truth.
I can't help it.

176
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,110
It wafts down the escalator,
usually I can resist, but...

177
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,361
Oh.

178
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,447
Oh, well, please have some.

179
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,866
I'll probably get fired over this.

180
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,285
Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

181
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,787
This smells like my mama's house.

182
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,041
Thank you.

183
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,012
That's incredible. Incredible.

184
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,806
You know,
I'm just trying to sell the cookware.

185
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,310
Where did you become a chef?

186
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,146
France, or someplace European
or something?

187
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,525
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,986
I ain't never been further north
than Mobile, Alabama.

189
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,824
You know, it's just a hobby.
Something I really enjoy doing.

190
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,994
A hobby, huh?
- I never trained or anything.

191
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,997
You gonna train?
- I don't know.

192
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,333
Someday. Maybe.

193
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:16,338
Look. I was wondering,
sometime, if you're free...

194
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,007
I thought maybe we could...

195
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,010
Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

196
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,095
You got...

197
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,555
Oh... Georgia!

198
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,907
Whoa! What happened? Is she okay?

199
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,325
She hit her head.

200
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,204
Give me a hand, please.
- So what? It's just a bump.

201
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,624
Watch her head.
Don't hit her head again.

202
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:35,125
Miss Byrd, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Miss Byrd?

203
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,754
Can you hear the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

204
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,923
How many fingers am I holding up?

205
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,842
Is it one, two, or more?

206
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,764
What's going on here?
- Georgia, are you okay? Georgia?

207
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,224
Oh, man.

208
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,850
I think we should do a CAT scan.

209
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,519
What?
That's a big ticket number, isn't it?

210
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,604
I didn't think we did that kind of thing
around here.

211
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,190
Well, we got a new machine.
Used, but new to us.

212
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,816
Yeah, I don't know.

213
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,945
Sir, there could be
a huge workman's comp payout...

214
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,279
if we don't follow procedure.

215
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,156
All right,
only if it's absolutely necessary.

216
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,159
I knew you'd understand.
Paperwork. Follow me.

217
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,498
Are you okay, Miss Byrd?
- Kind of nice to be off my feet.

218
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,583
Here we go.

219
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,928
<i>Now, don't worry now, Miss Byrd.
Everything will be just fine.</i>

220
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,061
What?

221
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,023
No, this can't be right.

222
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,319
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,030
Oh, my God.

224
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,457
<i>We're just going to try
one more time, Miss Byrd.</i>

225
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,835
This is not good.

226
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,671
This is not good at all.

227
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,841
What are we looking at?

228
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,261
Well, we're looking at the results
of a virus you have, ma'am.

229
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,347
Virus?
- I believe it to be Lampington's disease.

230
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,893
It's very rare and it's very harmless,
in most cases.

231
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,520
In most cases?
- Yes.

232
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,022
What about my case?

233
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,650
Well, I thought I'd misread
the first scan, so I did the second scan.

234
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,903
But that just confirmed it, you see?

235
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,364
Okay, so I have Lampington's?
- Yes.

236
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,743
Well, which one do I have
if not the harmless one?

237
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,537
Ma'am, I'm very sorry to tell you...

238
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,580
But l...

239
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,749
You see,
in my opinion it's the kind that...

240
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,336
Ma'am, please! This is very, very
difficult for me. I'm just...

241
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,921
Oh, dear.

242
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,423
I need to lie down.

243
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,384
You see this area here?

244
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,054
This is your mass.
- My mass?

245
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,472
Your tumor.

246
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,100
And this, and this, and this.

247
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,146
I'm sorry, Georgia,
but the virus has caused...

248
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,732
a very advanced case
of Lampington's lesions.

249
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,902
Okay, well, exactly what
does that mean, Lampington's lesions?

250
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,947
And Dr. Gupta hasn't told you anything
about this, right?

251
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,657
Well, I tried.

252
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,243
Thanks.

253
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,955
Without treatment, it's terminal.

254
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,875
What? Like I'm gonna die?

255
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,961
I'm very, very sorry.

256
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,088
But I feel fine.

257
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,216
I feel great.
I just finished a Fat Flush and...

258
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,677
No dizziness or fainting?

259
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,680
No. I got a tiny bump on my head,
that's all.

260
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,933
It's diabolical. Such a sneaky disease.

261
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:43,355
I'm afraid, in your condition,
you've got about three weeks to live.

262
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,692
What? I got three weeks to live?

263
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,569
Are you shitting me?

264
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,363
Four on the outside. I'm sorry.

265
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:55,200
You're sorry? Well, I'm sorry.
I can't accept that.

266
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,120
Then I think you should see
Katherine Lenz.

267
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,080
Okay. Fine.

268
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,958
That's what I'm talking about.
Katherine Lenz, okay.

269
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,752
Is that the brain specialist?
- No.

270
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,713
She's your HMO administrator.

271
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,967
Let me just save you some time here,
Miss Byrd.

272
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,011
We won't cover you for this operation.

273
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,637
Well, what do you mean,
you won't cover me?

274
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,681
I'm covered through my HMO.

275
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,727
If you feel you're being treated unfairly,
these are our appeals procedures...

276
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,313
which you have every legal right
to pursue.

277
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:34,698
Well, what if I pay for it myself?
How much would that cost me?

278
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,339
The cost
of a median cranial debulking surgery...

279
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,217
is around $340,000.

280
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,427
That's without anesthesia.

281
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,721
You'll want that.

282
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,350
Check again,
make sure I'm not covered.

283
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,212
You wait and you wait
for something big to happen...

284
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,925
and then you find out you're gonna die.

285
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,024
I really wanted to meet you.

286
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,404
And I should've ate that.

287
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,283
I should've ate all that stuff.

288
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,577
Especially this.

289
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,080
Put my foot in that. Darius loved that.

290
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,418
Now I'll never get to Karlovy Vary.

291
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,380
Chef Didier.

292
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,689
<i>Hello?
- Hi.</i>

293
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,901
Hiya, sis!
I was just getting ready to call you.

294
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,320
You know, there's this guy
that I met in this club...

295
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,448
<i>and he said he's gonna introduce me
to some of his friends in Nashville...</i>

296
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,618
I just need you
to take care of the kids for three days.

297
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,245
What you gonna do in Nashville?

298
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,416
Girl, I am finally going to be
a country western singer.

299
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,127
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

300
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,506
Tanya, ain't no such thing
as a black country singer.

301
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,301
<i>You know, I am not asking you to
comment on the validity of my dreams.</i>

302
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:03,430
Now can you...
Hold on. Anton, would you stop it?

303
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,725
<i>This child is going to kill himself!
- Listen, that's why I'm calling you...</i>

304
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,603
What are you doing? Why can't you
watch the kids? What are you...

305
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,647
<i>- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- But, I'm...</i>

306
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,983
<i>I told you to stop jumping.
Do it again and see what happens.</i>

307
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,652
<i>You think I'm playing?</i>

308
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,367
Georgia, where have you been?
Adamian's been looking for you.

309
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,952
Good, 'cause I'm looking for him, too.

310
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,870
Why?
- I'm gonna take your advice.

311
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,955
Huh?

312
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,124
Look, remember when you said
life was too short to live the way I do?

313
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,294
Oh, I say a lot of things.
- Yeah, well, you were right.

314
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,422
What? What did I say?
What are you gonna do?

315
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:39,967
Georgia?

316
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,805
What did I say?

317
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,438
You don't knock?

318
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,149
You better have a hell of an excuse
for where you've been, Ms. Byrd.

319
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,526
I do, I do.

320
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,571
You see, Mr. Adamian...

321
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,032
Excuse me, would you mind?
This is very important.

322
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:08,120
Actually, it's a matter of life and...
- What?

323
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,122
Just turn it off.

324
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,251
Yeah.

325
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,421
You're killing me
with the potato peelers.

326
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,048
Move them
or I'll shove them down your throat.

327
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,138
You got a problem?

328
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,640
Yes, I do.

329
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,357
That's a $400 phone.

330
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,116
Now I feel better.

331
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,203
That's company property.

332
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,913
That's going to come out
of your paycheck.

333
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,291
Take it. Take the whole thing, okay?
It's worth it.

334
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,961
This is not about you, okay?
It's not about me.

335
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,254
It's about business.

336
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,423
It's about the company.
- Mr. Adamian.

337
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,551
I want you to hear this.
This man lives his philosophy.

338
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:10,265
<i>Rule One:
Life is not a popularity contest...</i>

339
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,351
<i>but it is a contest.</i>

340
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,686
<i>Boo-hoo, they don't like me.</i>

341
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,106
<i>Rule Two: You grab
that scared little loser inside you...</i>

342
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,067
<i>and beat the living crap out of him!</i>

343
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,029
<i>Rule three: When is enough, enough?
Enough is never enough.</i>

344
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,494
Enough is enough right now,
Mr. Adamian!

345
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,287
I'm trying to talk to you!

346
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,332
I'm trying to tell you what's...

347
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,461
Why am I even wasting my time
trying to talk to you?

348
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,588
You know what? I quit.

349
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,423
You what?
- I quit.

350
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,176
You can't.
- Why can't I?

351
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,554
Fourth quarter sales are in the toilet
in this store...

352
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,597
and all the other stores, too,
for that matter.

353
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:53,058
Your department has
the highest profit record in the place.

354
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,143
I just... I can't afford to lose you.

355
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,522
How come
you never told me this before?

356
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,983
I didn't want you to do
what you're doing right now.

357
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,317
Holding me up for more money.

358
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,863
Which I'm happy to pay.
As God is my witness.

359
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,491
As God is your witness, huh?
As God is your witness?

360
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,289
All right. I'm prepared to offer you
50 cents more an hour!

361
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,001
75 cents more an hour. 75.

362
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:26,717
<i>Ms. Byrd, $1 more an hour. $1.50.</i>

363
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,141
Hey, Georgia. Your shift done already?

364
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,561
Yeah, I'm done.

365
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,689
Listen, I feel terrible
about what happened the other day.

366
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,859
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- It wasn't your fault.

367
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,528
Well, anyway...

368
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,365
Hey, I have a pair of tickets
to the Hornets game.

369
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,868
Now, the game
is a couple of weeks away...

370
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:56,497
but I know you're a busy woman,
so I wanted to put my bid in early.

371
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,959
Sean, there is nothing I would rather do
than to go to that game with you.

372
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,586
Yeah? That's great.

373
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:07,341
Well, look, I figured we'll go
to dinner early, then after the game...

374
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,759
I can't go, Sean.

375
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,721
I mean, it's not like I don't want to. I...

376
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,391
I can't.

377
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,938
You have to be somewhere else.

378
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,315
Yeah.

379
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,403
Hey, well, Georgia. Georgia!

380
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,072
Look.

381
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,116
I already paid for the ticket, so...

382
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,996
maybe your plans might change, huh?

383
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,679
Brothers and Sisters...

384
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,223
I'm sad to announce that...

385
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:00,602
Senator Dillings will not be gracing
our flock this morning as planned.

386
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,730
Pressing business
in our nation's capital has kept him.

387
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:08,151
But I'd like to take a moment of prayer
for the Senator.

388
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:12,823
He toils so hard
toting the burden of our welfare.

389
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:17,119
And I ask the good Lord
to guide his hand...

390
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,914
in his important good works. Amen.

391
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,791
Amen.
- Amen.

392
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:26,336
Oh, why me?

393
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,426
Oh, dear Lord, why me?
- Georgia?

394
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,136
Why me, Lord? Why me, Lord?

395
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,681
- Oh, dear Lord! Lord, why me?
- Bless the Lord.

396
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,017
Oh, Lord, no!

397
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,312
Oh, no, no.

398
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:46,773
Lord! Lord, come on!

399
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,359
Come on, Lord, why?

400
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,864
I don't understand!

401
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,326
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

402
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,369
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

403
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,038
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

404
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,248
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

405
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,585
<i>I never slept around
even though my sister did!</i>

406
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,338
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

407
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,173
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

408
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,593
<i>I never cussed my boss
or nothing like that!</i>

409
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,637
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

410
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,305
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

411
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,015
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

412
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,433
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

413
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,851
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

414
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,019
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

415
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,521
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

416
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:29,691
<i>Come on, now, somebody tell me why!</i>

417
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,985
<i>Why?
- Why?</i>

418
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,070
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

419
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,112
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

420
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,197
<i>Why, please?
- Why?</i>

421
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,281
<i>I got to know</i>

422
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,242
<i>I got to know, God!</i>

423
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,701
<i>Why me?</i>

424
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,581
<i>Why? Oh, why?</i>

425
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:48,377
<i>Why, Lord? Why? Oh, come on</i>

426
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:54,508
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

427
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:59,054
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

428
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:58,989
You're sure you want to liquidate
the entire IRA? All of it?

429
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,074
Yeah, and the bonds my mama left me.

430
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,495
Well, I'm sure a disciplined woman
such as yourself...

431
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,539
has a very useful purpose
for this money.

432
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:12,753
Yes, I do.

433
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,923
I'm just gonna blow it.

434
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,719
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we want to thank you...</i>

435
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,513
<i>for flying with us on Christmas Day.</i>

436
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,766
<i>We're going to make your trip
as comfortable as possible.</i>

437
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:29,811
Stewardess...

438
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,981
this person behind me
is giving me a hard time.

439
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,650
Okay, sure, sir.

440
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,528
Ma'am, would you mind
lowering your knees...

441
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,864
so the gentleman in front of you
can put his seat back down?

442
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,494
Actually, I very much would mind.

443
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,956
Am I going to have to
call the Air Marshal, ma'am?

444
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,375
People been calling me ma'am
a lot lately...

445
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,836
and, you know,
I'm hardly older than you.

446
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,170
Do people call you ma'am?

447
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,840
No... No, they don't.

448
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,676
Is there a problem here?

449
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:13,272
Yes. Yes, there is.

450
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,024
I'm gonna tell you what the problem is.

451
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,945
This greedy airline put all these seats
so close together...

452
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,655
just so they can make more money.

453
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,532
Makes sense.
- Yeah.

454
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,950
All right?

455
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,244
Now, I'm not flying
all the way to Prague...

456
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,204
with some stranger in my lap.

457
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,206
I know that's right.

458
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,626
That's a big boy.
That's a big old man right there.

459
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,003
I can't... Look at him.

460
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,882
Had you chosen to fly first class...

461
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,719
Ma'am? Hi.

462
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,805
Had you chosen to fly first class
instead of economy...

463
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,433
you would have had plenty of room
in one of our cocoons.

464
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,727
How much is it?
- Beg your pardon?

465
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,979
How much for the damn cocoon?

466
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,355
Work it!
- I like that.

467
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,024
All right.
- Hear, hear.

468
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,032
For our first class clients
flying with us during the holidays...

469
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,493
we thought we would do
something special.

470
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:25,010
Thank you. Wait, don't go.
Just leave that right here.

471
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,484
Look at that taxi line.

472
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,779
Oh, this is gonna take forever.

473
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,246
That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

474
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:47,676
Who is that?

475
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,931
What's going on?
- I'm not sure, Congressman.

476
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,808
Who is that?

477
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,021
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter...

478
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:01,732
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

479
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,150
Wow.

480
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,624
Hello. Welcome!

481
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,459
Thank you.
- Welcoming.

482
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:25,255
You are here for retreat of the health?
- I guess you could say that.

483
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,382
How are you?

484
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,427
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

485
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,597
Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
- Great, great.

486
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,522
Oh, you are from Louisiana?

487
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,483
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

488
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,694
Senator Dillings is here skiing?
- Yes.

489
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,823
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

490
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,575
Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
- Okay.

491
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,207
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

492
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:23,355
<i>Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
- Madame Byrd?</i>

493
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,317
Welcome to Grandhotel Pupp.

494
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,945
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

495
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,446
Pupp.
- Pupp.

496
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,906
Pupp.
- Pupp.

497
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,742
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

498
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,328
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

499
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:41,081
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

500
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,042
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

501
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,878
Don't y'all have anything available now?

502
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,462
I'll check it.

503
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,812
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

504
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,231
I've never noticed, madam.

505
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,234
Only the presidential suite.

506
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,155
It's ¬Ä3,000 a night.

507
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,492
About $4,000 a night.

508
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,329
Did you see me blink?

509
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,874
Madam Byrd, welcome.

510
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,002
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

511
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:30,631
Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
- Yes.

512
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:35,469
Matthew Kragen.
- You know Mr. Kragen?

513
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,515
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

514
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,103
You playing with me, right?
- Pardon me?

515
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,898
Oh, not you, Him.
- Excuse me.

516
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,691
Is the spelling okay?

517
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,861
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

518
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,488
Thank you.
- Mr. Kragen, sir.

519
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:57,157
I hope everything's okay.
- Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

520
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,869
And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
- Well, not this trip, Arturo.

521
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,412
This is strictly business.

522
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,999
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

523
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:09,253
Well, I won't, but she will.
- Lf I need you, I'll call you.

524
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:10,671
Excellent.

525
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,382
Can you believe that?

526
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,930
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything...

527
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,516
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

528
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,228
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

529
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,815
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

530
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,983
Okay.

531
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,778
Matthew, Miss Burns.

532
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,657
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

533
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,619
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

534
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,496
Congressman!

535
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:52,504
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

536
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,675
Who is that?

537
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:01,263
<i>Oh, Mademoiselle Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.</i>

538
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,933
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have...

539
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,186
a very important meeting together.

540
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:14,693
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

541
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,613
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

542
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:21,074
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

543
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,660
No, madam.

544
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,663
Now, more reasonable.

545
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,669
Bye-bye.
- Bye!

546
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,600
What world was I living in?

547
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,694
Make me international.

548
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,365
We could try.

549
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,477
Give me my money.

550
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,313
I can't wear this.

551
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,650
Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

552
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:57,254
You think anybody'd call me ma'am
in this outfit?

553
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,506
No.
- Definitely not.

554
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,440
<i>Table for one, please.
- Yes, mademoiselle.</i>

555
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,525
Please.

556
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,038
May I take your pashmina?

557
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,124
Oh, is that what this thing is?

558
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,169
Sure.

559
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,255
Hello, sister.

560
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,719
Who the hell is she?

561
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,096
<i>Mademoiselle.
- Thank you.</i>

562
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,443
Her name is Georgia Byrd.

563
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:05,280
She's loaded and she's an old crony
of Dillings from Louisiana.

564
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:08,450
I...

565
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,952
I'm sorry.

566
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,121
No. It's okay, it's okay.

567
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,749
Water. Flat. No ice.

568
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,626
Please, serve everyone.
- Of course.

569
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:20,254
Matthew, what are the chances
of our meeting Chef Didier?

570
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,048
Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

571
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,092
Is that right? Arturo!

572
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,760
Yes, sir.

573
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,683
Make sure Didier comes and says hello
to the table.

574
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,685
And fire that guy.

575
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,113
<i>For the specialties de maison,
we have the cassoulet.</i>

576
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,408
We have risotto Barolo with truffles.

577
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:53,245
<i>The rouget citrus beurre blanc
with capers.</i>

578
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,456
Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

579
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:01,837
And a braised lamb shank
with blood orange relish.

580
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:04,339
Blood orange relish.

581
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,009
Now, that all sounds so good.

582
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,760
Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

583
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:12,222
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

584
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,976
Well, I guess I better try them all
tonight then.

585
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,688
<i>Tout? All?</i>

586
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,233
<i>Tout, baby! Tout de suite.</i>

587
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:26,361
Do you think he would do a risotto
without the dairy?

588
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,490
I think I'm going to have
the rouget citrus without the potatoes...

589
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,158
<i>and the blanc without the beurre.</i>

590
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,337
No butter, no cream, no wheat,
no dairy, no fat!

591
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,881
<i>Merde! Why do they bother to eat?</i>

592
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,300
Next time, stick this in my neck!

593
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,776
And no substitutions?

594
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,042
I will do it myself.

595
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,755
She has got them eating
right out of her hand.

596
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:30,759
Well, she's sure not watching
her cholesterol.

597
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:33,387
I wish I could command
attention like that.

598
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,974
Is that the lamb?

599
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,269
<i>Mademoiselle.
- Oh, look at that!</i>

600
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:47,276
Looks so good!
Everything looks so good.

601
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:55,534
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

602
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,787
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

603
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:01,665
Amen.

604
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,836
I was thinking maybe we could get Bob
up to speed tomorrow at lunchtime.

605
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,338
Yes, Matthew. I'd like to know more
about this merger.

606
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:09,631
Here he is!

607
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,722
<i>How do you find everything,
mademoiselle?</i>

608
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,640
Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,143
I think he'll be by.

610
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,314
I'm sure he'll be right over, sir.

611
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:29,568
I'll be up there, on top of the mountain.
- Okay. Will Margaret join us?

612
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,236
Because we do need to talk
some business.

613
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:32,905
Okay, what time?

614
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,532
Depends on Kragen's schedule.

615
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,576
You know, where I come from...

616
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:41,121
we do a barbecue quail
with an andouille pudding.

617
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:43,749
I think you would just love it.

618
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,127
And, you know, call me crazy...

619
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:50,088
but am I tasting rendered lards
of pork belly here?

620
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,215
<i>Oui?</i>

621
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,841
Pork belly?

622
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,385
Oink, oink.

623
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:57,971
Very sensitive palate.

624
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:02,017
Half clarified butter and half pork fat.

625
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:05,229
I knew it.
- No? But you keep it to yourself.

626
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:09,691
You know how some people are
about pork's fat.

627
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,401
Yeah.

628
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,113
They don't like the pork...

629
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:24,206
Chef Didier, you're crazy!

630
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:31,380
Matthew, you seem to know everybody.
Who is she?

631
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:34,049
I was gonna ask the Senator
the same question.

632
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:37,344
I don't know her.
- Really? You sure about that?

633
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,389
Well, for your information,
I don't know everyone who's black.

634
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:43,767
Well, apparently she knows you
from New Orleans?

635
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:48,272
Really? Maybe it was last year's
Entrepreneurs of Diversity.

636
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,400
Well, whoever she is, I'd sure like
to have her ordering 10 plates...

637
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,819
at a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser.

638
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,572
Why, Bob?
Haven't I've been contributing enough?

639
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,240
No, Matthew, I didn't mean it that way.

640
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,034
You've been very generous
and it's much appreciated.

641
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,255
Dr. Gupta.

642
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,759
Dr. Gupta.

643
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,932
Sir, if this is a medical question,
I'm still on my break...

644
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:27,394
for two and a half more minutes.

645
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:30,439
Well, actually, excuse me,
it's not about me.

646
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,567
It's about Georgia Byrd.
Remember the lady who hit her head?

647
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:37,196
Sir, why do you think
I'm so desperately trying to relax?

648
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,615
Well, she's been acting
really strange lately.

649
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,950
She up and quit her job.
Nobody's seen her.

650
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:45,537
And I was wondering if you had said
anything that might have upset her?

651
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,789
Or if you know something...
- I'm sorry.

652
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:51,168
Patient privacy prevents me
from commenting, I'm very sorry...

653
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,962
You're gonna tell me!
- Okay, okay.

654
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,548
Sir?
- Tell me!

655
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,176
Georgia Byrd is going to die.

656
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,094
What?
- I'm very sorry.

657
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,305
What?
- I'm very sorry, sir.

658
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,891
No, this can't be.

659
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,978
My break is over. We can talk about it.
Come, put me down.

660
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:20,739
That's nice.

661
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:55,023
I do it with love.

662
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,238
Okay.

663
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,712
And the gonging, flushing
negative energy.

664
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:24,386
Wait. I gotta use the bathroom.

665
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:39,860
They say these waters
have curative powers...

666
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,987
let you live to be 100.

667
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:45,073
Yeah, well, I hope they work fast.

668
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:50,078
Clarence Dillings.
Senator Clarence Dillings.

669
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,832
I know who you are.
- Oh, so, we have met.

670
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,293
Entrepreneurs of Diversity?

671
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:59,129
No, afraid not.
- Washington?

672
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,264
They do know each other.

673
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:10,807
Well.

674
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,064
Church?

675
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,777
But I didn't go to church last Sunday.
- That's right.

676
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:26,240
You know, you left a whole lot
of church folk disappointed, Senator.

677
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,325
People who voted for you.

678
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:34,289
I hope you'll communicate
my sincerest regrets.

679
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,377
I don't wanna have nothing
to do with your regrets.

680
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:40,462
I got my hands full of my own.

681
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:44,258
I got a gut feeling about that woman.
She's trouble.

682
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,427
You know, Matthew,
who was it who said:

683
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:50,973
"Adversity is the stone
on which I sharpen my blade"?

684
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,266
Me.

685
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,404
Excuse me.

686
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:13,370
Ms. Byrd, is it?
We've not been introduced.

687
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,165
My name...
- There's no need.

688
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,208
Everybody knows Matthew Kragen.

689
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:22,087
The man for whom
"enough is never enough."

690
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,098
I mean, who is she?

691
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:34,808
How do I know she's not part of some...

692
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:36,685
consumer watchdog group
or something?

693
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,437
Well, it's not like there's some law...

694
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,523
against being at the same hotel
with a congressman and a senator.

695
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,109
Actually, there is,
if they're on my plane and my dime.

696
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:48,906
Well, watchdogs don't stay
in $4,000-a-night hotel suites, okay?

697
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,701
So, how about you and I
just forget all about...

698
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,162
retail empire building...

699
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,332
and let's just take a little bath? Yeah?

700
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,584
I'll take a bath, all right.

701
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,295
A $500-million bath
if these mergers don't go through.

702
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,507
You just keep your eyes open
and remember why we're here.

703
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,978
Are you all right, Madam Byrd?

704
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,442
Yeah. I just... I just love these sheets.

705
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:29,613
I love them. I was just taking them
for a little ride around the block.

706
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:32,282
I am Gunther. Floor valet.

707
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:36,036
Oh, that was you
that put my clothes away.

708
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,330
Yeah.
- Okay.

709
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:42,417
Well, Miss Gunther,
what do you do for fun around here?

710
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,878
What do I do for fun, madam?

711
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:49,216
I shine the guests' shoes
when they leave them out in the hall.

712
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,136
If that will be all.

713
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,890
No, actually, that won't, Miss Gunther.

714
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:00,602
I'm gonna be wanting to have
one of these snowboarding lessons.

715
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:04,398
Very good. Will that be all?
- No, no.

716
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:06,275
No, it won't.

717
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:10,362
I want some more
of these spa services. Like maybe...

718
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:16,451
Maybe this algae flotation wrap
and the reflexology massage.

719
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:19,288
No anti-aging treatment?

720
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:24,877
No, I ain't worried about aging.
- So, that will be all?

721
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,883
Yes! The colon irrigation treatment.

722
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,846
That's my gift to you.
Sort of like a "let's be friends" gesture.

723
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:40,142
Now, you think of me
when you're having it!

724
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,021
Oh.

725
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,738
I've been waiting my whole life
to do something like this.

726
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:54,490
All right then, let's go.
- Okay.

727
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:56,617
Just lean forward. Lean forward.
- Lean forward.

728
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,536
Left leg, that's it. And go!

729
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:04,416
Go, that's it. Just go! Yeah!
You got it, lean forward! Balance!

730
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,668
Yeah! That's it. Lean...

731
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:09,922
Are you all right?

732
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,049
Let's go.

733
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,593
Let's turn.
- Oh, man.

734
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:16,428
You feel the rhythm?
- I feel the rhythm.

735
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,222
Yeah. Feel the rhythm.
- That's good.

736
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:20,474
That's it. Right. You got it?
- I think I got it.

737
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:23,352
So, go! Just lean forward.
Lean forward and go!

738
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:26,688
Lean forward. Lean forward.
Lean forward.

739
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,690
Lean forward.
- Yeah, that's it, that's great.

740
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:31,235
Oh, Lord.
- That's great. No, no, no.

741
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,781
Slow down. Slow down a bit.
No. Slow down!

742
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:39,993
Turn the board sideways!
Slow, slow down!

743
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:43,747
Stop!

744
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:54,716
<i>Scusi! Watch out!
Get out of my way! Watch it!</i>

745
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,142
What?

746
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,775
It's steep here, Matthew.

747
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,319
Hey, Matthew, this is
a Black Diamond run.

748
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:15,988
Yeah, you're looking good.

749
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:18,907
Look at her go!
- Matthew?

750
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,326
Look at her go!
- Matthew?

751
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:24,454
Matthew!

752
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,310
Enjoying yourself?
- Not really.

753
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:47,519
Please, don't do that.

754
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,271
I guess you don't believe in turning?

755
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:52,399
I believe in it,
I just don't know how to do...

756
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,943
Oh, hold me, hold me! Please!

757
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,283
Please get off of my skis!
- Okay, I think I've got it.

758
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:02,409
Let me go.

759
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,663
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

760
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:07,998
Damn you!

761
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:11,460
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

762
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,420
Watch your mouth!

763
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,594
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

764
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:21,970
Watch out!

765
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,148
Get over here, you!

766
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:37,778
They should get you off this mountain!
You figure...

767
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:04,263
You... You ski like that...

768
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,015
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

769
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:09,142
That's fine with me, baby.

770
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:16,066
Oh, my God.

771
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:26,660
And we are going to leave you now...

772
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:30,205
to relax and meditate.
- Thank you.

773
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:36,420
Why, Lord?

774
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:39,840
I don't want to die.

775
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:42,759
I want to live.

776
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:51,059
What are you trying to do to me, huh?

777
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:53,145
You have big knot in neck.

778
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:58,025
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

779
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,611
Excuse me? Are you suggesting that l...

780
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:03,322
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

781
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,617
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up...

782
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,244
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

783
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,580
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

784
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:12,998
Excuse me.

785
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,592
Hey. Hey!

786
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,430
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

787
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:32,392
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

788
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:36,021
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

789
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,774
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

790
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:41,819
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

791
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:43,320
And he's a married man.

792
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,864
At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

793
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,825
Don't take it out on Brigitta.

794
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:49,743
Thank you.

795
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:55,082
Anyway, enjoy your massage.

796
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:57,459
Thank you very much.
- Bye.

797
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:24,027
Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

798
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,160
I knew it.

799
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:36,498
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

800
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,333
I'm marked by this.

801
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:43,130
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

802
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:47,176
Well, I wouldn't lose too much sleep
over what other people think.

803
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:50,888
Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

804
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,683
I've been at the company six years.

805
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,769
I've worked really hard, you know?

806
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:02,232
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

807
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,610
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

808
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:07,946
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

809
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,826
Look, I know this whole story.

810
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,163
My sister was seeing a married man.

811
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,499
Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

812
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,752
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

813
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:25,464
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope...

814
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:30,385
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

815
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:33,847
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

816
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:35,432
They ain't leaving their wives.

817
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:38,310
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

818
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:42,856
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

819
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:46,026
What am I going to do?
I didn't finish school.

820
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:49,613
Well, then you go back to school.

821
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,032
There now, we solved it.

822
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:54,910
Let's tackle something heavy,
like world hunger.

823
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:58,872
Well, did you at least find out
what she's doing here?

824
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:02,167
She's just here enjoying herself.
Unlike us.

825
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,627
How can I enjoy myself?

826
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,712
Dillings is suddenly telling me
that his committee...

827
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,381
has problems with my acquisitions.

828
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:10,175
Matthew, what does that
have to do with Georgia?

829
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:14,096
Oh, Georgia, is it now?
Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

830
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:17,933
I don't know, Matthew.
She said she worked in retail.

831
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:20,936
Did I mention to you how she told me...

832
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,272
you were gonna have
a shitty fourth quarter?

833
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,066
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

834
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:27,693
I barely know about our fourth quarter.

835
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,654
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

836
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,240
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you...

837
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:36,326
triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

838
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,163
You know what? That's it. That's it!

839
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:43,208
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

840
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,795
If I don't have their support,
my bill is dead on the floor.

841
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,425
That's what's gonna happen, see?
I need to relax, that's what I need to do.

842
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:55,262
Oh, God, my blood pressure is...

843
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:59,349
You know what?
I need to just do something to relax.

844
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,145
Come here...
- Take a cold plunge, Matthew.

845
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:04,730
What?

846
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:10,903
Georgia?

847
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:22,247
You guys seen Georgia?
- I ain't seen her in a while.

848
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:23,624
No.

849
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:35,052
Hey, what are you doing,
casing the place?

850
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,515
Where's Georgia?
- Hey, you're that guy.

851
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,725
You're the Possibilities man.
The guy in the book.

852
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,977
What? What book?
What are you talking about?

853
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:45,437
Where's Georgia?
- Hold on.

854
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,356
What?
- Hold on.

855
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,079
Here, I found this in her garbage can.

856
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:04,164
That's my employee of the month photo.

857
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,299
Did she say anything about me?
- No.

858
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,552
Why? You like her, right?

859
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:20,597
Easy, killer.
Did she say where she was going?

860
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,851
A place with healing waters
or something.

861
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:27,729
Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

862
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:30,107
Maybe it's in here somewhere.

863
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,901
I know she told me before she left.

864
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:38,115
I think this is it.
Calamari Vary, I think the name is.

865
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,201
Karlovy Vary?
- Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

866
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,170
Oh, good evening, Georgia.
- Hi.

867
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:52,713
How are you this evening?
- Good, thanks.

868
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:53,922
Why don't you join us?

869
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,009
We got plenty of room at our table,
don't we, Matthew?

870
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:01,305
Sure, yeah, why not?
- No, please. Please, come join us.

871
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,016
Yes, come, it's decided.
- Good evening, Ms. Byrd.

872
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:08,395
Chef Didier has reserved a special table
for you. If you'd like to come with me.

873
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:12,441
Well, thank you,
but why don't you join me?

874
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:14,359
It seems I have a special table.

875
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:21,325
Thanks so much for having us.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

876
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,202
You really look beautiful.

877
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,912
Yes, you do.
- Thank you.

878
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:26,788
You really do.
- Thank you.

879
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:30,042
Pull up a chair, Matthew.

880
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:37,674
Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

881
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:47,059
Could you maybe just... A little room.

882
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:53,649
It...

883
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:57,069
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

884
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:59,029
No, you are my preferred guest...

885
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:02,825
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

886
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,078
But I will make no substitutions.

887
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,329
Don't worry.

888
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:10,666
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

889
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:12,835
No substitutions?

890
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:16,797
No substitutions.

891
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,137
That was delicious.

892
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:27,266
Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
- Thank you.

893
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:30,144
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

894
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:31,478
I was.

895
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:34,189
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

896
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:36,733
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

897
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:41,655
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

898
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,575
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

899
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,994
You sold all of your bonds?

900
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,204
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee...

901
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:52,207
I'm always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself...

902
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:53,792
operate the market.

903
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,670
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you...

904
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,338
pessimistic about the future?

905
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,633
Well, Congressman...
- Bob, please. Bob.

906
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:06,263
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

907
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,140
Oh, come on, Georgia.

908
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,766
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

909
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:11,685
I would very much like to continue this...

910
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:13,437
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

911
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:17,065
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

912
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:18,400
Moser? What's that?

913
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:22,362
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

914
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,990
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

915
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,785
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

916
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:32,372
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

917
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,667
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

918
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,212
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

919
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,508
Oh, that is amazing.

920
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:44,760
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

921
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:46,094
It sounds like fun! Let's do that.

922
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,680
That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

923
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:53,101
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

924
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:05,280
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

925
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,406
Yes.

926
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,743
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current...

927
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:12,704
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

928
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:15,415
So, we don't want that, okay?

929
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,377
So, are you ready?
- Yes, I am.

930
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,421
Go get them, Matthew!
- Come on!

931
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:25,676
Damn.

932
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,555
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

933
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,224
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

934
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,143
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

935
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:37,271
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

936
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:39,523
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

937
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:41,358
He may have met his match in Georgia.

938
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:42,651
Camcorder!

939
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:44,486
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

940
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,864
We're rolling! Go ahead!
- Okay!

941
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:49,449
Oh, oh. He's gonna... There we go.
He's going over the rail.

942
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:51,285
Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

943
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,078
Oh, my God.

944
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:54,288
Oh, come on.

945
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:57,624
All right, here we go.

946
01:05:57,749 --> 01:06:00,544
Okay. Look.

947
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:04,506
I have told you before...

948
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,093
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

949
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,180
What, like people died?
- Yeah.

950
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,099
Sugar.
- Which one first?

951
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,185
Ladies first.

952
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,687
Ladies first. Okay.

953
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:20,230
Ready?

954
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,774
Three...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

955
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:28,197
Okay. All right.
- Three, two, one, go!

956
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,000
Perfect.

957
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,923
Whoa, baby!

958
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:47,424
Okay.

959
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:52,554
Three, two, one, go!

960
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:55,849
Is there a problem?

961
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,352
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

962
01:06:58,435 --> 01:06:59,853
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

963
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:02,773
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

964
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:05,400
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

965
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:08,153
Here I come. Watch it now!

966
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:10,781
Oh, hold it now!

967
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:12,407
I can't jump!

968
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:15,744
Canopy not connected to rigging!

969
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:18,413
Mechanical difficulties!
- It's all right.

970
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,791
I don't know why this happens!
- It's all right.

971
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,919
What are you doing?
- Klaus, just shut up!

972
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:26,046
Oh, man.

973
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:29,925
It's so...
- Disappointing.

974
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:42,396
Really?

975
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:47,860
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

976
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:48,944
Oh, yeah.

977
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:50,779
She lives on the edge.

978
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,032
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

979
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,951
True existentialist.

980
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:01,707
Hero worship, bought with a kiss
and an extravagant tip.

981
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,626
She's a fraud, I tell you.

982
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,922
<i>Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, Fr√§ulein Gunther.</i>

983
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:25,647
Mr. Kragen.
- How are you?

984
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,815
Good.

985
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,486
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd...

986
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:35,657
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

987
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:38,577
Quietly.
- Of course, Mr. Kragen.

988
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:48,962
Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

989
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,340
A prince? A real prince?

990
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:54,343
They have a charity dinner in town...

991
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:56,720
where everybody gets to feel generous.

992
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:00,349
I tell you, these people are all alike.

993
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,947
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

994
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,824
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

995
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,660
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

996
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:24,331
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting...

997
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:28,001
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

998
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:34,216
You know...

999
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:39,221
you and I, we know the secret of life.

1000
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,306
Well, what is that?

1001
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:44,726
The secret of life is butter.

1002
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:48,480
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

1003
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:51,233
Butter, huh?
- Butter, yes!

1004
01:09:52,276 --> 01:09:54,486
<i>Three cases of √©crevisses.</i>

1005
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:56,572
Hotel.

1006
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,213
Georgia, there you are.
- We were worried you checked out.

1007
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:56,381
No, not quite yet.
- Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

1008
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:58,550
Kragen's got it all arranged.
- No, I don't think so.

1009
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:00,677
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

1010
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,764
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

1011
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,641
Look, I just think I want to...

1012
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,851
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

1013
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:09,686
You probably just wanna take it easy.

1014
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:13,106
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

1015
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,651
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

1016
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:18,362
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

1017
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:20,072
It's gonna be great.
- Great time. Great time.

1018
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,740
Great time had by all.

1019
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,742
Fine, fine.
- Good, it's settled then.

1020
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:26,119
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

1021
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:27,788
Just take a little nap.

1022
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:34,962
<i>If you're reading this letter,
my disease has run its course.</i>

1023
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:40,092
<i>Enclosed is some money for my burial.</i>

1024
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,639
<i>I would like to be cremated.</i>

1025
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:48,475
<i>Spent my whole life in a box.</i>

1026
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:51,728
<i>I don't want to be buried in one.</i>

1027
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:57,651
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
because of turbulence...</i>

1028
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,611
<i>the captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

1029
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:00,696
Excuse me.

1030
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,780
<i>Please return to your seats
and remain seated...</i>

1031
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,117
<i>with your seat belt fastened
while the sign is illuminated.</i>

1032
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,494
Scared of flying?

1033
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:12,749
Do I look scared to you?
- I used to be scared, too.

1034
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:15,961
It helps if you color.

1035
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:28,098
Georgia, whatever you got,
give me some.

1036
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:30,934
Believe me, you don't want it.

1037
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:32,686
Place your bets.

1038
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:34,021
Don't know where to go.

1039
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,690
I'm following you wherever you go.

1040
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:40,027
That's a lunatic bet.
That's just a lunatic bet right there.

1041
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:42,279
Georgia, that's a lot of money.

1042
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:43,489
I know, huh?

1043
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,866
You always bet on black, baby.
- Yeah?

1044
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:48,535
Yes.
- All right. I'll give that a try.

1045
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,625
No more bets.
- Matthew, Matthew...

1046
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,294
doing it your own way.
Georgia's our Lady Luck tonight.

1047
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:58,754
Come on, 17.

1048
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:01,632
Come on, 17.

1049
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:03,467
Here we go.
- There it goes.

1050
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:07,721
17 black.
- Yeah!

1051
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:12,851
That's the ball over there.
- Where to next, lucky?

1052
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,478
What was that number I just played?
- 17.

1053
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:16,396
Seventeen. Sounds good to me.

1054
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,941
Isn't it a bit reckless
to bet on the same number twice?

1055
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:22,319
I guess that's why they call it gambling
and not crocheting.

1056
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:24,279
Gambling it is.

1057
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:26,740
Well, the house is loving you guys.
- I'm in.

1058
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:28,575
Place your bets.
- Me, too.

1059
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:31,703
Here we go, here we go,
here we go. Red.

1060
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:34,706
No more bets.

1061
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:37,292
Come on, show me something.
- Come on, 17.

1062
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,628
Come on.
- Big money, big money!

1063
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,172
Come on, come on, come on.
- Red, come on.

1064
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:44,466
17 black!

1065
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,426
What?
- Yes!

1066
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:48,512
Oh, my Lord!

1067
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:51,640
Give me a little kickback over here.

1068
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:54,685
Thank you.
- Wow.

1069
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,603
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
place your bets.</i>

1070
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:58,772
Place it, place it.
What are we doin' here?

1071
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,482
I'm going with 17.

1072
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:02,609
Georgia, you can't go there a third time.

1073
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:03,735
A third time? Come on!

1074
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:06,029
Come over here
and get some of this luck.

1075
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:08,115
Maybe I am pushing it a little bit.

1076
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,700
I was born on the 13th.

1077
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,493
Thirteen, thirteen.
Put this on the thirteen.

1078
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:13,120
You sure about that?

1079
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:16,748
But then again,
I lost my mama when I was 11.

1080
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,792
Good idea.
Double me up. Double me up.

1081
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:21,170
Eleven. Yeah. Thank you. Eleven.

1082
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:25,174
- I love my mama.
- Could you please just place the bet?

1083
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:28,177
But my mama was born on the 17th.
What am I doing?

1084
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:31,889
Oh, come on, bet!
- Wherever you're going, I'm following.

1085
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:33,182
No more bets.

1086
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,308
Thank you.

1087
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:41,648
Here we go!
- Come on, come on.

1088
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:44,902
Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1089
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,862
Come on, please, 17. 17. 17.

1090
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,157
17 black.

1091
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:51,867
What?

1092
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:53,368
Georgia!

1093
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,961
Great. Now you change my luck
for the better?

1094
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,507
You know what?
I'm not playing with you no more.

1095
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:09,718
Can I cash in my chips, please?
- Yes, I'd like to cash in mine, as well.

1096
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,678
And me, too. Thank you.

1097
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:16,683
Gosh, how much?

1098
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:21,688
That's 3,546,305 crowns.

1099
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:22,815
Wow.

1100
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:27,861
How much would you guess that is?
- That's about $100,000.

1101
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:29,863
Wow!

1102
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:15,075
Not very well-traveled.

1103
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:22,332
Sales associate?

1104
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:26,670
I wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth.

1105
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,978
<i>Oh, mademoiselle...</i>

1106
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:46,333
You were incredible tonight.
You amazed us all.

1107
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,877
And myself, too.

1108
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:53,382
So, how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home?

1109
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:56,093
Probably because you're not home
that much anymore.

1110
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:58,428
Well, Washington
is a hard place to resist.

1111
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,806
Come visit me sometime. You'll see.

1112
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:04,601
I'm sorry,
but I just can't seem to get past...

1113
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:08,147
that big flashing "for sale" sign
on your forehead.

1114
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:11,191
What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

1115
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:13,443
What are you doing here with Kragen?

1116
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,321
I mean, what exactly is it
that you two do for each other?

1117
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:20,200
I'm helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee, that's all.

1118
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:23,328
Well, it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people...

1119
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,830
over some hurdles.

1120
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,498
I mean, precious little's happened...

1121
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:29,501
with that Community Redevelopment
Program of yours.

1122
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:33,463
And nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless I get re-elected.

1123
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:37,342
Having generous supporters
like Matthew Kragen is a political reality.

1124
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:39,052
Yeah, well...

1125
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,555
I'm sorry, but...

1126
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:47,227
I only have time for reality realities.
Good night.

1127
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,231
Good night, Georgia.

1128
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:02,743
<i>Mademoiselle Byrd, I hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight.</i>

1129
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:07,414
I don't know about that.
- But there's no need to be humble.

1130
01:19:07,498 --> 01:19:09,708
Did you have a marvelous time?

1131
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,586
Why're you being so nice to me?

1132
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:16,548
Yeah, I know. I'm a bitch.
At least that's what people tell me.

1133
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,550
Oh, Miss Gunther...

1134
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:21,595
no, you're not. You're just like
a lot of women who work too hard.

1135
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:23,931
And yet you are always so kind.

1136
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:28,101
You are a woman of distinction
and courage.

1137
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:32,314
Yeah, apparently I am, all of a sudden.

1138
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:35,442
Wish it had happened a little sooner.

1139
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,114
Miss Gunther.

1140
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,367
I hope you're not trying
to make a pass at me...

1141
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,953
'cause I really can't handle that
right now.

1142
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:50,791
Please don't die, Miss Byrd.
I read the note.

1143
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,754
You went through my stuff?
- Oh, yeah, I go through everyone's stuff.

1144
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:57,381
I apologize.

1145
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,677
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of relieved...

1146
01:20:01,802 --> 01:20:03,846
to have somebody to share it with.

1147
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:08,267
Don't worry, I'll be with you here
to the very end.

1148
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,858
I don't know if I want to be here
to the very end.

1149
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:18,861
Why are you here
with these terrible people?

1150
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,989
You should be with people you love.

1151
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:26,285
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that myself.

1152
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:28,912
One in particular.

1153
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,875
It's time I go home and find him.

1154
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,263
Thank you, God.

1155
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,703
That's a lot of snow.

1156
01:21:57,876 --> 01:22:00,212
What's going on here?
- It's an avalanche.

1157
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,965
I'm sorry, but we'll have to go back.

1158
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,926
I can't believe this happened
on New Year's Eve.

1159
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:09,054
You're just not gonna cut me
any slack at all, are you?

1160
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,642
You're telling me there's nothing else?

1161
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:17,771
I wanted you to find out everything...
- As I told you before, nothing.

1162
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,941
Nothing?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

1163
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:23,193
Except that she is a saint.

1164
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:25,946
And from New Orleans.
- Yes.

1165
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:30,200
And her occupation?
- You should know. She works for you.

1166
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,619
Now, please.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1167
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,455
She works for me?
- That's all I know and all I'm telling.

1168
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:37,040
Here's your tip back.

1169
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,968
At this rate,
we're going to be here all night.

1170
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:51,472
Oh, no, we are not.
We are going back down the mountain.

1171
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:54,475
I prefer to spend the night with my wife.

1172
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,106
Hey, what are you doing?

1173
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:06,153
Are you crazy? It's dangerous.
- Yeah, I know.

1174
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:09,031
But I don't have much time.
Keep the change.

1175
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:11,742
Wish me luck.

1176
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:35,641
I hate snow.

1177
01:23:38,227 --> 01:23:39,812
Snow sucks.

1178
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,609
Cookware? Are you sure?

1179
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:17,558
I heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche.

1180
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:20,519
I just thought I'd check
to see if you needed any help.

1181
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:22,980
But I don't want to get in your way
or nothing.

1182
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:25,774
No, no, no, it would be an honor,
a privilege.

1183
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,070
What is this?

1184
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,739
It's a turnip.

1185
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:36,160
No, it's not. That can't be no turnip.

1186
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:40,914
The poor baby turnips.
Nobody likes them, you know?

1187
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:42,624
Of course.

1188
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:45,836
Life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom.

1189
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,881
But the turnip is to be loved...

1190
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:52,676
because she's a self-made woman
of vegetables.

1191
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:55,929
All the others you can only destroy
with cooking.

1192
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,807
But the turnip, she gets better.

1193
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,186
So, you see, it's not how you start...

1194
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:08,025
but how you finish.

1195
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,155
That's gonna be good!

1196
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:16,617
The first time I saw you...

1197
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:21,246
I was so happy
to see your appetite for food...

1198
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:23,874
for life.

1199
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,131
I'm so sorry.

1200
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,550
Gunther.

1201
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:38,764
Does anybody else know?

1202
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,058
No.

1203
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,227
Okay.

1204
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:46,939
Well, good.
Let's not say anything, all right?

1205
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:50,150
Let's just... Let's just cook.

1206
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:56,114
The onions, they make me cry.

1207
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:55,192
You have been very lucky.

1208
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:00,781
Well, you didn't get everything
you wanted...

1209
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,282
but you have...

1210
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:09,706
Next time, we do things different.

1211
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:13,168
We will laugh more, we'll love more.

1212
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:16,797
We'll see the world.

1213
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,883
We just won't be so afraid.

1214
01:28:27,808 --> 01:28:29,268
Happy New Year.

1215
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,066
Look at you.

1216
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:03,927
Now, see, look at these tumors.
Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

1217
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:06,263
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it...

1218
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,682
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

1219
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:12,186
So, I said to myself, "Rabindranath,
it has to be the machine."

1220
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:15,772
Oh, my God.

1221
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,830
Thanks. I'll see you.

1222
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:36,543
Excuse me, young man,
do you live here?

1223
01:29:36,627 --> 01:29:37,878
Yeah, I live right here.

1224
01:29:37,961 --> 01:29:41,131
Please tell me you know Georgia Byrd.
- Yeah, I know Georgia.

1225
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:42,132
Thank you.

1226
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:47,221
Tonight I'd like to make a toast...

1227
01:29:47,346 --> 01:29:49,848
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us.

1228
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,643
To Georgia Byrd.

1229
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,603
Well, hear, hear.

1230
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:55,896
To Georgia.

1231
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,440
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

1232
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:01,777
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

1233
01:30:01,902 --> 01:30:05,280
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

1234
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:09,701
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

1235
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:14,248
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

1236
01:30:14,832 --> 01:30:19,419
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

1237
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:22,923
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk...

1238
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:25,425
in my New Orleans store.

1239
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,761
In the cookware department, no less.

1240
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,889
Salary? $29,000 a year.

1241
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:32,432
Cheers, Georgia.

1242
01:30:32,516 --> 01:30:34,184
What?
- No.

1243
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:37,229
Or as we might say back home:

1244
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:42,234
"Attention Kragen shoppers,
impostor, aisle three."

1245
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,406
Oh, come on. Georgia, is this true?

1246
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:53,829
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

1247
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:57,124
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

1248
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:01,670
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

1249
01:31:02,337 --> 01:31:05,299
That's when...
- You owe these people no explanation.

1250
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:07,801
No, excuse me. I think she does.

1251
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:10,804
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week...

1252
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:12,639
and the only reason we took it was...

1253
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:15,225
because we thought
she was somebody.

1254
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,894
Well, I'm sorry.

1255
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:20,355
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

1256
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:23,400
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

1257
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:27,696
You see...

1258
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,450
I'm gonna die.

1259
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:34,578
Georgia, please.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1260
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,205
It's all right.

1261
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:43,128
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out...

1262
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:45,214
I only had three weeks to live.

1263
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:49,134
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

1264
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,471
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

1265
01:31:57,893 --> 01:32:00,354
But I did land on that mountaintop.

1266
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:04,691
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

1267
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:08,570
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

1268
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,032
Never in my life did I think...

1269
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:15,202
I would end up
in such a beautiful place...

1270
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:17,746
doing so many incredible things.

1271
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:21,500
So...

1272
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,920
I'm sorry if I was...

1273
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:28,340
maybe a little too honest with you.

1274
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:33,220
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

1275
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,600
I was afraid, I guess.

1276
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,728
You know how it is.

1277
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:46,233
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

1278
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:49,736
Then you look up one day and wonder:

1279
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:52,239
"How did I even get here?"
Huh, bro?

1280
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:58,287
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

1281
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:01,790
So...

1282
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:06,587
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

1283
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:09,298
And...

1284
01:33:12,092 --> 01:33:13,886
it's truly been my pleasure.

1285
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:17,514
Happy New Year.

1286
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:22,311
Happy New Year, Georgia.
- Thank you.

1287
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,318
Asshole.

1288
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:33,822
That's a very appropriate sentiment,
darling.

1289
01:33:36,492 --> 01:33:39,870
I second that.
Happy New Year, Matthew.

1290
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:48,545
Where are you going?

1291
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,758
Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

1292
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:54,927
And then I'm gonna go back to school...

1293
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,221
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

1294
01:33:57,346 --> 01:34:00,641
And then one day, when your wife
finally decides to divorce you...

1295
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:02,684
and takes half of everything you have...

1296
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,980
I'll only be too happy to help her figure
out exactly how much that should be.

1297
01:35:02,286 --> 01:35:04,329
Marie, what are you doing?

1298
01:35:05,497 --> 01:35:08,292
Has that ceiling
ever made you want to cry?

1299
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,299
What ceiling? Get back to work.

1300
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,813
Hey.
- Hey.

1301
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:33,734
Georgia, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am that...

1302
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:37,279
Girl, it's okay. I know you are.

1303
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:42,242
I left Matthew.
I'm going to the airport now.

1304
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:46,038
Oh, well, I don't know if they've cleared
the road yet to the airport.

1305
01:35:46,121 --> 01:35:47,498
What do you mean?
- The avalanche and stuff.

1306
01:35:47,623 --> 01:35:49,750
Ms. Byrd,
something terrible has happened.

1307
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,169
Matthew Kragen's
jumped out a window?

1308
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:54,755
Pity, but not yet. He's still on the ledge.

1309
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:56,215
What?
- Come on.

1310
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,758
I'll get my jacket.

1311
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,011
What's going... Wait a minute.

1312
01:36:01,136 --> 01:36:03,597
Who? Hey, that's Kragen!

1313
01:36:04,973 --> 01:36:08,769
What the hell is he doing?
- He does not take rejection well.

1314
01:36:13,065 --> 01:36:14,274
Matthew!

1315
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:18,570
Matthew, what are you doing?

1316
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:32,626
What you doing?
- Thinking.

1317
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:35,838
About what?
- Not falling.

1318
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:39,800
Oh, no. What's she doing out there?
- Oh, my goodness.

1319
01:36:39,925 --> 01:36:41,552
This is crazy.

1320
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:50,602
You don't have to be nice to me.
I know I'm a jerk.

1321
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:52,813
You don't think I know I'm a jerk?

1322
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:55,524
Oh, so, this is where jerks come
to hang out?

1323
01:36:57,067 --> 01:36:59,611
You're starting to get
a little crowd down there.

1324
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:00,946
Happy New Year!

1325
01:37:01,488 --> 01:37:03,991
Wave to the people.
- Happy New Year!

1326
01:37:04,116 --> 01:37:05,617
I can't believe this guy.

1327
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:07,703
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1328
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:11,290
They'd like me to jump.
- Well, don't start people-pleasing now.

1329
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:15,127
Matthew. Come back in here.

1330
01:37:15,252 --> 01:37:18,464
You know you're not gonna jump.
You couldn't even jump off the dam.

1331
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:20,174
Equipment failure.

1332
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:24,011
See? You know...
- Miss Burns, let me handle this, please.

1333
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:29,641
Mr. Kragen, you know what?
You're really starting to piss me off.

1334
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:32,686
Give me that.
- No, no, no.

1335
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:34,229
Oh, heads up!

1336
01:37:36,565 --> 01:37:38,442
Damn, that is a long drop.

1337
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:43,989
Look, a guy like you has all the money
and time in the world...

1338
01:37:44,156 --> 01:37:46,533
to turn things around for himself,
you know?

1339
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:48,744
So, just stop whining and get with it.

1340
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:50,704
Get with what, exactly?

1341
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:53,665
I don't know. I mean, I don't have...

1342
01:37:53,749 --> 01:37:56,960
Georgia Byrd's five rules
to how to be a better human being.

1343
01:37:57,085 --> 01:37:59,254
All I know is, if you want somebody
to care about you...

1344
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:01,965
stop trying to buy and sell them
all the time.

1345
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:04,218
Do I do that?

1346
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:07,179
And you know what?

1347
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:10,974
Get your pasty face off the cover
of your own magazine every month.

1348
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,019
Yep, that's the face right there.

1349
01:38:15,354 --> 01:38:16,480
Every month!

1350
01:38:19,107 --> 01:38:21,902
I can't believe I had somebody like you
working for me all this time.

1351
01:38:21,985 --> 01:38:23,862
Well, I wasn't gonna work
for you forever.

1352
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:25,489
I had plans, you know.

1353
01:38:25,614 --> 01:38:27,741
Yeah? What were you gonna do?

1354
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,703
Well, nothing big by your standards.

1355
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:35,833
But I was gonna open me up
a little restaurant.

1356
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,668
Bistro style.

1357
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,256
And, of course, a husband and a family.

1358
01:38:46,635 --> 01:38:48,554
Do you have a boyfriend?

1359
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:52,141
Well, I wouldn't call him that.

1360
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:55,769
He works for your company, too.
His name is Sean.

1361
01:38:56,019 --> 01:38:58,105
Georgia!

1362
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:02,109
It's starting to happen.
- What?

1363
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:05,821
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

1364
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:09,283
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

1365
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:12,953
Georgia!

1366
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:16,248
Is that...
- Sean, what are you doing here?

1367
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,752
Wait, I'm coming!

1368
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:29,761
You are here to see Miss Byrd?
- Yeah, how did you know?

1369
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:31,221
Lucky guess.

1370
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,151
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

1371
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:50,073
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

1372
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:06,215
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

1373
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:08,383
Georgia!

1374
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:11,386
What the hell? I mean...

1375
01:40:12,429 --> 01:40:13,472
Come on.

1376
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:14,973
How many people
can get on that ledge?

1377
01:40:15,057 --> 01:40:16,558
Who the hell is that?

1378
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:18,519
Sean, what you doing here?

1379
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:22,064
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease...

1380
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:24,149
and, well, I up and quit my job.

1381
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:26,360
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

1382
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:30,155
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit...

1383
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,867
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

1384
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:38,413
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

1385
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:41,875
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

1386
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:44,920
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

1387
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:48,257
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

1388
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:51,009
Okay. Talk to me.

1389
01:40:51,385 --> 01:40:53,846
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

1390
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:56,014
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

1391
01:40:56,098 --> 01:40:58,600
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1392
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:01,478
Well, look, I...

1393
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:05,941
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

1394
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:10,404
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

1395
01:41:10,487 --> 01:41:12,739
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

1396
01:41:15,993 --> 01:41:17,661
I have feelings for you.

1397
01:41:19,037 --> 01:41:21,498
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

1398
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:26,962
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

1399
01:41:28,964 --> 01:41:32,217
I like this guy. Good guy.
- Me, too.

1400
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:37,306
Oh, come on, knock it off.

1401
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:39,266
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here...

1402
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:41,393
when you know I gotta die?

1403
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:44,688
Who you talking to, baby?
- God.

1404
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:47,774
Hello!

1405
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:50,068
Oh, God.

1406
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:53,780
We're the only ones not up there.
- We should join them.

1407
01:41:53,906 --> 01:41:58,452
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

1408
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:02,539
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

1409
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:07,211
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

1410
01:42:07,503 --> 01:42:09,797
I'm not gonna die?
- No!

1411
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:12,132
I'm gonna live?
- Yes!

1412
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:17,054
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

1413
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:24,311
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

1414
01:42:24,436 --> 01:42:27,147
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

1415
01:42:27,231 --> 01:42:28,398
Oh, no.

1416
01:42:29,107 --> 01:42:32,694
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years...

1417
01:42:34,154 --> 01:42:35,322
my whole life!

1418
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:41,119
All right!

1419
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:48,252
All right!

1420
01:42:48,377 --> 01:42:50,295
Can we get off this ledge now?
- Yeah.

1421
01:42:50,379 --> 01:42:52,798
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

1422
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:56,051
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

1423
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:59,847
You had enough of this?
- Yeah, go in inside.

1424
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:03,433
Yeah, it's time to get warm.
- Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

1425
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:04,893
I want to tell you, thank you...

1426
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:07,688
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

1427
01:43:08,105 --> 01:43:11,650
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

1428
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,280
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

1429
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:18,282
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

1430
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:20,701
Come on, baby. Come on.

1431
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:34,840
Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

1432
01:43:34,923 --> 01:43:36,925
How about a little taste? Smell.

1433
01:43:37,593 --> 01:43:39,928
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

1434
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,017
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

1435
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:50,856
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

1436
01:43:53,442 --> 01:43:56,445
Come on, baby, let's go.
- Go out and see to your friends.

1437
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:58,322
And I'll take care of the rest.

1438
01:43:58,447 --> 01:43:59,406
Okay?
- Okay.

1439
01:43:59,531 --> 01:44:02,534
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

1440
01:44:02,618 --> 01:44:03,952
Okay, all right.

1441
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:06,371
<i>Merci!</i>

1442
01:44:16,298 --> 01:44:20,219
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you for coming.

1443
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:23,222
Thank you so much for coming.
- Welcome to Georgia's.

1444
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:26,183
My baby!
- Tough guy!

1445
01:44:26,517 --> 01:44:28,977
Who's my little guy?
- Congratulations.

1446
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:32,731
Rochelle.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1447
01:44:33,816 --> 01:44:35,108
You did it!

1448
01:44:36,443 --> 01:44:37,820
I quit my job.
- Thank you.

1449
01:44:37,945 --> 01:44:39,446
You did? Oh, congratulations.

1450
01:44:39,571 --> 01:44:41,573
I quit my job!
- You should never have had that job.

1451
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:43,200
I'm so glad.
- Hi, I quit my job!

1452
01:44:43,325 --> 01:44:46,870
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

1453
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:48,831
Welcome.
- Come on in to Georgia's.

1454
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:51,291
Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

1455
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:57,172
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1456
01:44:57,297 --> 01:44:59,967
Thank you for coming!
- Thank you. Congratulations.

1457
01:45:00,092 --> 01:45:01,718
She loves you.
- Congratulations.

1458
01:45:01,844 --> 01:45:03,220
Thanks for coming.

1459
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:04,304
Pleasure.
