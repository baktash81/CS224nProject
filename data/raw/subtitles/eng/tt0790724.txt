1
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,420
Move!

2
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,544
It's life or death now, James.

3
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,923
By that,
I mean you're doing one or the other

4
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,260
up in Rockview.

5
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,638
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.

6
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,100
Want to know what he's wondering?

7
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,562
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy

8
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,439
on your way to the death house.

9
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,941
See, the D.A. Likes the needle,

10
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,985
whereas me,

11
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,946
I like to see a man like you
live a long life

12
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,948
with all your teeth knocked out.

13
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,119
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your fart from a yawn.

14
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,371
Now, I don't know
what kind of man you are,

15
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,248
which of these two fates you prefer,

16
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,961
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.

17
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,300
If you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,

18
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,679
waive your right to counsel and confess,
right now.

19
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,400
Sixteen hours.

20
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,986
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.

21
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,660
What the hell is this?

22
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,673
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

23
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,009
Jack Reacher,

24
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,514
born Jack, not John, no middle name,
is a ghost.

25
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,060
No driver's licence, current or expired.
No residence, current or former.

26
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:08,357
No credit cards, no credit history.
No P.O. Box, cell phone, e-mail.

27
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,984
Nothing.

28
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,568
Can you at least tell me who he is?

29
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,822
Well, I can tell you who he was.
Blood military.

30
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,074
Born and raised on bases abroad.

31
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,202
Mother was a French national,
father in the Corps.

32
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,372
His first trip to the United States
was to attend West Point.

33
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,708
Four years later, he ships out for good.

34
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,712
Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans.
You name it.

35
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,214
Served with distinction.

36
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,551
Silver Star, Bronze Star,
Legion of Merit.

37
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,431
Defence Superior Service Medal?
Had to look that one up.

38
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,058
And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service

39
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,271
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

40
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,898
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

41
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,567
Demoted to Captain.

42
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,235
Worked his way back to Major.

43
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,739
Then two years ago, he musters out.

44
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:02,077
After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,

45
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,204
for only the second time in his life,

46
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,791
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.

47
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,960
Dead, maybe?

48
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,589
Not according to Social Security
and a bank account in Virginia.

49
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,966
His pension is deposited monthly

50
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,012
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.

51
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,932
I can't find out where
without a federal warrant.

52
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,477
Well, he can't drive or fly.

53
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,062
At least not under his real name.

54
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,774
- Any warrants?
- Record's clean.

55
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,319
Come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.

56
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,945
His record is clean.

57
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,989
So,

58
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,620
how do we find this Reacher?

59
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,290
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.

60
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,629
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher here to see you.

61
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,138
Can I help you?

62
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,682
James Barr.

63
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,818
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?

64
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,362
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

65
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,615
That was an oversight.

66
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,034
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.

67
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,994
Just as likely.

68
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,163
But it's done and we can't undo it.

69
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,456
So what happens now?

70
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,834
Well, now he's in a coma.

71
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,671
We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.

72
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,464
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

73
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Why did he call you as a witness?

74
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,510
I don't believe he did.

75
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,220
Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.

76
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,848
Any chance I could look
at the evidence?

77
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,641
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.

78
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,976
Nice meeting you.

79
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,394
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- Mr Reacher.

80
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,020
- Mr Reacher!
- Hey, stop! Stop right there!

81
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,480
We had a deal.

82
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,816
I take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.

83
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,652
I know you say he shot five people,
I know he's in a coma.

84
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,862
I know there's a bus station
three miles away

85
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,780
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.

86
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,198
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?

87
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,993
- He's not my friend.
- Why'd he ask for you, then?

88
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,037
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.

89
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,205
Hey. Hold on.

90
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
Don't do that.

91
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,543
Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.

92
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,336
You do not talk to my client
without me present.

93
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,463
You know that.

94
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,674
We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

95
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,260
- You're Barr's attorney?
- Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.

96
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,220
- Jack Reacher?
- Helen Rodin.

97
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,930
Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.

98
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,056
It's a good story, actually.

99
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,224
I'd like to hear it.

100
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,477
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?

101
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,062
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.

102
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
- It's not what it looks like.
- He came to us.

103
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,775
- You went to the D. A?
- Is there a law against that?

104
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,360
None you're currently breaking.

105
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,488
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.

106
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,907
Say, "See you in court." For me.

107
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,575
Goodbye, Detective.

108
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,577
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.

109
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:49,953
Let's go.

110
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,082
So...

111
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,587
So, you're Jack Reacher.

112
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,381
- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.

113
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,300
- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.

114
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,719
- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.

115
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,887
You don't want to depose me.

116
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,138
Oh, well, you're my only
defence witness.

117
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,891
- I'm not a defence witness.
- Your friend James thinks you are.

118
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,476
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?

119
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,602
Well, why else would he ask for you

120
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,728
and why would you
come here to help him?

121
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,232
I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.

122
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,841
Linsky.

123
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,804
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

124
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,267
- So why are you so hard to find?
- I'm impossible to find.

125
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,476
Why is that?

126
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,980
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.

127
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,148
Are you on the run?

128
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,695
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counsellor.

129
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,862
How do you know James Barr?

130
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,614
- Why are you representing him?
- I'm a lawyer.

131
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,284
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.

132
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,785
I'm not trying to clear him,

133
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,329
I am just trying
to keep him off death row.

134
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,874
- By proving he's insane?
- Well, that's one option.

135
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,626
And sticking it to your father because...

136
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,212
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

137
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,007
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

138
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,719
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

139
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,387
Impeccable tailoring.

140
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,307
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.

141
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,100
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

142
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,852
Confess or face death.

143
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,229
Against a D.A. Who never loses.

144
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,481
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

145
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,066
has gone down without a fight.

146
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,193
Oh, I get it.

147
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,362
You're an idealist.

148
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,698
No. I'm a pacifist.

149
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,241
It's a noble crusade.

150
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,245
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

151
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,205
You haven't even seen the evidence.

152
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,253
Is this a privileged conversation?

153
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,090
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

154
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,845
There are four types of people
who join the military.

155
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,722
For some, it's a family trade.

156
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,558
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

157
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,894
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

158
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,398
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

159
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,734
James Barr was one of those.

160
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,070
He made sniper.

161
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,406
Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.

162
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,867
And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise

163
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,536
the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.

164
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,581
The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.

165
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,251
Visualise that puff of pink mist.

166
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,922
Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.

167
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,924
He's put on overwatch.

168
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,469
All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.

169
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,262
Women.

170
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,639
Children.

171
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
Day in, day out, for two long years

172
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,895
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

173
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,773
Then comes the drawdown.

174
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,401
For James Barr, the war's over.

175
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,278
Two thousand rounds a week.

176
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,241
A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.

177
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,619
You've been hungry.
You've been horny.

178
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,288
You've had an itch you can't scratch.

179
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,793
Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.

180
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,131
Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.

181
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,343
Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home

182
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,

183
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,139
you never will.

184
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
You need a release.

185
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,309
You need a target.

186
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,604
And the who of it
never once enters your mind.

187
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,832
He covered his tracks well,

188
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,625
just like sane people do.

189
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,964
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

190
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,841
So why didn't he go to prison?

191
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,262
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

192
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,682
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.

193
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,853
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

194
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,857
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

195
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,027
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

196
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,697
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

197
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,367
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

198
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,371
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

199
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,832
This is classified information.

200
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,877
And that's why the privilege.

201
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,213
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

202
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,258
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

203
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,221
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

204
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,099
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

205
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,727
You still haven't seen the evidence.

206
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,815
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

207
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,400
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

208
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,402
He might.

209
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,240
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

210
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,158
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

211
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,036
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

212
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,749
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

213
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,127
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

214
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,424
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

215
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,593
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

216
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,265
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

217
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,433
He didn't confess this time.

218
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,894
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

219
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,231
I want to know why.

220
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,359
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

221
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,027
And you can't ask Barr,

222
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,446
and the D.A. Won't let you
see the evidence.

223
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,452
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

224
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,416
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

225
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,093
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

226
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,860
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

227
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,738
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

228
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,367
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

229
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,328
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

230
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,373
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

231
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll do it. On one condition.

232
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,882
Name it.

233
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,387
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

234
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,558
How do you suggest I do that?

235
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,730
- Yes?
- Mr Farrior?

236
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,899
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

237
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,235
Of course.

238
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,904
You said you're defending
the man that ki...

239
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,572
That man.

240
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,076
I represent James Barr, yes.

241
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,246
And you have questions
about my daughter?

242
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,415
I do.

243
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,584
What for?

244
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,755
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

245
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,634
That is to say, who they were as people.
As human beings.

246
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,101
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

247
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,436
That is true.

248
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,273
Normally someone in my position
would want the jury

249
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,775
to know as little as possible about the...

250
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,778
The people that your client killed.

251
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,114
In cold blood.

252
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,039
Have you spoken
with the other families?

253
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,250
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.

254
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,053
Come in.

255
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,471
Thank you.

256
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,758
Chrissie was a nanny.

257
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,052
She had a little girl with her that day.

258
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,429
Yes, I know.

259
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,767
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

260
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,769
No, of course not. I...

261
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,938
Why not?

262
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,900
- Well, I think it would be...
- Insensitive?

263
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,611
Inappropriate?

264
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,783
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter

265
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,162
is right here.

266
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,458
The Gazette did a nice piece on her.

267
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,921
Her obituary does the rest.

268
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,594
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

269
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,347
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

270
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,642
- That's not really for me to...
- Just

271
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
answer the question.

272
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,981
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

273
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,150
Good enough to keep
that man off death row?

274
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,653
You know,

275
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,446
I think maybe I should go.

276
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,156
You stay where you are.

277
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,830
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

278
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,127
Why would you defend him?

279
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,339
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.

280
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,511
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.

281
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,315
Hello, Dad.

282
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,733
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,360
What am I... What?

284
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,569
Is it true?

285
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,697
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

286
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,783
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

287
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

288
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,287
That's not an answer.

289
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,541
Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

290
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,377
That's right. I know about Reacher.

291
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,046
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

292
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,716
who's been missing
for the last two years.

293
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,677
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

294
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,053
How can you trust anything he tells you?

295
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,388
You don't know the man.

296
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,726
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

297
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,228
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

298
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
That nobody wants this case?

299
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,526
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

300
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,237
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

301
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,489
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

302
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,241
you gotta listen to me now.

303
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,579
You're making a terrible mistake.

304
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,415
You cannot win this case.

305
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,419
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

306
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,423
To hurt me? To change me?

307
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,258
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!

308
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,105
Thanks for letting me take a look.

309
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,316
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

310
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,068
try to tear our work to shreds.

311
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,611
He's not my friend.

312
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,781
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

313
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,283
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

314
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,454
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

315
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,208
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

316
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,795
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

317
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,798
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

318
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,633
No, thanks. Don't need to.

319
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,468
You never took any notes.

320
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,137
I don't need to.

321
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:48,309
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

322
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,269
I did all right.

323
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,314
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

324
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,818
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

325
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,027
What's that?

326
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,822
Every suspect was a trained killer.

327
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,116
Thanks again.

328
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,165
Why do you think he paid for parking?

329
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,794
Pardon?

330
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,673
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

331
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,175
And he's worried about the meter maid?

332
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,010
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

333
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,346
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

334
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,684
Habit.

335
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,686
Muscle memory.

336
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,355
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

337
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,693
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

338
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,027
Hey, Army.

339
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,698
What's the serial number on the rifle?

340
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,120
What's the date on the quarter?

341
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,541
1968.

342
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,713
Forest for the trees, Detective.

343
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,716
Forest for the trees.

344
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,375
Mind if I share your table?

345
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,461
I'm Sandy.

346
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,631
So was I. Last week.

347
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,467
On a beach, in Florida.

348
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,556
What's your name?

349
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,976
Jimmie Reese.

350
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,564
You don't look like a Jimmie.

351
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,690
What do I look like?

352
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,486
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

353
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,906
So you're new in town?

354
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,992
Usually.

355
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,494
It's kind of loud in here.

356
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,832
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.

357
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,500
You're old enough to drive?

358
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,753
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

359
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,673
I'm on a budget, Sandy.

360
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,258
What?

361
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,843
I can't afford you.

362
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,511
I'm not a hooker.

363
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,180
Then I really can't afford you.

364
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,017
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.

365
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,688
What I mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.

366
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,692
I am not a hooker!

367
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,360
No. A hooker would get the joke.

368
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,530
- What's this?
- He called me a whore.

369
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,702
Is that true?

370
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,209
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.

371
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,211
Hey. That's our sister.

372
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,547
Is she a good kisser?

373
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,550
Hey. Outside.

374
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,386
Pay your cheque first.

375
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,596
I'll pay later.

376
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,223
You won't be able to.

377
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,725
You think?

378
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,393
All the time. You should try it.

379
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,979
It's a great joke,
but I'm going to beat your ass.

380
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,814
Do you want to do that here or outside?

381
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,404
Outside.

382
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,326
Stay here, Sandy.

383
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,329
I don't mind the sight of blood.

384
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,083
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.

385
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,770
You still think you're funny now, creep?

386
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,439
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.

387
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,365
It's your last chance to walk away.

388
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,119
Are you kidding? It's five against one.

389
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,122
It's three against one.

390
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,458
How do you figure?

391
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,378
Well, once I take out the leader,
which is you,

392
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,298
I'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

393
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,802
The last two guys, they always run.

394
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,637
You've done this before?

395
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,222
Yeah.

396
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,642
It's getting late.

397
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,396
Remember,

398
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,565
you wanted this.

399
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,115
It's okay. You're okay.

400
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,241
Get up.

401
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,502
Okay.

402
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,254
Now we know who's who.

403
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,922
Let's get this done.

404
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,857
Really?

405
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,529
Shit!

406
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,872
On the ground!

407
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,957
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.

408
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,375
Do it!

409
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,718
Hands behind your back.

410
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,056
Who hired you?

411
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,392
Let's go.

412
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,326
Hey, Helen.

413
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,411
Am I wearing too much perfume?

414
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,415
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.

415
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,252
- Somebody dead?
- And if someone is?

416
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,257
Then they died of shame.
'Cause I was being gentle.

417
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,593
I'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.

418
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,679
So no one's dead.

419
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,598
One guy
likely won't ever walk right again.

420
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,101
- You want to charge me.
- Very much.

421
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,435
But no one's pressing.

422
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,271
Sadly, no.

423
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,359
Am I free to go?

424
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,113
Hey, Emerson.

425
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,786
4862681.

426
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,622
What's that?

427
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,709
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

428
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,466
You're working for me,
do you understand that?

429
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,637
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.

430
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,805
I was set up.

431
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,056
You're talking to a lawyer.

432
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,059
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

433
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,728
Which never happens in a bar.

434
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,897
She was thrown
when I told her my name.

435
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,148
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

436
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,983
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

437
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,737
Yankees second baseman.

438
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,239
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

439
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,159
I always use Yankees second basemen.

440
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,495
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...

441
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,166
Look, the point is,

442
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,168
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

443
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,419
She knew who I was.

444
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,504
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

445
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,507
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

446
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,178
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

447
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,514
Who?

448
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
If someone followed you
at the river today,

449
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,521
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

450
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,106
There are three things cops never do.

451
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,859
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

452
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,111
and they never use personal vehicles.

453
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,614
It's not a cop.

454
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,866
A P.I., then, or the D.A.'s office.

455
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,743
You think your father's office
would set me up?

456
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,119
Why would anyone set you up?

457
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,454
How was your day?

458
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,039
It went exactly the way I think

459
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,792
you hoped it would.

460
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,920
You okay?

461
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,800
What'd you learn?

462
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,305
Chrissie Farrior was 22.

463
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,310
A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.

464
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,398
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

465
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,608
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

466
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:44,154
But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.

467
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,659
They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.

468
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,333
Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.

469
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,920
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

470
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,464
Since her son Marco
was nine years old

471
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,552
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.

472
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,804
But her dedication had paid off.

473
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,682
Marco was now an honour student.

474
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,976
As a reward for all his hard work,

475
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,270
Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.

476
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,315
And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.

477
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,362
Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were a lie.

478
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,281
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

479
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,199
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

480
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,535
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

481
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,748
It's perfect.

482
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,876
She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.

483
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,129
She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary

484
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,632
- just a few days away.
- Thank you.

485
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,221
Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,

486
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,060
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.

487
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,606
So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit

488
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,483
were forcing them
to sell to the competition.

489
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,817
Rob?

490
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,694
Help! Help!

491
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,325
Her husband
had given his life for the company.

492
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,244
But now that it was hers,

493
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,830
she couldn't bring herself to let it go.

494
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,089
She was on her way
to secure a loan that day

495
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,425
so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.

496
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,595
Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker

497
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,764
in the same building where Rita worked.

498
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,101
His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.

499
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:42,022
She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.

500
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,691
Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses

501
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,777
he'd bought that morning

502
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,280
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,

503
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,950
he was most likely thinking of her.

504
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,013
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

505
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,473
We're gonna be okay.

506
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,559
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

507
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,227
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

508
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,241
So what'd you learn?

509
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,161
You want me to say you were right.

510
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,121
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

511
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,832
James Barr should die.

512
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,501
Maybe he should.

513
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,420
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

514
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,546
What more do you want?

515
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,840
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

516
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,925
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

517
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,510
This is my shirt.

518
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,096
You lose your luggage?

519
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,764
I don't have any luggage.

520
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,684
What was I saying?

521
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,353
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

522
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,109
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

523
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,777
Two and a half million.

524
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,197
That means every day,

525
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,117
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

526
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,495
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

527
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:21,622
Is that random?

528
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,123
What else would you call it?

529
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,418
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

530
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,544
Excuse me?

531
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,339
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

532
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,132
You buy them on the way home.

533
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,802
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

534
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,638
when your anniversary is that weekend.

535
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,973
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.

536
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,020
And that's why she kept walking

537
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,399
while everyone else ran.

538
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:50,984
You can't prove that.

539
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,571
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

540
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,659
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

541
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,827
What's your point exactly?

542
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,414
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

543
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,252
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

544
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,504
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

545
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,756
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

546
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,259
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

547
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,677
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,930
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

549
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,307
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

550
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,851
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

551
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,770
gun ranges.

552
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,647
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

553
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,898
What do we hope to find?

554
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,192
I need some sleep.

555
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,778
You, too.

556
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,863
You don't really think I'm gonna...

557
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,622
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

558
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,378
Yep. Absolutely.

559
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,836
Who's with you?

560
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,504
What happened?

561
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,341
That's him, isn't it?

562
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,509
I ain't seeing you, man!

563
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,428
Relax. What happened?

564
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,307
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

565
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,518
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

566
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,687
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

567
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,522
So?

568
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,360
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

569
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,321
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

570
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,198
Almost like he knew something.

571
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,701
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

572
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,203
No, we sure don't.

573
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,788
So I took steps.

574
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,874
You took steps.

575
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,377
Local people. My guys.

576
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,295
And it blew back on you.

577
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,923
I figured five guys would do it.

578
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,051
This franchise was yours to manage.

579
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,221
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

580
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,347
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

581
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,473
Well, that's how this works.

582
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,891
Well, I had to make a decision!

583
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,685
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

584
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:31,978
Any of them know who you are?

585
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,147
Just one, but I took care of it.

586
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,650
You...

587
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,569
- Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

588
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,738
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

589
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,157
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

590
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,244
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

591
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,079
Clean!

592
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,206
A missing person isn't clean.

593
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,750
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

594
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,252
You tapped five! You call that clean?

595
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,506
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

596
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,757
Jesus.

597
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,845
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

598
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,098
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

599
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,268
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

600
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,020
- Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!

601
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,106
It makes no difference now.

602
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,117
I made a mistake.

603
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,870
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

604
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,790
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

605
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,127
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

606
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,962
All right. You're right.

607
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,547
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

608
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,300
Just tell me what I have to do.

609
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,053
I was in prison in Siberia.

610
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:51,141
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

611
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,643
A hole in one pocket.

612
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,979
I chewed these fingers off

613
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,149
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

614
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,155
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

615
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,993
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

616
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,664
A man this rare can always be of use.

617
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,169
So show me. Show me you are rare.

618
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,422
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

619
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,467
I don't understand.

620
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,512
The fingers from your left hand.

621
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,332
Have you... Have you got a knife?

622
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,126
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

623
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,466
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

624
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,635
You can do it.

625
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,387
Show me.

626
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,587
Christ!

627
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,881
Can't! I can't.

628
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,134
Always the bullet.

629
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,844
- I can't!
- I don't understand.

630
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,769
What do we do about the soldier?

631
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,022
What we always do.

632
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,530
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

633
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,284
Coffee. You take it black, right?

634
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,626
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

635
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,059
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

636
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,064
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

637
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,569
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

638
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,656
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

639
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,074
Sure, if you tell me why.

640
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,660
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

641
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,994
and again on Sunday.

642
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,621
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

643
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,082
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

644
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,169
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

645
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,589
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

646
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,510
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

647
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,012
I'm guessing every Saturday.

648
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,598
Maybe with a friend.

649
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,434
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

650
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,602
Assuming he had any.

651
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,354
Drop me at the auto parts store.

652
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,272
I... Wait. Which one?

653
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,858
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

654
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,984
She? Who?

655
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,611
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

656
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,030
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

657
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,659
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

658
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,878
You want me to wait?

659
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,882
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- How will you get there?

660
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,138
I'll hitch a ride.

661
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:41,931
Can I help you?

662
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,308
Sandy work here?

663
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,728
What's this about?

664
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,939
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.

665
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,441
It's a personal matter.

666
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,903
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.

667
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,197
What are you, a cop?

668
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,366
Call her out, Gary.

669
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,036
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.

670
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,622
Well, I need to see something.

671
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,750
How about the inside of an ambulance?

672
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,756
Okay, I'm calling the police.

673
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,469
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

674
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,804
- Hello?
...but let's ask.

675
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,096
Hey! You...

676
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,308
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

677
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,354
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

678
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,611
Shit.

679
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,324
You know this guy?

680
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,659
Tell him.

681
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,286
Give us a few, Gary.

682
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,051
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

683
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,720
I didn't know that was going to happen!

684
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,561
It was Jeb.

685
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,355
The big guy.

686
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,357
Jeb Oliver.

687
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,656
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.

688
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,622
Just don't hurt me.

689
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,208
Sandy, sit down.

690
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,337
Where can I find Jeb?

691
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,506
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

692
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,883
So he works here.

693
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,551
Yeah.

694
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:45,555
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

695
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,098
His address, write it down.

696
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,895
I'm really sorry, mister.

697
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,565
You were supposed to be a pervert.

698
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,235
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

699
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,570
That's all?

700
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:06,659
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

701
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,582
Am I in trouble?

702
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,420
Not if you lend me your car.

703
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,632
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.

704
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,717
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

705
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,720
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

706
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,264
I can't. It's Jeb's car!

707
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,643
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.

708
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,109
Who are you, mister?

709
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,778
Really?

710
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,204
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

711
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,247
I get off work at six!

712
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,503
Maybe we could...

713
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,630
Sandy, listen.

714
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,092
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

715
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,386
You're pretty.

716
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,888
You're obviously sharp,

717
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,640
doing Gary's books for him.

718
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,893
You don't have to
let these guys use you.

719
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,482
It's just what girls like me do.

720
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,779
You got money?

721
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,156
A little.

722
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:29,993
Get out of town for a couple of days.

723
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,536
Why?

724
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,665
Get out of town, Sandy.

725
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,419
Is Jeb home?

726
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,428
I have a warrant to search the premises.

727
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,894
I see.

728
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,564
Well, if you don't mind...

729
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,527
Get him! Get him! Get him!

730
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,913
I got this!

731
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,080
Okay, okay.

732
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,666
All right.

733
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,811
Don't move.

734
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,813
I'll tell you what.

735
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:12,149
When I move, you pull the trigger.

736
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,697
- Where's Jeb?
- He's not here.

737
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,115
Where can I find him?

738
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,741
Jesus! My hand!

739
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,035
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can I find him?

740
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:26,163
You're the one driving his car. You tell...

741
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,125
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

742
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,793
He said he had to see a guy.

743
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,628
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.

744
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,130
I don't know, I swear.

745
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,674
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender

746
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,009
and his shit's all gone.

747
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,469
Is he the sort to light out like that?

748
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,097
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

749
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,432
Shit ain't right.

750
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,309
- Got a car?
- It's outside.

751
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,560
Keys.

752
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,353
My hand, man. They're in my pock...

753
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,855
Okay, okay.

754
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,363
Now look at your friends.

755
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,198
Now look at my face.

756
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,202
Do you ever want to see me again?

757
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,038
No way.

758
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,041
Am I stealing your car?

759
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,378
Use it as long as you like.

760
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,048
You're very kind.

761
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,949
I think Jeb Oliver's dead.

762
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,536
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.

763
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,415
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

764
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,585
What? No, not me.

765
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,046
No, he was murdered.

766
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,006
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

767
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,591
Well, maybe he just left town.

768
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,385
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

769
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,637
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?

770
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,555
What is that on your head?

771
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,605
You don't want to know.

772
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,568
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

773
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,449
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

774
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,451
But he trained non-stop for two years.

775
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,786
What does training like that do?

776
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,830
What does any training do?

777
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,791
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

778
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,461
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

779
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,964
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

780
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,466
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

781
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,135
didn't exist in Baghdad,

782
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,179
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

783
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,434
See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.

784
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,645
Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.

785
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,398
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

786
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,192
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

787
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,154
Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.

788
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,031
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

789
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,826
and the exact same conditions

790
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,370
he would've had
up on that highway bridge.

791
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,499
Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.

792
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,502
No parking meter.

793
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,712
No camera.

794
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:24,216
No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.

795
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,010
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

796
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,512
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

797
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:29,638
Not that way.

798
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,182
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

799
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,267
Well, what exactly are you saying?

800
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,021
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

801
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,732
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

802
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,859
And who the hell pays for parking?

803
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,695
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

804
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,492
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

805
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,369
That would not explain how Barr,

806
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:57,666
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

807
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,001
He did miss.

808
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,586
He did.

809
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,924
A pristine bullet,

810
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,344
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.

811
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,890
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

812
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,894
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

813
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,564
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

814
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,525
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

815
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,069
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

816
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,862
and if he wanted to get caught,

817
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,782
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

818
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,742
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

819
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,078
That's what I was willing to accept,

820
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,121
then those guys took a run at me.

821
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,707
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

822
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,252
It was just a bar fight.

823
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:42,711
Maybe.

824
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,590
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

825
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,387
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

826
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,766
Patsy?

827
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,728
It was such a great crime scene.

828
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,772
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

829
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,440
Not Emerson.

830
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,234
Not your father.

831
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,945
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.

832
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,282
But Barr knew I would,

833
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,619
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

834
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,331
That's why he asked for me.

835
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,292
Wait.

836
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,669
Are you suggesting...

837
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,963
James Barr is innocent.

838
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:37,141
You can see what this is, can't you?

839
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,602
You've got a case in your hands

840
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,812
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

841
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,774
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

842
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,611
Helen.
