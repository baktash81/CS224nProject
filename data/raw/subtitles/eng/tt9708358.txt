1
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,308
(ominous music)

2
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,527
I care deeply about black people

3
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:44,110
and the issues of black people.

4
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:49,899
But I care deeply about the issues of all people.

5
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:56,506
I want to look at things objectively.

6
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:04,104
When I look at what policies I believe

7
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,192
will help not only black people,

8
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:08,942
but what would help all people, I voice that.

9
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,797
And because I stand in the opposition,

10
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:15,047
that makes me an Uncle Tom.

11
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,119
I used to get very offended and upset

12
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,702
whenever people would call me an Uncle Tom.

13
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,653
I think I'm in a place now, when someone calls me that,

14
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,060
I kinda pity them because of their ignorance.

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,643
It just shows that they haven't actually read the book.

16
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,542
Whenever someone calls you an Uncle Tom,

17
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:47,529
what they're trying to communicate

18
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,529
is that either you just do not like black people

19
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:57,173
and you see all black people as trash,

20
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:58,974
or they're tying to communicate

21
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,704
that, "Oh, you're just trying to fit in with white people.

22
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,425
"You're trying to be accepted among whites.

23
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,728
"And so, I wanna call you this derogatory word

24
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,996
"to put you in your place and to remind you,

25
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:14,513
"you will never be accepted by whites.

26
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,528
"You'll always be just a black nigger."

27
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:19,968
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,114
Those people who find my Instagram

29
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:27,114
and comment on it just to call me Uncle Tom, House Negro...

30
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,642
I never thought that I would be called

31
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,348
such racist and derogatory terms.

32
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,181
Uncle Tom.

33
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,014
Uncle Tom.

34
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,519
Uncle Tom, coon, bed wench.

35
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,352
Boot licker.

36
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:36,185
Chuckin' and jobbin'.

37
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,229
House Negro.

38
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,074
Coon.

39
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,362
Uncle Tom and coon.

40
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:42,449
Matter of fact, I have a Coon Award over there.

41
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,945
Coon of the year award.

42
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,032
They call us the coons.

43
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,023
Coon.
Coon.

44
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,511
For Indians like me, you're an Uncle Patel.

45
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,344
Uncle Ruckus.

46
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:53,741
Well, praise be to white God and his son, white Jesus.

47
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,550
The guy from "Get Out."

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,286
They put his face on my post.

49
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:59,885
I find that the African-American experience for me

50
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,603
has been for the most part very good.

51
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,437
I think the funniest thing I've ever been called,

52
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,894
most absurd thing is a black white supremacist.

53
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,194
It's like the old Chappelle skit, Clayton Bigsby.

54
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,027
They go (gasps).

55
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:11,860
White power.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,925
It must be real.

57
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,041
People say crazy things.

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,039
Leftists say the craziest shit to you.

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,070
<v Lenore>Don't try to twist what I say.

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,974
But that's what you're saying.

61
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:24,628
<v Lenore>That is not what I'm saying.

62
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,495
That is what you're saying.

63
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,744
<v Lenore>You can't tell me what I'm saying.

64
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,532
I know you, Lenore, that's what you're saying.

65
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:31,564
<v Lenore>You don't know me.

66
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,707
You sound like all of them.

67
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:34,540
<v Lenore>Oh yeah, okay.

68
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,499
And guess what, you sound like all them Uncle Toms.

69
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,765
Now, how about that?
See that?

70
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,376
I knew it.

71
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,078
Lenore, it's good to hear from you.

72
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,474
It's good to hear from you.

73
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,492
<v Lenore>Go drop dead.

74
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,581
All right.

75
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,950
Thank you, Lenore.

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,038
What a sweet lady.

77
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,931
An Uncle Tom is somebody who has sold out

78
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,523
by embracing the white man, by becoming a Republican,

79
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,927
by rejecting the idea that you're a victim,

80
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,913
by supporting things like hard work,

81
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,729
accountability and low taxes.

82
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,270
By refusing to think of yourself as a black person first,

83
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,979
as opposed to as an American who is black.

84
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:10,412
Your skin color should dictate how you think

85
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,664
and what you say.

86
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,002
The only way I can operate as a human being

87
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,725
is via my skin color.

88
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:18,191
I can't operate via my intelligence

89
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,860
or the things I have accomplished.

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,908
My resume should be, I'm black.

91
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:27,311
An Uncle Tom has traditionally been a black person

92
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,711
that tried to serve and curry favor with white people.

93
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:34,935
So, they believe that I wanna be accepted

94
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,117
in the white community.

95
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,524
Kinda like the House Negro back in slavery.

96
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:39,923
That I'm in the house.

97
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,886
"Master, what can I do for you?"

98
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,955
And I'm gonna suck up to them

99
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,512
and leave my people behind.

100
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,305
Most black people don't believe

101
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:51,175
that other blacks can be independent free-thinkers

102
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:54,179
or standing up--
You definitely don't.

103
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:56,423
Or stand up for what is right.

104
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:58,390
They believe that if a black person

105
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,908
stand up for what is right, they're a sell out.

106
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:01,741
They're a Uncle Tom.

107
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,440
The white people have to be brainwashing.

108
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,501
As my late grandfathers used to say,

109
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,668
who lived to be 94, "I does not care."

110
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,726
'cause he didn't have a lot of education.

111
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,595
He said, "I does not care."

112
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,038
So, I don't care if they call me names.

113
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,612
Just meet me at the bank.

114
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,589
(laughing)

115
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,685
And we'll compare bank accounts.

116
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,553
(soft music)

117
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:31,213
I am very optimistic about the future.

118
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,325
Frankly, I have seen certain changes

119
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:35,309
in the United States over the last two years

120
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,080
that surprise me.

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,060
I've seen levels of compliance

122
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,453
with the Civil Rights bill, and changes

123
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:44,393
that have been most surprising.

124
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,807
So, on the basis of this,

125
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:49,266
I think we may be able to get a negro president

126
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,099
in less than 40 years.

127
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:56,014
(somber music)

128
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,492
<v Announcer>In churches, in bars, on the streets.

129
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,848
Americans have been celebrating this great landmark

130
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,882
of the long struggle for civil rights.

131
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:10,839
In Chicago, the veteran black leader, Jesse Jackson,

132
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,170
broke down in tears.

133
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,211
In Atlanta, from the pulpit

134
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,246
of Martin Luther King's old church,

135
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:18,267
its pastor declared, "Tonight, we have seized

136
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,350
"the promise of America."

137
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,291
<v Man>Not to sound crazy,

138
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,575
but white people always had Jesus.

139
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,150
So, they always had that mentality,

140
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,650
I could be anything, even God.

141
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:33,253
For me, the image of him is like,

142
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,398
who's the most powerful person in the world?

143
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,639
Who's considered like a God, basically?

144
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,452
It's the president of the United States.

145
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:44,598
Obama became that image for us, like that Jesus.

146
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,312
We never looked at ourselves as being politicians.

147
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,105
We looked at ourselves as rappers.

148
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:52,938
or football, basketball players, drug dealers.

149
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,783
That's why I think Obama was important

150
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,399
in becoming president.

151
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,037
Because it gave us that optic.

152
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:02,132
Like, we could be whatever we wanna be.

153
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,723
<v Candace>It was America finally feeling

154
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,813
that we could let go.

155
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:09,121
Just let go and say we finally did it.

156
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,199
Progress is here.

157
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,682
I cried when he won.

158
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,432
(crowd cheering)

159
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:24,794
I never thought in my lifetime that it would happen.

160
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,136
But it happened today.

161
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:30,375
It's a reality and we did it.

162
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,261
America is now more united.

163
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,094
We did it.

164
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:36,155
I can't believe that I got the opportunity

165
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,453
to live, to see something so great.

166
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,102
I can't even describe it.

167
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:45,033
I can't believe I got the chance to vote for someone...

168
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:45,866
<v Woman>Just look around.

169
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,699
It's all young people, all colors.

170
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,533
I believe, when you dream, your dreams can come true.

171
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:00,139
Who would have thought that this year

172
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,351
a man like this will be elected

173
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,318
as the president of United States?

174
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,062
This is the beauty of America.

175
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,352
God bless America.

176
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,852
God bless America!

177
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,186
(drill whirring)

178
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,140
I became a Christian back in 2009.

179
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,617
The year prior, I voted for Barack Obama.

180
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:57,842
I was really passionate about Barack Obama and his policies.

181
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,663
I was having a conversation with a friend,

182
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:03,469
and I was telling him how I'm a Democrat

183
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:07,497
because the Democrat policy is pro-Medicaid,

184
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:09,806
pro-government benefits, all these things

185
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,763
that can help poor urban communities.

186
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:14,466
And doesn't the Bible say

187
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,620
that we're supposed to look out for poor people?

188
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,824
And this friend of mine, who's also a Christian said,

189
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:24,574
"Well, was it talking about the government

190
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:26,248
"or is it talking about you?"

191
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,454
(soft music)

192
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:30,067
And I was like, that's very interesting.

193
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,697
And so, I went back and read it

194
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,030
and it was talking about me.

195
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:40,732
A lot of the way that I saw things began to change,

196
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:42,982
but I was still a Democrat.

197
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,363
This friend of mine challenged me

198
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:50,937
to go and read the Republican platform

199
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,127
and read the Democrat platform.

200
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,877
And see where my values and my views line up.

201
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:01,518
My whole mindset was changing around this time,

202
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,844
and so I took him up on that offer.

203
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,363
I went in and I read the entire Democrat platform

204
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:09,222
and I read the entire Republican platform.

205
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:12,555
And I was like, "Man, I'm a Republican,"

206
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,795
I have learned to go beyond

207
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:19,577
just listening to what CNN says, or even Fox News.

208
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,040
I go on Fox News all the time,

209
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,835
but I decide to go beyond what they are saying

210
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,183
and what they're selling

211
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:29,766
and I'm able to listen and do the research on my own

212
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:34,318
so I know who I believe in, who am I voting for and why.

213
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,302
I used to be a Democrat.

214
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,952
I used to be hardcore, Barack Obama,

215
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:41,977
the Democrats are only here to help the people,

216
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:43,812
they're the party of the people.

217
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:45,698
And then I found out that the Democratic party

218
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,326
was the party of slavery, Ku Klux Klan,

219
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,149
the Jim Crow laws.

220
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,897
They were opposed to the civil rights movement.

221
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:54,488
The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendment

222
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,476
which freed the slaves, gave black people citizenship

223
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:58,691
and the right to vote.

224
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,941
The Democrats unanimously voted against

225
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,463
all of those rights.

226
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,509
And when I found that out,

227
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,587
and nobody could give me a legitimate stance

228
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,797
on how the party switched,

229
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,794
it's like I have no other choice

230
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:15,023
but to at least consider what principles

231
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,618
does the other side have?

232
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:17,787
What are they offering?

233
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:20,454
(ominous music)

234
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:24,789
<v Man>When I began to educate myself

235
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:27,505
on the history of the Democratic party,

236
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:29,423
I learned a lot about Margaret Sanger.

237
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,511
<v Margaret>I think the greatest sin in the world

238
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,461
is bringing children into the world.

239
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,496
That have disease--

240
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:38,829
And I learned about the birth of the Ku Klux Klan.

241
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:45,367
And I learned about the Jim Crow south.

242
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,534
And I learned about Black Wall Street.

243
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:56,218
And all of those events had Democratic hands in them.

244
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:02,011
It unraveled everything that I knew to be true.

245
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,511
Everything that the news media taught me.

246
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,784
Everything that my own culture taught me.

247
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:10,117
We're going to the studio.

248
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:12,829
News nugget.

249
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,022
Show time.

250
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:19,091
George Washington mural should be covered but preserved

251
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:24,067
according to a San Francisco school board decision.

252
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,037
Don't they have better things to do?

253
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,322
Do you know what the problem is with that mural?

254
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,842
It has a slave in it.

255
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:34,425
That was back then.

256
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,403
But they wanna cover up history.

257
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:42,175
It had a native American-Indian in it.

258
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,843
They don't like that.

259
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,406
It's part of history.

260
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:47,406
I focus on three things.

261
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,101
Performance, performance, performance.

262
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:56,751
The three things that are my guiding lights,

263
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,334
belief in God, belief in myself

264
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:05,058
and my belief in the United Sates of America.

265
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:06,811
I learned it from that man right there.

266
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:09,228
(soft music)

267
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,366
My dad worked three jobs until he could live off of two,

268
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:20,627
and he worked two until he could live off of one.

269
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:24,561
He used to be a chauffeur for the Coca Cola company.

270
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:27,795
And then one day he was asked to drive

271
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:31,545
for the chairman and CEO, Robert W. Woodruff.

272
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:36,376
It was like a 24/7, seven-day a week job.

273
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:37,579
I never heard him complain

274
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,935
about having to work so hard.

275
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,364
I never heard him complain

276
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:44,730
about what the government didn't do to help us.

277
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,184
We were poor, but we didn't know it.

278
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:48,873
We didn't have people screaming at us all the time

279
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:50,873
telling us we were poor.

280
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,983
My dad encouraged my brother and I

281
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,390
to get as much education as you can.

282
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,145
'cause he worked in an environment

283
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:01,014
where the most successful people

284
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:05,731
were the ones that had the greatest amount of education.

285
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:09,148
Success does not come in a straight line.

286
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:11,645
It's a zigzag.

287
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,389
I'm sick of us hearing about our people talking about,

288
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,531
"Oh, when I go to a job,

289
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,346
"they're gonna discriminate against me.

290
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:18,179
"White privilege."

291
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,373
I don't wanna hear a lick of that crap anymore.

292
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,745
(crowd applauding)

293
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,938
You're stronger than that.

294
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:27,615
You're more powerful than that.

295
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,825
I tell you what, I go to a job interview,

296
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,644
and someone don't give me an opportunity,

297
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,336
I'm a apply for every single job on the block

298
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,152
until I get a job.

299
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,757
I don't need no handouts, I don't need your excuses.

300
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,731
I'm a go harder than everybody else for their job.

301
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:43,637
And if you go hard, and you put yourself in position,

302
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,685
you'll be successful.

303
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,338
(somber music)

304
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,063
I never saw myself as handicapped,

305
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:52,742
because I was black, I was a woman,

306
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,137
that I came from poverty.

307
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:58,131
It was just not the way I processed the world.

308
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,167
As someone who got a GED, went to a community college,

309
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,232
then went on to get a four-year degree,

310
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:06,183
graduating magna cum laude,

311
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,632
while I was working 40 hours a week,

312
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:13,049
nights and weekends at the community college library.

313
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:17,954
My life has taken many turns.

314
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,795
I married at 16, I dropped out of school.

315
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,884
By the time I was 21, I had three small children.

316
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,274
I had no idea that I would end up going to college

317
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:29,274
and becoming a university professor.

318
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,986
Graduate school was very interesting for me

319
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,820
in a lot of ways.

320
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,309
I had this experience in a course

321
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,118
that was being taught by a white female,

322
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,653
she was actually a white liberal.

323
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,477
At some point in the classroom,

324
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:49,094
I'm sure I'd said something that really irked her

325
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:51,417
because she turned to me and she yelled,

326
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,719
"You'll never be able to change the fact

327
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,720
"that you're a black woman."

328
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,752
And I interpreted that to mean that I was handicapped,

329
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:00,835
whether I knew it or not.

330
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:05,527
There I learned that I was black, I was poor,

331
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,113
I was a woman, and that I was not supposed

332
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:09,786
to have accomplished the things

333
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:13,733
that I had already accomplished, which was success.

334
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,816
By then, it was too late.

335
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,067
<v Larry>When I was a kid, I went to a summer camp

336
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,956
in an area of California called Ukiah.

337
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,464
Really bucolic, flowers everywhere, it was just wonderful.

338
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,383
There was a Boy Scouts jamboree,

339
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:30,783
and there were hundreds of Boy Scouts

340
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,895
from all over California.

341
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:33,799
And from what I can tell,

342
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,799
there were just a handful of blacks.

343
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,246
I was in a cabin with maybe seven or eight kids,

344
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:44,136
and we'd been together now for three, four days.

345
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,825
And there was one kid.

346
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:47,210
He and I got into some sort of argument,

347
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,641
I don't remember why, and he called me a nigger.

348
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,360
And I literally had to restrain the other kids

349
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,713
from killing this guy.

350
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,210
I mean, they were just gonna kill him.

351
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,376
They were more angry about it than I was.

352
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:02,391
And so, I never really felt that those who are bigots,

353
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,712
the racists were in the majority.

354
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:05,677
I never really felt that.

355
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:08,336
I always felt that people who were bigots

356
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,421
intuitively were in the minority,

357
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,678
and most people didn't feel that way.

358
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:13,672
That seemed to be consistent

359
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:16,774
with my own personal experiences.

360
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,691
I was always confident.

361
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,749
I always knew I had a good memory,

362
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,490
made good grades, and my parents gave me

363
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,042
a lot of positive feedback because of that.

364
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,090
I always knew I was going to be an achiever,

365
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,277
and it was no doubt about that.

366
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,694
The only doubt was the route.

367
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,137
There was never a time when I thought of myself

368
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,887
as a victim, never, not one time.

369
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,076
You're afraid of being marginalized.

370
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,999
Welcome to what it feels like to be black.

371
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,433
A man caught on video unleashing a racist rant.

372
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,947
An alleged racist incident.

373
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:49,792
Racial bias.

374
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,061
Racist tendencies.

375
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,306
Racism.
Racism from coast to coast.

376
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,229
The open racism.

377
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:55,087
Statements of racism.

378
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,156
He was brutally beaten by attackers

379
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,390
yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

380
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,223
A racist drifter.

381
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:01,745
Is it racism, is it sexism?

382
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,567
How do we get white people to see racism

383
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,023
as their problem too.

384
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,987
That was racist.
Racist.

385
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,099
Go back to Africa kind of racism.

386
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,447
Straight up racist.

387
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,482
Racist tweets.
Racist tweets.

388
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,203
Those tweets are racist.

389
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:15,409
A racial dog whistle.

390
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:19,058
The most successful black Americans today

391
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,576
are Nigerian-Americans,

392
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,397
because they're not brainwashed by our media.

393
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:25,062
We've heard all about the big, explosive cases

394
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,105
of racial injustice in America.

395
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,046
But that's not what most black people in America deal with.

396
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:32,096
You deal with what we call micro aggressions,

397
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:35,677
or a 1000 cuts of racism every single day.

398
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:39,817
I grew up being told of my disadvantages.

399
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:43,341
That this country is unfair to black people.

400
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,705
You're black, you're not gonna be able to do it.

401
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:45,876
You can't get this, you can't get that,

402
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:46,904
you can't get bank loans.

403
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:48,333
When you walk into a bank,

404
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,387
you will get a loan more easily if you're a white guy.

405
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:54,493
The ideology is implanted into you subconsciously

406
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:55,858
to believe these things.

407
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:59,088
We don't teach our children to have confidence.

408
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:01,123
It's like we're brainwashed to think.

409
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:02,371
"Or is it because I'm black?

410
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:03,867
"Why are they looking at me like that?"

411
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,655
How many of you feel judged?

412
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:08,906
How many of you feel feared on sight

413
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,333
when people see you?

414
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,003
Show of hands.

415
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,237
We teach them to be scared of this country,

416
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:17,241
to be scared of the world that they live in.

417
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,853
It's like a cancerous plague

418
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,654
in the mind of black Americans.

419
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:21,897
You trying to say that this country

420
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:24,299
does not specialize in racism and bigotry?

421
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,117
I am saying that racism exists.

422
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,731
I am saying--
Exists,

423
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,010
but you have the luxury.

424
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,389
You have the luxury to be cavalier about it.

425
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,299
When you are angry, it's very easy to be deceived.

426
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,642
It's very sad to see black people operate in that.

427
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:43,156
There's a lot of members in the black community,

428
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:46,989
who they're operating in very negative energy.

429
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,562
I call out racism.

430
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,998
That is maddening to me, and I'm crying about it

431
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,637
because it's crazy--

432
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,642
If you keep yourself in this constant state

433
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:00,309
of woe is me, I'm disadvantaged,

434
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,971
I'll never accomplish anything,

435
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,874
then you won't accomplish anything.

436
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:07,246
It will be a self-fulfilling prophecy for you.

437
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,844
If you determine that you can't be successful

438
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,025
or that you're oppressed, then you are oppressed.

439
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,728
That's the power of the mind.

440
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,064
If you believe that you can't, you won't,

441
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,408
and you sure as hell won't try.

442
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:17,987
And black America has been programmed

443
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:19,310
to believe that we can't.

444
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,540
The country was founded on racism and bigotry, David.

445
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,796
If you turn on a radio morning show.

446
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,419
<v Woman>If you a African-American and the cops show up,

447
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,374
we don't know if we gon' make it out alive, I'm sorry.

448
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:31,713
<v Man>The message is clear.

449
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,482
<v Man>If you broke and white in America,

450
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,512
you're wasting your whiteness.

451
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:35,988
<v Man>And that's what's being fed

452
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:37,418
into the urban community.

453
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:40,231
<v Man>White supremacy is the backbone

454
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:42,931
of political and economic disenfranchisement of black folks.

455
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,964
So long as black people continue to have their psyche

456
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:50,327
filled by that nonsense, we won't have an awakening.

457
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:51,871
Trump is a racist.

458
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,693
He doesn't want more brown and black people here--

459
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,748
It gets brainwashed into you in multiple facets.

460
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:59,005
We tend to be geared towards entertainment.

461
00:20:59,005 --> 00:20:59,838
<v Snoop>You need to know

462
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,099
that a lot of your fans is racist.

463
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,326
People have used those entertainment personalities

464
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:07,981
to convince us subconsciously what we should believe.

465
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,770
If you like that nigga, you motherfuckin' racist.

466
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,603
Fuck you and--

467
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,891
♪ Fuck Donald Trump ♪

468
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:14,811
♪ Fuck Donald Trump ♪

469
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,317
♪ Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump ♪

470
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,571
I'm beginning to lose confidence

471
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,116
in the Trump administration.

472
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:22,235
(audience laughing)

473
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:25,202
Yeah, what do you think of that?

474
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,652
I think it's actually a great thing.

475
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,146
Jay Z has always been a drug dealer

476
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,137
to the black community.

477
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:31,970
He's very open about the fact

478
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,359
that he used to sell crack cocaine

479
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,033
when he was living in the projects,

480
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,594
and that's how he got ahead.

481
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,707
So, he was selling something that was harming

482
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:39,795
the black community.

483
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:41,028
Well, he's still doing that.

484
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:42,087
He's still selling something

485
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,388
that's harming the black community,

486
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,969
and it's flying off the shelves, and that's victimhood.

487
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:47,160
We have to have the conversation.

488
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,461
We have to have tough conversations.

489
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,792
We have to talk about the N-word,

490
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,338
and we have to talk about why white men are so privileged

491
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:54,230
in this country.

492
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,813
(somber music)

493
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,804
Colin Kaepernick, same exact hustle.

494
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:03,066
This is a half-white man who's chosen

495
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,126
to pick his hair out to be an Afro, to be black,

496
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:08,126
because right now victimhood is hot.

497
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,955
Colin Kaepernick is making a ton of money.

498
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,676
Jay Z is making a ton of money.

499
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:18,009
Is black America any better?

500
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,541
The communities are still hurting,

501
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,374
but they get to line their pockets

502
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:27,432
and we accept the same type of crack cocaine.

503
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,538
The left gets away with this

504
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:32,874
because 80 to 90% of the primary sources of news

505
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:33,707
are left-wing.

506
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:34,854
My father was a janitor.

507
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,932
He was born in the Jim Crow south.

508
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:38,805
Fast forward, my father in his late 40s,

509
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,072
started a small business,

510
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,454
got a little bit of property.

511
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:42,867
This is what happens in America.

512
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,932
Raised three boys, educated them.

513
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,702
We have a thriving black middle class.

514
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,325
If black America were a country, Brooke,

515
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,987
it would be the 15th wealthiest country in the world.

516
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:53,850
For crying out loud, this is not your grandfather's America.

517
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,412
America is an idea.

518
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,529
That's why we're different than every other country.

519
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,833
That's why we have freedoms that other countries don't.

520
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,902
That's why entrepreneurs are birthed here.

521
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,997
That's why there's so many millionaires here.

522
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:05,542
That's why black people are doing better here

523
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,036
than anywhere else in the world.

524
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:08,759
It's very simple.

525
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,578
This ideology, people begin to adopt around the world,

526
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:15,492
and they become successful.

527
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:16,951
It's an idea.

528
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,559
America is an idea.

529
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,017
Anybody who adopts the idea of America

530
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:23,650
will be American and successful.

531
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,739
If you don't adopt the idea, you're not American.

532
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,599
You're not get that forward in America

533
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,070
if you don't pursue the American idea.

534
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,254
(soft music)

535
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:34,921
You wanna hold it?

536
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,314
(cock crowing)

537
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:44,981
I love that this country values individuals.

538
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,705
As a black American in the United States,

539
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,800
I have autonomy in the things that I do

540
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,383
or are of my doing.

541
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,908
A lot people expect when you say farmer,

542
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:01,555
they're expecting wide tracts of land

543
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:03,991
and tractors and stuff, but we don't have any of that.

544
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:07,253
And I realize when I look back here every day,

545
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:11,130
I'm proud of what we've gotten done so far.

546
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,739
Started with chickens, which is the gateway farming

547
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:16,906
to goats, rabbits, horses.

548
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,333
These are my goats, Posey and Zelda.

549
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,345
One's a Nubian and one's a Kiko.

550
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,428
A really badly bred Kiko.

551
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,201
This year is the first year that I ever had goats.

552
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:36,632
Individualism, independence and taking responsibility

553
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,210
for your actions and for your food.

554
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,907
I think that as for promoting small government values.

555
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:42,447
When you do things yourself,

556
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:46,364
you don't need the government to do it for you.

557
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,718
I think black Americans should believe

558
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:54,040
and uphold the ideas of constitutional inherent rights.

559
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,747
Without those beliefs, we wouldn't be where we are today.

560
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,330
(somber music)

561
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:06,621
I will support and defend the constitution

562
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,649
of the United States of America against all enemies,

563
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:09,772
foreign and domestic.

564
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:12,310
I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,

565
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,376
that I take this obligation freely

566
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:17,058
without any purpose of evasion or mental reservations,

567
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,308
so help me God.

568
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:24,832
We don't take an oath to a color, to a party, to a person.

569
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:28,515
We take an oath to the thing that binds us all together,

570
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:32,848
and that's our constitution, that's our rule of law.

571
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,569
Those of us that understand that oath,

572
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,736
will always be guardians of the American republic.

573
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:47,433
If I want to see this nation that I love so dearly

574
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,165
continue on in the path of liberty, freedom

575
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,784
and individual rights, then I gotta make sure

576
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,221
that subsequent generations understand that.

577
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,985
They are willing to go out and fight for it and defend it

578
00:25:57,985 --> 00:25:59,334
just the same as I did.

579
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:02,660
Because I had a dad that inculcated that into me.

580
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,537
<v Man>Your green herring bones, but take your hat first.

581
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,741
That's the green hat with a brim on it.

582
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:06,941
Try it on.
At the age of 15,

583
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,763
when my dad said that there was no greater honor

584
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:09,625
than to wear the uniform

585
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,798
of the United States of America,

586
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:12,291
that's a powerful statement.

587
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:16,808
Coming from a man that was born in 1920 down in the south.

588
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,415
Never heard him say a bad word

589
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:21,359
about the United States of America.

590
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,539
He went off to serve and fight for this country,

591
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,358
even though this country did not see him

592
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:27,537
as it should have seen him.

593
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,454
But he wasn't a victim.

594
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,751
The black community really believe

595
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:35,174
that if they could show that they were willing

596
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:38,312
to stand side by side with white Americans

597
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,988
and fight for liberties and freedoms,

598
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:42,827
that sooner or later, people would understand

599
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:46,454
that we can't have this hypocrisy.

600
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:50,587
Executive order 9981 that President Harry Truman signed

601
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:51,966
that desegregated our military.

602
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:56,450
He finally realized that if we are true to ourselves

603
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,771
about the liberation of other people,

604
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,816
from the tyranny of Nazism, fascism

605
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:04,381
and Japanese imperialism, we gotta be true to that here

606
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,511
in our own country, in the United States of America.

607
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:10,117
And that's why Harry Truman's picture hangs in my house.

608
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:13,449
That's why the principles of the founders

609
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:15,032
speak loudly to me.

610
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:20,218
Even though we face the difficulties

611
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:23,885
of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.

612
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:30,786
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

613
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:33,903
I think it is an immoral posture

614
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,122
to hold the position that individuals,

615
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:41,040
whether they be Negroes or members of other minority groups,

616
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,273
should have their basic constitutional

617
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:46,961
and God-given rights held up.

618
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,073
Self governance is what all

619
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,881
of those grassroots people were seeking.

620
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:55,281
They understood that the victimizer,

621
00:27:55,281 --> 00:28:00,031
i.e. racism and discrimination may have knocked you down,

622
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:05,371
but it's the victim that has to get up.

623
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,898
Hello, sister Tasha Fields.

624
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,613
Hi, this Rob Woodson, how are you?

625
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:20,523
Good, listen.

626
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:22,177
I wanna invite you and your husband

627
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:24,734
to join this consortium of ours.

628
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:28,246
We're calling it the 1776 Consortium,

629
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:31,633
to respond to the 1619 piece that was done

630
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,177
in the New York Times.

631
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:36,659
I'm not interested in engaging in debate with them.

632
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,711
I'm saying, we need an accurate portrayal of slavery,

633
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,093
but it doesn't totally define the black condition.

634
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,377
We want our people to understand

635
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:46,570
that the future of black America

636
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,799
is not defined by slavery,

637
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,401
but by the kinds of things we did

638
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:53,547
and responds to these conditions,

639
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:57,103
similar to what you and your husband has overcome.

640
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:00,222
So, I'm gonna send you if I could,

641
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,581
a invitation to formally join us.

642
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,472
Because what we would like to do...

643
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:08,435
I wish that it would be mandatory reading,

644
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:09,830
not just in the black community

645
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,523
but all across America, to read the autobiography

646
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:14,523
of Booker T. Washington.

647
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:18,992
Here was a man that was born into slavery.

648
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:22,075
And when he learned that he was free,

649
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:26,066
his number one quest, his number one goal

650
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:28,066
was to get an education.

651
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,787
He walks from present day West Virginia

652
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:34,224
to Hampton, Virginia, to Hampton Institute,

653
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:36,675
so that he could show himself qualified

654
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:41,319
to enter that institution and get an education.

655
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,919
When he established Tuskegee Normal

656
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,839
and Industrial Institute,

657
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,677
it wasn't just about the book learning,

658
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:49,119
it was about industrial learning.

659
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,714
It was about people being able to take an education

660
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,974
and develop themselves into entrepreneurs

661
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:58,141
so that they could have self reliance.

662
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,743
There was a schism between Booker T. Washington

663
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:04,326
and W.E.B. Du Bois.

664
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:11,356
Booker T. Washington believed in the ability of someone

665
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:13,564
to get out there and work with industries

666
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,805
and show their value, by the talents

667
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:17,515
that they were able to develop,

668
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,848
by the businesses they were able to create and open.

669
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:27,106
The W.E.B. Du Bois faction more so believed

670
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:30,647
in that protest oriented demanding of rights

671
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,814
and things of this nature.

672
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:36,454
This is where you get the sellout, Uncle Tom

673
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:37,455
and all of these things

674
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:42,106
that they used to demonize Booker T. Washington.

675
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,464
But when you think about, in the long run,

676
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:45,631
who was right?

677
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,376
W.E.B. Du Bois was an avowed socialist,

678
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,264
who became an avowed communist,

679
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,948
who renounced his American citizenship.

680
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:58,186
But the institution that Booker T. Washington established

681
00:30:58,186 --> 00:30:59,936
is still there today.

682
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,421
We need to go back and understand

683
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,486
what Booker T. Washington was really,

684
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:09,558
his philosophy, what he was trying to get us to understand.

685
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:11,849
There's nothing wrong with hard work.

686
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,586
There's nothing wrong with working your way up

687
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:14,499
from the bottom.

688
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:19,257
Much the same as his autobiography says, up from slavery.

689
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:22,007
(dramatic music)

690
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,214
I had a college student ask me one time,

691
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:37,348
how did you deal with color and race

692
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:39,757
when you were climbing the corporate ladder?

693
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,424
My answer, I didn't.

694
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,743
Let them deal with it.

695
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:49,217
I didn't focus on that, I didn't have time.

696
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:57,380
I went to the president of the Pillsbury company

697
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,328
and said, "I need to get involved

698
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,185
"in some other aspects of the corporation,

699
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,221
"because I want to run one of the business units one day."

700
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:07,067
So, he said, "We need a lotta leadership in Burger King.

701
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:10,254
"You have to go and spend two weeks at Whopper College."

702
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:13,830
There really is a Whopper College in Miami.

703
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,583
I graduated summa cum laude.

704
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,833
(laughing)

705
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:23,690
I was working for the Department of the Navy.

706
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,637
The same day that I started, another white gentleman

707
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:28,861
named Robert started working there also.

708
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:31,070
We had very similar jobs.

709
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,329
So, the first 12 months, I got outstanding performance

710
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,060
four quarters in a row.

711
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,038
Second year, outstanding performance fur quarters in a row.

712
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:43,359
And Robert got outstanding performance.

713
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,020
But Robert was getting his GS salary increase

714
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,412
at least two months sooner than me.

715
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,836
So, I went to Wayne, my supervisor and said,

716
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:54,790
"Robert and I are both doing a great job."

717
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,458
He said, "Yeah."

718
00:32:56,458 --> 00:33:00,984
"But why is he getting little increases quicker than me?"

719
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:04,671
He said, "He has a Master's degree."

720
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:06,527
I said, "Oh, it's not because he's white?"

721
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:10,039
"Nope, he has a Master's degree."

722
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,664
So, you know what I did?

723
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,304
I didn't get mad.

724
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:16,422
I went and got me a Master's degree.

725
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:18,585
There are only four rungs to this ladder.

726
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,519
Went back, sat down with Wayne.

727
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,870
I said, "Well, I got a Master's degree.

728
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,732
"That says next time you have opening for a promotion,"

729
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:26,036
I said, "Keep me in mind.

730
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:28,214
"See you around."

731
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,570
And not long after that, they had a special project

732
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,043
called a rocket assisted projector.

733
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:34,979
They had to have someone

734
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:39,979
who was gonna be the GS 13 supervisor and mathematician,

735
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,096
to do the special ballistics

736
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,929
on this rocket assisted projector.

737
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:49,134
I got the promotion.

738
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:52,758
And I had eight white people working for me.

739
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:56,679
It was all about performance, not the color of your skin.

740
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,098
So, since I now had that Master's degree

741
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:02,348
and I had proved myself, I got the job.

742
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:06,364
When I decided to live Dahlgren,

743
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,673
never forget the department head.

744
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:11,049
And he called me up for an exit interview.

745
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,249
And I'll never forget Ross, I think he's deceased now.

746
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:19,220
He said, "You know, you have taught me something."

747
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,008
I said, "What?"

748
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:25,155
He said, "I had never worked with a black person before.

749
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,433
"You taught me, don't judge somebody

750
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,200
"by the color of their skin."

751
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,783
(somber music)

752
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:43,174
I grew up primarily around black people.

753
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,956
Primarily in what we call the Afrocentric perspective.

754
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:48,802
That mean, everything in life

755
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:52,458
was seen from the lens of being black in America.

756
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,391
I used to have gold teeth in my mouth.

757
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,533
I got young savage tattooed across my stomach.

758
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,602
I got my hood tattooed on my forearm.

759
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:02,185
So, I kinda had this whole hip hop culture,

760
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,355
negative, angry mentality.

761
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,292
I grew up believing that white people

762
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,866
did not like black people.

763
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,715
And that no matter what you did in life,

764
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:15,259
the white man is gonna hold you down.

765
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:19,342
My parents didn't teach me that I was a victim,

766
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,716
but there were other influences that did.

767
00:35:24,716 --> 00:35:27,710
Whether we're talking about uncles and aunts,

768
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,344
from the hip hop industry, the media.

769
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:34,067
It painted a picture of the black man in America

770
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,913
as being in a constant state of distress,

771
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,974
a constant state of disadvantage.

772
00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:42,142
And I have relatives of mine who bought into that message.

773
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,763
And I even bought into that message before I was born again.

774
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:47,525
The only people I knew who existed in my life

775
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:51,266
and who I could pick to be role models

776
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:53,164
were athletes and rappers.

777
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,341
So, many of you guys have watched my political awakening.

778
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:59,546
I've been pretty much in front of everybody on the stage

779
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:00,776
when I've had this reckoning,

780
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:05,051
but there's one person who totally transformed

781
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:05,884
the way that I thought.

782
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:08,255
There was a video that I saw on YouTube

783
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,452
and it was Larry Elder.

784
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:13,202
(crowd cheering)

785
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,952
Oh my God, they always call me the sunken place demon.

786
00:36:15,952 --> 00:36:16,785
I think it's the funniest thing...

787
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:18,483
Larry Elder is my mentor.

788
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:21,258
I can call him any time about any topic,

789
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:24,179
'cause there are still spots of ignorance that I have.

790
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:25,615
I'm having to contend with the fact

791
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,898
that all I have is the media narrative of things,

792
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,660
and he lived through it, he saw it,

793
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,130
and he'll tell me exactly what to look up and research.

794
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,675
Larry Elder was at the forefront

795
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,234
of being a thought leader,

796
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,706
in terms of questioning prevalent narratives

797
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,200
of the black community.

798
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,688
Especially with regards to individual accountability.

799
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:44,209
If you have parents who care about education,

800
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:45,865
there are books around and you're immersed in it,

801
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:47,712
you're gonna have a better situation

802
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:49,567
than somebody else with the same IQ

803
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,617
whose parents don't have that kind of motivation,

804
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:53,716
who don't immerse you in education.

805
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,389
Environment absolutely has a role.

806
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:57,825
He provided a huge part of my awakening.

807
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:00,121
One video of him with Dave Reuben,

808
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,169
and I went, "Oh my goodness!

809
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:03,272
"I've been so ignorant."

810
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,571
You wouldn't not acknowledge

811
00:37:04,571 --> 00:37:06,500
that there are some systemic issues.

812
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,596
Give me an example.

813
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:10,415
Tell me what you think the most systemic, racist issue is.

814
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:11,411
What is it?

815
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,796
Well, I would say that because black people

816
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,673
in most cases, in many cases,

817
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:20,673
were descendants of slaves, that racism as an institution--

818
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:22,061
In 2015?
A certain amount if it

819
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:24,263
just exists.
In 2015?

820
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:26,036
Give me the most blatant racist example

821
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,324
you can come up with right now.

822
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:31,099
I think you could probably find evidence

823
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:34,182
that in general cops are more willing

824
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:40,429
to shoot if the perpetrator is black than white.

825
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:43,682
What's your basis for saying that?

826
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:44,865
Look, I know a lot of people would say,

827
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,041
"Look what's going on in Chicago."

828
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,874
I know what they would say,

829
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:47,914
I'm talking about what the facts are.

830
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:51,500
965 people were shot by cops last year and killed.

831
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,521
4% of them were white cops shooting unarmed blacks.

832
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:59,028
In Chicago in 2011, 21 people were shot and killed by cops.

833
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,150
In 2015, there were seven.

834
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,593
In Chicago, which is 1/3 black, 1/3 white

835
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:05,953
and 1/3 Hispanic, 70% of the homicides

836
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,457
are black on black.

837
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:11,361
About 40 per month, almost 500 per year

838
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:12,498
last year in Chicago,

839
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,597
and 75% of them are unsolved.

840
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:16,402
Where is the Black Lives Matter on that?

841
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:19,069
The idea that a racist white cop

842
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:22,094
shooting unarmed black people is a peril to black people

843
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,713
is BS, is complete and total--

844
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:27,731
A white guy can say all this stuff all he want.

845
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:29,442
It's facts or it's not.

846
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,391
But Larry Elder did something different.

847
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:33,781
What this lie does, it causes young, black men

848
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,233
to be confrontational with cops

849
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:37,491
instead of cooperating, and it causes the cops to pull back

850
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:39,475
for fear that they'd be called racist--

851
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:43,928
I saw a black man that reminded me of myself

852
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:46,286
and other people I grew up with.

853
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:50,595
And I said, he's black, he came from a similar background.

854
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,173
How did he come to these conclusions?

855
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:54,072
It's incomparable to have porous borders

856
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,326
and a welfare state.

857
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,046
So, I think it's just common sense to say,

858
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:00,216
if you come here, you ought not be a charge on taxpayers.

859
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:01,893
Why is that so controversial?

860
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:04,180
In order to be persuaded or to like someone's work,

861
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,938
you don't have to share a race with them.

862
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:08,830
However, we're talking about a very important,

863
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,709
fundamental shift, like a breaking of the frame.

864
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:14,031
What's the purpose of an SAT?

865
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:16,662
The purpose of the SAT is to make sure

866
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:18,860
the student can do the freaking work

867
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,129
that's required of him or her

868
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:22,663
once they get admitted to that given university.

869
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,728
So, if you give 'em adjusted score

870
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,891
because of their disadvantaged nature,

871
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,939
that does not give them the ability

872
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,422
to compete at the school and succeed.

873
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:34,830
So, all you're gonna do is create more dropouts

874
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,663
than we already have,

875
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,159
because of race based preferences.

876
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,358
You're talking about breaking a very major narrative,

877
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:40,932
shattering a glass ceiling.

878
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:42,541
A lot of young black people are discovering me

879
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,997
and consider me to be something of a mentor,

880
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:47,924
the way I considered Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams.

881
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:49,661
Black people have never taken a position

882
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,850
that you describe.

883
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,254
So, it is not a question of what black people chose.

884
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:56,331
It is what you choose to put in the mouths of black people.

885
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:58,619
It's what you choose to project.

886
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,530
We didn't learn about these guys.

887
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,298
I didn't know who Thomas Sowell was until four years ago.

888
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:07,480
The engineer is judged by the end product

889
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,136
which is not simply ideas.

890
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:11,901
If he builds a building that collapses,

891
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,276
it doesn't matter how brilliant his idea was,

892
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:16,526
or he's ruined.

893
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:20,212
Conversely, if an intellectual who's brilliant

894
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:23,171
has an idea for rearranging society,

895
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,286
and that ends in disaster, he pays no price at all.

896
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,802
To hear Thomas Sowell destroy

897
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,269
all of this so-called data,

898
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:32,436
that the so-called enlightened among us

899
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:34,139
were using to try to get their way

900
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,265
and to try to shape policy--

901
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,678
But you would also have to agree

902
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,669
that generally speaking, women are paid less for example,

903
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:41,098
for the same jobs as men.

904
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:42,058
No, I would not.

905
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,129
I would not agree with that.

906
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:44,653
You're talking about women.

907
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,850
With the same number of years of experience.

908
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,438
With the same continuous service, et cetera, et cetera.

909
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:53,230
Then when I look at that, I don't find that disparity.

910
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,764
I find for example, in many cases, the women are making more

911
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:57,974
depending on how you break the data down.

912
00:40:57,974 --> 00:41:00,030
The difference with women

913
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,240
is between married women and everybody else.

914
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,740
If his message would have somehow penetrated through

915
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:13,064
all of the nonsense, and all of the manufactured,

916
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,958
preconceived notion that I bought into

917
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,962
and settled itself in my mind,

918
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:20,901
he would've been a huge influence for me.

919
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:25,873
Why wouldn't they teach us about Thomas Sowell in school?

920
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:27,421
<v Candace>I know Lebron James.

921
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,885
I know you guys are excited to see her.

922
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,683
I didn't know you guys would be excited to see me too,

923
00:41:30,683 --> 00:41:33,810
but thank you.
(crowd cheering)

924
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,310
I know all of these rappers.

925
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:39,618
I don't know Thomas Sowell.

926
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:43,119
I don't know about Walter Williams.

927
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,323
I've always been a radical.

928
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:46,004
I've always challenged the status quo.

929
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,418
<v Woman>If there's one person that you think

930
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,027
black America would be celebrating...

931
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:50,912
I supported things like minimum wage laws

932
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:53,012
'cause I thought it was a good idea.

933
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,634
Until I ran into some professor, he said,

934
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:57,369
"Well, look Walter, let's look at the effects

935
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:58,220
"of the minimum wage law,

936
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,856
"as opposed to looking at the intentions."

937
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:03,594
They gave me material to read and then I changed my mind.

938
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:06,761
It's like havin' a very successful family

939
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:09,624
that you never knew you had.

940
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:11,753
Until your grandfather dies

941
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,467
and y'all meet at the funeral.

942
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:18,237
While I was hangin' out with my cousin smokin' weed,

943
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:22,207
we got people in our family that have gone to Harvard.

944
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,522
We have people in our family that own businesses.

945
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,022
Highly successful.

946
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:32,008
Why have you hidden this from me?

947
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,774
It's unfortunate but history is written by academics,

948
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:37,906
and academia is a tool of the left.

949
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:40,820
If you find a very educated black American,

950
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,742
somebody who got a 4.0 at a public high school,

951
00:42:43,742 --> 00:42:46,229
they're actively learning their history wrong.

952
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:49,545
That's a part of the uphill battle that we have.

953
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:54,378
Is that if you are educated, you're actually mis-educated.

954
00:42:57,852 --> 00:43:00,580
When I was growing up, my mom was a Democrat,

955
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,208
remained a Democrat her entire life.

956
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,719
My dad was a Republican,

957
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,507
remained a Republican his entire life.

958
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:07,418
By the way, most blacks were Republican

959
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,067
until the New Deal.

960
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:11,067
My dad was born in 1915,

961
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,436
and my dad like most people his age was a Republican.

962
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:16,269
He never changed.

963
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,134
My mom became a democrat in large part

964
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:19,340
because of Franklin Roosevelt.

965
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,476
To 30 millions of our citizens,

966
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,409
who will reap direct benefits

967
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,879
through unemployment compensation.

968
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:27,911
<v Larry>Most blacks were Republican

969
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:30,301
to the extent that they could vote before the New Deal.

970
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:31,292
And when the New Deal came,

971
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,958
a number of blacks switched over to the New Deal.

972
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,003
That switch has continued.

973
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,318
<v Announcer>Only a few months before his tragic death,

974
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,112
President Kennedy called on the American Congress

975
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:42,679
to pass the most far reaching Civil Rights bill

976
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:44,680
in the nation's history.

977
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,954
To protect the constitutional rights of all citizens.

978
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:49,344
(audience applauding)

979
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:52,740
The shift came with the presidential election

980
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,153
between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.

981
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:58,931
Martin Luther King Jr. had been imprisoned,

982
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:03,146
and both sides asked their respective presidential candidate

983
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:06,538
to give a courtesy call to Coretta Scott King

984
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,700
and offer their condolences and their support

985
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,200
and what have you.

986
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:15,216
The rumor got out that John F. Kennedy did.

987
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:16,702
And so, the next thing you know,

988
00:44:16,702 --> 00:44:18,327
and every house down south,

989
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:21,348
and I can say this from my own eyeballs.

990
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:24,241
There were three pictures that hung in the living room

991
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:26,763
of any black home down south.

992
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:29,314
It was Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King Jr.

993
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:31,541
and John F. Kennedy.

994
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,728
<v Larry>John Kennedy promoted a dramatic tax cut.

995
00:44:34,728 --> 00:44:37,114
He was a coal warrior, he was a hunter,

996
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:39,131
he believed in the Second Amendment.

997
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:41,278
John Kennedy's collection of views right now

998
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,511
would make him a Republican.

999
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:46,604
He would not be welcome within the Democratic party.

1000
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:49,271
No memorial, oration or eulogy

1001
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,352
could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory

1002
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:58,439
than the earliest possible passage

1003
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:00,716
of the Civil Rights bill for which he fought so long.

1004
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:01,866
(audience applauding)

1005
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,340
It goes back to the mid-1960s

1006
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,507
as to why blacks believe they should be Democrats.

1007
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,133
In 1964, the Civil Rights Act passed.

1008
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,487
Lyndon Johnson signed it.

1009
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,404
1965, the Voting Rights Act passed.

1010
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,757
Lyndon Johnson signed it.

1011
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:30,757
So, he got credit for those two major pieces of legislation.

1012
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,935
But here's what they don't tell you.

1013
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:39,510
There was a larger percentage of Republicans in Congress,

1014
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,507
in both instances that voted for it

1015
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,626
than the percentage of Democrats that voted for it.

1016
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:48,791
Who enabled the Civil Rights legislation in '64 to pass

1017
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:51,753
was Senate Republicans, led by Everett Dirksen.

1018
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:53,882
Everett Dirksen got an award from the NAACP

1019
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:56,075
for helping to shepherd the act into fruition.

1020
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:57,277
Most blacks are unaware of that.

1021
00:45:57,277 --> 00:46:00,103
I didn't study that kind of stuff when I was in history.

1022
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:03,063
President Johnson was able to get

1023
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:05,760
the Civil Rights bill passed,

1024
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,602
and it was perceived that it was an effort

1025
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:10,167
on the part of the Democrats.

1026
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,873
And so that's a perception and a narrative

1027
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:17,201
that has been created, that caused the community

1028
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:20,368
to connect that event, momentous event

1029
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,619
to the Democratic party.

1030
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,812
And they have been using that idea

1031
00:46:26,812 --> 00:46:29,645
to effectively create a perception

1032
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:33,621
that the best friend to the black community

1033
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:38,038
is the Democratic party, which is far from the truth.

1034
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:40,759
Black people have been taught

1035
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,308
that the Democratic party wears the white hat

1036
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:45,951
when it comes to Civil Rights and racial justice,

1037
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:48,553
and Republicans have been described

1038
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:50,019
as wearing the black hat.

1039
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:55,019
If resistance to the Federal Court order ceases at once,

1040
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:59,019
the further presence of Federal troops will be unnecessary.

1041
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,195
And the city of Little Rock

1042
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,933
will return to its normal habits of peace and order.

1043
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,609
And a blot upon the fair name

1044
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:08,413
and high honor of our nation in the world

1045
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:09,799
will be removed.

1046
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:12,347
<v Man>Dwight Eisenhower was responsible

1047
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:16,490
for bringing the civil rights issues to the forefront.

1048
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,990
<v Martin>I have a dream, that one day...

1049
00:47:20,897 --> 00:47:25,287
It was a movement that was challenging America

1050
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:27,037
to embrace its ideas.

1051
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:30,221
Those ideas that were found

1052
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:32,299
in the Declaration of Independence,

1053
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,769
that all men are created equal.

1054
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,969
To hold our society, America,

1055
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:41,156
to the principles that were found in the constitution.

1056
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:43,042
And those constitutional principles

1057
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,104
that protect our liberties,

1058
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:48,457
and protect our individual rights,

1059
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:50,844
is what that civil rights movement was all about.

1060
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:54,661
There must be a revolution of values in our country.

1061
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:58,127
Because some of the values that presently exist

1062
00:47:58,127 --> 00:48:01,544
are certainly out of line with the values

1063
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:05,355
and the idealistic structure

1064
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:07,893
that brought our nation into being.

1065
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:10,523
Unfortunately, we haven't been true to these ideals.

1066
00:48:10,523 --> 00:48:12,929
<v Man>It was signed under the hope

1067
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:14,410
that that piece of legislation

1068
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,492
would open up opportunities for the blacks.

1069
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:21,087
To have equal access, to have first class citizenship,

1070
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:23,167
have better economic opportunities.

1071
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:27,890
That was the dream that Dr. Martin Luther King talked about.

1072
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,640
(crowd cheering)

1073
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:35,089
<v Larry>Al Gore's father, Al Gore Sr.,

1074
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:37,339
worked with other Democrats

1075
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,328
to mount what was at the time,

1076
00:48:41,328 --> 00:48:46,122
the longest filibuster in the history of the Senate.

1077
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:48,904
To prevent the bill from ever getting onto the floor

1078
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:49,821
for a vote.

1079
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:54,914
Al Gore's dad by the way died a Democrat.

1080
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:59,496
He didn't make a big switch to join the racist Republicans.

1081
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:02,975
Whenever I began to read the Republican party platform,

1082
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,869
I didn't find one thing in there

1083
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,119
that I felt as a black man targeted me.

1084
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:13,008
I began to wonder, well, if I can't find anything

1085
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:14,375
in their platform, maybe I can find something

1086
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,659
in the Republican party's past

1087
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:19,394
that gives me an example of how they targeted me

1088
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:20,644
as a black man.

1089
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:26,545
And I started with Abraham Lincoln, who was a Republican.

1090
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:30,124
You can argue, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation

1091
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:33,517
as a war strategy, and you could argue that.

1092
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:34,897
But at the end of the day,

1093
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:37,273
the fact of the matter is that it was a Republican

1094
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:40,457
who signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

1095
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:44,749
And then if you fast forward to women suffrage,

1096
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,832
it was a Republican Chief Justice in William Taft

1097
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:52,382
that struck down laws that made it illegal

1098
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,882
for women to vote.

1099
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,245
If you look at Jim Crow.

1100
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:05,258
It was Republican votes in the Senate and in the House

1101
00:50:05,258 --> 00:50:08,428
that was able to rid this country of Jim Crow.

1102
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:11,095
(ominous music)

1103
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:18,873
When we look at the history of entities like the KKK,

1104
00:50:18,873 --> 00:50:21,152
it was specifically intended

1105
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:24,155
to suppress the African-Americans

1106
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:27,210
and keep them from voting for Republicans specifically.

1107
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:31,127
That was always what the KKK was founded to do.

1108
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:35,650
A lot of black people were voting for Democrats

1109
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,484
because they were being forced to.

1110
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:39,323
If you don't vote for Democrats,

1111
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:41,397
the Ku Klux Klan are gonna come

1112
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:44,291
and lynch your eldest son.

1113
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,022
And so, you fast forward to today,

1114
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:48,374
the message is still the same.

1115
00:50:48,374 --> 00:50:49,851
If you don't vote for Democrats,

1116
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,118
the Republicans are gonna come.

1117
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:52,925
They can turn back voting rights.

1118
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,144
They can turn back many of the things

1119
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:58,789
that people suffered and died for.

1120
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,399
Didn't nobody donate to us the right to vote.

1121
00:51:02,399 --> 00:51:04,248
It's the same Democratic party.

1122
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:06,917
It's just, they learned to play the game better.

1123
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,753
We in the same ship.

1124
00:51:08,753 --> 00:51:11,226
It's the same suit just worned over.

1125
00:51:11,226 --> 00:51:12,464
It ain't nothing change.

1126
00:51:12,464 --> 00:51:14,222
The same party is doing the same thing

1127
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:15,878
they always been doing.

1128
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:18,849
Party of division, the party of power.

1129
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,520
If you're a minority, you're smart,

1130
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,566
you can believe what you wanna believe,

1131
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:23,802
support what you wanna support,

1132
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:25,482
you are free to do these things.

1133
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,637
We don't have to support one person.

1134
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:31,140
You don't have to drink at this one water fountain.

1135
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,322
We are free to make choices.

1136
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,516
It's like, okay, that's great.

1137
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:37,074
I choose to be a Republican, and when whoa!

1138
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:38,375
Everybody stop.

1139
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,958
(somber music)

1140
00:51:42,174 --> 00:51:45,652
He is encouraging a generation of foolish, young people.

1141
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:48,480
These are lost, disturbed, self-loathing people.

1142
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,295
Notice that all of those youngsters had caps on.

1143
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:55,580
It was almost like, we're gonna dress you for the photo.

1144
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,246
It's gone like from physical restrictions,

1145
00:51:58,246 --> 00:52:00,798
but now, in the 21st century

1146
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,880
as we're reaching the information age,

1147
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,252
it's a become a sort of metaphysical restriction

1148
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:07,317
as to what a minority can and can't do.

1149
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:08,700
Minorities shouldn't think this way.

1150
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,824
Minorities shouldn't support these people.

1151
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:12,808
Minorities shouldn't believe these things.

1152
00:52:12,808 --> 00:52:14,711
Black conservatives today,

1153
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,806
or anybody that has a black conservative message,

1154
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:18,807
we are the people that are escaping the plantation.

1155
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:21,278
The liberal will try to control a black person

1156
00:52:21,278 --> 00:52:22,724
through the concept of racism,

1157
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:25,353
because they know that we are very proud, emotional people.

1158
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:27,619
What was your reaction when black slaves

1159
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:29,262
escaped the plantation?

1160
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:30,286
It was swift.

1161
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:32,987
What I saw was a minstrel show today.

1162
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:34,723
Him in front of all of these white people

1163
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:35,973
embarrassing himself.

1164
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:38,089
When minorities don't support

1165
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,884
the agenda of the Democrats or the left,

1166
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:43,884
all of a sudden, the restrictions they put on years ago

1167
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:44,980
in a physical realm,

1168
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,934
they're now doing in a metaphysical realm.

1169
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,391
But are we 100% convinced?

1170
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:51,856
Are we back on the Kanye is not sick and off his meds?

1171
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:56,246
He really has a problem pumping the break here

1172
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:57,594
mentally and emotionally.

1173
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,146
Maybe he was missing his medication.

1174
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:02,309
Though makes clear that he has struggled

1175
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:05,832
and admitted diagnoses for personal mental health issues.

1176
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:09,816
Anybody who threatens their 95% monolithic black vote

1177
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,151
is an enemy.

1178
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:13,084
They've gotta be dealt with, they've gotta be put down.

1179
00:53:13,084 --> 00:53:14,478
Another stunning act of terror--

1180
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:16,686
A mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand.

1181
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:19,396
He claims to have been radicalized by Candace Owens.

1182
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,350
Saying that she was an inspiration to him.

1183
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,492
She has responded sarcastically.

1184
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,104
Few events I have not been blamed for.

1185
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:26,739
Brazilian mining dam collapse.

1186
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:28,825
Chinese air smog.

1187
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:30,839
Tenerife air crash, 1973.

1188
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,266
She's not taking this at all seriously.

1189
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:34,303
What do you think the press is doing

1190
00:53:34,303 --> 00:53:36,583
when you try to smear someone as having a mental disorder

1191
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:37,794
and when you say that someone

1192
00:53:37,794 --> 00:53:39,437
is inspiring a mosque shooting.

1193
00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:41,108
Or you're trying to make it so that my career

1194
00:53:41,108 --> 00:53:42,195
is effectively cut off.

1195
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:44,100
You're trying to make it so that nobody talks to me,

1196
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,247
so that I'm considered sort of this reject.

1197
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:48,863
I just have to say that I object strenuously

1198
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:51,801
to your use of the word hilarious.

1199
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:54,062
To me, this feels a lot like your reaction

1200
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:56,967
to being named on one of these manifestos.

1201
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,688
Now, you're of course not responsible

1202
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:02,761
for the words of somebody writing that document.

1203
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:06,788
But I do think that laughing at it is a real problem,

1204
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,337
because these are real families

1205
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:10,059
that are impacted by this violence.

1206
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:12,821
I'm a black female who came from poverty.

1207
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:14,818
I should be at the top of the progressive stack.

1208
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,235
I should be receiving awards.

1209
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:18,219
They should be calling me, inviting me on the red carpet

1210
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,879
to share my story, but they're not.

1211
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:20,712
Why?

1212
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:22,784
Because I'm not saying what they want me to say.

1213
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:25,937
You would rather assign meaning to a homicidal maniac

1214
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:29,445
than to actually address the things that I said today

1215
00:54:29,445 --> 00:54:31,495
that are actually harming black America.

1216
00:54:31,495 --> 00:54:33,383
Number one, father absence.

1217
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:35,559
Number two, the education system

1218
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:36,523
and the illiteracy rate.

1219
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,381
Allele immigration ranks high, abortion ranks high,

1220
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,441
white supremacy and white nationalism,

1221
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:43,899
if I had to make a list again of 100 things,

1222
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:45,766
would not be on it.

1223
00:54:45,766 --> 00:54:48,452
This hearing in my opinion is a farce,

1224
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,139
and it is ironic that you're sitting here

1225
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:52,562
and you're having three Caucasian people testify,

1226
00:54:52,562 --> 00:54:54,201
and tell you what their expertise are.

1227
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:55,519
Do I know what my expertise are?

1228
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,739
Black in America.

1229
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,459
I've been black in America my whole life.

1230
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,363
All 30 years, and I can tell you,

1231
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,252
that you guys have done the exact same thing

1232
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:04,441
every four years ahead of an election cycle

1233
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,874
and it needs to stop.

1234
00:55:05,874 --> 00:55:08,674
I think probably the most hated

1235
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:11,891
political person in America, is a black conservative.

1236
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,676
And that's because we refute the entire philosophy

1237
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:18,320
of the Democratic party.

1238
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,987
(ominous music)

1239
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:26,856
<v Man>I think the fact that a black person

1240
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,526
can start in government housing,

1241
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,205
and go on to be one of the most successful brain surgeons

1242
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,372
ever to exist,

1243
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:36,613
that's somebody you should emulate.

1244
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,548
That's someone you should idolize.

1245
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:41,806
That's someone you should put on a pedestal.

1246
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:45,335
Came from nothing, became a neurosurgeon,

1247
00:55:45,335 --> 00:55:46,862
one of the greatest men in the world.

1248
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:51,529
Some of things he done, nobody's ever done in the world.

1249
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,673
He was the first person to perform surgery

1250
00:55:55,673 --> 00:55:58,340
on conjoined twins at the brain.

1251
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:00,354
No one wanted to do that.

1252
00:56:00,354 --> 00:56:02,077
And he did that as a black man.

1253
00:56:02,077 --> 00:56:05,525
I don't think myself as a surgeon,

1254
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:09,315
just a guy people pay to stab their brain

1255
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:10,778
(audience laughing)

1256
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:12,451
until they're healthy.

1257
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:13,752
(audience laughing)

1258
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:16,090
A quick back story on Dr. Ben for those who don't know.

1259
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:17,541
He's a former brain surgeon

1260
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,103
and Republican presidential candidate,

1261
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:21,151
who our celebrity in chief, Donald J. Trump,

1262
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:24,314
nominated as his HUD secretary in 2017,

1263
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,381
despite him having zero relevant experience.

1264
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:29,744
Ben Carson is a very intelligent person.

1265
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:33,760
To ignore that and say like, oh well, he's a doctor.

1266
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,478
He has no business in government.

1267
00:56:35,478 --> 00:56:36,370
Really?

1268
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,061
So we can't even have people

1269
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,460
who are smart enough to be doctors

1270
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,518
in the government now?

1271
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:41,930
Like, who do you want to be in the government then?

1272
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,213
Just because Dr. Ben Carson

1273
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,677
is a well educated neurosurgeon,

1274
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:46,106
who doesn't speak fluent nigger

1275
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:47,973
doesn't mean he's acting white.

1276
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:49,706
So, I don't agree with calling people Oreos

1277
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,008
but I can see why you would call Dr. Ben Carson one.

1278
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:55,295
Ben Carson, do you pass the black test?

1279
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,634
You know, I grew up in Detroit and I grew up in Boston.

1280
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:03,261
In Boston, we lived in the ghetto.

1281
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:06,769
(audience laughing)

1282
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:09,090
Excuse me, you grew up in a what?

1283
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:09,923
A ghetto?

1284
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:12,815
A ghetto?

1285
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:15,563
That sounds like a French person saying cat in Spanish.

1286
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:16,945
What is that?

1287
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:19,867
What kind of black person says, "Ghetto."

1288
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:22,568
Mother (bleep) I'm straight outta Compton.

1289
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:26,336
This kind of crap goes on all the time.

1290
00:57:26,336 --> 00:57:29,476
They're trying to say he is not black enough.

1291
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:32,907
I was at a Popeyes organization,

1292
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,574
and then I deposited basketballs

1293
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:38,965
at the urban athletic complex.

1294
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:42,981
Thereafter, I rounded out the night

1295
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:44,722
by making it precipitate

1296
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,753
at a ladies clothing removal facility.

1297
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:48,973
(audience laughing)

1298
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:49,965
We wanna shun him.

1299
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:52,145
He's a sellout, he's a coon.

1300
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:54,108
We wanna remove his name off of schools.

1301
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:55,784
The Detroit school board now considering

1302
00:57:55,784 --> 00:57:58,404
stripping the name of HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson

1303
00:57:58,404 --> 00:58:02,449
off of a local school, over his ties, yes, to the president.

1304
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,797
<v Larry>I've cringed when I've seen the way

1305
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:05,905
people like Ben Carson get treated by the media.

1306
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:08,913
For example, when Carson first became HUD secretary,

1307
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:12,232
he gave a speech where he likened slaves to immigrants.

1308
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:13,969
A land of dreams and opportunity.

1309
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,578
There were other immigrants who came here

1310
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:16,866
in the bottom of slave ships,

1311
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:20,283
worked even longer, even harder for less.

1312
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:22,929
But they too had a dream.

1313
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:25,382
<v Larry>And he got fried, especially in the black media.

1314
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:28,617
Like we actually came here on our own accord.

1315
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:29,803
Shackled.

1316
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:31,001
Beat.

1317
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:33,358
Shot, killed, on our way here to find a better life.

1318
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:35,393
How does he miss that no slave

1319
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,786
came to this country willingly?

1320
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:40,594
This is one of the most atrocious acts

1321
00:58:40,594 --> 00:58:43,957
of historical revisionism that one might imagine.

1322
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:47,540
It wasn't always easy for new immigrants.

1323
00:58:49,243 --> 00:58:52,409
Certainly it wasn't easy for those of African heritage

1324
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,729
who had not come here voluntarily,

1325
00:58:55,729 --> 00:59:00,062
and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves.

1326
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:05,107
<v Larry>Obama said the very same thing at least 11 times.

1327
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,857
Nobody said anything.

1328
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:12,078
The left claims it advocates for black people,

1329
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:14,525
but they really advocate for left wing black people.

1330
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:19,486
Reagan won Pennsylvania by the margin of despair.

1331
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:22,281
By the margins of fracture of our coalition.

1332
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:23,891
Your time has come.

1333
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:27,714
Pick up your slingshot, pick up your rock.

1334
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:29,881
Declare our time has come.

1335
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,391
<v Jesse>When I became old enough to vote,

1336
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:35,872
I registered as a Democrat,

1337
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:39,123
because that's what the black people did.

1338
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:42,537
I suffer for it because I started to believe

1339
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,114
what the Democratic party was saying.

1340
00:59:46,114 --> 00:59:48,281
I believed into their lie.

1341
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:54,208
Louis Farrakhan would come out here to LA

1342
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,204
and he would give talks at The Forum,

1343
00:59:56,204 --> 00:59:58,935
and he talked about how bad the old blue-eyed devil was.

1344
00:59:58,935 --> 01:00:02,352
We and white people are mortal enemies.

1345
01:00:05,075 --> 01:00:07,549
They were not made to be our friends.

1346
01:00:07,549 --> 01:00:09,775
They were made to be our enemies,

1347
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:13,872
and they are that, and they can't be nothing but that.

1348
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:15,630
They're locked into that.

1349
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,550
There ain't no redemption for them.

1350
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,956
That is why I challenge you now to stand together.

1351
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:24,544
<v Jesse>I would listen to Jesse Jackson.

1352
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,794
Raise your fists together

1353
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:32,317
and engage in our national black listening...

1354
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,376
I would listen to them, and they would say

1355
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:37,336
and it's all white people fault.

1356
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:38,579
And so, I started to believe

1357
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,877
because nobody else was opposing what they were saying.

1358
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:42,999
And for the first time in my life,

1359
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:45,987
I started to resent white people.

1360
01:00:45,987 --> 01:00:47,338
I suffered for it.

1361
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:51,005
I finally got over it but I suffered for it.

1362
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:57,284
When I turned 30-something, I started asking questions like,

1363
01:00:57,284 --> 01:01:01,527
if the white man is holding me back because I'm black,

1364
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:03,610
why is it that they're not holding Jesse Jackson

1365
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:07,511
and his family back, the so-called NAACP and all of them.

1366
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:09,593
Their kids went to the best school,

1367
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:11,671
they had father and mothers in their homes

1368
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:13,365
and they were doing very well.

1369
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:16,680
And so, I wonder, why is it that they're not holding

1370
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,630
those people back if they're holding me back

1371
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,929
because I'm black.

1372
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,414
And that's when I realized I've been lied to.

1373
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:24,104
And everything started changing.

1374
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:26,400
Jesse Jackson is a racist demagogue,

1375
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,453
and he's built a career

1376
01:01:27,453 --> 01:01:28,968
on keeping black people down.

1377
01:01:28,968 --> 01:01:31,323
Keeping 'em angry, brainwashing them

1378
01:01:31,323 --> 01:01:34,180
to control them for his own personal gain.

1379
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,401
And they have lost that power--

1380
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,734
Speak your mind, Reverend.

1381
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:44,828
I grew up in Alabama on a plantation,

1382
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:47,265
and I grew up under Jim Crow laws.

1383
01:01:47,265 --> 01:01:49,150
They deliberately kept us down

1384
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:52,546
by causing us to become angry, destroying the family

1385
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,722
and demoralizing black people.

1386
01:01:54,722 --> 01:01:56,834
And so, what we're trying to do is wake them up

1387
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,541
to that reality.

1388
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:01,694
When I was growing up, I was just taught good and evil,

1389
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,111
right versus wrong.

1390
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:05,628
I had never even heard the word racism.

1391
01:02:05,628 --> 01:02:07,791
We knew that it was a spiritual battle

1392
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:11,041
between right and wrong, good and evil.

1393
01:02:13,153 --> 01:02:15,377
There was no such thing as racism, sexism

1394
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:18,274
or homophobia-ism, Islamophobia-ism.

1395
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:21,445
Or there be that ism, or white supremacism.

1396
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:22,678
It didn't exist.

1397
01:02:22,678 --> 01:02:25,216
That only came about when we allowed the Democrats

1398
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:26,049
to take over.

1399
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:29,018
They start making up words to deceive us.

1400
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:31,731
We've got to deal with homophobia in our communities.

1401
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,225
Including the black community.

1402
01:02:33,225 --> 01:02:36,188
A lot of the black civil rights leaders

1403
01:02:36,188 --> 01:02:38,842
have abandoned the moral high ground,

1404
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,701
and have perverted the civil rights movement

1405
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:43,002
to the point where it's become

1406
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:45,456
a part of a race grievance industry.

1407
01:02:45,456 --> 01:02:48,523
We're on the brink of undoing

1408
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:51,288
what Dr. King and others went to jail for.

1409
01:02:51,288 --> 01:02:52,444
Blacks have been convinced

1410
01:02:52,444 --> 01:02:53,951
that they're supposed to respect you,

1411
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,256
if you have the title, reverend or pastor,

1412
01:02:56,256 --> 01:02:57,692
even if you're no good.

1413
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,362
You probably can't even remember

1414
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:00,893
a sermon from Al Sharpton.

1415
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:02,501
Reverend Al Sharpton.

1416
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:03,917
He's a reverend of what?

1417
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,394
In politics, the road to the White House

1418
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:07,233
took a detour through Harlem today.

1419
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:09,587
It is like a rite of passage for Democratic candidates,

1420
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:12,450
as an outreach to the African-American community.

1421
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,058
Well toady, South Bend, Indiana mayor, Pete Buttigieg

1422
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,114
had lunch at Sylvia's with Reverend Al Sharpton.

1423
01:03:18,114 --> 01:03:20,681
<v Announcer>Barack Obama dined here in 2008.

1424
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:23,397
So did Bernie Sanders in 2016.

1425
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:26,847
I could tell the Negroes to go left and they'll go left.

1426
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:28,645
How much are you willing to pay me

1427
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:32,105
to get the Negroes to do what I want them to do?

1428
01:03:32,105 --> 01:03:34,290
They're the ones that receive the contributions

1429
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,905
to say, "Hey, let's keep these people subjugated.

1430
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:38,774
"Let's keep them voting for us,

1431
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,250
"and you do what is necessary.

1432
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,558
"And help us to squelch these voices

1433
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:45,338
"that are rising up in opposition to what we believe."

1434
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:46,864
They're leading the narratives

1435
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,715
that others want them to lead.

1436
01:03:48,715 --> 01:03:51,548
And today, we shall pour outrage

1437
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,218
is when you keep pressing people down.

1438
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:56,775
<v Man>If we can get the black community

1439
01:03:56,775 --> 01:04:01,108
to hate the police, then they'll keep breaking laws.

1440
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,629
<v Larry>So they gotta keep black people angry,

1441
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:08,046
stirred up angry, ticked off.

1442
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:15,044
How else do you get 95% of people

1443
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:18,361
to pull the lever for a party,

1444
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:21,688
whose views are absolutely inconsistent

1445
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:23,748
with the best interests of the country in general

1446
01:04:23,748 --> 01:04:26,544
and of the best interests of black people in particular.

1447
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:29,015
<v Martin>We still advocate nonviolence

1448
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:32,999
with passive resistance, and still determined to use

1449
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:34,807
the weapon of love.

1450
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:38,170
But we are still insisting emphatically

1451
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,276
that violence is self defeating.

1452
01:04:41,276 --> 01:04:44,835
That he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.

1453
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:47,194
<v Man>Martin Luther King was a pastor.

1454
01:04:47,194 --> 01:04:49,566
He was a genuine pastor.

1455
01:04:49,566 --> 01:04:51,509
That's why Martin Luther King can't be around.

1456
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,242
He can't leave.

1457
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:54,742
He's too powerful.

1458
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,319
The anger building up in a community

1459
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,495
which causes people to riot

1460
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:03,747
and to tear things down and to burn things up,

1461
01:05:03,747 --> 01:05:07,246
it goes to show that black people don't feel these days

1462
01:05:07,246 --> 01:05:08,317
like we're building anything.

1463
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:10,254
That we're contributing to anything.

1464
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,187
When it comes America,

1465
01:05:12,187 --> 01:05:13,941
black people helped build this country.

1466
01:05:13,941 --> 01:05:16,358
(soft music)

1467
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:19,953
When you look back at the history of black people

1468
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:22,640
here in America, once we were free from slavery,

1469
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,391
we were successful in ways, and we overcame things

1470
01:05:26,391 --> 01:05:29,023
and we did things far beyond

1471
01:05:29,023 --> 01:05:31,221
our predecessors could have imagined.

1472
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:35,462
Simply because we had that almost instinctively in us.

1473
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:38,304
As blacks emerged from slavery,

1474
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:41,667
minute percentage could read or write.

1475
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,390
And yet in 1/2 a century,

1476
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,763
over 1/2 the black population was literate.

1477
01:05:45,763 --> 01:05:47,162
And economic historians call that

1478
01:05:47,162 --> 01:05:51,616
one of the most remarkable things in history.

1479
01:05:51,616 --> 01:05:54,398
<v Man>So, in the late 1800s,

1480
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:59,007
we had actually in not very well documented boon

1481
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:01,380
of African American proliferation

1482
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,130
into the political space, into the entrepreneurial space.

1483
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:08,548
And we had real movers and shakers

1484
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,376
in our communities who were doing real things.

1485
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:13,652
Because at one time, blacks were Republicans,

1486
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:14,709
and you dominated.

1487
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,885
Those seven years after the Civil War,

1488
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:18,284
you were Republicans.

1489
01:06:18,284 --> 01:06:21,615
You had more blacks in the House and Senate than you do now,

1490
01:06:21,615 --> 01:06:25,175
and you dominated your own economic communities.

1491
01:06:25,175 --> 01:06:27,508
You did that as Republicans.

1492
01:06:29,271 --> 01:06:31,939
But then what happened was that Democrats realized

1493
01:06:31,939 --> 01:06:33,901
they could still control us

1494
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:38,318
by enacting new laws to suppress our civil liberties.

1495
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:43,296
That brings us to the rise of Jim Crow.

1496
01:06:43,296 --> 01:06:45,997
The Jim Crow era and Ruby Bridges going to school,

1497
01:06:45,997 --> 01:06:50,687
that happened in the 1950s, 1960s, that general era.

1498
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:52,821
But we had Hiram Rhodes Revels

1499
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:54,980
and many other African-Americans

1500
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,724
rise to positions of power in the political space

1501
01:06:57,724 --> 01:06:59,400
in the late 1800s.

1502
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,705
So, there's this gap of missing achievement that we have,

1503
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:05,788
and that is what the KKK,

1504
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,113
that is what the Jim Crow laws did to our community.

1505
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,279
You can't depend on a government school

1506
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:19,817
to teach you raw history.

1507
01:07:19,817 --> 01:07:23,230
You're gonna see people like even Frederick Douglas

1508
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,832
become less and less and less celebrated,

1509
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:27,505
and less and less and less popular

1510
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,599
because he doesn't really fit the narrative.

1511
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,879
He was a Republican, very American.

1512
01:07:32,879 --> 01:07:34,508
When they wanna teach you somebody that was great

1513
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:37,226
in black American history and they happen to be Republican,

1514
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:38,527
they don't tell you that element.

1515
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:40,650
And they also, and this is sort of one of the biggest myths

1516
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:44,550
that they tell you, that the parties completely switched.

1517
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,551
They have to say the parties switched.

1518
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:47,993
They have to.

1519
01:07:47,993 --> 01:07:51,227
Because they can't acknowledge

1520
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:54,026
that they're part of all of the worst things

1521
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:56,347
that have ever happened to black people in history.

1522
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:57,449
And if you know better

1523
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,325
and you know the parties didn't switch,

1524
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,900
and you just look at today,

1525
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,529
there's still a part of every negative thing

1526
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,516
that have happened to black people in America.

1527
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,547
<v Larry>Let's just take one issue.

1528
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,264
And that's the issue we've talked abut for a long time

1529
01:08:10,264 --> 01:08:11,538
and that's vouchers.

1530
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:14,089
<v Reporter>They have to pass through metal detectors.

1531
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:15,728
They're faced by security guards

1532
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:17,422
looking for hidden weapons.

1533
01:08:17,422 --> 01:08:19,747
They're watched over by armed police.

1534
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:21,450
<v Larry>You're required to send your kid to a school

1535
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:24,813
where only 3% of kids can do math at grade level,

1536
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:26,928
because you have no option.

1537
01:08:26,928 --> 01:08:28,933
Republicans want you to have an option.

1538
01:08:28,933 --> 01:08:30,132
But Republicans of course are racist

1539
01:08:30,132 --> 01:08:32,261
so you can't vote for them, right?

1540
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:33,191
What a dilemma!

1541
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:35,380
Slave codes in the early 19th century

1542
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:38,717
made it illegal for black Americans to learn to read, why?

1543
01:08:38,717 --> 01:08:42,177
Because if slaves could read, they could access information.

1544
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:44,078
I don't believe that much has changed.

1545
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,023
If the parties did switch

1546
01:08:45,023 --> 01:08:47,169
and Democrats really are the party

1547
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:49,336
of, for and by minorities,

1548
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:53,482
then why do they react so viciously

1549
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:56,770
when you introduce legislation

1550
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,212
that would help the minorities by giving them school choice?

1551
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:02,812
There's answers to all these questions.

1552
01:09:02,812 --> 01:09:04,442
But you have to be the one to find them.

1553
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:06,789
Because no one else is going to tell you

1554
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:08,930
the inconvenient truth.

1555
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,680
The welfare state is slavery 2.0.

1556
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:19,511
The biggest falsehood, the biggest lie

1557
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:24,011
that gets repeated is that the kind of disorganization

1558
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:27,524
and chaos and violence

1559
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:31,360
and self-destruction that we're witnessing

1560
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:36,360
in the black community is somehow a legacy of slavery

1561
01:09:36,427 --> 01:09:38,121
and Jim Crow.

1562
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:39,704
That is just a lie.

1563
01:09:43,648 --> 01:09:47,808
Because if that were so, between 1930 and 1940,

1564
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,342
during the years of the depression,

1565
01:09:50,342 --> 01:09:54,199
when segregation and racism was enshrined in laws,

1566
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:57,873
when there was no black representation in government,

1567
01:09:57,873 --> 01:10:01,474
even in the face of these horrible conditions,

1568
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:04,127
the black community had the highest marriage rate

1569
01:10:04,127 --> 01:10:06,127
of any group in society.

1570
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:11,058
Our institutions served as an anchor for us.

1571
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:14,999
And so therefore, elderly people could walk

1572
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:17,226
in their neighborhood without fear

1573
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:20,726
of being assaulted by their grandchildren.

1574
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:27,044
Our business formation rate was high then.

1575
01:10:27,044 --> 01:10:29,485
<v Reporter>Has yielded a 1/2 million dollar yearly growth.

1576
01:10:29,485 --> 01:10:31,370
If we were able to accomplish

1577
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,000
the building of hospitals, dental schools, hotels,

1578
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
movie theaters, Vaudeville theaters.

1579
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:42,865
If we were able to accomplish this

1580
01:10:43,966 --> 01:10:46,714
and not engage in the kind of self-destruction...

1581
01:10:46,714 --> 01:10:48,839
<v Man>What's the proper way to mug a nigga?

1582
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:51,445
You know, walked on him, grab him by his hood and,

1583
01:10:51,445 --> 01:10:52,763
one to the head.
One to the head.

1584
01:10:52,763 --> 01:10:54,075
I'm a hit you one time in the head,

1585
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:55,606
two times in the chest.

1586
01:10:55,606 --> 01:10:57,856
How can you explain that?

1587
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:01,246
<v Candace>How is that possible in a society

1588
01:11:01,246 --> 01:11:04,199
that has experienced so much social progress,

1589
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:07,289
that we are seeing a decline in the black community?

1590
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:09,499
The statistics of illegitimacy, crime rates

1591
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:11,322
and illiteracy have worsened

1592
01:11:11,322 --> 01:11:13,694
since the time of segregation and Jim Crow.

1593
01:11:13,694 --> 01:11:16,111
(soft music)

1594
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:27,182
<v Larry>Before the war on poverty launched,

1595
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,768
87% of blacks lived below the federally defined

1596
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,851
level of poverty in 1940.

1597
01:11:33,262 --> 01:11:37,017
By 1960, that number had decreased to 47%.

1598
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:39,350
A 40-point drop in 20 years.

1599
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:42,979
That's probably the greatest economic prosperity period

1600
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:46,132
for blacks in the history of this country,

1601
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:48,470
and this all happened before affirmative action,

1602
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,470
before the so-called war on poverty.

1603
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:55,570
<v Man>Back then it was commonplace

1604
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:58,320
to have both parents in the home.

1605
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:02,460
If you made a commitment and you marry somebody

1606
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,460
and you had kids, you stay with 'em.

1607
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:09,308
<v Man>It wasn't just about your immediate family.

1608
01:12:09,308 --> 01:12:12,391
It was also about your church family.

1609
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:17,953
<v Jesse>In those days, black men were in control.

1610
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:21,153
The black woman respected the black man.

1611
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:24,468
<v Man>Having a strong father showed me how to be a man.

1612
01:12:24,468 --> 01:12:27,718
It also showed me how to treat a woman.

1613
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,747
<v Man>When I was young, I remember going to open house

1614
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:35,747
and everybody's parents were there, everybody's.

1615
01:12:46,723 --> 01:12:50,973
Up until 1962-'63, 85% of all black families

1616
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:55,208
had a man and a woman raising children.

1617
01:12:56,361 --> 01:12:59,111
But that all changed in the '60s.

1618
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:04,444
If you estimate that the welfare is paying,

1619
01:13:04,444 --> 01:13:08,777
I guess, six, $7 billion dollars a year in benefits,

1620
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:13,071
how much would you say is denied by these illegal practices?

1621
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:15,491
<v Rob>The architect of this destruction

1622
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,982
was Cloward and Piven.

1623
01:13:16,982 --> 01:13:18,509
The American public welfare system

1624
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:23,028
is only expanding 1/2 of what it should be expanding

1625
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:24,346
if it were reaching all of the people

1626
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:27,742
who are eligible under existing statutes.

1627
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,854
So, we think welfare costs should probably double.

1628
01:13:29,854 --> 01:13:33,040
A couple of renowned sociologists

1629
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,056
at the Columbia University School of Social Work.

1630
01:13:37,056 --> 01:13:40,556
And their theory was, if we could separate

1631
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:46,708
work from income, it would make men redundant,

1632
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:50,791
and if we can just remove the stigma from welfare

1633
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:56,609
and entice more people to flood the welfare system,

1634
01:13:56,609 --> 01:14:00,480
it will bankrupt cities and the country.

1635
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,232
<v Dr. Wiley>The welfare rights movement and the lawyers

1636
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:05,270
are challenging man in the house rules,

1637
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,822
and other kinds of requirements which are restricting.

1638
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:10,458
This, I presume would be additional people

1639
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,253
who could become eligible for additional money

1640
01:14:13,253 --> 01:14:15,463
if these were challenged.

1641
01:14:15,463 --> 01:14:19,851
Yes, that would raise the cost even more.

1642
01:14:19,851 --> 01:14:24,321
To recruit people into the welfare system,

1643
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:26,071
we relaxed the rules.

1644
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,931
If a woman had to declare paternity

1645
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:33,456
in order to qualify for welfare, the ACLU sued

1646
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:37,829
and said this is a violation of our privacy rights.

1647
01:14:37,829 --> 01:14:40,346
They also said that the nuclear family,

1648
01:14:40,346 --> 01:14:45,013
Ozzie and Harriet, was Eurocentric and therefore racist.

1649
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:51,167
The women's movement concurred with that.

1650
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:54,250
The Black Power movement also agreed.

1651
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:59,807
Millions of blacks in a period of less than four years

1652
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:03,766
flooded into the welfare system in major cities.

1653
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,575
At a time when the unemployment rate

1654
01:15:05,575 --> 01:15:08,626
for blacks in New York for males

1655
01:15:08,626 --> 01:15:10,738
was less than 4%.

1656
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:13,942
If I could get me a job where I could be my own man.

1657
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,282
Don't make think that they feelin' sorry for me.

1658
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:18,106
Give me this, give me what I need,

1659
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:20,439
just like a pet, like a dog.

1660
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:24,192
You have to be fed now.

1661
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:25,270
Give him some food.

1662
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,071
<v Rob>What you then saw is a consequence

1663
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:29,767
of separating work from income.

1664
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:31,948
The out-of-wedlock births in the black community

1665
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:33,620
began to skyrocket.

1666
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:36,703
Went from under 25% to 70%.

1667
01:15:39,813 --> 01:15:42,738
It is a neutron bomb that was dropped on this country,

1668
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:46,595
and it really hurt families, especially the black family.

1669
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:49,176
During slavery, a black kid was more likely

1670
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:51,613
to be raised under a roof with his biological mother

1671
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,363
and biological father than today.

1672
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,311
The welfare state has done more to destroy

1673
01:15:58,311 --> 01:16:01,661
and destabilize the black family than even slavery did.

1674
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:03,692
<v Candace>We allowed them to remove the fathers

1675
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,189
from our homes.

1676
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:07,689
Removing the backbone of our families.

1677
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,460
I remember my dad used to be hard on us,

1678
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:12,775
making us fold clothes and washing dishes properly.

1679
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:14,887
And if we didn't, we got a whooping.

1680
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:17,264
If we didn't 'em right, or if we didn't do 'em

1681
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:18,322
when he told us to do 'em.

1682
01:16:18,322 --> 01:16:20,839
And I didn't like him when he did that to us.

1683
01:16:20,839 --> 01:16:23,621
My dad made me a responsible man by doing that.

1684
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,252
And it just really made me wonder

1685
01:16:26,252 --> 01:16:28,771
like what if he wasn't there?

1686
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:31,301
I'm very blessed to be who I am today,

1687
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,388
and a lot of that had to do with the upbringing

1688
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,766
I had from my father,

1689
01:16:34,766 --> 01:16:38,435
who was in the house, who made sure that we were in school,

1690
01:16:38,435 --> 01:16:39,771
who made sure that we were clothed,

1691
01:16:39,771 --> 01:16:41,507
that we had shelter, that we had food.

1692
01:16:41,507 --> 01:16:43,120
That was my father.

1693
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,881
When I was growing up, fathers led.

1694
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,611
And you knew not to be fighting and carrying 'em

1695
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:50,642
because you had respect for the elderly,

1696
01:16:50,642 --> 01:16:51,798
and you respect yourself

1697
01:16:51,798 --> 01:16:53,437
because you represented your parents

1698
01:16:53,437 --> 01:16:55,145
when you're out there.

1699
01:16:55,145 --> 01:16:57,355
But that representation is no longer there

1700
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:58,835
because the man is not there.

1701
01:16:58,835 --> 01:17:01,240
If you look at every major issue

1702
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,076
facing the black community today,

1703
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,719
it can be stemmed back to fatherlessness.

1704
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,097
You see black people joining gangs.

1705
01:17:06,097 --> 01:17:08,469
They're joining the gang to simulate a family unit.

1706
01:17:08,469 --> 01:17:10,599
Family unit can be solved with the father.

1707
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:12,685
Don't understand what it's like, how to treat a woman,

1708
01:17:12,685 --> 01:17:16,226
how to be respectful, how to earn a living the legal way.

1709
01:17:16,226 --> 01:17:18,095
They didn't have a father in their home

1710
01:17:18,095 --> 01:17:19,264
that taught them these things.

1711
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:20,938
And then that father didn't have a father in his home.

1712
01:17:20,938 --> 01:17:22,990
So, this generational fatherlessness

1713
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:25,836
is far more dangerous to the black community

1714
01:17:25,836 --> 01:17:28,938
than institutional or generational racism.

1715
01:17:28,938 --> 01:17:32,906
If there is a strong man in the household,

1716
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:36,059
people aren't eligible for these benefits.

1717
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:38,256
So, you see how it kinda starts and it just grows

1718
01:17:38,256 --> 01:17:39,089
and grows and grows.

1719
01:17:39,089 --> 01:17:41,992
With the political left, this whole idea

1720
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,851
that government can bring people out of poverty

1721
01:17:44,851 --> 01:17:47,240
and that government can fix all the problems,

1722
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,238
we know that government can't do that.

1723
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:51,889
That government can't raise a family.

1724
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:52,722
Who like man.

1725
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:53,653
(bleep) this job.

1726
01:17:53,653 --> 01:17:54,569
You can't have the pizza.

1727
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,644
I said, "(bleep) I want the money and your car."

1728
01:17:56,644 --> 01:17:58,823
<v Reporter>Dequandre Weaver was 14 years old

1729
01:17:58,823 --> 01:18:00,079
when this video was shot,

1730
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:01,535
and this week a judge sentenced him

1731
01:18:01,535 --> 01:18:06,416
to serve 20 years in prison for a list of felonies.

1732
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:10,166
Because the left has promoted the welfare state,

1733
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,398
has encouraged women to marry the government,

1734
01:18:12,398 --> 01:18:14,324
has allowed men to abandon their financial

1735
01:18:14,324 --> 01:18:17,176
and moral responsibility, we have these problems.

1736
01:18:17,176 --> 01:18:19,613
It is no wonder that you have the chaos.

1737
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:23,613
More blacks are killing other blacks in one year

1738
01:18:26,746 --> 01:18:29,496
than the Klan killed in 70 years.

1739
01:18:33,138 --> 01:18:35,805
(ominous music)

1740
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:39,778
(gunshots blaring)

1741
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:42,235
<v Man>We are on autopilot in the destruction

1742
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:44,937
of our own communities.

1743
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:47,655
Black on black crime is something that our media tells us

1744
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:49,878
that we're not allowed to talk about.

1745
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:53,128
Over 93% of black homicide victims

1746
01:18:54,284 --> 01:18:57,161
are killed by other black people.

1747
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,325
We are not supposed to be outraged,

1748
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:02,620
and we're not told to remember the names of those victims.

1749
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,417
Because if we begin to focus on that area,

1750
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:07,171
something that is causing real harm

1751
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:09,654
and devastation to our communities,

1752
01:19:09,654 --> 01:19:11,904
we might uncover the truth.

1753
01:19:14,877 --> 01:19:18,550
Our inner cities are all by Democrat design.

1754
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:22,254
Like Chicago, like Baltimore and like Detroit.

1755
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:26,158
They have been run by Democrats for decades.

1756
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:27,179
We have been made to believe

1757
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,750
that the conditions in our cities are normal.

1758
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,163
We're supposed to turn a blind eye

1759
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:33,897
to the corruption, to the crime, to the gangs, and instead,

1760
01:19:33,897 --> 01:19:37,091
focus on what our media deems of more importance.

1761
01:19:37,091 --> 01:19:38,604
We're instead told that we should be focusing

1762
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:39,975
on white people.

1763
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,530
We're supposed to be reactive and angry and fearful

1764
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,045
about white supremacy, when in fact,

1765
01:19:45,045 --> 01:19:50,045
it is liberal supremacy that is harming our communities.

1766
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:53,192
In the inner cities, who's killing who?

1767
01:19:53,192 --> 01:19:55,710
Back in slavery, they used to rip the families apart,

1768
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:56,849
take the father out of the home.

1769
01:19:56,849 --> 01:19:59,501
Now we removing ourselves from the home.

1770
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:02,341
These are things that I believe

1771
01:20:02,341 --> 01:20:03,513
have gotten us to the point

1772
01:20:03,513 --> 01:20:06,892
where we are on autopilot for the liberal movement.

1773
01:20:06,892 --> 01:20:09,235
(soft music)

1774
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:11,010
<v Larry>You begin to ask yourself,

1775
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:14,889
why is it that more black women are getting abortions

1776
01:20:14,889 --> 01:20:17,669
than any other ethnic group?

1777
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:19,459
And you begin to look at maps

1778
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:23,666
of where these Planned Parenthood clinics are situated.

1779
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:27,174
<v Jesse>77% of Planned Parenthood abortion pills

1780
01:20:27,174 --> 01:20:30,502
are located in the inner cities.

1781
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:33,220
<v Woman>Somehow, the script was flipped,

1782
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,343
and so it became a civil right to abort a child.

1783
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:39,300
It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision.

1784
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,303
It became a woman's reproductive right,

1785
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:45,577
but nobody really examined the motives behind it.

1786
01:20:45,577 --> 01:20:49,998
52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion.

1787
01:20:49,998 --> 01:20:52,248
1786 a day, and since 1973,

1788
01:20:55,361 --> 01:20:57,926
over 20 million African-Americans

1789
01:20:57,926 --> 01:21:00,319
have been killed by abortion alone.

1790
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:03,665
For more federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

1791
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:06,852
The Democratic party has always been focused

1792
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:11,519
on pushing eugenics and abortion on the black community.

1793
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:16,277
Margaret Sanger, the woman that ultimately founded

1794
01:21:16,277 --> 01:21:17,677
what became Planned Parenthood,

1795
01:21:17,677 --> 01:21:21,100
believed that certain people were degenerate,

1796
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,490
were unworthy of living.

1797
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,522
And if you're one of those persons,

1798
01:21:25,522 --> 01:21:27,391
perfectly okay for you to be eliminated.

1799
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:28,691
<v Man>Whether you're talking about

1800
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:31,243
Margaret Sanger strategies back then,

1801
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:33,458
or you're talking about Planned Parenthood's tactics

1802
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:37,033
of today, they're still able to Trojan Horse

1803
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:38,821
the black community.

1804
01:21:38,821 --> 01:21:41,108
That is to deliver this message

1805
01:21:41,108 --> 01:21:42,635
of, "We're for women's health.

1806
01:21:42,635 --> 01:21:44,380
"We're for the black community."

1807
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,279
More than 1/2 of Planned Parenthood's centers

1808
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:52,279
are located in areas without ready access to healthcare.

1809
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:55,097
Here you have the left wing embracing Planned Parenthood,

1810
01:21:55,097 --> 01:21:56,794
embracing the pro-choice movement,

1811
01:21:56,794 --> 01:21:59,068
completely oblivious to the fact that Margaret Sanger

1812
01:21:59,068 --> 01:22:02,042
was not particularly fond of poor, black people,

1813
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,908
who in her view could not make it on their own.

1814
01:22:03,908 --> 01:22:05,016
I think the greatest sin in the world

1815
01:22:05,016 --> 01:22:07,055
is bringing children into the world

1816
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:10,315
that have disease from their parents,

1817
01:22:10,315 --> 01:22:12,022
that have no chance in the world

1818
01:22:12,022 --> 01:22:13,901
to be a human being practically.

1819
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:16,788
Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things,

1820
01:22:16,788 --> 01:22:18,298
just marked when they're born.

1821
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:21,583
That to me is the greatest sin.

1822
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:25,726
I see black people argue that if a woman is poor,

1823
01:22:25,726 --> 01:22:28,159
she shouldn't have a child.

1824
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:31,512
If that were the case, a lot of black people that I know

1825
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:33,172
who have done great things in life

1826
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:35,011
would never have been born,

1827
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:36,257
and I would have been one of them.

1828
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:38,390
<v Man>The Billboard's idea that abortion is genocide

1829
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:41,739
has made a comeback in some parts of the black community.

1830
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:43,267
<v Candace>Our population growth has stagnated.

1831
01:22:43,267 --> 01:22:45,541
<v Man>Fueling this is the growing number of Latinos

1832
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,266
who have fewer abortions, more children...

1833
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:48,351
<v Candace>60% of all new births

1834
01:22:48,351 --> 01:22:49,642
in this country are Latino,

1835
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:52,076
and you have Democrats that are advocating for open borders.

1836
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:53,879
<v Man>Ethnic minority than black Americans.

1837
01:22:53,879 --> 01:22:55,068
<v Candace>Right now, the Democrat party

1838
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:57,442
relies upon our vote, but they don't have to forever.

1839
01:22:57,442 --> 01:23:01,109
(speaking foreign language)

1840
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:05,161
Black Americans are gonna wake up,

1841
01:23:05,161 --> 01:23:06,751
or we're going to become irrelevant.

1842
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:09,448
Black people in general are starting to get the sense

1843
01:23:09,448 --> 01:23:12,861
that we are being traded for illegal immigrants.

1844
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:14,828
<v Reporter>The caravan lurched forward

1845
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,828
carrying babies, suitcases and hope.

1846
01:23:18,674 --> 01:23:23,257
<v Candace>They're importing a whole new victim class.

1847
01:23:24,273 --> 01:23:27,356
It's gonna do exactly to the illegals

1848
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:32,197
what they did to black America in the '60s.

1849
01:23:32,197 --> 01:23:33,410
Get them addicted to government,

1850
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:35,333
give them the handouts, and turn them

1851
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,620
into a permanent class of victim voters.

1852
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:40,574
<v Man>They are willing to use

1853
01:23:40,574 --> 01:23:43,157
people's genuine disadvantages,

1854
01:23:44,466 --> 01:23:48,216
people's genuine struggles to get into power.

1855
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,113
And we are gonna fight for fairness

1856
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:53,276
and justice for immigration.

1857
01:23:53,276 --> 01:23:54,952
We're gonna fight for DACA,

1858
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:57,137
and we're going to help this country--

1859
01:23:57,137 --> 01:24:00,741
How is it that we have Maxine Waters and John Lewis

1860
01:24:00,741 --> 01:24:03,753
and others in the Black Congressional Caucus

1861
01:24:03,753 --> 01:24:05,920
who are fighting for DACA?

1862
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:09,962
For the dreamers

1863
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:14,220
of illegal aliens who have come to our nation,

1864
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,154
and they're not fighting for black children

1865
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:23,092
and the dreams that our kids and our teenagers have.

1866
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:27,170
They've set them aside and made DACA their priority.

1867
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,549
I submit to you they're in pursuit of an agenda.

1868
01:24:30,549 --> 01:24:33,932
The black community has been destroyed

1869
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:38,243
by racist, illegal immigration and we're not gonna have it.

1870
01:24:38,243 --> 01:24:41,186
When my people do a crime, we get three strikes.

1871
01:24:41,186 --> 01:24:43,230
Your people do a crime, they get amnesty,

1872
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:44,778
they get benefits, and they're not...

1873
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:47,023
Blacks are protesting the fact

1874
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,199
that for the last 50 years,

1875
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:52,914
they're living in cities that are the most dangerous,

1876
01:24:52,914 --> 01:24:55,258
disinvested places, and they've been run

1877
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:57,660
by liberal black Democrats.

1878
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:01,986
But they've got no alternative to express that discontent.

1879
01:25:01,986 --> 01:25:04,246
The black community is low-hanging fruit

1880
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:06,210
for the Republican party.

1881
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:09,299
And the fact that they're not making a more concerted effort

1882
01:25:09,299 --> 01:25:12,632
to message to our community aggressively

1883
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:14,974
is a huge mistake.

1884
01:25:14,974 --> 01:25:16,012
First, they have to be serious

1885
01:25:16,012 --> 01:25:19,915
about whether or not they want minorities in the party.

1886
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,918
And if they are, then they need to totally rethink

1887
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,318
how they're goin' about it.

1888
01:25:24,318 --> 01:25:26,735
(soft music)

1889
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:33,796
My experiences running as a mayoral candidate

1890
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:37,129
in a city that's predominantly Democrat,

1891
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:41,943
I've been criticized by Republican strategists

1892
01:25:41,943 --> 01:25:45,693
for spending my time in minority communities.

1893
01:25:49,513 --> 01:25:52,324
I've placed my campaign office

1894
01:25:52,324 --> 01:25:55,349
in a historically black community.

1895
01:25:55,349 --> 01:25:57,099
I did that by choice.

1896
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:01,578
I have not found the kind of support

1897
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:04,328
that I expected from Republicans.

1898
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:08,888
I think that if you look at the Republican party,

1899
01:26:08,888 --> 01:26:11,034
I believe that if I were white

1900
01:26:11,034 --> 01:26:14,732
that I would notice that there were so few people of color,

1901
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:17,395
racial and ethnic minorities in my party,

1902
01:26:17,395 --> 01:26:20,727
and I would support the ones that were sincere.

1903
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:22,171
I love America.

1904
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:23,607
I believe the American dream,

1905
01:26:23,607 --> 01:26:26,240
and I wanna give hope to people who are disadvantaged,

1906
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,095
not just black people, but also white people

1907
01:26:29,095 --> 01:26:31,603
who come from unfortunate circumstances.

1908
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:35,211
When I've gone to campaign and elections meetings,

1909
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:36,902
I hear these strategists say,

1910
01:26:36,902 --> 01:26:40,034
"Don't waste your time in minority communities.

1911
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:42,133
"You need to hunt where the ducks are."

1912
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:43,805
For years, the Democratic party

1913
01:26:43,805 --> 01:26:47,010
has assumed they're going to get 90-95% of the black vote,

1914
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:49,188
as did the Republican party.

1915
01:26:49,188 --> 01:26:50,274
They didn't even try.

1916
01:26:50,274 --> 01:26:51,315
Republicans have convinced themselves

1917
01:26:51,315 --> 01:26:53,708
that blacks are unalterably Democrats,

1918
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:54,843
there's nothing we can do about it.

1919
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:57,058
Let's husband our money and our energy

1920
01:26:57,058 --> 01:26:59,051
and just spend it where we think we can get votes.

1921
01:26:59,051 --> 01:27:01,184
The Republican party ignores us

1922
01:27:01,184 --> 01:27:05,032
because they believe a narrative that has been pushed

1923
01:27:05,032 --> 01:27:06,321
out into the public square

1924
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:09,571
that the black community is a monolith.

1925
01:27:11,014 --> 01:27:13,096
And so we're being ignored on both sides.

1926
01:27:13,096 --> 01:27:14,807
<v Announcer>The major conservative in the race,

1927
01:27:14,807 --> 01:27:17,467
Carol Swain, was the last to concede tonight.

1928
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:20,154
<v Jesse>We're not making the kind of investments

1929
01:27:20,154 --> 01:27:22,071
in our minority allies.

1930
01:27:23,943 --> 01:27:25,991
That's the fault of the Republican party,

1931
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,345
is that they have just completely said,

1932
01:27:28,345 --> 01:27:29,713
"We can't connect with 'em."

1933
01:27:29,713 --> 01:27:31,061
And they gave up.

1934
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:34,880
We have more in common with the Republican party by far

1935
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,151
than anything Democrat.

1936
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:39,592
Regardless of where your position is socioeconomically.

1937
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:41,591
'cause the Democrats, they're not giving jobs,

1938
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:42,880
they don't care about jobs.

1939
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,534
So they don't want you to succeed.

1940
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:46,370
They don't want you to own anything.

1941
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,769
That's why they keep spoonfeeding you,

1942
01:27:47,769 --> 01:27:50,368
putting you in projects and then giving you a little,

1943
01:27:50,368 --> 01:27:51,571
so now you're dependent.

1944
01:27:51,571 --> 01:27:54,126
Being unapologetically capitalist

1945
01:27:54,126 --> 01:27:56,300
is sort of the way to move forward.

1946
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,570
I wanna be rich.

1947
01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:58,756
I don't wanna be poor.

1948
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,219
You wanna be wealthy and successful.

1949
01:28:00,219 --> 01:28:03,500
Well, we're the party that promotes values

1950
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,820
and policies that will make you wealthy and successful.

1951
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:11,176
Conservatives are really bad at marketing good ideas.

1952
01:28:11,176 --> 01:28:12,849
They're horrible.

1953
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:15,612
Republicans have been their own worst messengers.

1954
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:17,300
The problem with conservatives

1955
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,321
and what we don't do good enough,

1956
01:28:19,321 --> 01:28:22,518
is that we don't infiltrate ourselves into the culture.

1957
01:28:22,518 --> 01:28:24,714
<v Candace>For too long, we've left the left run culture.

1958
01:28:24,714 --> 01:28:26,013
Saturday Night Live.

1959
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:29,080
We're gonna make fun and people can understand humor.

1960
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,196
You're not going to be able to sell your ideas,

1961
01:28:31,196 --> 01:28:33,697
and your theories and your thoughts to the people,

1962
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:35,259
if you're doing things in the same way

1963
01:28:35,259 --> 01:28:39,340
that you have done them for the last, 20-30 years.

1964
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:42,896
Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running

1965
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:45,595
(crowd cheering)

1966
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:49,300
for President of the United States,

1967
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:53,513
and we are going to make our country great again.

1968
01:28:53,513 --> 01:28:58,513
Donald Trump is the first Republican that is unafraid.

1969
01:28:58,956 --> 01:28:59,990
He's unafraid of the media.

1970
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,744
You know it, if you're honest reporters,

1971
01:29:01,744 --> 01:29:03,242
which in many cases you're not.

1972
01:29:03,242 --> 01:29:04,587
<v Man>The progressive socialist left

1973
01:29:04,587 --> 01:29:06,051
and all their tactics, all their antics.

1974
01:29:06,051 --> 01:29:08,472
It's the next step in our investigation.

1975
01:29:08,472 --> 01:29:09,625
They don't know what to do with him.

1976
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:11,043
If you look at his policies

1977
01:29:11,043 --> 01:29:15,370
and how they benefited and continue to benefit this country,

1978
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:18,663
there's no denying the objective facts.

1979
01:29:18,663 --> 01:29:22,046
But if you look at the man, Donald Trump,

1980
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:24,927
the version of him as it is painted by the media,

1981
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:28,156
then it's easy to hate the man, hate his guts.

1982
01:29:28,156 --> 01:29:30,713
Painting a picture of him that he is incompetent,

1983
01:29:30,713 --> 01:29:33,731
not capable, out of control, impetuous,

1984
01:29:33,731 --> 01:29:37,117
all those things is what we get out of the media.

1985
01:29:37,117 --> 01:29:40,057
But somehow, through the charisma of his personality

1986
01:29:40,057 --> 01:29:42,966
and a force of his personality has gotten through

1987
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:44,204
to some in our community.

1988
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:46,687
I see Trump as this window of opportunity

1989
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:48,005
for black America to wake up,

1990
01:29:48,005 --> 01:29:49,871
is because I think he's the most cultural president

1991
01:29:49,871 --> 01:29:51,121
we've ever had.

1992
01:29:52,161 --> 01:29:53,949
<v Man>He was taking photos with rappers.

1993
01:29:53,949 --> 01:29:56,048
He was always part of the culture.

1994
01:29:56,048 --> 01:29:57,948
You got this guy that talks shit,

1995
01:29:57,948 --> 01:30:00,906
at WrestleMania, he was doing this, he was doing that

1996
01:30:00,906 --> 01:30:01,963
and he's president?

1997
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,458
He made politics cool again.

1998
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:07,128
Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

1999
01:30:07,128 --> 01:30:08,611
Because you'd be in jail.

2000
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:09,959
You can see the realness.

2001
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:11,161
He's a New Yorker, man.

2002
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,186
And he talks like one.

2003
01:30:12,186 --> 01:30:14,414
He has the bravado like one.

2004
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:16,198
Jeb wants to be a tough guy.

2005
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:17,726
He wants to be a tough guy tonight.

2006
01:30:17,726 --> 01:30:19,091
I didn't take the property.

2007
01:30:19,091 --> 01:30:20,716
<v Man>A lot of young, black people,

2008
01:30:20,716 --> 01:30:22,718
that's why they're drawn to him.

2009
01:30:22,718 --> 01:30:24,277
If people spoke to black people

2010
01:30:24,277 --> 01:30:29,277
the way Donald Trump does, bluntly, without condescension.

2011
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:34,473
Look how much African-American communities have suffered

2012
01:30:34,473 --> 01:30:36,556
under Democratic control.

2013
01:30:37,413 --> 01:30:39,913
To those, I say the following,

2014
01:30:41,526 --> 01:30:43,609
what do you have to lose?

2015
01:30:44,615 --> 01:30:47,051
Donald Trump is facing a new backlash.

2016
01:30:47,051 --> 01:30:49,975
Is "What the hell do you have to lose" the best pitch?

2017
01:30:49,975 --> 01:30:52,026
Trump's latest attempted outreach

2018
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:55,290
to a larger voting block is already being called ignorant.

2019
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,809
So disrespectful and so condescending.

2020
01:30:57,809 --> 01:31:01,434
How condescending, how offensive, how racist, whatever.

2021
01:31:01,434 --> 01:31:02,267
But he was right.

2022
01:31:02,267 --> 01:31:03,175
What do you have to lose?

2023
01:31:03,175 --> 01:31:06,375
You're living in poverty, your schools are no good,

2024
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,555
you have no jobs.

2025
01:31:08,555 --> 01:31:11,760
58% of your youth is unemployed.

2026
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,554
The audacity to stare black America in the face

2027
01:31:14,554 --> 01:31:17,157
and say, "Hello, wake up, you're already losing.

2028
01:31:17,157 --> 01:31:18,002
"Look at your communities.

2029
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:19,627
"Everything's run down, what's the big deal?

2030
01:31:19,627 --> 01:31:20,922
"Take a chance on Trump."

2031
01:31:20,922 --> 01:31:23,491
People, black and white and brown

2032
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,801
who did not go to college

2033
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:30,367
have felt ignored by the elites of both parties.

2034
01:31:30,367 --> 01:31:34,224
And Trump turned over the tables in the temple.

2035
01:31:34,224 --> 01:31:36,768
You can say he's an artful, he's not articulate,

2036
01:31:36,768 --> 01:31:38,265
he's not smooth, whatever.

2037
01:31:38,265 --> 01:31:40,113
People really don't care.

2038
01:31:40,113 --> 01:31:41,627
People are tired of politicians

2039
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:43,577
that say one thing and do something else.

2040
01:31:43,577 --> 01:31:46,944
Especially, we're starting to see in the black community.

2041
01:31:46,944 --> 01:31:47,985
They wanna see some change,

2042
01:31:47,985 --> 01:31:49,350
they wanna see something different.

2043
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:51,918
And that's why blacks feeling as if they're conservatives

2044
01:31:51,918 --> 01:31:53,477
is on the rise.

2045
01:31:53,477 --> 01:31:54,662
They're looking at the results.

2046
01:31:54,662 --> 01:31:57,412
(crowd cheering)

2047
01:31:59,526 --> 01:32:02,107
You think you can bully people to stop doing something.

2048
01:32:02,107 --> 01:32:04,753
Callin' us coons, all them types of names.

2049
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,352
Usually, people run to their little cubby hills after that.

2050
01:32:07,352 --> 01:32:09,511
It's a new movement now and we want all the smoke.

2051
01:32:09,511 --> 01:32:10,778
It's really clear.

2052
01:32:10,778 --> 01:32:11,821
People tell me not to wear the MAGA hat,

2053
01:32:11,821 --> 01:32:13,868
so I bought the biggest MAGA hat.

2054
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:16,000
Then I bought a bigger one.

2055
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,759
So now if somebody say something to me,

2056
01:32:17,759 --> 01:32:19,462
duh, common sense, a bigger one.

2057
01:32:19,462 --> 01:32:21,676
It's simple math really when you put it all together.

2058
01:32:21,676 --> 01:32:23,432
♪ Yeah, I'm black I'm not Democrat ♪

2059
01:32:23,432 --> 01:32:24,551
♪ With the MAGA hat ♪

2060
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:27,572
♪ Ooh we they try to take my guns I can't go like that ♪

2061
01:32:27,572 --> 01:32:30,354
♪ Ooh we they try to take our funds I can't go like that ♪

2062
01:32:30,354 --> 01:32:33,328
♪ Ooh we they tried to bend our speeds I can't go like that ♪

2063
01:32:33,328 --> 01:32:35,201
♪ Yeah, I'm black, I'm not Democrat ♪

2064
01:32:35,201 --> 01:32:36,643
♪ With the MAGA hat ♪

2065
01:32:36,643 --> 01:32:39,114
It was Donald Trump who woke me up, man.

2066
01:32:39,114 --> 01:32:43,082
At first, when he was nominated and he was elected,

2067
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:46,819
I was not a big fan, but to see the things he's done

2068
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:48,197
for the black community, see the things he's done

2069
01:32:48,197 --> 01:32:49,771
for America in particular.

2070
01:32:49,771 --> 01:32:51,822
I'm a huge fan now and he has my support.

2071
01:32:51,822 --> 01:32:52,863
We are in historical times,

2072
01:32:52,863 --> 01:32:54,518
'cause people are waking up, people are changing.

2073
01:32:54,518 --> 01:32:55,760
Humans are naturally conservative.

2074
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,371
You grow up being told to work hard for what you eat.

2075
01:32:57,371 --> 01:33:00,165
You don't grow up being told you gon' get somethin'

2076
01:33:00,165 --> 01:33:02,015
because you just want it.

2077
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:03,728
You see, like you ain't gotta work for it.

2078
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:05,529
When I went to the store,

2079
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:07,444
and I try to get a Snickers and I had no money for it,

2080
01:33:07,444 --> 01:33:09,966
momma slapped my hand, "Put that Snickers back.

2081
01:33:09,966 --> 01:33:11,546
"We can't afford that."

2082
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:12,452
But Democrats, they're saying,

2083
01:33:12,452 --> 01:33:14,243
"Hey, we give you everything for free."

2084
01:33:14,243 --> 01:33:15,076
That ain't reality.

2085
01:33:15,076 --> 01:33:17,139
Black America is starting to get it.

2086
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,886
And that's why there is this sort of battle

2087
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,644
that's happening I think right now.

2088
01:33:21,644 --> 01:33:25,058
Black America is in the midst of an ideological civil war.

2089
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:26,453
Oh, it's bullshit!

2090
01:33:26,453 --> 01:33:28,322
It's racism, it's Trump.

2091
01:33:28,322 --> 01:33:30,092
Get off your feet, fuck this.

2092
01:33:30,092 --> 01:33:32,121
We gotta stand up, we gotta do our shit.

2093
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:33,281
We gotta do what we gotta do as black people.

2094
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:34,772
Round of applause for Candace, please.

2095
01:33:34,772 --> 01:33:36,626
That's a waste of time.

2096
01:33:36,626 --> 01:33:38,836
(somber music)

2097
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:40,414
You guys, this is so beautiful.

2098
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:41,502
Look at all of us.

2099
01:33:41,502 --> 01:33:43,905
We made it all the way to the White House.

2100
01:33:43,905 --> 01:33:46,021
This week, in two days, I'm going to the White House

2101
01:33:46,021 --> 01:33:48,815
with 400 black kids, and it's basically saying,

2102
01:33:48,815 --> 01:33:52,135
you don't get to take away my blackness

2103
01:33:52,135 --> 01:33:55,605
because I don't agree with you, because I'm educated.

2104
01:33:55,605 --> 01:33:57,636
Before, it was just a monolith.

2105
01:33:57,636 --> 01:34:00,315
And there was no thought, it was just nodding like zombies.

2106
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:04,514
Like of course, we have to support Barack Obama.

2107
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:06,122
<v Larry>The one reason that I thought

2108
01:34:06,122 --> 01:34:08,392
that his candidacy would be positive.

2109
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:12,568
The one reason, was because when Senator Obama

2110
01:34:12,568 --> 01:34:14,650
was interviewed by Steve Croft,

2111
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:17,593
I believe that was his first 60 Minutes interview,

2112
01:34:17,593 --> 01:34:18,969
and Steve Croft said to Obama.

2113
01:34:18,969 --> 01:34:20,683
You think the country's ready for a black president?

2114
01:34:20,683 --> 01:34:22,287
Yes!

2115
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:23,836
You don't think it's gonna hold you back.

2116
01:34:23,836 --> 01:34:24,669
No.

2117
01:34:25,723 --> 01:34:28,556
I think, if I don't win this race,

2118
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:33,557
it would be because of other factors.

2119
01:34:33,557 --> 01:34:36,724
It's gonna be because I have not shown

2120
01:34:38,057 --> 01:34:39,649
to the American people a vision

2121
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:43,033
for where the country needs to go that they can embrace.

2122
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:44,710
<v Larry>I said to myself, hallelujah!

2123
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:49,160
At least this is not your basic black victocrat.

2124
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,803
Well, he got elected.

2125
01:34:50,803 --> 01:34:52,711
<v Man>I cried, tears came to my eyes

2126
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:53,900
during his inauguration.

2127
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,816
My fellow citizens.

2128
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:57,101
A black man being a president?

2129
01:34:57,101 --> 01:35:00,206
Like, this is finally, we have proven to the world

2130
01:35:00,206 --> 01:35:01,264
and everybody else in the country

2131
01:35:01,264 --> 01:35:02,697
that this is not a racist country.

2132
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,596
And I think that's what America really felt,

2133
01:35:04,596 --> 01:35:05,826
that we had turned a corner.

2134
01:35:05,826 --> 01:35:08,234
I could follow in the same steps now finally.

2135
01:35:08,234 --> 01:35:10,399
That there was no barrier that was preventing me

2136
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:12,332
as a black American from doing anything.

2137
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:14,410
Many people had high expectations

2138
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:17,465
that he was going to take us in a direction

2139
01:35:17,465 --> 01:35:19,825
that was gonna improve things.

2140
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:21,288
Obama, before he became president,

2141
01:35:21,288 --> 01:35:23,545
gave a speech at a black church in Atlanta.

2142
01:35:23,545 --> 01:35:25,303
And he said, the Moses generation,

2143
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,368
referring to the generation of Martin Luther King,

2144
01:35:27,368 --> 01:35:31,119
has gotten us 90% of the way there,

2145
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,732
which I though was pretty reasonable.

2146
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:35,347
He said, "My generation, the Joshua generation

2147
01:35:35,347 --> 01:35:37,324
"has to get us that remaining 10%."

2148
01:35:37,324 --> 01:35:40,661
The Moses generation pointed the way.

2149
01:35:40,661 --> 01:35:42,497
They took us 90% of the way there,

2150
01:35:42,497 --> 01:35:44,904
but we still got that 10%.

2151
01:35:44,904 --> 01:35:47,067
That was before Obama became president.

2152
01:35:47,067 --> 01:35:49,550
I'm suspecting that now that he's president,

2153
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:52,703
that that 10% probably got shaved into just a little bit.

2154
01:35:52,703 --> 01:35:54,971
Yet when he was president, what did he say, what did do?

2155
01:35:54,971 --> 01:35:58,861
<v Obama>Slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination

2156
01:35:58,861 --> 01:36:02,278
in almost every institution of our lives,

2157
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:06,093
that cast a long shadow.

2158
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:09,310
And that's still part of our DNA.

2159
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:10,727
That's passed on.

2160
01:36:11,606 --> 01:36:12,792
We're not cured of it.

2161
01:36:12,792 --> 01:36:14,336
Racism?
Racism.

2162
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,620
We are not cured of it.

2163
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,391
Obama got a higher percentage of the white vote

2164
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,098
than John Kerry did, and here he is

2165
01:36:19,098 --> 01:36:21,075
talking about racism is in our DNA?

2166
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,238
<v Both>If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.

2167
01:36:23,238 --> 01:36:24,330
The Cambridge Police...

2168
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:26,019
<v Larry>The Cambridge Police acted stupidly.

2169
01:36:26,019 --> 01:36:27,824
Acted stupidly.

2170
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:32,437
What he really did was add to the level of racial tension

2171
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:34,455
that we have in America today.

2172
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,300
He went out of his way to capitalize

2173
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,395
on this sort of like, wokeness.

2174
01:36:39,395 --> 01:36:42,583
There are very few African-American men in this country,

2175
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:45,490
who haven't had the experience of being followed

2176
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:48,172
when they were shopping in a department store.

2177
01:36:48,172 --> 01:36:49,038
That includes me.

2178
01:36:49,038 --> 01:36:52,887
He had Al Sharpton in his White House over 70 times.

2179
01:36:52,887 --> 01:36:55,517
And every time you criticize President Obama

2180
01:36:55,517 --> 01:36:58,723
based upon policy, you were called what?

2181
01:36:58,723 --> 01:36:59,649
A racist.

2182
01:36:59,649 --> 01:37:02,054
He played the race card, Obama did.

2183
01:37:02,054 --> 01:37:04,752
This is a guy who knew better and could've,

2184
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:07,176
in my opinion done a great deal to advance

2185
01:37:07,176 --> 01:37:08,541
racial issue in this country.

2186
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:10,930
We didn't turn any corner.

2187
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:13,627
And so now, we are just at a point

2188
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,270
where we're at each other's throats.

2189
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,443
You called me a nigger.

2190
01:37:16,443 --> 01:37:17,686
I didn't call you no nigger.
Yes, you did.

2191
01:37:17,686 --> 01:37:18,519
No, I didn't.

2192
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:19,832
He made things worse for America

2193
01:37:19,832 --> 01:37:21,897
in terms of race, and there's not a single person

2194
01:37:21,897 --> 01:37:24,691
that can say they remember America feeling like this.

2195
01:37:24,691 --> 01:37:26,121
Constitution.
I said you a house nigger.

2196
01:37:26,121 --> 01:37:27,132
I didn't call you a nigger.

2197
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:27,965
Oh, okay.

2198
01:37:27,965 --> 01:37:29,009
That's a big difference.

2199
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:31,309
You a Uncle Tom.
Yeah, I'm a Uncle Tom?

2200
01:37:31,309 --> 01:37:33,505
(clamoring)

2201
01:37:33,505 --> 01:37:37,307
Before Obama, wasn't all this racist talk at all.

2202
01:37:37,307 --> 01:37:38,506
I don't remember it.

2203
01:37:38,506 --> 01:37:40,187
<v Candace>I don't remember at any point

2204
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:43,353
before Barack Obama ever feeling this much racial strife

2205
01:37:43,353 --> 01:37:44,535
in this country.

2206
01:37:44,535 --> 01:37:47,729
<v Man>Obama was the most divisive president of our time.

2207
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:49,685
Especially in the African-American community,

2208
01:37:49,685 --> 01:37:52,173
I will consider it a personal insult,

2209
01:37:52,173 --> 01:37:56,704
an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard

2210
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,659
and fails to activate itself in this election.

2211
01:37:58,659 --> 01:38:01,630
I believe Obama is one of the most articulate presidents

2212
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:04,296
that we've had, charismatic presidents that we've had.

2213
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:06,181
When you look at his educational background,

2214
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:09,135
he's probably one of the most intelligent.

2215
01:38:09,135 --> 01:38:10,468
He knows better.

2216
01:38:11,759 --> 01:38:14,178
I harbor a lot of resentment towards Barack Obama,

2217
01:38:14,178 --> 01:38:16,875
because now I see what he was.

2218
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,413
But I wouldn't take that moment back,

2219
01:38:19,413 --> 01:38:20,433
for a lot of reasons.

2220
01:38:20,433 --> 01:38:23,650
And one of those reasons is that it did me a lot.

2221
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:26,257
Now it's something that I point to to show people.

2222
01:38:26,257 --> 01:38:28,839
If America is a racist country,

2223
01:38:28,839 --> 01:38:31,556
how did Barack Obama get into office for two terms?

2224
01:38:31,556 --> 01:38:34,594
In barely half a century,

2225
01:38:34,594 --> 01:38:38,101
you can go from a young African-American girl

2226
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:41,548
being escorted into the school by the National Guard,

2227
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:45,240
to having the first person of color occupy the Oval Office.

2228
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,840
(somber music)

2229
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,092
<v Man>That's why all those people were in tears

2230
01:38:50,092 --> 01:38:53,326
when Obama was elected president.

2231
01:38:53,326 --> 01:38:54,692
Look at what we are.

2232
01:38:54,692 --> 01:38:56,774
This is America.

2233
01:38:56,774 --> 01:38:59,357
If there is anyone out there,

2234
01:39:00,448 --> 01:39:03,614
who still doubts that America is a place

2235
01:39:03,614 --> 01:39:06,114
where all things are possible,

2236
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:10,846
who still wonders if the dream of our founders

2237
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:14,263
is alive in our time, who still questions

2238
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:19,700
the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

2239
01:39:20,606 --> 01:39:23,356
(crowd cheering)

2240
01:39:26,766 --> 01:39:29,642
It's the answer told by lines that stretched

2241
01:39:29,642 --> 01:39:32,326
around schools and churches,

2242
01:39:32,326 --> 01:39:35,493
in numbers this nation has never seen.

2243
01:39:36,564 --> 01:39:37,622
I didn't grow up thinking,

2244
01:39:37,622 --> 01:39:39,375
one day I wanna own my own business,

2245
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:41,375
I wanna do my own thing.

2246
01:39:45,294 --> 01:39:47,074
It seemed like something that surely I could never achieve.

2247
01:39:47,074 --> 01:39:49,399
That's something that you have to be really smart.

2248
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:50,841
You have to come from money.

2249
01:39:50,841 --> 01:39:53,657
You have to have a huge set of capital

2250
01:39:53,657 --> 01:39:56,858
before you can even start a business.

2251
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:58,561
That's something that's too lofty for me.

2252
01:39:58,561 --> 01:40:00,498
I would never accomplish that.

2253
01:40:00,498 --> 01:40:03,248
So, I didn't even think about it.

2254
01:40:05,033 --> 01:40:07,799
If you have some material and stuff that you're needing,

2255
01:40:07,799 --> 01:40:08,804
I would like to get it to a place

2256
01:40:08,804 --> 01:40:11,404
where you can call him and if we have it in the shop

2257
01:40:11,404 --> 01:40:13,044
he can run it to you.

2258
01:40:13,044 --> 01:40:16,427
Early in my 20s when I began to go into a transition,

2259
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:20,010
if you will, of learning more about policy,

2260
01:40:21,437 --> 01:40:23,195
of learning more about the platforms

2261
01:40:23,195 --> 01:40:25,469
and how they're so different from one another,

2262
01:40:25,469 --> 01:40:27,096
I realized, well, no, there's something

2263
01:40:27,096 --> 01:40:29,114
that is well within my grasp.

2264
01:40:29,114 --> 01:40:32,557
This is something that is attainable.

2265
01:40:32,557 --> 01:40:34,217
Being a business owner in America

2266
01:40:34,217 --> 01:40:39,027
is one of the greatest privileges of being in America.

2267
01:40:39,027 --> 01:40:40,357
I love being in this country,

2268
01:40:40,357 --> 01:40:42,926
where you can start anything, you can be anything,

2269
01:40:42,926 --> 01:40:44,961
you can do anything.

2270
01:40:44,961 --> 01:40:49,211
And it's not possible everywhere to do it that way.

2271
01:40:50,487 --> 01:40:53,737
Oftentimes I get crazy messages from people

2272
01:40:53,737 --> 01:40:58,379
who, they can't believe I do this or whatever.

2273
01:40:58,379 --> 01:41:00,986
But you don't know until you do it yourself.

2274
01:41:00,986 --> 01:41:02,787
You don't really get it and understand it

2275
01:41:02,787 --> 01:41:05,620
until you start doing it yourself.

2276
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:07,408
Designers.

2277
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:09,159
They're still thinking that it's a four-inch supply

2278
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,055
coming into the building...

2279
01:41:10,055 --> 01:41:12,654
In my heart of hearts, I do desire

2280
01:41:12,654 --> 01:41:14,702
that people will kind of have

2281
01:41:14,702 --> 01:41:16,944
the same kind of revelations that I've had,

2282
01:41:16,944 --> 01:41:20,373
because to me, what it means to be a conservative

2283
01:41:20,373 --> 01:41:24,750
is to realize that a lot of the dignity that you have

2284
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,953
is within yourself.

2285
01:41:25,953 --> 01:41:29,649
Conservatism is the political philosophy

2286
01:41:29,649 --> 01:41:32,870
that is pro-business, that is pro-growth,

2287
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:34,588
that is pro-minority,

2288
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:38,101
way more than any kind of liberal idea

2289
01:41:38,101 --> 01:41:40,247
or policy can ever be.

2290
01:41:40,247 --> 01:41:42,803
I want for people to understand that.

2291
01:41:42,803 --> 01:41:44,377
I want for people to realize that.

2292
01:41:44,377 --> 01:41:48,132
These are the sinks that you fixed last time?

2293
01:41:48,132 --> 01:41:50,180
It starts with the individual.

2294
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:54,161
What you do in making yourself a better person

2295
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:57,510
will matriculate down to everybody else in the community,

2296
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:59,686
all the generations that come after you.

2297
01:41:59,686 --> 01:42:02,029
The power is in your hands.

2298
01:42:02,029 --> 01:42:04,757
Don't rely and wait for everybody else to do something.

2299
01:42:04,757 --> 01:42:07,262
You have the power to change you.

2300
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:09,180
You have authority to change you.

2301
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:11,799
I will not pretend to be a victim in this country.

2302
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:13,015
I know that that makes many people

2303
01:42:13,015 --> 01:42:14,561
on the left uncomfortable.

2304
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:16,416
I know people might not like me

2305
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:17,616
'cause they're from an era

2306
01:42:17,616 --> 01:42:18,918
where race hustling is a business.

2307
01:42:18,918 --> 01:42:21,449
But I say to people, "I'm not here to be your friend.

2308
01:42:21,449 --> 01:42:23,549
"I'm not here to become the most well liked

2309
01:42:23,549 --> 01:42:25,174
"black person in America.

2310
01:42:25,174 --> 01:42:27,057
"I am here to be like an alarm clock.

2311
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:28,524
"Your alarm clock goes off in the morning

2312
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:29,687
"and you're pretty pissed at it,

2313
01:42:29,687 --> 01:42:32,584
"but eventually you get up and you do what you have to do."

2314
01:42:32,584 --> 01:42:34,499
Many of the black kids who grew up in this country,

2315
01:42:34,499 --> 01:42:36,923
they see mom and dad voting for Democrats.

2316
01:42:36,923 --> 01:42:38,433
They don't question it.

2317
01:42:38,433 --> 01:42:40,107
They just go and do it.

2318
01:42:40,107 --> 01:42:43,357
But many of them have so much potential

2319
01:42:44,334 --> 01:42:46,916
and so much worth that they can really do

2320
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:50,397
anything they wanted with their lives.

2321
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:54,233
So much creativity and so much vision.

2322
01:42:54,233 --> 01:42:57,113
What's sad is that many of them are being lied to,

2323
01:42:57,113 --> 01:42:58,802
and they're being put in situations

2324
01:42:58,802 --> 01:43:01,175
where these limits are being put on them

2325
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:04,406
by their selves, by their family,

2326
01:43:04,406 --> 01:43:07,675
by their schools, by the government,

2327
01:43:07,675 --> 01:43:10,925
to where their minds are ever dependent

2328
01:43:11,771 --> 01:43:15,604
on Democrat politicians, on Democrat policies.

2329
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,733
When in reality, you're bigger than a program,

2330
01:43:19,733 --> 01:43:21,119
you're better than a program.

2331
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,954
You're capable of providing for yourself

2332
01:43:22,954 --> 01:43:25,066
so much more than any government program

2333
01:43:25,066 --> 01:43:27,473
can provide for you.

2334
01:43:27,473 --> 01:43:31,662
My fear is that with black people in America,

2335
01:43:31,662 --> 01:43:34,236
many of us haven't came to that realization,

2336
01:43:34,236 --> 01:43:35,766
and I want for us to.

2337
01:43:35,766 --> 01:43:38,461
Because we can do so much better as a community

2338
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:41,211
when we come to that realization.

2339
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:08,617
Alrighty.

2340
01:44:09,944 --> 01:44:11,111
That'll do it.

2341
01:44:13,022 --> 01:44:15,772
(dramatic music)
