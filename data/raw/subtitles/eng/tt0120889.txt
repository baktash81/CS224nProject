1
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:44,624
When I was young

2
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:47,624
I met this beautiful girl by a lake.

3
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:57,544
Scusi! Scusi! Scusi!

4
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:03,224
Dov'è la Svizzera? Ah,

5
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:04,684
No capice.

6
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:05,594
No Capice?

7
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:09,014
Uhm, où est la Suisse?

8
00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:09,524
S-Switzerland?

9
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:11,624
Oh, Suisse, yeah. Yeah. You got it. Switzerland. La-bas.

10
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,524
Hi. Oh, you're American?

11
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:17,624
So are you! Yeah.

12
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:24,624
Keep going that way till you smell money or till you step in chocolate.

13
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,624
Okay. Thank you.

14
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:34,624
Ho, watch your head.

15
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:37,524
You okay? I'm fine.

16
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,524
Can I sit here?

17
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:07,724
Actually, no.

18
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:11,724
Two years ago, I reserved this specific area.

19
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:16,524
What if I say please? That's the one exception.

20
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:35,224
Oh…Careful there.

21
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,624
You find Switzerland?

22
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:50,724
Ahm…I did.

23
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:55,524
And claimed it for Missouri. Planted my little flag…

24
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:56,724
and sold beads to the natives.

25
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,624
They had sandwiches there.

26
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:02,724
I brought you some.

27
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,624
I'm Ann.

28
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,824
Collins. 
h, sure, the lady who discovered Switzerland.

29
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,824
In all the papers.

30
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:21,824
I'm Chris Nielsen.

31
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,824
How did you know I'd be here?

32
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,624
Ahm…I didn't.

33
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:07,824
Come here, trader.

34
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,824
Oh no, not in the back!!

35
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:40,824
Aah! Let's make it. Oh.

36
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,824
I tell you, mom.

37
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,624
You've gotta eat something. 
o, I don't. I can get something at school.

38
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,924
Yeah, and I know what you'll get! 
h, Mom, I got a carb up,

39
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:00,924
I got a game. And a math test.

40
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,924
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. I'm cool.

41
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:12,624
Mom, if you pick me up, I won't have to wait
 million hours at his incredibly boring game.

42
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:13,924
I'm sorry, Mary, I have a meeting.

43
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:17,924
And Angie's get us by and is gonna pick you up…
efore she gets your brother.

44
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:20,924
I'll let her take the van.

45
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,624
And I'll see your chorus thing tomorrow. 
 thought you couldn't.

46
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:27,924
Don't worry, I'll get out, I don't wanna miss it.

47
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:31,924
We're late guys. I'll put out the van.

48
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:35,924
Hey, ace it, okay? Yeah.

49
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:39,724
I love you.

50
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,924
Do you…you want his breakfast? Mmh.

51
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,924
Your mother puts healthy stuff in there. So don't trade-
trade it for chips and cookies, I know.

52
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,924
It was the last time Annie and I saw them alive.

53
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:50,024
When death claims the life of our children

54
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:53,824
we are left with

55
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:56,624
too many questions.

56
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:02,024
How do we make sense of the feelings we're left with?

57
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:09,724
The Gospel according to Luke, even the First Corinthians,

58
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:14,024
tell us of the extraordinary paradise that awaits us.

59
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,024
Okay. The lucky winner is

60
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,024
Jacobs! Stacy Jacobs.

61
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,024
Hello, Stacy, I'm doctor Nielsen.

62
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,024
Hi.

63
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,024
Ah, too late.

64
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:20,124
Oh, nice stream. I bet he's feeling better. 
e's been waited to do that for ten years.

65
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,124
Stacy Jacobs!

66
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:28,124
What in the world were you thinking?
t's all right.

67
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:32,124
My kid used to say,
hat's the difference, you weren't looking anyway?

68
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:35,924
Do you like rabbits?

69
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,124
Yes? Then go like this.

70
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,124
Good. Ready.

71
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,624
Whooo.

72
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:48,924
We've given her MRIs and…Whoa!

73
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:53,124
Wild rabbit. Watch out. Oh, oh.

74
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:58,124
And also a CAT scan, I believe.

75
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,124
Look at that. 
tacy, you have more pictures than a supermodel.

76
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:08,124
Do you ever wear glasses? 
o, she doesn't need glasses.

77
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:11,124
Does your head hurt a lot? 
ll the time.

78
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,124
Will you do something for me?

79
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:18,124
I want you to cup your hand, and cover your nose 
nd mouth like this and just breathe in and out.

80
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,124
Mrs. Nielsen on four. Oh, that's my wife.

81
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:24,124
Let's see, if you can do it longer than she can talk,

82
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,924
that would be a real achievement.

83
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:31,124
Christy, I've got a meltdown. Okay, take a breath.

84
00:09:32,224 --> 00:09:34,124
The eight pieces from Germany never arrived.

85
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,124
I've gotta choose replacements the night before the opening.

86
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,024
And get them down here, re-hang them and re-light them and I

87
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:44,924
Okay, focus, okay.

88
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:48,124
Focus. It's out double D-anniversary and I'm ruining it.

89
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,124
Double D, yeah. I'm sorry, Christy, I can't leave here.

90
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,024
I'm sorry.

91
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,224
Okay, uhm, I'll tell you what, how about this

92
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,224
uh. How about the Hudson Rivers?

93
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:08,224
Okay? That gives us three.

94
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,224
And the, uh, Hollenbeck…

95
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:17,924
nd the, uh, Hennik 16, 19 and, uh, 23…

96
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:22,224
and the bridge. 
ut they're all in Fairfield and I don't have anybody to send.

97
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:27,024
Well, I'll drop by after work and 
ake 'em up and take 'em over to the gallery, huh.

98
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:32,224
You'd do that for me? Only if you're incredibly grateful. Hey,

99
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:38,224
that gives us a chance to show yours. 
ou've gotta hang it, it's very sexy.

100
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:46,224
Okay, weirdo…

101
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:50,224
I'll be home late, but I'll be home.

102
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:57,224
I love you, Bella. I love you too.

103
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:01,024
Bye. Yeah.

104
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,224
Stacy, do you like art?

105
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,224
My wife fixes paintings and she also makes some of her owns.

106
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:14,224
Now, to me, paintings are the most 
mportant interesting things in the world

107
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,224
next to your brain.

108
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:18,224
You feel better, don't you?

109
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,124
Mmh, migraines…he.

110
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,224
I said, I love you, Bella.”

111
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,224
I'll always remember that.

112
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,324
At least I got to say it.

113
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,124
Huh. Huh. Are you all right?! 
eah, I think so.

114
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,824
I'm a doctor. Get me out of here!

115
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:24,324
Don't move.

116
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,224
Chris?

117
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:54,324
Hmm? Do you know what's happened?

118
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,324
Yeah, I had a bad piece of fish before bed, Ha.

119
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:05,224
Who are you?

120
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,324
A doc? Are you operating on me?

121
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:15,224
Who are you? Why can't I see you?

122
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:32,424
Ginger. Ginger, you see me?

123
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,224
She does. Dogs are different.

124
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:39,424
Can you see me now? Is that you, doc?

125
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,424
Why are you so blurred? 
'll get clearer when you want me to, Chris.

126
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,124
Are you confused about 
ow you got home so fast?

127
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,424
Dreams don't deal in time, doc. 
ime doesn't count.

128
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,424
You've died, Chris.

129
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:06,424
You have to be a dream, doc, 
f I were dead, would I need you to tell me?

130
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,424
I guess you do. Everyone is different.

131
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:16,424
I wish everybody would go home. I know.

132
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,424
How can I see everyone, doc? Everybody

133
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,224
but…I know you don't wanna see me.

134
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,424
You don't wanna be dead.

135
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,424
The kids were so young when they died.

136
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,424
I want you to remember is your kids.

137
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,424
When they were still alive.

138
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,424
When she goes to the hospital, I'm going too.

139
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,424
Marie, Katie's not

140
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:07,524
Katie's not going there to get better.

141
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:11,324
Sugar?

142
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,524
They're gonna give her a shot.
And it's not gonna hurt

143
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,524
and she's gonna fall asleep.
You're going to kill my dog?

144
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:21,524
I'm going to help her die, yes.

145
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,524
Honey, she hurts very…very

146
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:34,224
badly and nothing can help her.

147
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:38,524
So, I'm gonna stop that, because I love her.
You're going to kill my dog.

148
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,524
You get angry. Death does that.

149
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,324
What'll happen to her?

150
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:55,324
Uhm…she'll go where we all go.

151
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,324
And how can that be bad?

152
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:08,524
Come on, dad.

153
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,524
Oh, my leg!

154
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:13,524
Oh, oh, aah, stucker! Aah. Oh.

155
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,424
Thanks for not listening to Mom.

156
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:26,524
About what? Well, I don't know, just coming out here.

157
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:30,524
And this whole day. 
ou know, she didn't want us doing this, because of,

158
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,524
because of, I don't know, grades and stuff.

159
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:36,624
Your mother and I did talk.

160
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,624
And, uh, you know, we always listen to each other.

161
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,424
So, I mean, what'd you talk about?

162
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:51,624
About taking you out of Head-Royce.

163
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:57,424
The school is wrong for you.

164
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:02,624
While this is a time and

165
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,624
Where are we now?

166
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:09,624
Maybe you don't want to stay, Chris. This is your funeral.

167
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,624
What am I on? You're real, real fuzzy?

168
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:28,624
At least you're willing to see yourself.
You're losing your fear.

169
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,624
Fear? That you disappeared.

170
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:37,624
You didn't. You only died.

171
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:45,624
A woman...who lost her only children just four short years ago.

172
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:50,624
Every day in the Lord's Prayer. Celia, oh,

173
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,624
oh…come on.

174
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,624
DE REPENTE UM DIA, SABEMOS Q SE SENTE

175
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:04,624
UM MOMENTO EM QUE LA FE, LA ESPERANCA

176
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:08,624
NOS POE UMA UNICA PROVA

177
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,724
This one is a present…for me.

178
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:09,724
It's our double D-anniversary. 
t's kind of a special day.

179
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,724
It's her version of our place.

180
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,724
Your place? Where we first met.

181
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,724
Where we're going to retire, I guess.

182
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,724
Live out our lives. Be old farts together.

183
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:31,724
Right there. That's our dream house.

184
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:34,724
That one is me, I guess.

185
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:38,724
The blurry one is Annie.

186
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:41,724
Looks a little familiar, doc.

187
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:54,724
The funeral is over, doc. Why is this going on past the funeral?

188
00:19:58,824 --> 00:19:59,824
Dear Diary,

189
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,724
I'm writing in your bullshit pages because my shrink is crazier than I am.

190
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:06,824
He thinks you're therapy.

191
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:12,824
He figures if two babies can hammer me
into a psycho ward, what'll I do with this?

192
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:15,624
He's so stupid.

193
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,524
He's so stupid he thinks he pulled me through the breakdown

194
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:23,824
when it was only Christy. Always. Only Chris.

195
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,824
Oh, Jesus…I was looking through his postcards.

196
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,824
Paintings were his obsession.

197
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:33,824
He used arts to love me, to help me.

198
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:36,824
To keep us always together.

199
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,824
Annie? I'm here, babe.

200
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:45,824
I still exist.

201
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:52,624
You're thinking of me. Keep thinking of me.

202
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:54,824
Come on, with me.

203
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:57,824
You were always with me.

204
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,824
You know, the people who finished each other's sentences. Remember us?

205
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:07,824
I still exist.

206
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:10,824
I still exist!

207
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,824
I still exist.

208
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:19,824
Just write it down.

209
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:23,824
Write it down.

210
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:29,824
This is Chris.

211
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,724
This…is…Chris.

212
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:43,724
I…

213
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:47,724
still…

214
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:52,724
exist. Oh, yeah.

215
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,724
Read it.

216
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:06,924
Read it!

217
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:44,724
Christ, when does it end?

218
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:49,924
There's no rules, Chris.
It ends when you want to.

219
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:53,924
Where were you? Someplace else.

220
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:57,924
Mmh. What, you think I'm a figment of your imagination?

221
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,924
It's real. She's real. You're real. It's all real.

222
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,924
That's the point if there's a point.

223
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:07,924
Reality, it's over when you stop wanting to hurt her.

224
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:26,024
Forever…

225
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:39,024
Don't worry, baby…

226
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:45,824
I'm not leaving you alone. I'm not going anywhere. Aaah! Aaaah!

227
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:09,024
Goodbye, babe.

228
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,124
Mh, mh. Oh, Katie, it's you! Ha-ha.

229
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:41,124
You're young again. Oh.

230
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:46,924
Come here, Katie!

231
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:48,924
Katie! Katie!

232
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:51,124
Katie?

233
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:55,124
Hey, come on, hey!

234
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:01,124
Boy, I screwed up. I'm in dog heaven.

235
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:15,124
A place where we all go can't be bad, can it, girl?

236
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:48,224
Maybe I'm not in your heaven after all girl! Maybe you're in mine!

237
00:26:56,224 --> 00:26:58,224
Annie!!!

238
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:37,024
Chris? What the hell you're doing? That's not how you use a stethoscope!

239
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,024
Albert Lewis? Last time you saw me

240
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:44,224
I was 63, stretched out on a cardiac ward!

241
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:49,224
I bet you thought I was old and decrepit, huh? 
alking about “Ah, can't go on,

242
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:51,224
can't go on!”

243
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:55,024
Who wants to be 63 throughout eternity?

244
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:58,024
Look at you on the water there! Well hello, somebody!

245
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:02,224
Come on…walk along, feel the beat!

246
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:05,124
Dancing on water! He. Smooth as ever.

247
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:08,224
And that was you…

248
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:10,224
just now, when I,

249
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,124
when I died.

250
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:17,324
I thought you recognized me, because you kept calling me, “Doc”.

251
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:21,324
Me being your favorite doc of all time. Could you lend me hand?

252
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:25,324
I'm kind of up to my ass in problems again, chief.

253
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:28,324
Oh, Chris…Ah, ah.

254
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:31,324
Come here.

255
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:34,324
You are still kinda ugly.

256
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,324
You taught me a lot, chief. Nice place you got here.

257
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:43,324
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, nice place you got here.

258
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:47,324
Me? Sure, you're making all of this.

259
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:49,324
See, we're all pretty insecure at first,

260
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:52,324
so we se ourselves somewhere safe and comforting.

261
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:55,324
We all paint our surroundings, Chris, but you're the first guy

262
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,324
who knows to use real paint! There's so much here she didn't paint.

263
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,324
Like that bird.

264
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:08,324
Annie gave you a start, sort of like holding onto handrails.

265
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:11,124
Now you're creating an entire world here.

266
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:14,324
From your imagination, from paintings you love, anything you want.

267
00:29:15,324 --> 00:29:18,324
Why doesn't it move? It will move when you want it to.

268
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,324
Oh-hoh! You go, boy! Can I make it dive?

269
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:32,324
You're the painter now! It's your world.

270
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:39,224
Heeeeeaaa-haaa! Whoo. Look at it go!

271
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:43,324
How about maybe turquoise wings? Turquoise!

272
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,324
And a little mauve, all right! Wow!

273
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:05,424
Huh. I didn't do that. No, I did.

274
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:09,424
See, when we're together it's like dual controls.

275
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,424
Can I make elephants fly?

276
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,424
Hey, didn't Annie paint a house somewhere?

277
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:22,424
Yeah, it's our dream house.

278
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,424
Just a stroll across the water.

279
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,224
Let's take the shortcut.

280
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,424
Nice shortcut. It's easy, Chris, look at me.

281
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:41,424
I'm gonna drown. You can't, you're already dead.

282
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:47,424
Oh. Am I…am I really here? What do you mean by “you” anyway?

283
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:50,424
Are you your arm or your leg?

284
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:52,424
Partly. Really?

285
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:56,224
If you lost all your limbs, would that still be you?

286
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:58,424
That's still be me. So, what is then “me”?

287
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,424
My brain, I suppose. Your brain?

288
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:06,424
Your brain is a body part. Like your fingernail or your heart.

289
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,224
Why would that be the part that's “you”?

290
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:10,424
Because

291
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,424
“I” am sort of a voice in my head.
The part of me that thinks, that feels.

292
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:17,424
That is aware that I exist at all.

293
00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:26,424
So, if you're aware you exist…then you do.

294
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:29,324
That's why you're still here.

295
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:46,524
No windows. What aren't you ready to see, I wonder?

296
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:54,524
Drink it. Just thinks it's coffee and it will be.

297
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:58,524
Okay. It's coffee.

298
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:02,524
Paint! Acrylic.

299
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,524
Why is it so hard? What?

300
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:11,524
Your brain is meat. It rots and disappears.

301
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,524
You really think that's all there was to you?

302
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,524
Like, you're in your house right now.

303
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:24,324
You're IN your house, it doesn't mean you ARE your house.

304
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:26,524
House falls down, you get out and walk away.

305
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:32,324
But it looks like I rebuilt, huh?
You see your body because you like seeing one.

306
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,524
We're seeing what we choose to see.

307
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:38,324
Let me show you something.

308
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:15,524
Ha! It's real, where is all the paint? You don't need it anymore.

309
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,424
This is your world now.

310
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,624
Thought is real. Physical is the illusion.

311
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:27,624
Ironic, huh?

312
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:34,624
Where's God in all of this? He's up there.

313
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:38,624
Somewhere… shouting down that he loves us.

314
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:41,624
Wondering why we can't hear him. You think?

315
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:45,624
Yeah. Drink your coffee.

316
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:51,624
Needs milk. Don't push your luck.

317
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:06,624
What do you think, Christy?

318
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:11,624
Right here.

319
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:15,624
Like this?

320
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:18,424
You think?

321
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:36,624
They say we live in our minds anyway.

322
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:41,624
Having you with me, like this,

323
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:43,624
keeps me happy.

324
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,624
Why do I believe you can hear me?

325
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,624
Why do I think you can see this?

326
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:01,724
What's that purple tree? I never saw that.

327
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,724
Well, let's take a look.
Think you can get there in eight seconds?

328
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:09,724
Fffw, eight seconds? Over there?

329
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,724
Yeah, I just need a little incentive.

330
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,724
Yeah, I can fly. Oh, no, no, no!

331
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,524
Why not? I can do what I want, right?

332
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:41,724
Well, I think you'd be more comfortable keeping it real.

333
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,724
Okay. Think of running real fast, like the roadrunner. Okay. Okay? Yeah.

334
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:54,724
I can handle this. Adios, muchacho. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah.

335
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:04,524
Oh, wait! Chris!

336
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:07,724
Annie!!!

337
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,724
I bet you're thinking “Oh, shit” now!

338
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,724
Yeah! Go, boy!

339
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,824
Go, Chris go! Ah. Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

340
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,824
Albert! Albert!

341
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,824
It's completely new.

342
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,824
The canvas was blank when I was alive.

343
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:29,824
How can I see this drawing after I'm dead?

344
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,824
Ha, for an expert you look pretty surprised.

345
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:38,824
You and Annie, a long courtship? No actually.

346
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,824
From the very first moment it was like-Soul mates.

347
00:37:42,824 --> 00:37:44,824
It's extremely rare, but it exists.

348
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,824
Sort of like two twin souls. Tuned in to each other.

349
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:53,724
Apparently even in death.

350
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:59,824
You're reaching each other through her painting. It's
It's nothing I've ever seen, Chris.

351
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:04,824
You can't see it, can you?

352
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:09,824
And you never will.

353
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:52,924
I love you. Aaah.

354
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:40,924
Whose footprints are these?

355
00:39:43,024 --> 00:39:43,924
Don't ask me, you put 'em here.

356
00:39:58,024 --> 00:39:58,824
Annie.

357
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,024
Annie! Chris!

358
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:02,024
Annie!

359
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:14,024
Fantasy is not what you need right now, Chris. No, you're right,

360
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:17,024
I need Annie.

361
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:23,024
That'll change in time, Chris. Oh, come on, Einstein!

362
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:28,024
Time is not on my watch any more! Time…does not exist here!

363
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:32,024
And wherever it went, it won't make me need Annie any less.

364
00:40:35,024 --> 00:40:38,024
You'll feel differently, Chris, and so will she! Man…

365
00:40:40,924 --> 00:40:41,824
you don't know us.

366
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,024
Wish I did.

367
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:53,824
Marie.

368
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:55,824
Marie!

369
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:03,024
Hey, look, it's Tigger!

370
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:08,024
It's my daughter's! Katie tore it up once and…

371
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:14,024
she's here, right.

372
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:16,924
Where's she?

373
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:23,024
Chris, “here” is big enough for everybody to have their own private universe.

374
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:29,024
That's not why you haven't seen you kids yet, is it?

375
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,024
What does that mean, Buddha!

376
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:37,024
I wanna see my children, Albert!

377
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,124
When you do, you will.

378
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:00,124
Does that hurt?

379
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:03,924
Mm-mm. That?

380
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:06,124
Mm-mm. How about that?

381
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,124
I'm gonna keep doing this till you tickle.

382
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:19,124
You've got a fever. It's going down, though.
Don't you have to go somewhere?

383
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,124
You wanna play chess?

384
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:28,924
I could teach you.

385
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:31,924
Would you teach me that?

386
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:03,024
Excuse me.

387
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,124
Albert has to work. He asked me to meet with you.

388
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:12,124
Would that be all right?

389
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,024
Leona…

390
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:19,024
That's a beautiful name. He said you've been isolated.

391
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:23,224
Do you wanna see others? Perhaps a city?

392
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:26,224
I would, but travel makes me nauseous.

393
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,224
Close your eyes.

394
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:38,224
I didn't mean forever.

395
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,224
What do you think?

396
00:43:53,224 --> 00:43:57,224
I think I'm a little under-dressed. You look fine.

397
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:01,224
Until now you've been painting your world. This is mine.

398
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:04,224
In our city across the river we have to have a common vision.

399
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:23,224
So, there's work

400
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:28,224
I like that. Albert, for example,

401
00:44:28,324 --> 00:44:32,024
he's sort of a missionary. Saving lost souls.

402
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:34,224
Like me. Hardly.

403
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,224
They are the ones who can't get here.

404
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:41,224
You mean, from hell? In a way.

405
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:43,224
It's probably not what you think.

406
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,224
My work on the other hand, is with animals.

407
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:51,124
Katie is an old friend.

408
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,124
Dearest Christy.

409
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:58,024
I don't know how this day unravelled.

410
00:44:58,124 --> 00:45:01,224
I was proud of how I held together through this annd this afternoon.

411
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:05,324
But coming home, I began to lose it.

412
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:12,324
If I had walked out that night for our double D,
ou would have never been in the tunnel doing me a favor.

413
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:16,324
A whole family lost in car crashes.

414
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,124
Enough to make a person buy a bike.

415
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:29,324
Where are they going? They're going to help others be reborn on earth.

416
00:45:30,324 --> 00:45:32,124
Really? Reincarnation.

417
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:42,124
Albert says to cheer you up.

418
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,324
You have difficulty…to losing my wife, yeah.

419
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:52,324
And your children? They died years ago.

420
00:45:53,324 --> 00:45:55,324
That's why I'm worried about my wife.

421
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:00,324
They died in a terrible collision.

422
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,324
The nanny was driving. It wasn't her fault.

423
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:06,124
And your wife?

424
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,324
My daughter had asked her to drive.

425
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:28,324
It was a trucker's fault.

426
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:33,224
But my wife believed that if she'd been driving the kids,

427
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,324
her protective instinct would have…

428
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:50,424
Are you okay?

429
00:46:58,224 --> 00:46:59,224
Come on, Katie!

430
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:15,224
Where were you just now?

431
00:47:16,424 --> 00:47:18,424
Your mind's been wandering all afternoon.

432
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,424
Thinking of someone.

433
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:29,424
Your wife must have loved her children very much. Very much.

434
00:47:30,424 --> 00:47:32,424
But you don't have to break in half to love somebody.

435
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:39,224
Tell me a memory of your own.

436
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:43,224
Say, with your daughter.

437
00:48:02,524 --> 00:48:04,424
Hey, that's somebody else's art.

438
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:08,424
What's the difference, you weren't looking anyway.

439
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:15,424
Your move.

440
00:48:18,324 --> 00:48:19,424
Is this where we go when we die?

441
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:28,524
It's a dream, baby. It's a beautiful one,

442
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:32,524
but you know, dreams-I know, are not real.

443
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:35,324
Yeah.

444
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:41,224
It's after midnight. I haven't won yet.

445
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:44,524
It's your first time. No, I like that I haven't won yet.

446
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:45,524
Means that you're not cheating.

447
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,524
And when I win, I really win. I just wanna play till I do.

448
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:56,524
Unless you wanna stop. No. Let's play till you win.

449
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,524
She died three months later.

450
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,524
We played every night.

451
00:49:08,524 --> 00:49:09,524
It meant the world to me.

452
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:13,524
But she never won.

453
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:43,524
I didn't look like this in the body, you know.

454
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:51,324
We flew to Singapore once.

455
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:54,524
And my Daddy smiled at the flight attendant who…

456
00:49:57,624 --> 00:50:00,624
looked like this and wore a name tag Leona.

457
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:06,624
He said Asian women are so…

458
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:11,624
lovely and… graceful and…

459
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:15,624
intelligent. He didn't mean only

460
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:18,624
-I know. It was just something he said.

461
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:23,624
And what I thought was, when I grow up I wanna be that.

462
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,624
You still play chess?

463
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:40,624
I think I waited for my partner.

464
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:27,241
I swear that California is the strangest place.

465
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:33,122
They sort of push you into it so you can get it done before your shrink commits you.

466
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,126
Thoughtful legislation there.

467
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:39,337
Mine is suspicious.

468
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:44,217
Another week, he might commit me. For my own safety.

469
00:51:48,346 --> 00:51:52,350
I had the husband lover I was meant to have.
Two spectacular children.

470
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:57,355
Blessings no one would dare expect from anything as our victorious life.

471
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:01,317
And the truth is, simply…

472
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:05,154
that it's over.

473
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:10,326
Just this one loose end to ravel up.

474
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:18,334
I don't get to say goodbye. You're dead and I blew that.

475
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:24,340
I don't get to say goodbye.

476
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:29,345
But I'll tell you what

477
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:33,349
-across whatever distance there is,

478
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,353
I send you my love.

479
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,332
Hey. Where were you? Far away.

480
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,335
I got called back, when I was working.

481
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:05,339
There are no words to thank you.

482
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:08,342
For finding Marie.

483
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,348
Is she okay? Marie's fine.

484
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:18,227
You'll see her again, real soon. She sends her love

485
00:53:19,437 --> 00:53:20,438
Especially now.

486
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:32,450
We're gonna go through something very hard right now.

487
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:35,453
I'm with you. You're not alone.

488
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:40,249
Chris, Annie is dead.

489
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,422
She killed herself.

490
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,428
It's

491
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:54,430
-It's nothing I'd ever expected.

492
00:53:58,351 --> 00:53:59,435
Like I said, you don't know us.

493
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:05,441
Is that kind of an occupational hazard of soul mates?

494
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:07,443
One is not much without the other?

495
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:12,448
He, but she's okay.

496
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,452
You know. Because her pain is over.

497
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:19,247
You don't understand. She won't cling like I did.

498
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,456
You don't understand. When do I see her?

499
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:22,250
Never.

500
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:29,424
You'll never see her. She's a suicide, suicides go somewhere else.

501
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:33,428
What are you punishing her for?
No, it's not punishment.

502
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:37,223
She's suffered enough so much pain.
There are no judges or crimes here.

503
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:40,226
Everybody is equal. It's just reality and the way things work!

504
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:44,439
And the reality is suicides go to hell?
No goddamn judgement in that!

505
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:48,443
You wanna fight.

506
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,448
You can hide from it or you can understand it.

507
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:58,244
What you call “Hell” is for those who don't know they're dead.

508
00:54:58,536 --> 00:55:01,539
They can't realise what they've done or what's happened in them.

509
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:07,253
Too self-absorbed in life that they build this world-Self-absorbed?!

510
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:08,546
That doesn't apply to Annie, all right?

511
00:55:10,548 --> 00:55:11,549
No, it doesn't.

512
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,219
Suicides are different.

513
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:18,556
Suicides don't go to hell because they're immoral or selfish.
They're going for a very different reason.

514
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,519
Each of us has an instinct that there's a natural order to our journey.

515
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,523
And Annie has violated that. She won't face it.

516
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:33,529
She won't realise, accept what she's done.

517
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,532
And she will spend eternity playing that out.

518
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:40,536
You're still saying she's in hell. Everybody's hell is different.

519
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,538
It's not all fire and pain.

520
00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:44,540
The real hell is your life gone wrong.

521
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:07,522
I'm her soul mate. I can find her.

522
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:19,534
You don't understand how-It's not about understanding!

523
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:23,538
It's about not giving up.

524
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:28,543
You said there were no rules. How about that purple tree, sport.

525
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,545
You were pretty surprised when that one came through of me, huh?

526
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,551
Hey, if there're no rules, how can you say all suicides are the same?

527
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:39,345
I can't. That's a rule. I can't. Okay.

528
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,556
And how can you say that Annie can't realise she's dead.

529
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:44,350
I can't. Okay. We and all the others have seen it.

530
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,519
No one has ever seen a suicide brought back!

531
00:56:46,727 --> 00:56:49,439
Stick around, chief. You ain't seen nothing yet.

532
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,656
Okay, look. You deserve your change.

533
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,616
We'll find us a tracker.

534
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:32,333
Hey! This the guy who doesn't give up?

535
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:36,754
Anyone ever tell you too much persistence can get stupid?

536
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,551
Constantly. I hear the same thing.

537
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:44,720
I also hear I read too slow. I don't need glasses.

538
00:58:46,848 --> 00:58:48,724
My eyes being a figment of my imagination.

539
00:58:50,852 --> 00:58:53,855
You'll hear a lot of smart stuff around here. It's usually right.

540
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:56,858
Don't let it screw you up. I won't.

541
00:58:58,818 --> 00:59:00,820
Your wife love you as strong?

542
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:10,830
We'll find her.

543
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:16,836
But when you find her…nothing will make her recognise you.

544
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:22,842
Nothing will break her denial. It's stronger than her love.

545
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:25,845
In fact, reinforced by her love.

546
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:31,851
You can say everything you long to say. Including goodbye.

547
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:35,646
Even if she can't understand it.

548
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:40,818
Then you'll have the satisfaction that you didn't give up.

549
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,823
That has to be enough. You just get me there.

550
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:47,825
I'll decide what's enough.

551
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:51,829
When do we leave?

552
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:54,832
Close your eyes.

553
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:10,848
Albert's a sweet kid. He is that.

554
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:13,851
There's a tenderness I never knew in life.

555
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:16,854
I guess it's because I knew him when he was young.

556
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,817
Were you proud of your own kids?

557
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:27,824
Of course. Oh, well, that's an easy bullshit answer.

558
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:30,827
Put some thought behind it. I said “Of course”.

559
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:34,956
I like this sore point.

560
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:40,837
It's juice, juice is strong. It connects.

561
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:44,924
Makes you a better receiver for Annie.

562
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:51,931
She's sort of the transmitter, sending thoughts of you.

563
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:19,917
What did you do when you were alive? You mean the last time?

564
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:25,923
Sure, we can go back and get reborn. But only if we choose to.

565
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:30,928
Last trip, I was on the same line of work-You were a shrink!

566
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:32,930
Fairly perceptive.

567
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:43,733
Oh, my God. You're expecting physical danger?

568
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,948
What could it do, kill you, huh?

569
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:54,952
No, in hell, there's real danger.

570
01:01:57,038 --> 01:01:58,831
Of losing your mind.

571
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:41,833
Because he's drowning, that's why.

572
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,047
He's thirteen years old.

573
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:52,051
I know. He needs to hang out with his friends. That's what he needs.

574
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:56,055
He needs to veg out in front of the television, 
e needs for once in his life to read a fucking book

575
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,851
that he actually likes! 
hat you're saying is, he's going though all of this,

576
01:02:59,934 --> 01:03:02,019
so he won't let me down? 
o, it's actually worse than that.

577
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,022
He's so into you so deep, he thinks he's letting himself down.

578
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:09,026
You say something he can't and then him think he's shit. 
o. How sick is that?

579
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:19,036
How can you take me out of my school?

580
01:03:20,121 --> 01:03:23,040
How can you just blew me out? This is-this is my life!

581
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,043
Don't you think I can make it?

582
01:03:27,128 --> 01:03:30,840
I mean, if I-If I really dig in---Yeah, but you gotta show me

583
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:32,049
some more, okay, buddy? Come on!

584
01:03:33,134 --> 01:03:35,052
You're blowing it, Ian! I'm not you!

585
01:04:44,038 --> 01:04:44,956
Shipwrecks…

586
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:48,126
What is this place? This is the gateway to hell.

587
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:56,134
How are we doing? Picking up any signals?

588
01:04:57,135 --> 01:04:59,137
Actually, not a ripple.

589
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:02,140
That's because I was thinking about somebody else.

590
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:13,943
It's a slap in the face when you walk through a door

591
01:05:14,026 --> 01:05:17,155
and you all these kids taking a 
est and they're just breezing through it.

592
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:20,158
And for you it just…kinda goes.

593
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:25,121
Every day I see, how I'm not as good as you

594
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:27,123
and everyone else.

595
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,127
But that doesn't mean I give up.

596
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:22,220
Cerberus-the guardian.

597
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,237
How do you feel?

598
01:06:43,324 --> 01:06:45,243
More than I want you in and out of some school,

599
01:06:45,326 --> 01:06:47,245
I want to know how you feel when you go to bed at night.

600
01:06:51,332 --> 01:06:52,250
Real scared.

601
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,254
I know I believe in you.

602
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,217
If I was going through fucking hell,

603
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:05,221
I'd only want one person in the goddamn world by my side.

604
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:26,117
There's man

605
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:29,328
Ian never got to know.

606
01:07:33,332 --> 01:07:36,335
The man, he was growing up to be.

607
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,342
He's a good-looking, clear-eyed young fella,

608
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:46,345
about twenty-five.

609
01:07:49,348 --> 01:07:50,349
I could see him.

610
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:56,355
He's a type of guy that men want to be around.

611
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:00,151
Because he has integrity, you know?

612
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,324
He has character. You can't fake that.

613
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:13,331
And he's a guy women want to be around, too.

614
01:08:17,335 --> 01:08:19,337
Because there' tenderness in him.

615
01:08:21,255 --> 01:08:22,256
Respect…

616
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:24,342
Loyalty…

617
01:08:25,218 --> 01:08:26,219
Courage…

618
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,349
And women respond to that.

619
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:36,354
That's makes him a terrific husband, this guy.

620
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,358
I see him as a father.

621
01:08:43,444 --> 01:08:44,320
That's where he really shines.

622
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:53,329
See, when he looks in his kids eyes

623
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:59,419
-and the kid knows that his dad really sees him

624
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,421
-he sees who he is.

625
01:09:04,424 --> 01:09:07,427
Then that child that knows that he's an amazing person.

626
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:14,434
He's quite a guy…that I'll never get to meet.

627
01:09:18,438 --> 01:09:19,439
I wish I had.

628
01:09:25,236 --> 01:09:26,237
Let's do it!

629
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,451
Come on, she could be in there!

630
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:50,428
No!

631
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,431
No

632
01:09:57,435 --> 01:10:00,438
Don't! Don't…Don't do this! 
our mother is not in there, Ian!

633
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:10,323
Your mom is not in there, son.

634
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,424
There's not another man I'd go through hell with.

635
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:35,556
Elevator to hell. Going up.

636
01:10:37,517 --> 01:10:40,520
Come on. So long. Wish us luck.

637
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:44,524
I'm coming with you. I'm not really giving you a choice.

638
01:10:45,525 --> 01:10:50,530
What are you saying? Ever since you suspected Albert was your son,

639
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:54,242
you lost all signals of your wife. I'll concentrate harder.

640
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:57,245
You don't know how. You're all mouth and no chops!

641
01:10:57,328 --> 01:11:02,542
All you're good for is your wife loves you.
And your boy is a devise of distraction.

642
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,545
Damn shrinks! You really love shoving people around, don't you!

643
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,547
We're going up. This is his last chance.

644
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,550
He's never been in such a place. Neither have you.

645
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,553
I've got a better chance by watching one than two.

646
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:17,348
You want him clear? Screw him, Ian!

647
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:19,350
He doesn't know us! He's not family!

648
01:11:20,518 --> 01:11:22,520
No! I'm not leaving him!

649
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:29,527
If he never sees her? Never says goodbye?

650
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,532
We do it without him. We do it together.

651
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,535
Come on, she's your mother, let's go. Dad! No! Listen to me.

652
01:11:42,623 --> 01:11:44,542
When you get there, you don't listen to him.

653
01:11:46,627 --> 01:11:47,545
You find her…

654
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,548
and you bring her back.

655
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:53,551
You can do it.

656
01:11:55,636 --> 01:11:56,554
I believe in you.

657
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:11,444
Do you ever think why I chose to be Albert?

658
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:13,529
He was the only guy you ever listened to.

659
01:12:15,656 --> 01:12:18,618
Listen to me now. Think about mom!

660
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,455
Think about what happened when we died!

661
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:25,625
Think about what you said to her to bring her back!

662
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:13,631
Think about mom.

663
01:13:19,554 --> 01:13:20,638
Think about when we died.

664
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:30,648
I'm teaching myself to smoke.

665
01:13:33,734 --> 01:13:35,653
The doctors call it an affirmation of life.

666
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:42,618
Well, it beats the statue thing.

667
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:50,626
You said divorce. You got my attention.

668
01:13:55,548 --> 01:13:56,632
I think that we're too different,

669
01:13:59,552 --> 01:14:00,636
to stay together.

670
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:04,557
I mean, well, for one thing,

671
01:14:07,727 --> 01:14:09,729
why aren't you in here?

672
01:14:12,732 --> 01:14:13,733
Why didn't you go crazy?

673
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:17,737
Your children died.

674
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:20,531
I remember.

675
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,744
I remember the silence in the house.

676
01:14:25,745 --> 01:14:27,747
I thought I was supposed to be strong.

677
01:14:32,752 --> 01:14:33,753
For me? For me.

678
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:37,757
For us. Just on general principles.

679
01:14:39,717 --> 01:14:40,718
I loved them, Annie.

680
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,721
But they're gone.

681
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:50,728
You've got a choice. Life either goes on…

682
01:14:54,732 --> 01:14:57,735
or not. And you choose life.

683
01:15:02,824 --> 01:15:05,743
Sometimes, when you win, you lose.

684
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:24,720
This hasn't been really a good day.

685
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:31,727
C'mon. It's our private deck.

686
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:35,857
shut up, shut all up.

687
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:40,820
I never took more than thirty percent from any clients.

688
01:15:41,821 --> 01:15:42,822
This must be the place.

689
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:46,826
Mister! I'm here! I'm coming!

690
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:54,834
Hey, watch where you stepping! Oh, sorry, Excuse me!

691
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:56,627
Hi,

692
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,842
Anybody got a cure? No, man!

693
01:16:03,634 --> 01:16:04,635
Excuse me.

694
01:16:05,845 --> 01:16:06,846
Sorry.

695
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:10,850
Welcome, welcome, son. Papa?

696
01:16:11,851 --> 01:16:13,853
Son, son. Papa?

697
01:16:14,854 --> 01:16:16,856
You're close. Welcome.

698
01:16:17,857 --> 01:16:20,818
Are you Klaus.
elcome.

699
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:22,820
No. Welcome, welcome.

700
01:16:24,822 --> 01:16:25,823
You're not my dad, sorry.

701
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:27,825
It's all right, all right.

702
01:16:28,826 --> 01:16:30,620
They'll never come.

703
01:16:31,746 --> 01:16:32,830
Don't worry. It's only a matter of time.

704
01:16:47,929 --> 01:16:49,722
You don't think it looks like a dog?

705
01:16:50,932 --> 01:16:52,850
Sure, you always take the easy ones.

706
01:16:52,934 --> 01:16:56,854
Well, how about that one? 
hat looks like a complete twenty-for-piece dining set.

707
01:16:56,938 --> 01:16:59,857
With a soup tureen. Yeah, or a bunny rabbit.

708
01:17:01,943 --> 01:17:03,820
A very complex bunny rabbit.

709
01:17:05,947 --> 01:17:07,824
Or a very Rubenesque breast.

710
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:13,830
Hey. You always think they're breasts. 
ll different kinds of breasts.

711
01:17:14,956 --> 01:17:15,957
I love them. Yours.

712
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:20,920
Oh, oh, we're gonna be late for the dance thing! What's the rush?

713
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:24,924
I know what you're doing.

714
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:30,930
This is all just a stall. Really? I know why you don't wanna go.

715
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:33,724
Busted.

716
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:36,936
Why don't you try to dance just once?

717
01:17:38,938 --> 01:17:41,941
Other husbands are just as clumsy. Oh, thank you.

718
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:45,945
Lets go.

719
01:17:47,822 --> 01:17:49,949
It's just that when everybody's dancing I feel like

720
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:51,951
I'm alone

721
01:17:52,952 --> 01:17:53,953
in a sea of faces.

722
01:18:42,043 --> 01:18:43,920
Angel Falls…few.

723
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:48,925
It's a little expensive, yeah.

724
01:18:51,052 --> 01:18:53,930
But it's our first double D. Shouldn't it be incredible?

725
01:18:58,017 --> 01:19:01,938
I've never seen anything like this. Well, that's my rule.

726
01:19:03,022 --> 01:19:05,024
To bring adventure to your life.

727
01:19:10,822 --> 01:19:12,031
You...taught me…

728
01:19:13,032 --> 01:19:17,036
the only thing I should always remember.

729
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:19,831
Which is?

730
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:24,043
I forgot.

731
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,052
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah…

732
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:36,055
It was, never give up.

733
01:19:39,016 --> 01:19:40,017
Never give up.

734
01:19:45,022 --> 01:19:46,023
Never.

735
01:19:54,949 --> 01:19:55,825
She's here.

736
01:19:59,036 --> 01:20:00,037
You found her.

737
01:20:01,956 --> 01:20:02,957
Impressive.

738
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,043
That jolt of fear for her. It connected.

739
01:20:06,919 --> 01:20:08,045
My God, is that our house?

740
01:20:31,152 --> 01:20:33,029
Ah! Ah. It's just like our home. Don't you ever think that.

741
01:20:34,155 --> 01:20:35,156
It's an illusion.

742
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:39,035
The whole place…her illusion.

743
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:44,040
Suicides can go get tortured, committed to punishing themselves.

744
01:20:45,124 --> 01:20:48,127
You don't want to push her that way. You want to see her.

745
01:20:49,128 --> 01:20:52,131
Tell her what's in your heart. And then go.

746
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:55,134
No pressure. Wait, wait, wait!

747
01:20:57,136 --> 01:21:00,139
I knew you could get us here. You're a competitor with a big ego.

748
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:06,854
How do you know the first thing about me? 
ou called your son Albert.

749
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:10,149
Who is that? First doctor I interned under.

750
01:21:13,152 --> 01:21:17,156
He was like a father to me. 
is words were gold. A brilliant mind.

751
01:21:18,157 --> 01:21:21,119
Yeah. You recall what did he practice before turning to pediatrics?

752
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:26,958
Child psychia-psychiatry.

753
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:32,130
And he was always, a slow reader.

754
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:37,135
But these, used to be rimless.

755
01:21:39,137 --> 01:21:40,138
And the rest of me,

756
01:21:42,223 --> 01:21:43,141
used to be black.

757
01:21:55,236 --> 01:21:58,156
You know why we choose to look different?

758
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:02,952
Me, the children? Package doesn't count? One's as good as the-Oh, no.

759
01:22:03,035 --> 01:22:07,123
The old package has roles of authority. Who's the teacher, who's the father,

760
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:10,126
gets in the way of who we really are…to each other.

761
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:16,257
And I've been waiting for years for a chance to watch out for you.

762
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:21,220
And I'm watching out for you now.

763
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:24,223
But this isn't like the rest of hell, son.

764
01:22:24,348 --> 01:22:28,227
You've got no defence against Annie.

765
01:22:29,228 --> 01:22:33,232
If you're losing yourself or your soul or being swallowed by hell itself,

766
01:22:33,357 --> 01:22:37,236
if that could possibly save her, 
'd say go for it and I'd be there cheering you on.

767
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:43,242
You've got your children back now. And they need you.

768
01:22:45,244 --> 01:22:48,247
Three minutes, any more you could lose your mind.

769
01:22:50,249 --> 01:22:54,045
How can you lose your mind? Once her reality becomes yours,

770
01:22:55,254 --> 01:22:56,255
there's really no way back.

771
01:23:14,232 --> 01:23:16,025
Think about mom.

772
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,238
About what you said to her to bring her back.

773
01:23:33,126 --> 01:23:34,127
Hello?

774
01:23:35,336 --> 01:23:37,130
Your door is open.

775
01:24:11,122 --> 01:24:12,123
Sorry,

776
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:14,333
I didn't mean to scare you.

777
01:24:17,336 --> 01:24:18,337
Who, who are you?

778
01:24:20,339 --> 01:24:21,340
I'm your neighbour.

779
01:24:22,341 --> 01:24:25,136
I just bought the Gorman's place two months ago.

780
01:24:26,345 --> 01:24:30,349
I just moved in. I never heard they sold their place.

781
01:24:33,227 --> 01:24:34,353
You're Annie Nielsen, right?

782
01:24:36,355 --> 01:24:40,318
They told me a lot about you. 
ike what? What did they say?

783
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:45,323
That you're a very talented artist and work for a museum, right?

784
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:48,326
And, uh, you're a widow.

785
01:24:50,328 --> 01:24:52,330
Mrs. Gorman admires your roses,

786
01:24:54,248 --> 01:24:55,124
very much.

787
01:24:57,335 --> 01:24:58,336
They were so handsome.

788
01:25:01,422 --> 01:25:03,341
But now there's no water pressure in the neighbourhood.

789
01:25:06,427 --> 01:25:10,348
There's no electricity and no gas.

790
01:25:11,432 --> 01:25:14,352
And, and, there're other thing missing, too.

791
01:25:15,436 --> 01:25:18,356
You know, like all my clean cloths and books I want to read.

792
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,317
And, uhm, some of my favorite paintings

793
01:25:22,443 --> 01:25:24,320
I have to work on.

794
01:25:32,453 --> 01:25:34,330
Aaah! Aaah! What is it? They're everywhere now!

795
01:25:36,249 --> 01:25:37,250
I got it!

796
01:25:41,254 --> 01:25:42,255
It's gone.

797
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,221
Thank you.

798
01:25:53,433 --> 01:25:56,227
You're welcome. You say your paintings are missing.

799
01:25:57,437 --> 01:25:59,021
Some of my most precious panels.

800
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,442
The ones that remind me.

801
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:13,453
Remind me of my husband and my children.

802
01:26:15,455 --> 01:26:17,457
That's why I never leave.

803
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:20,418
Because they might return?

804
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:27,425
I hope that's true with all my heart. It's not, you know.

805
01:26:29,427 --> 01:26:32,430
When you're dead, you disappear.

806
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:39,437
My wife committed suicide after our children died. And After I…

807
01:26:43,524 --> 01:26:45,443
She was the loveliest person.

808
01:26:47,528 --> 01:26:52,241
Don't you think that's sad?

809
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:55,244
Don't you have to leave? No. But if you want me to go-I do.

810
01:26:55,328 --> 01:26:56,329
All right.

811
01:26:57,538 --> 01:26:59,457
The last day I saw my wife

812
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:03,252
it was our anniversary. 
 thought you said you were gonna leave?

813
01:27:03,336 --> 01:27:05,421
In a minute. I was sticking around in case there is another problem.

814
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:12,428
It wasn't a wedding anniversary. 
t was a very special kind of day,

815
01:27:16,349 --> 01:27:17,433
no one else knows about.

816
01:27:33,533 --> 01:27:34,534
I need to talk to you.

817
01:27:36,536 --> 01:27:38,329
And you don't have to respond.

818
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:49,549
This is a one-way ticket…for me.

819
01:27:52,552 --> 01:27:54,554
My hanging around here is not helping you.

820
01:27:55,555 --> 01:27:56,556
And it's killing me.

821
01:27:58,558 --> 01:28:00,518
So, today is kind of a D-day.

822
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,522
“D” for decision, I guess.

823
01:28:08,526 --> 01:28:09,527
About divorce.

824
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:13,531
That'd be two D's, wouldn't it?

825
01:28:20,538 --> 01:28:21,539
I stand corrected.

826
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:30,548
Look what happens when you say anything for a month.

827
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:37,555
Cindy called. She said everything is waiting, for you.

828
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:44,520
All the artists and curators will meet with you when you're better.

829
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,441
And I told her,

830
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,528
it was the museum and one of those meetings

831
01:28:54,655 --> 01:28:56,657
that kept you from driving that day.

832
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:03,623
And if you went back, it'd mean you weren't sorry,

833
01:29:03,748 --> 01:29:07,627
you weren't wrong and you'd betraying your children.

834
01:29:09,629 --> 01:29:13,633
She said you were crazy and I said she was a soulless bitch!

835
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:15,635
And I hung up on her! That didn't go very well!

836
01:29:22,433 --> 01:29:24,644
What's true in our minds is true.

837
01:29:25,645 --> 01:29:27,647
Whether some people know it or not.

838
01:29:30,525 --> 01:29:32,443
That's when I realised I'm part of the problem.

839
01:29:34,654 --> 01:29:36,656
Not because I remind you. Because I

840
01:29:38,658 --> 01:29:43,621
couldn't join you. So I left you alone.

841
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:53,631
Don't give up, okay?

842
01:30:06,519 --> 01:30:07,520
Okay.

843
01:30:09,522 --> 01:30:10,523
Okay.

844
01:30:12,525 --> 01:30:13,526
Okay. It's okay.

845
01:30:31,753 --> 01:30:32,628
So you reconciled.

846
01:30:36,758 --> 01:30:37,717
That's very romantic.

847
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,721
But she still killed herself.

848
01:30:44,724 --> 01:30:47,435
At the end she gave up. There's nothing wrong with that.

849
01:30:47,518 --> 01:30:49,729
Her husband didn't think so. He was a coward!

850
01:30:51,522 --> 01:30:52,732
Being strong, not giving up,

851
01:30:54,734 --> 01:30:59,739
that was just his place to hide. 
e pushed the pain away so hard,

852
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:03,743
he disconnected himself from the person he loved the most.

853
01:31:06,746 --> 01:31:09,540
Sometimes, when you win, you lose.

854
01:31:17,757 --> 01:31:20,551
When he saw his children again

855
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:21,719
-I thought you said your children were dead.

856
01:31:24,722 --> 01:31:27,725
You can see the dead. In your dreams. If you want to.

857
01:31:33,648 --> 01:31:34,732
I wanna see Christy.

858
01:31:37,735 --> 01:31:39,737
I can show you. It's not hard.

859
01:31:40,738 --> 01:31:44,742
You know, all you have to do, 
t's like painting a picture. We do it together.

860
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,746
Just close your eyes.

861
01:31:51,624 --> 01:31:52,625
Please. Don't be afraid.

862
01:31:55,837 --> 01:31:57,755
Remember where you were married?

863
01:32:05,638 --> 01:32:06,639
Christy!

864
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,641
Christy.

865
01:32:10,852 --> 01:32:12,728
Who else would you be marrying in you dreams?

866
01:32:16,858 --> 01:32:17,817
I missed you so.

867
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,823
Annie, this is real.

868
01:32:27,827 --> 01:32:28,828
The man in the garden.

869
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:34,834
It's me.

870
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:40,548
No!

871
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:41,632
No!

872
01:32:43,843 --> 01:32:47,847
Whoever you are, whatever you are, 
id you think you could take him from me?

873
01:33:03,821 --> 01:33:06,824
I'm sorry, babe. There's some things I have to say.

874
01:33:07,825 --> 01:33:09,827
I've only got a few moments left.

875
01:33:13,831 --> 01:33:15,833
I'm sorry for all the things I'll never give you.

876
01:33:17,835 --> 01:33:20,630
I'll never buy you another meatball sub with extra sauce.

877
01:33:21,923 --> 01:33:22,840
And always the big one.

878
01:33:25,927 --> 01:33:26,844
I'll never make you smile.

879
01:33:30,932 --> 01:33:32,850
I just wanted us to be old together.

880
01:33:34,727 --> 01:33:37,855
Just two old farts together laughing 
t each other as our bodies fell apart.

881
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,819
Together at the end. By that lake in your painting.

882
01:33:44,946 --> 01:33:45,822
That was our heaven, see?

883
01:33:47,949 --> 01:33:49,826
There's a lots of things to miss.

884
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:55,832
Books…naps…kisses…

885
01:33:57,917 --> 01:33:58,918
and fights.

886
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:01,921
Oh, God, we had some great ones!

887
01:34:02,922 --> 01:34:04,924
Thank you for those.

888
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:08,928
Thank you for every kindness.

889
01:34:11,931 --> 01:34:13,724
Thank you for our children.

890
01:34:14,934 --> 01:34:16,936
For the first time I saw them.

891
01:34:18,938 --> 01:34:21,941
Thank you for being someone I was always proud to be with.

892
01:34:25,945 --> 01:34:28,948
For your guts, for your sweetness.

893
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,952
For how you always looked, for how I always wanted to touch you.

894
01:34:36,956 --> 01:34:37,957
God, you were my life.

895
01:34:41,919 --> 01:34:43,921
I apologise for every time I failed you.

896
01:34:45,923 --> 01:34:46,924
Especially this one.

897
01:35:11,032 --> 01:35:14,952
Didn't you think I'd make out there?
You were in there a while.

898
01:35:15,036 --> 01:35:16,954
Took me a while to realise you were right.

899
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,917
Nothing you can do could help her.

900
01:35:22,043 --> 01:35:23,920
This trip was always just for you. Yeah.

901
01:35:27,048 --> 01:35:28,925
Did you come close-To losing it?

902
01:35:31,052 --> 01:35:33,930
Oh, yeah. Pushed it right to the edge.

903
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:39,936
That's why I had to come out now. I, uh, I'm giving up.

904
01:35:44,023 --> 01:35:45,817
Just not the way you think.

905
01:35:50,029 --> 01:35:51,030
Go home, Al.

906
01:35:53,032 --> 01:35:55,034
Will you tell my children I love them?

907
01:35:57,036 --> 01:35:59,038
And I won't leave their mother.

908
01:36:04,836 --> 01:36:05,837
Thanks.

909
01:36:13,928 --> 01:36:15,054
Where were we headed, baby?

910
01:36:17,056 --> 01:36:21,018
In one minute I won't know you any better than you'll know me.

911
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:25,022
But we'll be together.

912
01:36:27,024 --> 01:36:28,025
Where we belong.

913
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:34,031
Good people end up in hell because they can't forgive themselves.

914
01:36:36,033 --> 01:36:37,034
I know I can't.

915
01:36:38,035 --> 01:36:39,829
But I can forgive you.

916
01:36:42,123 --> 01:36:47,044
For killing my children? And my sweet husband?

917
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:53,050
No. For being so wonderful,
 guy would choose hell over heaven,

918
01:36:53,134 --> 01:36:55,052
just to hang around with you.

919
01:37:02,143 --> 01:37:04,020
Not because I remind you…

920
01:37:05,146 --> 01:37:07,023
but because I couldn't join you.

921
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:10,026
Sorry I left you alone.

922
01:37:14,155 --> 01:37:15,031
Don't give up, okay?

923
01:37:35,927 --> 01:37:36,928
Christy?

924
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:43,935
Christy.

925
01:37:49,148 --> 01:37:50,149
What happened to this place?

926
01:37:55,029 --> 01:37:55,947
It's cold.

927
01:38:09,127 --> 01:38:10,128
Christy?

928
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,924
Oh, God! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

929
01:38:15,049 --> 01:38:16,134
Don't give up! Don't give up! Don't give up!

930
01:38:16,217 --> 01:38:19,137
Christy! Christy. Don't give up!

931
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,139
Don't, don't, don't, don't give up!

932
01:38:26,227 --> 01:38:27,145
Stay with me, don't give up.

933
01:38:50,251 --> 01:38:51,127
Christy.

934
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:33,252
Hey! Remember me?

935
01:39:44,222 --> 01:39:46,224
Sometimes, when you lose,

936
01:39:48,142 --> 01:39:49,018
you win.

937
01:40:44,323 --> 01:40:45,324
How did we get here?

938
01:40:50,329 --> 01:40:52,331
Travel here is like everything else.

939
01:40:53,332 --> 01:40:54,333
It's in your mind.

940
01:40:57,336 --> 01:40:59,338
All you have to do is close your eyes.

941
01:41:01,132 --> 01:41:02,341
If you know where you're going…

942
01:41:05,344 --> 01:41:06,345
looks like we did. Where you were…

943
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:10,141
I

944
01:41:13,352 --> 01:41:15,146
tried everything. But nothing worked.

945
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:18,149
Until…

946
01:41:19,317 --> 01:41:21,319
you tried trailing me.

947
01:41:28,242 --> 01:41:29,327
What some folks call impossible,

948
01:41:31,329 --> 01:41:33,122
is the stuff they haven't seen before.

949
01:42:16,457 --> 01:42:17,417
Excuse me, lady.

950
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:22,422
Ready for that surprise?

951
01:42:23,423 --> 01:42:24,257
Yeah. Hey.

952
01:42:28,428 --> 01:42:29,429
That's not the surprise.

953
01:42:31,222 --> 01:42:32,223
Mommy?

954
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:24,442
I want us to grow old together.
Can we do that here?

955
01:43:27,528 --> 01:43:28,446
Mm-hm. I want it all.

956
01:43:30,531 --> 01:43:33,326
As long as it's with you. It will be.

957
01:43:38,331 --> 01:43:39,457
But what about going back?

958
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:42,418
Being reborn?

959
01:43:44,545 --> 01:43:45,421
See, that's the one thing we can't have here.

960
01:43:47,548 --> 01:43:48,424
Finding each other

961
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:52,428
all over again. Falling in love.

962
01:43:55,556 --> 01:43:57,350
Make different choices.

963
01:44:02,522 --> 01:44:04,524
Try again. Yeah.

964
01:44:05,525 --> 01:44:07,318
Avoid sharp objects.

965
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:12,532
Don't worry about the kids. They'll be here.

966
01:44:13,533 --> 01:44:14,534
They want us to go.

967
01:44:17,537 --> 01:44:19,539
A whole human life is just a heartbeat here in heaven.

968
01:44:19,622 --> 01:44:22,333
And we'll all be together. Forever. Yeah.

969
01:44:27,547 --> 01:44:30,550
How will I find you? I found you in hell,

970
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:32,552
don't you think I could find you in Jersey.

971
01:44:40,518 --> 01:44:41,519
I love you.

972
01:45:36,657 --> 01:45:37,617
When I was young...

973
01:45:38,618 --> 01:45:40,620
...I met this beautiful girl by a lake.
