1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


3
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:50,267
Not all the hiking up mountain
stuff that you are planning.

4
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,254
It tickles, it tickles!

5
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:56,142
Do you want me to stop?

6
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:57,635
No.

7
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,159
But it's 6:15.

8
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:00,536
6:15?

9
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,216
Oh, I've gotta go.

10
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:10,452
I'll cook tonight.

11
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:34,460
Don't even think about it, it's pouring.

12
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,642
Freddie, yeah listen, I am on it!

13
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,370
The West coast will still be up.

14
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,255
I'll call Carmichael now,
and we can close this.

15
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,103
Taxi!!

16
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,127
What? Don't worry.

17
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,471
Careful!

18
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:11,590
<b>Me Before You.

19
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:29,041
SHOP OF THE CASTLE

20
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,628
How many in this one?

21
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:42,293
170 calories, you did
have that one yesterday.

22
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,711
What about that one, then?

23
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:48,677
220, but it is less if
you eat them standing up.

24
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:51,725
Ah!

25
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:53,031
Should we put them in a bag?

26
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,263
Yeah!

27
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,702
Thanks Frank.

28
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:06,708
I don't think I can finish this.

29
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:09,064
Should we wrap it up for you,
Daphne?

30
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:11,525
- Have it later?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,592
CLOSED

32
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:26,685
I'm really sorry.

33
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,116
A month's money?! That's big of 'im!

34
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,950
Given that she's worked like a trojan

35
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,103
in that cafe, for the past six years.

36
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,872
He's closing down, love, he has no choice.

37
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,343
What the hell she going to do now?

38
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,460
Trina can't get any more
hours in the florist.

39
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,581
Lou will get another job.

40
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:15,797
She has a lot of potential.

41
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,409
There are no jobs, Josie, I should know.

42
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,326
Look, I'm just sayin'

43
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,061
We needed that money.

44
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,170
Let's not panic, eh?

45
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:27,922
She'll find something.

46
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,066
Won't you Lou?

47
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,121
Run with me, babe!

48
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:36,989
C'mon!

49
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,876
Only got two laps to go.

50
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,641
You've just gotta get back out there,

51
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,402
Think what you want to do.

52
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,816
Estate agent, maybe, shop
assistant, catering.

53
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:50,627
Do we have to discuss this again?

54
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,277
Well, you can't just mope around.

55
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:55,389
All the best entrepreneurs, they fight
their way back from rock bottom.

56
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,509
Just look at me.

57
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:59,966
But I am not you Pat. I
toast the tea cakes.

58
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:03,543
Can't you slow down? I'm
wearing the wrong bra.

59
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,649
I'm just saying.

60
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,379
Put on a smile and head
back to the job center.

61
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,086
And do not worry about the holiday

62
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,248
I'll pay.

63
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,661
In the last two weeks, we tried

64
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,125
the chicken processing factory

65
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,681
I'm still having nightmares
about those giblets.

66
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,577
We tried beautician.

67
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,564
It turns out hot wax is NOT my friend.

68
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:31,702
I'm running out of options for you, Louisa.

69
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,215
Sayeed, please! I'll take anything!

70
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,882
Oh, this is new in.

71
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,920
And is not far from your home.

72
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:44,402
But you might need to do something
about your wardrobe, for this one.

73
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:48,510
Care and companionship for a disabled man.

74
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,678
What kind of care?

75
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,238
Need someone to drive, feed and assist

76
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,368
six months fixed term contract.

77
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,147
Oh! And it's good money.

78
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,310
It's actually excellent money.

79
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,828
This is the fifth time
they tried to recruit.

80
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,672
They're desperate.

81
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,359
And there's nothing on
here about needing skills.

82
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:08,713
It's perfect for you.

83
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,801
Yeah?

84
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,514
I know it's not how you like to dress.

85
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:14,254
Is this like how anyone likes to dress?!

86
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,075
It served me very well.

87
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:18,049
In 1983.

88
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,802
Styles change, love,

89
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,870
but smart remains smart.

90
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,810
THE CITY CENTER BY THE CASTLE

91
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,001
Thank You.

92
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,742
You Must Be Louisa Clark.

93
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,550
I am Camilla Traynor, do come in.

94
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:21,400
Please, sit down.

95
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,638
Ok.

96
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:26,131
Do you have any experience of care giving?

97
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,808
Um, I've never done it, but
I'm sure I could learn.

98
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,638
And do you have experience
with quadriplegia?

99
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,147
Eh, no.

100
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:34,775
We are talking about complete loss

101
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,420
of the legs and very limited
use of the arms and hands.

102
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:38,851
Would that bother you?

103
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,538
Not as much as it'd bother him. Obviously.

104
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:42,370
So.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,653
Sorry, No! I didn't No, uh!

106
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,115
No, I.

107
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,939
Are you alright?

108
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,981
Um, I'm just a little hot.

109
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,930
Do you, do you mind if
I take off my jacket?

110
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:58,328
Your previous employer here says

111
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:01,958
you are a warm, chatty and
life enhancing presence

112
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,940
with a lot of potential.

113
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,093
Yes, I paid him. Heh.

114
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,357
So what exactly do you
want to do with your life?

115
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:10,673
Sorry?

116
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:17,235
Do you have aspirations for a career or a
professional dream you wish to pursue?

117
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:19,670
Miss Clark, why should I employ you?

118
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,205
Instead of say, the previous candidate?

119
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,602
Um

120
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,771
Really? You can't think of a
single reason I should employ you?

121
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,617
I, I'm I'm, I'm a fast learner.

122
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:33,798
And I'm never ill,

123
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,131
and I only live on the
other side of the castle.

124
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,431
And, and, I am stronger than I look.

125
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,526
And I make a mean cup of tea.

126
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:42,571
You know, there isn't
much that can't be solved.

127
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,182
By a decent cup of tea.

128
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,901
No, not that I'm saying

129
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:48,343
that your husband's paraplegia,
quadriplegia could be solved by

130
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,367
my husband?

131
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,101
It's my son.

132
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,632
Your son?

133
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,531
Will was injured in a road
accident two years ago.

134
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,901
Ah, I'm sorry, when

135
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,578
I am nervous, I just say stupid stuff.

136
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,157
I'm just popping out.

137
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,635
Ah, another interviewee?

138
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:09,958
Will you be back this evening?

139
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:11,016
I'll do my best.

140
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,780
Why, do you need me for something?

141
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,221
No darling.

142
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,559
Hello, I am Stephen, Will's father.

143
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,778
Ah, yeah. Louisa Clark.

144
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,274
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

145
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:25,576
See you later, darling.

146
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:36,060
So?

147
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,232
Would you like the job?

148
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:43,834
Yes!

149
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,725
Can you start immediately?

150
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:46,535
Yes!

151
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:47,665
Good.

152
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,191
The let's go and meet Will.

153
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,590
No, Yes, but I.

154
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,140
The hours are from 8 to
5, Monday to Saturday.

155
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,176
If for whatever reason you're running late

156
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,530
or you need to leave early,

157
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,409
- call me to let me know.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,866
I must stress.

159
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:03,663
That Will should not left alone

160
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,001
- for longer than 15 minutes.
- Ay.

161
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,626
And uh..

162
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,201
You might want to wear something
a little less revealing.

163
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,401
Oh, yes, of course.

164
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:17,912
This is the annex,

165
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,360
it was the stables, before we
had them adapted for Will.

166
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,440
I will give you a set of car keys.

167
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,032
And put you on the insurance.

168
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,374
Nathan, will show you how to use the ramp.

169
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,807
There is a bathroom in here.

170
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,906
The tea and coffee

171
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,843
are in this cupboard here.

172
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,141
You're welcome to help yourself.

173
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,953
You and Will can work out your,

174
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,491
level of interaction yourselves.

175
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,275
Obviously

176
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,444
well, I would hope that you could get on.

177
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,391
I would be nice if he could think
of you as a friend rather than a

178
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:57,728
paid professional.

179
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,256
Do you have any questions?

180
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:00,674
No.

181
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:03,614
Then let's introduce you to Will.
He should be dressed by now.

182
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,739
He has good days and bad days.

183
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,615
Mrs. Traynor, I won't let you down.

184
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:14,548
Good.

185
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,195
I have someone to meet you.

186
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:19,211
Yeah, he's decent Mrs. T.

187
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,470
Will, this is Louisa Clark.

188
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,302
I'm Lou.

189
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,304
Will.

190
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:36,701
William!

191
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:41,756
William, please!

192
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:47,066
Hello Louisa Clark. I am Will Traynor.

193
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:50,479
You appear to have a
problem with your skirt.

194
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,772
You're a bad man, Mr. T!

195
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,158
G'day.Nathan.

196
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,393
Right, well I'll leave you to get on.

197
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,417
Miss Clark, Nathan will talk
you through Will's routines

198
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:06,201
and equipment.

199
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:08,228
You don't have to talk across me, mother.

200
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,240
My brain isn't paralyzed

201
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:12,577
yet.

202
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm Lou.

203
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:32,830
Yeah, you already said that.

204
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,562
Shall I make us all a cup of tea?

205
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,772
Wrench! Where's my wrench!?

206
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:42,101
Mom, did you turn down
the gas on my veggies?

207
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:43,531
This is the drawer of the covered

208
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,571
- you're getting oil everywhere.
- They're gonna be soggy again.

209
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,011
Everything turns up in strange
places, in this house.

210
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,837
It's Auntie Lou!

211
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:54,170
You got it, didn't you!

212
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:56,942
Uh, yeah!

213
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,239
Louisa Clark, working for the Traynors.

214
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:05,818
Wonders'll never cease.

215
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:07,058
Yeah.

216
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Okay?

217
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,147
This, tells you pretty much
everything you need to know.

218
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:22,175
I do most of the heavy lifting, but

219
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:26,281
there's a time table here
to see what he has, when.

220
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:29,773
I have to handle drugs?

221
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:30,995
Blood pressure meds.

222
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,008
To raise it in the morning when he gets up.

223
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,008
Anti-spasm tablets.

224
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,559
Four times a day, to control muscle spasms.

225
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,310
Tablets for nerve pain.

226
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:42,001
Now, you can give him pain killers

227
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:42,854
if he asks, just

228
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,339
try to resist giving him
sleeping pills, if possible

229
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:47,402
because they tend make him a little,

230
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,025
Well, irritable.

231
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,327
Like, "more irritable".

232
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:55,724
It's a lot to remember.

233
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,033
It's all written down.

234
00:13:57,228 --> 00:14:00,218
And he knows what is what.
He might deny it.

235
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,293
And you got my number. Most of
my other patients live nearby

236
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,363
I am never far away.

237
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,795
What if he needs to, uh.

238
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,458
Don't worry. You're not here
for any of the physical stuff.

239
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:11,636
Okay.

240
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,787
What am I here for?

241
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,638
To cheer him up, I guess.

242
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,834
Hello.

243
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,730
Hello.

244
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,136
So I thought we could
go out this afternoon.

245
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,004
Where do you have in mind?

246
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,549
Well, I was told you have
a car that was adapted,

247
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,466
for wheelchairs.

248
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,279
And you thought a drive
would be good for me?

249
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,083
A breath of fresh air?

250
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,023
What do you usually do?

251
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,305
I don't do anything, Miss Clark. I sit.

252
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,061
And just about exist.

253
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:54,237
Okay, well I could get you your computer?

254
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,667
Did you find a good quad
support group I could join?

255
00:14:56,784 --> 00:15:00,437
'Quads-R-Us? The 'Tin Wheels' club?

256
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:04,129
Or perhaps we could get
to know each other a bit.

257
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,171
You know, because then you

258
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,895
could tell me what you DO like to do.

259
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:12,733
Maybe.

260
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,876
Here's what I know about you, Miss Clark.

261
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:24,913
My mother says that you're chatty.

262
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:25,963
Yeah.

263
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,290
Could we strike a deal.

264
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,755
Whereby you are very 'unchatty' around me?

265
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,696
Okay.

266
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,596
Yeah, well I'll just

267
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,089
be in the kitchen, if you need anything.

268
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,074
Lovely.

269
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,991
Has he done his Stephen
Hawking impression yet,

270
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,748
or stuff about "My Left Foot"?

271
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,256
No, he's fine.

272
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,380
Okay, well you can take lunch now.

273
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,368
Me and Mr. T. Have a few things
to take care of this time of day.

274
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:49,852
Still a disaster? Yup.

275
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,817
Good morning!

276
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:11,817
Hi!

277
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,589
Not a great day.

278
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:18,735
Would you like a cup of tea?

279
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:30,879
Oh! Sorry!

280
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,066
Val d'Isere.

281
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,166
Good snow that year.

282
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,039
Sorry, I was, I was.

283
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:43,709
You were just looking at my photographs.

284
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,409
Thinking how awful it must be
having lived like that and ended

285
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,525
up like this.

286
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,752
The rest are in the drawer if you'd
like to snoop around further.

287
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,243
Good morning.

288
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,809
Every time I speak, he looks
at me like I am stupid.

289
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,157
To be fair, you are pretty stupid.

290
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,447
Yes, but he does not know that yet.

291
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,212
Maybe he's like that with everyone.

292
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:27,715
Until he knows if you are going to stick
around. I mean, it's only been 10 days.

293
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,026
But it feels like a lifetime.

294
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,353
You can't quit, Lou.

295
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,689
Yes? Watch me.

296
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,233
Look, I'm thinking of
going back to college.

297
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:44,994
Someone's dropped out of business
studies and they can take me back.

298
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:46,283
What? What about Thomas?

299
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,258
There is a nursery on the Campus,
we'd come back at weekends.

300
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:52,403
I do not have a Patrick, Lou

301
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:54,983
I don't think I'm ever
going to have a Patrick.

302
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,179
I need this - Oh, I get it!

303
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,959
You just want me to stay here
in this miserable job, so

304
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:01,475
I can help Mom and Dad!

305
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,281
- I've done my fair share.
- Oh yeah?

306
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,851
I can't stay here.

307
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:09,321
You know I can't.

308
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,325
Please, for me and Tom.

309
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:32,896
Louisa, some visitors are on their way.

310
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,797
Friends of Wills, it's unexpected.

311
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,048
You might need to

312
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,487
I'll make some tea or coffee.

313
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,271
And I'll make myself scarce.

314
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,006
I think I'll.

315
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,506
I think I'll leave them to it.

316
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,166
So how's the Physio and
stuff, all coming on,

317
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,196
is there any improvement?

318
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,602
No.

319
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,612
Because you look good.

320
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:07,642
Yeah.

321
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:11,187
So?

322
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:13,010
To what do I owe this pleasure?

323
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:15,543
I'm sorry it's been so long.

324
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:16,646
But I have been very busy,

325
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,029
Yes, things are manic at the office.

326
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,710
There's a new chap from New York.

327
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,684
Baines, you ever come across him at all?

328
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:24,523
No.

329
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:25,532
Vicious.

330
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,601
Total monster.

331
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:28,674
Some days, I feel that I
can hardly leave my chair.

332
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:45,885
Please say something.

333
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,779
Congratulations.

334
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,895
Neither of us meant for this to happen.
We were just

335
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,505
friends, for ages.

336
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:56,649
And if truth be told,

337
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:59,195
Rupert was a great support,
after your accident.

338
00:20:59,225 --> 00:20:59,860
How big of him!

339
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,369
Oh Will, please, I.

340
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,521
We should probably go.

341
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,769
I'm sorry will, I really am.

342
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:15,355
We both are, and I, uh, we.

343
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,364
We really do hope things improve for you.

344
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:41,765
Thank you, you know I tried, for months.

345
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:47,497
You know, you can only help someone
who actually wants to be helped.

346
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:07,864
I wondered, if you wanted me to.

347
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,505
Right, well you'd better not
move until I've cleaned that up.

348
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,452
Because I've got no idea what
I'd do, if you pop a tire.

349
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,066
It was awful!

350
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:34,938
It's his girlfriend and his best friend!

351
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:36,680
You can't blame her.

352
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,869
Are you really saying that you'd stick are
with me if I was paralyzed from the neck down?

353
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,395
Of course I would!

354
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,960
Well, I don['t want someone
to stay with me out of pity.

355
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:47,872
I mean, strangers wipe your ass, Jesus!

356
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,776
Think of all the things you couldn't do.

357
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:52,203
No more running, no more cycling.

358
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,958
Hey, no more sex.

359
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:55,492
Of course we could have sex!

360
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,776
It's just the girl'd have to be on top.

361
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,652
Ah, well then we'd be doing it then?

362
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:01,608
Hey, listen.

363
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:02,903
Yeah?

364
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,013
- About the holiday.
- Yeah?

365
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,128
How do you fancy.

366
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,838
- Norway?
- Norway!

367
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,876
- WOW!!!!!!
- Yeah! Okay!

368
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,060
Eh, boys! I'm in!

369
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,469
Yeah!

370
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:26,744
The Viking triathlon.

371
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,584
60 miles on a bike.

372
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,023
30 miles on foot.

373
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,426
And then a nice swim through
sub zero Nordic seas, yeah!

374
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,343
That's our holiday?

375
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:36,818
Not all of it.

376
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:39,971
Just the beginning, then
we'll sight see or whatever

377
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,615
I have never been fitter, Lou.

378
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,313
This is the year to do it.

379
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:10,955
I just thought if I could see
if I could fix some of these.

380
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,083
Or um, y'know.

381
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,685
If you wanted to get new ones, I
could go into town at lunch time.

382
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,729
Or we could both go.

383
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,272
You know what, Louisa.

384
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:20,670
Me smashing those was not an accident.

385
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,797
Sorry, aright, I didn't think

386
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:25,458
you thought you knew best.

387
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,625
Well, I don't want those
pictures staring at me,

388
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:29,097
Every time I'm in bed,

389
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,523
Waiting for someone to bloody
get me out again, okay?

390
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,410
I wasn't going to fix the one of Alicia.

391
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,063
I'm not THAT stupid.

392
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:36,648
Spare me the psychology.

393
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:39,096
Just go and raid your grandma's wardrobe

394
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:41,449
or whatever it is you do,
when you're not making tea.

395
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,584
You don't have to be an ass!!

396
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,485
Your friends got the shitty
treatment, fine. They deserved it.

397
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:52,873
I'm just trying to do
my job, as best I can.

398
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:55,361
So it would be really nice if
you didn't TRY and make my

399
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:58,040
life so miserable, as you
apparently make everyone else's.

400
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,953
And what if I said I didn't want you here?

401
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:02,813
I'm not employed by you, I'm
employed by your mother.

402
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:05,429
So unless she says she doesn't
want me here anymore,

403
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,122
I'm staying.

404
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,635
Not because I care about you,

405
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,534
or particularly enjoy your company.

406
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:11,508
But because I need the money.

407
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,683
I really need the money.

408
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,448
Just put them in the drawer.

409
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,399
Hi, am I needed?

410
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:00,148
DVD weather, I think.

411
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,555
"Des Hommes et des dieux".

412
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,777
Something about men?

413
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:14,428
Yes, it's French gay porn.

414
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,702
You really don't enjoy sarcasm, do you?

415
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:19,894
The sarcasm is fine

416
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,818
I just don't like superiority.

417
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,347
You must hate me, then

418
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,266
I've never hated anyone.

419
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:30,837
Let me know

420
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,059
if you need anything.

421
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:35,117
Have you seen it?

422
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,743
I don't really like those kinds of films.

423
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:41,467
Those kinds of films?

424
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:42,983
Films with subtitles.

425
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:45,067
What, did your school
not teach you to read?

426
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,256
Sit down.

427
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,530
Watch with me, that's an order.

428
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,188
You have no choice!

429
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:55,364
Yes.

430
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:57,843
I do.

431
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,467
So?

432
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:23,856
Well, they could have left!

433
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,413
They chose to stay.

434
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,476
Yes, no I get it,

435
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:28,385
being there, gave their lives
more meaning, but that's

436
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:29,409
but you don't agree.

437
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:30,176
What?

438
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,854
To sacrifice themselves like that.

439
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,298
I mean, could you even imagine?

440
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:34,358
Did you like the film?

441
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,110
I loved it.

442
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,415
Oh, if you're laughing at me,

443
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,140
I swear to God I will push
you out of that chair.

444
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:42,478
I am not laughing at you.

445
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,331
The sky is clearing

446
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,511
should we get some air?

447
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:51,451
I am just amazed that you could
reach the ripe old age of

448
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,258
- what?
- 26.

449
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,270
26, and never have watched
a film with subtitles?

450
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,026
Oh? Well, I'm just amazed
that at the ripe old age of

451
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:03,440
31, without having been
locked in a cupboard

452
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,502
- for being such a snob.
- What?

453
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:07,910
E.T. is my favorite film.

454
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,948
E.T. is everyone's favorite film.

455
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,145
I've seen every Bond

456
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:12,357
sob's the world.

457
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:14,549
And I've got a soft spot for "Armageddon".

458
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,277
With Bruce Willis.

459
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:19,047
Oil driller. Has to save the
world from an asteroid.

460
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,010
And he does.

461
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
That's better.

462
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:22,269
So.

463
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,869
What do you do with yourself when
you are not here Louisa Clark?

464
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:29,028
I uh, spend time with my family and

465
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,497
I um, go to the pub.

466
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:33,221
Or I watch TV.

467
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:35,408
And I watch Patrick running.

468
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:36,628
Patrick's your boyfriend?

469
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:37,314
Yeah.

470
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,095
But you don't run with him?

471
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:41,831
I am not exactly built for it.

472
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:43,636
This is an impressive list of hobbies.

473
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,380
Well no, no, ok.

474
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:45,947
I read a bit.

475
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:48,149
And I, I like clothes.

476
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,086
You like.clothes.

477
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:53,710
I don't do much, okay?

478
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,988
I go to work, and I go home and that's it.

479
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,130
Wow, your life's even duller than mine.

480
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:06,419
He's in a good mood.

481
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:10,593
He told me all about you offering
him the pasta with green gravy.

482
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,202
He has never had pesto sauce before!

483
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,056
Whatever, it's all good.

484
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,315
It's a long time since
he's laughed at anything.

485
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:44,943
Hey.

486
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:49,109
Hello Mr. Traynor, how are you?

487
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,298
Nathan, what are they doing in there?

488
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:53,685
He has a check up every six months.

489
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,097
To see if he is getting better?

490
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,295
It's a spinal cord injury.

491
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:01,007
He's not going to get better.

492
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,326
But you do all those exercises with him.

493
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,921
Yes, to stop his muscles atrophying.

494
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:10,466
Will's body no longer worksbelow here.

495
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,496
But you're still trying, right?

496
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,417
He's threw everything into
physio in the first year.

497
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:19,560
And all we got was slight movement
from his thumb and finger.

498
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,906
Then the first bout of pneumonia hit

499
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,011
- and then autonomic dysreflexia.
- And what's that mean?

500
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,092
His blood pressure goes up and down?

501
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:28,674
Yeah.

502
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:30,209
He's constantly open to infection.

503
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,615
But there'smedical advances
taking place all the time, right?

504
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:34,996
Well, yeah.

505
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,240
But no one's worked out how
to fix the spinal cord yet.

506
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:48,415
HOME CINEMA THE RIVERSIDE

507
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:50,485
Oh I hear this one's good.

508
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:55,210
No, but it's got subtitles.

509
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:57,569
You don't even notice after a while.
Seriously.

510
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:00,460
Two for the Will Ferrell, please.

511
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,689
Is he okay?

512
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:32,038
He's not great.

513
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:33,372
A bit of a chill.

514
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:34,498
Where is Nathan?

515
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,243
I've called him. He'll be here soon.

516
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,282
Look, Camilla's had to go up to London.

517
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,460
Are you going to be alright?

518
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,646
- Of course.
- Yeah?

519
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:42,886
Yeah.

520
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:47,460
I'm on my mobile, if you need me.

521
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:48,690
Ok.

522
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,671
Will, can I do anything?

523
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,357
My pillows aren't right.

524
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:03,081
And what do I do?

525
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,131
Put your hand under my head.

526
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:07,928
On my neck and just lift gently.

527
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:09,298
Ok.

528
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,075
- Whoa! Jesus!
- What did I do?

529
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,938
Your hands are freezing.

530
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:27,282
Better.

531
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,235
Can I get you some pain killers?

532
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:34,207
- Yes.
- Thank You.

533
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,269
Ok.

534
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,550
Will?

535
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:00,536
Will!

536
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:05,688
Will! It's.

537
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:08,742
It's Lou.

538
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:12,344
I know.

539
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,256
Is there something I should be doing?

540
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:19,896
Some drugs or something? I'm just really
worried and I do not know what to do.

541
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,697
Hello, this is Stephen.

542
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,974
Please leave your name and
number and I'll call you back.

543
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,522
Hello Mr. Traynor. Its' Lou.

544
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,456
I am getting concerned about Will.

545
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,966
And I was wondering if you could just

546
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,904
call me back, ok thanks, bye.

547
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,571
Good day, this is Nathan.

548
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:55,445
Leave your message and I'll call you back.

549
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,441
- Don't ring Mum.
- What?

550
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,192
It will be fine, Clark.

551
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:14,642
Oy!

552
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,715
Sorry, I had to walk here.

553
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:18,810
It took ages with the bloody weather.

554
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,633
How are things?

555
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,375
Not great. He's in and out.

556
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:22,103
And he's not drunk anything.

557
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,166
How long has he been like this?!

558
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,402
Maybe four or five hours.

559
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,171
I called you, I did give him pain killers.

560
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:27,388
You might as well have given him M & Ms.

561
00:34:27,412 --> 00:34:29,095
Well he said that he just wanted to sleep.

562
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,365
This is all in the folder, Lou.

563
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,516
Will doesn't sweat the way we do.

564
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:35,362
If he gets even a slight chill,
his temperature goes haywire.

565
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,115
Yeah, but he said

566
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,996
bring us a fan and a damp towel, quick.

567
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:39,142
- Fast!
- Yeah.

568
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:42,109
Hey buddy, you alright?

569
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,702
Will? You alright?

570
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,979
Wait, focus Lou. You gotta
watch what I'm doing.

571
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,377
- Sorry.
- That's right.

572
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,727
Yeah.

573
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:58,932
He's gonna be okay.

574
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,469
VIDEO OF BIRTHDAY OF WILLY THE CRAZY

575
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:04,466
there are very few people
out there who can claim

576
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,312
they have out-Bonded James Bond.

577
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,831
But birthday boy Wild Willy, Will Traynor,

578
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,238
is certainly one of them.

579
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:12,360
Hey Will, any final thoughts, bro?

580
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,014
I'm thinking you should be next, mate.

581
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,038
Yeah, right!

582
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:19,766
We're all thinking it ..

583
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:22,114
Is there really nothing he can't do?

584
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,217
Do we hate him?

585
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:24,783
- Yes.
- We do!

586
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,828
But there's no point dwelling
on that on his birthday.

587
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:30,562
Thank God, he's not good looking.

588
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,994
Damn it!

589
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:38,150
You're not watching French gay porn, I hope.

590
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:41,933
The WiFi connection's not strong enough.

591
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,891
What time is it?

592
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:46,007
Where Is Nathan?

593
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:48,208
Half eight, had to see to another patient.

594
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,149
The snow got pretty bad.

595
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:55,468
Shouldn't you be at home?

596
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:58,966
You're stuck with me.

597
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,126
Will, can I ask you something?

598
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,651
I suspect you're going to.

599
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:13,451
What happened?

600
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:15,101
My Mother didn't tell you?

601
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,786
It's her favorite story.

602
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,579
It was some sort of traffic accident.

603
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:18,632
Motorbike.

604
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,261
You were riding a motorbike?

605
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,330
Actually I wasn't.

606
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,471
The bike, hit me.

607
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,244
I am sorry.

608
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,547
Sorry, I'm being chatty again.

609
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:33,608
And you, you need to rest.

610
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,792
No.

611
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:37,126
Stay.

612
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:39,337
Tell me.

613
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:41,036
Tell me something good.

614
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:42,948
I used to say that to my Dad!

615
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:46,076
But if I told you what he said
back, you'd think I was insane.

616
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:48,228
That ship already sailed Clark.

617
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:51,239
When had nightmares or
something, he used to sing.

618
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,470
Go on.

619
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,913
He used to sing the Malahonkey song.

620
00:37:54,943 --> 00:37:55,735
What?

621
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,377
The Malahonkey song. I
thought everyone knew it.

622
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,579
Trust me Clark

623
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:01,633
I am a Malahonkey virgin.

624
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,319
You're gonna make me sing it now?

625
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:17,382
I willillillillished, I lillillillillived
in the Malalalahonkey land

626
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:21,678
the lalalalaland where..

627
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:24,928
So I lalala L-I could plalalalalay

628
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,035
you're insane.

629
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,689
Your' whole family's insane.

630
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,092
And you're a god awful singer.

631
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,671
Maybe Dad was better.

632
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:32,722
I think what you mean to say is.

633
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:35,228
Thank you Miss Clark, for
attempting to entertain me.

634
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,634
Okay, Clark.

635
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:39,696
Tell me something else.

636
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,694
Something that doesn't involve singing.

637
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:43,299
- About?
- Anything.

638
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:46,044
Well

639
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,301
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies.

640
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:55,655
And I refused to take them off.

641
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,623
I wore them in bed

642
00:38:57,653 --> 00:38:59,244
in the bath

643
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,405
all summer long.

644
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:02,880
My favorite outfit was

645
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,531
the glittery boots and my bumblebee tights.

646
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:07,127
Bumblebee tights?

647
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:08,056
Black and yellow stripes.

648
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:09,189
Oh dear God!

649
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:12,406
And I really really really
liked having stripy legs.

650
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,589
And what happened to these gorgeous wellies
..

651
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,901
And the stripy tights?

652
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:17,529
Ah, I outgrew them.

653
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,256
It broke my heart.

654
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,887
And they don't make those tights anymore.

655
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:22,147
At least not for grown women anyway.

656
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,242
Strange, that?

657
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:24,267
Oh, you can mock!

658
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:26,043
Didn't you ever love anything that much?

659
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:29,829
Yes.

660
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:32,294
Yes, I did.

661
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:55,932
MARIAN KEYES SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS

662
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:15,086
interesting choice of footwear.

663
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:19,444
Patrick says, that I make it look
like a leprechaun drag queen.

664
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:20,607
He was being nice.

665
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,725
Don't smile at me like that.

666
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:24,121
Why not?

667
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,853
Because I do not know what it means.

668
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,226
Where did you pick up your exotic taste?

669
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:29,281
What do you mean by that?

670
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:30,391
It can't be from around here.

671
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:31,082
Why not?

672
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:35,202
Because this is the kind of place people come
to when they got tired of actually living.

673
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,766
People here believe think excitement

674
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:39,558
is a new 'please be quiet'
sign going up in the library.

675
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:41,599
You should be out there,

676
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:43,128
claiming the world as your own.

677
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,665
Showing your leprechaun shoes to dodgy men.

678
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,198
I like my life.

679
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:47,875
You like everything.

680
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:48,781
I'm happy here.

681
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:49,863
Well you shouldn't be.

682
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:52,319
You want me to be more like
the girls you know, do you?

683
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,702
Who go to London,

684
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:55,460
to marry someone like Rupert.

685
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,699
I believe he's taken.

686
00:40:56,729 --> 00:41:00,219
And ignore the fact that he's shagging
his secretary within five years.

687
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,751
And bitch about him at dinner parties,

688
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,069
knowing that won't leave because
he's scared of the alimony.

689
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:06,188
And have sex once every six weeks,

690
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:07,710
And listen to him going on and on about,

691
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,535
how much he adores the children.

692
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:12,230
While doing nothing to
actually take care of them.

693
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,865
And have perfect hair.

694
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,572
That get this kind of pinched face

695
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,662
and never saying what you actually mean!

696
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:20,220
And develop an insane Pilates habit.

697
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,652
And buy a dog or a horse.

698
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,305
And develop a crush on
the riding instructor.

699
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,620
And would that your husband,

700
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,812
take up jogging when he hits 40.

701
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,040
And buy a Harley.

702
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,492
And know that every day,

703
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,789
he goes into the office,

704
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,071
and looks at the young men

705
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,909
and feels like somehow he got suckered.

706
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,183
And leave him anyway.

707
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:37,126
And come back here.

708
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:39,299
To give the children a happy childhood.
whoa.

709
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:43,618
There were a lot of divorced
handovers at the cafe.

710
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:44,854
I am sorry.

711
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:46,688
How did you end up in that cafe?

712
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:49,180
Trina made a bet that I couldn't get a job

713
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,259
in 24 hrs.

714
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,749
I proved her wrong.

715
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:52,915
And you stayed there six years.

716
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:53,640
Way to go!

717
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,894
I was supposed to leave.

718
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:57,940
I had a place at Manchester.

719
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,130
What you were going to study?

720
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:00,909
Fashion!!

721
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:03,535
And why didn't you go?

722
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:08,944
Do you know what I see when I look at you?

723
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,373
Do not say potential.

724
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,439
Potential.

725
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:14,549
You have to widen your horizons Clark.

726
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,105
You only get one life.

727
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:19,437
And it is actually your duty to
live it as fully as possible.

728
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:23,881
Well you, you need a shave.

729
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:26,066
If that beard gets any longer,
I'll be picking food out of it.

730
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,357
And I'll have to sue you

731
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,926
for undue distress in the workplace.

732
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:31,027
You're changing the subject.

733
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,614
Yeah, I am.

734
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,360
Fine.

735
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:37,565
I'll let you.

736
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,179
You're really going to do this?

737
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,607
I'm, uh,

738
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:47,464
really going to do this.

739
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:49,119
My mother will be so happy.

740
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:50,480
Yes, well.

741
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:53,032
We won't let that put us off.

742
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:35,678
You've got a funny look on your face.

743
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:38,627
Please do not tell me you
shaved off my eyebrows.

744
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:40,588
Only the one.

745
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:48,844
Freedom?! You call this 'freedom'?!

746
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:50,008
We all agreed to it

747
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,864
not the specifics, Jesus!

748
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,535
We made an agreement with Will.

749
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:57,465
Six months.

750
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:00,184
No, I only agreed so
that we had six months,

751
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,360
to change his mind.

752
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:02,688
I can not believe.

753
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:05,414
That you are willing to
help our son end his life!

754
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:06,562
I'd rather that,

755
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:09,071
than risk him trying it again, alone.

756
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,698
It wasn't a cry for help, Camilla,

757
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,566
he meant it and you know that.

758
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:15,169
And this way we can be with him,

759
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:17,064
supporting him.

760
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:18,144
Loving him.

761
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,269
He's my son!

762
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,015
Yes, he's my son, too!!

763
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:23,280
It's his choice.

764
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:24,812
And this is what he wants.

765
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,945
You know how much pain he's in.

766
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,554
God!

767
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:43,371
He gave me six months.

768
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,023
We can still persuade him.

769
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:50,592
And do you think the pretty
waitress is going to do that?

770
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:57,375
Now.

771
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:59,621
Can I have the letter, please?

772
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:03,584
Please?

773
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:13,477
DIGNITAS

774
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,687
Apparently, the shave was your idea.

775
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:22,943
Nice one, looks great!

776
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:33,295
Bye!

777
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,871
I need you.

778
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:53,445
I know that we need the money,

779
00:45:53,452 --> 00:45:54,896
but this is horrible!

780
00:45:55,374 --> 00:45:57,777
I'm basically just on suicide watch.

781
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,707
I am not going back.

782
00:46:00,312 --> 00:46:02,161
Yeah - What?

783
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,735
C'mon, say it.

784
00:46:05,772 --> 00:46:07,366
I was thinking about him.

785
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:10,731
Lou, you can't leave him.

786
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,516
They've got money, right?

787
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:14,780
I do not want their money!

788
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,743
No, not for you, idiot girl.

789
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,773
Look.

790
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:20,537
If this is what he really wants

791
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:24,532
the use the time he's got left.
Make it special

792
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,186
ask the Traynors for a budget.

793
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,798
And go crazy, organize, I dunno

794
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,085
swimming with dolphins, skydiving.

795
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:35,160
A nice sexy lap dance?

796
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,042
City-boys always like a lap dance.

797
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:38,072
Katrina Clark!

798
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:39,931
A bucket list.

799
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:43,191
Show him how good this time can be.

800
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:45,544
Take him to places, make him laugh.

801
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:48,763
Bloody hell!

802
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:52,232
But Trina, what if

803
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:54,711
that list could do more than that?

804
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:57,180
What if it could make him change his mind?

805
00:46:57,584 --> 00:47:00,092

Will's barely left the house in two years

810
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,722
- and we have tried.
- Yes, but we haven't succeeded.

811
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,895
If Louisa can come up with
things that Will is able

812
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:45,655
and prepared to do, then that's
all for the good, surely!

813
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:48,221
Sports, concerts

814
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,529
I'd love to see him do any of these things.

815
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,949
Okay, okay.

816
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,971
Louisa, if you can get me a schedule

817
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:55,749
I'll see if I can shift
things around in my diary.

818
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,853
No!

819
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:59,141
Let do it for himself.

820
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:02,455

Okay.

823
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:37,332
Alright.

824
00:48:38,025 --> 00:48:41,223
Oh my God! What have you come as?

825
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:42,282
I don't care what you think.

826
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:45,031
Even if you have got... a new haircut!

827
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:46,546
You look like a mad woman.

828
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,318
An oddly cheerful mad woman.

829
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:51,651
We're taking Nathan to
see the horse racing.

830
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:53,435
The horse racing?

831
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:54,859
Yes, Nathan's never been.

832
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:57,046
Yes, it is true.

833
00:48:57,076 --> 00:48:59,690
And besides, I've got five pounds.

834
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,868
On Man Oh Man at eight to one.

835

My Dad's mate Jimmy ..

836
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:05,017
Said that he's a sure thing.

837
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:06,493
Just a wild guess

838
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:09,044
you haven't been racing before
either, have you, Clark?

839
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:13,946
There is a perfect spot!

840
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:16,247
Right, we're so lucky!

841
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:18,821
Are you sure this isn't going to sink?

842
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,085
No, it's fine. It's gonna be great.

843
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:23,107
Thanks. That's alright

844
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:24,137
yeah.

845
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:26,923
Um.

846
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:28,729
What.

847
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:29,759
We need to push.

848
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,534
Okay.

849
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,559
Whoa sorry!

850
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,235
Don't worry, it's only cashmere.

851
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,338
Yeah, it's stuck.

852
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:40,586
It's fine, it's gonna be fine.

853
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,274
- Oh, excuse me!
- Okay?

854
00:49:42,504 --> 00:49:44,069
Hi. Hi.

855
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:44,638
Sorry.

856
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:46,697
Do you..would you be
able to help us with the.

857
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,100
'Cause we're a bit stuck.

858
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:49,465
- We're fine.
- We are not fine.

859
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,453
You're very kind

860
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,483
carefully!!

861
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:56,513
How are we doing?
We're doing well, doing well.

862
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:57,444
Brilliant!

863
00:49:57,612 --> 00:49:59,372
I thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.

864
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,476
Thanks guys. Thank You.

865
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:03,206
You Guys, we're here! It's gonna be fun!

866
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:09,379
Look! Look, look, look, look! There he is.

867
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,758
Don't you think he looks like a sure thing?

868
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:13,480
Huh, Will?

869
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:14,900
You're going to lose.

870
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,583
How would you know that?

871
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,596
His ears are flat, his coat is dull.

872
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:19,972
And he's got a funny walk.

873
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,552
Great.

874
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:23,874
So you know everything
about horse racing, too.

875
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:24,519
No.

876
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:27,013
I just look, process information.

877
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:28,154
And I make decisions.

878
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:30,892
And that horse is definitely
not going to win.

879
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:32,787
Yeah, well, I like him.

880
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:34,754
Sometimes you just have
to go with your gut.

881
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:37,481
I'm gonna go and place my bet.

882
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,715
They're lining up at the gate now.

883
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:51,670
The start is on us

884
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,914
and they're off!

885
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,490
Man o Mann, apparently took the day off.

886
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,470
Whoa, this is nice!

887
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,964
Yes, nothing like being
spoon fed in public.

888
00:51:12,994 --> 00:51:15,189
Hello, we want a table for three, please.

889
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,180
Of course, if I could just see your badge?

890
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,084
Sorry?

891
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:20,442
This restaurant is for
Premier badge holders.

892
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:21,578
Oh, well we.

893
00:51:21,608 --> 00:51:23,596
We've got the pink badges.

894
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:26,780
I'm sorry, we can only serve
Premier badge holders

895
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,841
okay, are there any other restaurants?

896
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:32,676
Well, there's our relaxed dining area.

897
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:34,554
And there are stalls outside.

898
00:51:34,685 --> 00:51:35,804
The Pig In A Poke

899
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,992
does a nice hot roast in a bun..

900
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:39,475
With applesauce.

901
00:51:39,856 --> 00:51:42,393
Sharon, can I call Sharon?

902
00:51:42,423 --> 00:51:43,027
So it's

903
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:45,614
a quiet Monday afternoon and you've,

904
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,886
got a lot of empty tables.

905
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:51,019
We want to buy a really expensive meal.

906
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:52,673
And we do not want to eat
pork rolls in a stall

907
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:55,264
even with applesauce!

908
00:51:55,294 --> 00:51:57,923
I am very sorry, you need
a premier are badge,

909
00:51:57,953 --> 00:51:58,456
it's the policy.

910
00:51:58,503 --> 00:51:59,278
Ok, ok, ok.

911
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:00,318
So how much

912
00:52:00,348 --> 00:52:02,216
for a premier area badge?

913
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,390
What would you like, another
ten more, perhaps twenty.

914
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:06,248
We don't sell badges madam.

915
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,651
This is a restaurant!

916
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:10,023
You will need to go to the
ticket office to buy it.

917
00:52:10,323 --> 00:52:11,515
Louisa?

918
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:12,472
Let's go.

919
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:13,740
No, no, no! This is not fair!

920
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,967
We've come all this way!

921
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,239
Louisa?

922
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,019
I'm not hungry.

923
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:20,383
No! I'm just gonna run and get the badges.

924
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:22,399
And then we will have our meal.

925
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:24,269
And you will see that we
we'll be fine once we've eaten.

926
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:25,522
- Yeah.
- Lou?

927
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:27,681
I think that Will wants to go home.

928
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:35,611
Do you know what, Sharon?

929
00:52:36,325 --> 00:52:38,510
You can stick your premier badge

930
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:41,347
right up your relaxed dining area

931
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,115
okay? Okay.

932
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:45,368
Everything's fine.

933
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:03,068
Great so we're going to

934
00:53:03,092 --> 00:53:05,108
paralyze your eardrums as well, now?

935
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:12,949
So maybe horse racing

936
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:14,642
wasn't my best idea.

937
00:53:18,037 --> 00:53:20,434
But this I think you'll enjoy.

938
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,300
So Nathan's never been to a
classical music concert, now?

939
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,593
No, I haven't.

940
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:28,782
Will you please come with me?

941
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:32,199
I bought the tickets a week ago.

942
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:33,941
You can say no.

943
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,807
A wind concerto?

944
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:38,584
I've been assured it
doesn't involve farting.

945
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:41,650
There's not chance of Jay-Z?

946
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:44,383
Sadly, his tickets had just sold out.

947
00:53:47,844 --> 00:53:49,533
Mozart it is then.

948
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:57,816
Okay, would this

949
00:53:58,557 --> 00:54:00,943
be the right sort of thing
to wear to a concert?

950
00:54:01,392 --> 00:54:03,250
Metallica no.

951
00:54:03,643 --> 00:54:04,987
Neil Diamond possibly.

952
00:54:05,436 --> 00:54:06,836
I thought Pat was training tonight?

953
00:54:07,102 --> 00:54:08,442
Oh no, he is, he is

954
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,184
I'm taking Will to a concert.

955
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,887
Sorry, you're going on a date?

956
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:14,802
It's, it's too 'booby'?

957
00:54:14,832 --> 00:54:15,962
Way too booby!

958
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:18,473
Given it's a man for whom your
boobs are mostly eye level.

959
00:54:19,077 --> 00:54:20,978
Oh! You're SO annoying!

960
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,372
You are SO going on a
date with Will Traynor.

961
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:26,504
Get the red dress out.

962
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:28,155
Really?

963
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:32,320
Oh, kapow!

964
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:41,675
Lose the scarf.

965
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:43,286
The scarf why?

966
00:54:43,623 --> 00:54:45,583
If you are going to wear
a dress like that, Clark.

967
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,189
You have to wear it with confidence.

968
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,696
Only you, Will Traynor

969
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,980
would tell a woman how
to wear a bloody dress

970
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:05,516
here.

971
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:11,290
- Am I good?
- Yes.

972
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,625
Yes, yes...

973
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:25,309
Is everything okay?

974
00:55:28,146 --> 00:55:30,480
Actually no, there's something
digging into my collar.

975
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:36,596
It's the tag.

976
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:38,651
Have we got any scissors in the bag?

977
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:40,443
I do not know, Clark.

978
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:42,234
Believe it or not, I rarely
pack it myself.

979
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,359
Okay then.

980
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:50,027
Got it!

981
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:52,638
Just be grateful that
wasn't in your trousers!

982
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,088
Look it, they're starting!

983
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:42,189
So you're not a classical
music person, then?

984
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:43,219
Hated every minute.

985
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:44,282
Yes, I could tell.

986
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:47,203
Especially during that oboe solo.

987
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:48,766
There was something in my eye.

988
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:51,854
I loved it.

989
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:54,232
Did you?

990
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:57,732
Yeah.

991
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:02,963
- Right, we're gonna get you in.
- Wait a minute, Clark.

992
00:57:02,993 --> 00:57:03,993
Are you okay?

993
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:05,324
I am.

994
00:57:06,446 --> 00:57:07,909
I don't want to go in yet.

995
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,515
I just want to be a man
who's been to a concert,

996
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:14,745
with a girl in a red dress.

997
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:20,261
Just a few minutes more.

998
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,705
So, um

999
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:56,481
Patrick, wants to meet you.

1000
00:57:57,612 --> 00:57:58,900
'Running Man'? Why?

1001
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:01,983
I think he wants to know who I'm
spending all these late nights with.

1002
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:04,178
My parents do too.

1003
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:06,541
I get nervous when I a girl
asks me to meet her parents.

1004
00:58:07,765 --> 00:58:09,562
They wanted me to invite you to my birthday

1005
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:12,141
dinner next Thursday, but don't worry.

1006
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,411
I said you wouldn't want to go.

1007
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:14,479
Why?

1008
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:17,416
Because you hate strangers and don't
like eating in front of people

1009
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,100
it seemed pretty obvious.

1010
00:58:20,156 --> 00:58:23,111
I'll come, if you want me to.

1011
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:29,828
Ah, lads Welcome!

1012
00:58:29,862 --> 00:58:30,862
Bernard Clark.

1013
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:33,543
I am sorry, I didn't, I didn't

1014
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:35,719
a curtsy will be fine.

1015
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:41,703
A curtsy, nice one!

1016
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,440
This is Josie, my wife.

1017
00:58:43,537 --> 00:58:44,537
- Hello.
- Hello.

1018
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:45,674
Come on in.

1019
00:58:45,704 --> 00:58:47,225
Yes, c'mon.

1020
00:58:47,255 --> 00:58:48,595
Thank You.

1021
00:58:48,914 --> 00:58:50,216
Listen, have fun.

1022
00:58:51,248 --> 00:58:52,320
Thank You!

1023
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:58,329
Lord, thank you for the food we eat.

1024
00:58:58,359 --> 00:58:59,718
And the company we keep.

1025
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,981
Thank you for the
opportunities that give us.

1026
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:04,207
And the strength to face the challenges,

1027
00:59:04,237 --> 00:59:05,597
we meet on our journey.

1028
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:08,131
Amen.

1029
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,989
- Amen.
- Amen.

1030
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:15,853
So, Will.

1031
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,105
You bought and sold companies?

1032
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,880
Something like that.

1033
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:23,596
Would you know this fella, Alan Stonehouse?

1034
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:25,152
The one who, um,

1035
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:26,948
what is it?

1036
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:29,456
Asset stripped our firm?

1037
00:59:30,185 --> 00:59:31,991
I'm afraid I trained him.

1038
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,351
Oh! Well, that's the door.

1039
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:42,852
Would you like chicken, love?

1040
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:49,410
Six miles, in 28 minutes!

1041
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,487
And um.

1042
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:51,940
Happy birthday to my girlfriend!

1043
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,512
Yes, happy birthday.

1044
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,253
- Sorry a bit late.
- No, only

1045
00:59:57,256 --> 00:59:58,482
28 minutes.

1046
01:00:00,784 --> 01:00:02,220
So, couldn't you go back to it, Will?
I mean, clearly you're

1047
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:04,469
still sharp as a tack.

1048
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:05,861
- Dad!
- No, it's fine.

1049
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:08,805
The truth is that I thought
that I could crack this

1050
01:00:08,835 --> 01:00:10,586
and then go back as if nothing had changed.

1051
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:12,582
I was wrong.

1052
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,594
This is delicious, Mrs. Clark.

1053
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:17,671
Oh, Josie, please!

1054
01:00:17,753 --> 01:00:19,721
Well, we wanted to make today special.

1055
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:22,004
Wish Trina could have been here.

1056
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,583
She's the brains of the family.

1057
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,994
She got put up two years at
school, didn't she, Bernard?

1058
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,550
Overtook our Lou.

1059
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,800
Not bright enough to to stop
herself getting up the duff.

1060
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,453
Pat, should I help you
to some more chicken?

1061
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,583
So, Patrick?

1062
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,479
Louisa told me that
you're a personal trainer.

1063
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,538
Life coaching, physical training.

1064
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:47,357
Motivation.

1065
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:50,217
Local young entrepreneur of
the year, two years running!

1066
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,943
Lou told me that you were a
bit of action man, before.

1067
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:53,461
Pat?

1068
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:55,754
I bet you if we got you on a fitness regime.

1069
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:58,307
There is actually a Swedish study
that says that you can train muscles

1070
01:00:58,331 --> 01:00:59,331
Patrick.

1071
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:01,132
What?

1072
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:02,339
Just trying to.

1073
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:03,687
Yes, but don't.

1074
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,359
I will bear that in mind.

1075
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:08,158
Thank You.

1076
01:01:11,645 --> 01:01:15,750
Happy birthday to you.

1077
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,288
Happy Birthday, to you.

1078
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,385
Happy Birthday, Dear Lou.

1079
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:28,088
Yay!

1080
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,928
Um, So I just wanted to say

1081
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,557
we're very proud of you, love.

1082
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,553
And um, I don't know what

1083
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,725
we would have done without
you, this past year.

1084
01:01:39,755 --> 01:01:41,035
Oh Dad!

1085
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:44,405
And Will, thank you for employing her.

1086
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:47,062
- Someone had to Hey!
- Hey!

1087
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:49,671
The pleasure has been all mine, really.

1088
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:51,579
Here.

1089
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:53,552
It's not much, but.

1090
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:56,572
Granddad saw something on TV
about making your own presents.

1091
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:05,459
Oh, granddad, thank you!

1092
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:07,366
Thank You!

1093
01:02:08,363 --> 01:02:11,887
9 months - LOU 4 years.

1094
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:13,554
I love it.

1095
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:14,845
Oh Mom, thank you!

1096
01:02:15,254 --> 01:02:16,560
Thank You!

1097
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:18,054
Mine, next.

1098
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:24,418
Open it.

1099
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,668
I had it made, specially.

1100
01:02:31,961 --> 01:02:34,246
Thank you, Patrick!

1101
01:02:41,143 --> 01:02:43,838
There's something for
you in my bag as well.

1102
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:45,239
You got Lou a present?

1103
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:47,039
That's very kind of you!

1104
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:49,390
- Isn't that kind, Bernard?
- That's very kind.

1105
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:54,751
Okay.

1106
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:08,876
Oh, Oh my God, I don't believe it!

1107
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:10,978
What?

1108
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:13,108
But where did you get them!?

1109
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,006
That is a secret.

1110
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:16,668
Tights?

1111
01:03:16,717 --> 01:03:19,064
Only the best pair of tights, ever!

1112
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:21,704
I am going to try them on!

1113
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:26,610
Oh! I can't tell you how much I love them.

1114
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:28,942
Really, thanks.

1115
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:37,377
Okay, you can give a kiss.

1116
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:39,754
Thank you, Josie.

1117
01:03:40,811 --> 01:03:42,131
It was good to meet you all.

1118
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:44,227
And Patrick, thank you for the, um,

1119
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,354
fitness advice.

1120
01:03:47,746 --> 01:03:50,011
Just helping my girlfriend
get the best out of her job.

1121
01:03:50,355 --> 01:03:51,857
You're a lucky man.

1122
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,936
She certainly gives a good bed bath.

1123
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,840
- Well done!
- Pleased me.

1124
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:15,444
So

1125
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,811
I could take you to a Shakespeare Festival

1126
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:19,118
happens today and tomorrow.

1127
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:21,015
Or there is a sculpture park we can visit.

1128
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,318
Or there is there's wine tasting.

1129
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:24,723
This came.

1130
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,797
'Wedding of Alicia Annabell Dewares
and Rupert Christopher Collins

1131
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,346
can I take YOU somewhere?

1132
01:04:37,243 --> 01:04:38,679
The first kiss I ever had,

1133
01:04:38,732 --> 01:04:39,871
was on that rampart.

1134
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:42,583
Probably didn't hurt that
you owned the castle.

1135
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,735
Ah, maybe I should have told her.

1136
01:04:45,067 --> 01:04:46,162
She dumped me a week later,

1137
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,898
for a boy who worked at the local shop.

1138
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,886
You're never gonna fit through there!

1139
01:04:58,278 --> 01:04:59,411
Ah, wow, it's amazing!

1140
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:00,758
Will! Will!

1141
01:05:00,945 --> 01:05:02,001
No, please!

1142
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:04,882
- Will, stop!
- Are you coming!?

1143
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,250
It's a very bad idea.

1144
01:05:10,052 --> 01:05:11,635
It's very dangerous.

1145
01:05:12,754 --> 01:05:14,925
It's very, very high.

1146
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:19,981
And windy

1147
01:05:22,141 --> 01:05:25,122
when I was a kid, this was
my favorite place in the whole world.

1148
01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:28,929
Did you walk around up here,
pretending to be a warrior prince?

1149
01:05:29,562 --> 01:05:31,588
Even knicked a sword
from one of the exhibits.

1150
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,985
Weighed a ton.

1151
01:05:34,617 --> 01:05:37,682
I think that this would
still be my favorite spot.

1152
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,352
That's because you haven't been anywhere.

1153
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,909
Ah, so where's better than this, then?

1154
01:05:42,996 --> 01:05:44,419
Val-d'Isere?

1155
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,170
Paris.

1156
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,546
Place d'Auphine, right
next to the Pont Neuf.

1157
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:55,096
Sitting outside a cafe
with a strong, coffee

1158
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:57,316
and a croissant warm, with unsalted butter

1159
01:05:57,346 --> 01:05:58,122
and strawberry jam.

1160
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,074
So let's go!

1161
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:00,601
We could get on the EuroStar

1162
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:01,582
right now!

1163
01:06:01,617 --> 01:06:03,370
- No.
- But you just said.

1164
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,864
You don't get it, Clark.

1165
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,328
I want to be in Paris, as me.

1166
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:10,000
The old me.

1167
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,954
When pretty French girls, give me the eye.

1168
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:14,704
That could be something to look forward to.

1169
01:06:16,232 --> 01:06:17,795
If I shut my eyes now,

1170
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,372
I know exactly how it feels
to be in that little square.

1171
01:06:23,073 --> 01:06:24,982
I remember every sensation.

1172
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,515
I do not want those memories erased,

1173
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:31,432
by the struggle to fit behind a table.

1174
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:35,296
The taxi drivers, who refuse to take me.

1175
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,049
And my wheelchair power pack that

1176
01:06:37,053 --> 01:06:38,727
won't charge in a French socket.

1177
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:46,951
But I tell you where we will go, though.

1178
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,925
Where?

1179
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:50,798
Alicia's wedding.

1180
01:06:50,827 --> 01:06:51,827
Really?

1181
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,343
Will you come with me?

1182
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,437
If you want me to.

1183
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:02,672
Hello?

1184
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:06,093
Whoa! Jesus Mum, hello!

1185
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:08,179
Is it too much? Oh, sod it, I don't care!

1186
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:10,568
We are celebrating Lou!

1187
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:12,209
I've got a job!

1188
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:14,821
Oh Dad, that is fantastic!

1189
01:07:14,938 --> 01:07:15,701
You are looking

1190
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,171
at the new head of maintenance

1191
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:18,599
at the castle.

1192
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,566
God, that is - I know, I know.

1193
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,705
Mr. Traynor rang me himself.

1194
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:25,341
I'm starting tomorrow morning.

1195
01:07:25,472 --> 01:07:26,363
A month's trial.

1196
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:27,279
Isn't it brilliant?

1197
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,439
And it's good money, Lou.

1198
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:30,508
And he get's his own van.

1199
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,250
- See you.
- Okay.

1200
01:07:35,947 --> 01:07:38,025
But I thought you would be pleased.

1201
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,375
No, I am, I am pleased.

1202
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:42,365
I just, I don't know, I feel weird.

1203
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:44,245
Well, don't.

1204
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:47,336
Your dad needed a job and I
needed a head of maintenance.

1205
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:50,375
Yes, but it is the timing, it's just a bit

1206
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:51,886
it's good.

1207
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:53,701
Your dad will be great.

1208
01:07:54,132 --> 01:07:56,014
And, it means

1209
01:07:56,045 --> 01:07:57,261
it means what?

1210
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:58,925
It means

1211
01:07:58,955 --> 01:08:01,174
that one day, you can go
off and spread your wings

1212
01:08:01,204 --> 01:08:02,947
without worrying about everyone else.

1213
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,018
Put yourself first, for once.

1214
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:15,344
Hello.

1215
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:16,849
Michael Lawler.

1216
01:08:16,879 --> 01:08:18,302
I'm here to see Mr Traynor.

1217
01:08:18,332 --> 01:08:19,885
Ah, no no, you've got the wrong door.

1218
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:21,459
- He lives in the.
- It's okay, Clark.

1219
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,641
How was traffic Michael?

1220
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:25,461
Y'know, once you're out of London.

1221
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:26,821
We'll sit in the courtyard.

1222
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,772
You can leave us, thanks Clark.

1223
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:33,244
- How have you been?
- Well, thank you.

1224
01:08:57,456 --> 01:09:00,806
I thought he seemed happier,
he was smiling, laughing.

1225
01:09:00,832 --> 01:09:01,832
Me, too.

1226
01:09:03,242 --> 01:09:04,331
Thank you, for telling me.

1227
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:14,419
You will look after him at
the wedding, won't you?

1228
01:09:27,688 --> 01:09:29,385
I still don't know why we're doing this.

1229
01:09:29,561 --> 01:09:31,297
We going to behave, admirably.

1230
01:09:31,518 --> 01:09:32,523
Just so you know

1231
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:34,247
that if you do the "My Left Foot" thing

1232
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,114
I will drive home and leave you stuck here.

1233
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:37,458
With all your ex-girlfriends.

1234
01:09:38,015 --> 01:09:39,345
Spoil sport.

1235
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:23,888
Will, hi.

1236
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:26,490
It's so good to see you again.

1237
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:28,078
The office is not the same without you.

1238
01:10:28,138 --> 01:10:29,982
One minute you were there,
running everything and everyone.

1239
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,495
And the next.

1240
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,019
Well, it's, uh, not the same.

1241
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:34,767
It's kind of you to say so, Freddie.

1242
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,226
Louisa Clark, Freddie Foster.

1243
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:40,215
Yes, yes, I saw you at the church.

1244
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:42,924
Life isn't all bad then, eh, will.i.am!

1245
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:45,674
Anyway, anyway, must mingle.

1246
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:46,342
What a pleasure to see you.

1247
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:47,931
And you, Miss Clark.

1248
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,707
He's a nice guy.

1249
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:53,590
He fancies you.

1250
01:10:53,736 --> 01:10:54,925
He needs glasses.

1251
01:10:54,955 --> 01:10:56,026
Don't do that.

1252
01:10:57,538 --> 01:10:58,964
You look beautiful.

1253
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:02,428
Well, you don't look so shabby yourself.

1254
01:11:04,402 --> 01:11:05,822
Ladies and gentlemen,

1255
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:08,255
I give you, the bride and groom,

1256
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:11,510
Mr and Mrs Rupert Collins!

1257
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,069
Whoa God!

1258
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:35,677
There ought to be a law against
Englishmen on dance floors.

1259
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:39,923
- Bride or Groom?
- Oh, neither.

1260
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:42,273
And you?

1261
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:44,052
Godmother to the bride.

1262
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,038
What makes me morally responsible for her.

1263
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:48,206
Not one of my finer acts.

1264
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,506
Ooh, you don't think much of her then?

1265
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:52,716
This is a bit depressing!

1266
01:11:53,578 --> 01:11:55,505
Still, I can't do these things, sober.

1267
01:11:56,621 --> 01:11:58,903
Oh no, wait, there's alcohol in this stuff?

1268
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,552
Absolutely, darling.

1269
01:12:00,829 --> 01:12:03,227
And I firmly encourage you to get as drunk

1270
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:04,373
as possible.

1271
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,629
I hear rumors that the father of the bride

1272
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:09,051
is going to inflict another speech on us.

1273
01:12:09,165 --> 01:12:10,026
Oh, no no no!

1274
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:11,954
I'm supposed to be driving Will home.

1275
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:14,660
Ah yes, young Will.

1276
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:16,535
He was her chance, you know.

1277
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,851
Only one of that lot,
that was worth a damn.

1278
01:12:18,882 --> 01:12:20,854
Terrible shame.

1279
01:12:21,105 --> 01:12:22,105
He is not dead.

1280
01:12:22,156 --> 01:12:23,733
No I mean for her, not for him.

1281
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:25,807
Rupert's an asshole.

1282
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:27,693
You take care of him,

1283
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:29,870
He's a good one.

1284
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,820
Take it from one who knows.

1285
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:33,826
Four marriages and counting.

1286
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:55,624
Thank you so much for coming, Will.

1287
01:12:55,883 --> 01:12:58,283
It was a lovely day,
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1288
01:12:59,186 --> 01:13:01,773
- You remember Louisa?
- Oh yeah, yes, yes.

1289
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:04,607
Anyway, you're a real star for being here.

1290
01:13:04,936 --> 01:13:06,257
And thank you for

1291
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:09,577
the um, um - the mirror.

1292
01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:11,751
Yes, the mirror. Absolutely
love that mirror.

1293
01:13:12,653 --> 01:13:13,727
Anyway, thank you.

1294
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:18,321
You didn't buy her a mirror!

1295
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:19,441
I know.

1296
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:21,012
Okay, you.

1297
01:13:22,617 --> 01:13:25,006
What do you say, you gonna give me a whirl?

1298
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:26,282
What?

1299
01:13:26,326 --> 01:13:27,602
How many of those did you drink?

1300
01:13:27,626 --> 01:13:28,288
C'mon!

1301
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,615
Let's give these tossers
something to talk about.

1302
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:31,956
Alright.

1303
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:38,093
Are they all appalled?

1304
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:39,555
Yes.

1305
01:13:40,993 --> 01:13:42,312
Yes!

1306
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:44,877
Move closer?

1307
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:46,315
You smell fantastic.

1308
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:50,205
You know, you never would have
let those breasts so near to me,

1309
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:52,085
if I wasn't in a wheelchair.

1310
01:13:52,089 --> 01:13:53,489
Yes, well

1311
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,349
you never would have been
lookin' at these breasts,

1312
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:56,961
if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.

1313
01:13:56,973 --> 01:13:58,777
- Of course I would!
- No, you wouldn't.

1314
01:13:58,808 --> 01:13:59,474
You wouldn't.

1315
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,604
You would have been too busy
looking at the leggy blondes.

1316
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:04,914
The ones who can smell an
expense account at 40 paces.

1317
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:06,876
And anyway, I would have been over there

1318
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:07,924
serving the drinks,

1319
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:09,507
One of the invisibles.

1320
01:14:09,537 --> 01:14:10,755
Am I right?

1321
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,327
Yes, but in my defense

1322
01:14:13,677 --> 01:14:15,364
- I was an ass.
- Yup.

1323
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,059
Do you know something, Clark?

1324
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:22,491
You are pretty much.

1325
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,861
The only thing that makes me
want to get up in the morning.

1326
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:27,211
Then let's go somewhere!

1327
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:30,337
Anywhere in the world, just you and me.

1328
01:14:30,685 --> 01:14:31,685
What do you say?

1329
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,441
Say yes, Will!

1330
01:14:37,809 --> 01:14:38,809
Go on.

1331
01:14:41,065 --> 01:14:43,170
Okay - yeah?

1332
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:46,571
I can't handle this very
well you know that.

1333
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:49,179
Look out, Will!

1334
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:52,545
Oh my God!

1335
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:08,080
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

1336
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,516
I was worried sick. Are you okay?

1337
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:12,006
I am old enough to spend.

1338
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:14,006
The night in a hotel without
permission, mother.

1339
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:15,030
Okay?

1340
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:16,895
Okay.

1341
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:20,548
Right.

1342
01:15:28,688 --> 01:15:30,222
I'm guessing she didn't do your tubes?

1343
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:32,755
She did manage to get the
portal down me, in the bed.

1344
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:34,741
This is not good, mate. You are sweating.

1345
01:15:35,252 --> 01:15:36,831
Look at me, how's your eyesight?

1346
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,594
I'm pretty sure you're Nathan, am I right?

1347
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,170
And I'm pretty sure
you've been on the drink.

1348
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:42,501
Eh, am I right?

1349
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:44,323
- I will be fine.
- Jesus, Will.

1350
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:46,381
We had a nice time.

1351
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:48,997
What?

1352
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:51,942
I'm not coming

1353
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:53,652
to extreme, whatever it is called, Norway.

1354
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,430
They need me at work.

1355
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,034
But you said you'd support me!

1356
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:58,819
I am supporting you, Patrick

1357
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:01,551
I hate cycling and you know I do!

1358
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:06,932
But there's this trip I've
got to go on, with Will.

1359
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:09,671
Why can't he just get an agency nurse?

1360
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:11,379
Because it is my job!

1361
01:16:14,294 --> 01:16:16,283
What is this Lou?

1362
01:16:16,915 --> 01:16:19,746
Your job, it takes priority
over everything these days!

1363
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:22,881
Patrick, this is important, okay?

1364
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,141
- Trust me.
- It's Norway!

1365
01:16:24,582 --> 01:16:26,498
It's meant to be a holiday.

1366
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:29,319
I just can't.

1367
01:16:31,122 --> 01:16:32,848
Oh, Pat!

1368
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:55,856
He's stable.

1369
01:16:57,022 --> 01:16:59,074
Pneumonia?

1370
01:16:59,377 --> 01:17:01,132
He only had cough on Saturday morning.

1371
01:17:01,354 --> 01:17:02,616
His lungs are weak.

1372
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:04,333
Any bacteria hits him hard.

1373
01:17:06,633 --> 01:17:07,728
Can I go in?

1374
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,334
No, Camilla's with him.

1375
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:11,403
Let's leave her to it.

1376
01:17:14,232 --> 01:17:16,163
It's his fourth bout in two years.

1377
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:18,704
The last nearly killed him.

1378
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,048
Thank you.

1379
01:17:44,148 --> 01:17:45,148
How he doing?

1380
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:48,994
He's a little better, I think.

1381
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:53,559
Would you like me to take over for a while?

1382
01:17:57,313 --> 01:17:59,711
I would really like to change my clothes.

1383
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:01,130
Yeah.

1384
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:35,229
Hey.

1385
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:43,617
How are you feeling?

1386
01:18:47,982 --> 01:18:49,267
I've been better.

1387
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:52,636
I don't know, you'll do anything
for attention, Will Traynor.

1388
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,701
I don't think I can be witty today, Clark.

1389
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:15,312
Hey.

1390
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:17,351
Just dropping off some meds
for when he gets back.

1391
01:19:18,857 --> 01:19:19,857
Are you alright?

1392
01:19:20,028 --> 01:19:22,502
Yes, just um, cancelling everything.

1393
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:35,570
You know, don't you?

1394
01:19:36,441 --> 01:19:37,441
Yeah

1395
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,890
I've been with him two years.

1396
01:19:40,826 --> 01:19:42,553
His life is hard.

1397
01:19:42,698 --> 01:19:44,744
He hides his pain, when he's with you.

1398
01:19:44,774 --> 01:19:46,882
But there have been times
when I've stayed over.

1399
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:48,090
And I hear him screaming.

1400
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:51,251
In his dreams he's still running or skiing.

1401
01:19:51,597 --> 01:19:53,031
Still doing things and..

1402
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:54,227
Then he wakes up.

1403
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,421
And there is nothing I can say to him.

1404
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:00,207
Now, I can't judge what he wants to do.

1405
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:02,275
That's his choice.

1406
01:20:02,868 --> 01:20:05,799
But that was before me.

1407
01:20:05,829 --> 01:20:08,038
Yes and I know that he
did pretty much anything

1408
01:20:08,068 --> 01:20:09,068
to make you happy.

1409
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,564
I want him to live, Lou.

1410
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:16,282
But only if he wants to live.

1411
01:20:16,752 --> 01:20:18,596
I can't just let this happen.

1412
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,382
I can't.

1413
01:20:20,825 --> 01:20:22,553
And we are running out of time.

1414
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:23,770
So if I

1415
01:20:23,997 --> 01:20:25,401
could come up with

1416
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:28,025
another trick, that doctors would agree to

1417
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:30,403
would you come with us?

1418
01:20:32,763 --> 01:20:33,763
Yeah.

1419
01:20:34,316 --> 01:20:35,697
Of course I would.

1420
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:47,048
Hi.

1421
01:20:50,347 --> 01:20:52,557
This is unexpected.

1422
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:55,609
I've bought your parents cinema tickets

1423
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:58,370
and your granddad is in
his room, asleep. I think.

1424
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,626
You bribed my parents
and jailed my granddad.

1425
01:21:00,657 --> 01:21:01,657
Good.

1426
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,485
I'm an idiot.

1427
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:05,707
But this job of yours is
just for a few more weeks

1428
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:08,160
and things will soon be back to normal

1429
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:10,754
and I should be proud.

1430
01:21:10,784 --> 01:21:12,363
That you're doing something worthwhile.

1431
01:21:14,654 --> 01:21:16,782
I don't want to argue with you

1432
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:21,220
less than 300 calories.

1433
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,067
What is this?

1434
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:34,558
It's the trip I told you about.

1435
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,091
I thought you meant Lords or something.

1436
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,499
Hot tub under the stars?

1437
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,632
Massages?

1438
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:43,985
Swim with dolphins?

1439
01:21:44,325 --> 01:21:46,501
Whoa look! Five star luxury

1440
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:47,525
24 hour room service.

1441
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,274
This isn't work.

1442
01:21:51,598 --> 01:21:54,085
Do you really expect me to just sit here
while you swan off with another man?

1443
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,159
On a honeymoon?

1444
01:21:55,465 --> 01:21:56,825
His other care giver's coming too.

1445
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,814
- What?
- Two guys, well that's alright then.

1446
01:21:58,845 --> 01:21:59,577
Patrick.

1447
01:21:59,607 --> 01:22:01,258
This is really important.

1448
01:22:01,993 --> 01:22:03,353
Do you know how this feels?

1449
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:06,703
It's like

1450
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:08,488
I'm running permanently just a little

1451
01:22:08,519 --> 01:22:10,018
behind the rest of the field.

1452
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,801
It's like

1453
01:22:12,009 --> 01:22:14,057
there's something bad around the bend

1454
01:22:14,087 --> 01:22:16,158
and everyone seems to know
what it is, except me.

1455
01:22:16,252 --> 01:22:18,099
Patrick - Seven years!

1456
01:22:18,617 --> 01:22:19,862
We've been together, Lou.

1457
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:22,059
You've known him five months.

1458
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:23,441
But he needs me.

1459
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,105
And I don't?

1460
01:22:27,429 --> 01:22:28,429
I am sorry.

1461
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:53,751
Well, you got him here.

1462
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,697
- Cheers.
- Thank you sir.

1463
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:06,725
'Welcome to Paradise'

1464
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:18,481
Bienvenue, let me show you to your rooms.

1465
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:45,858
Hey, you!

1466
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:49,912
How are you feeling?

1467
01:23:51,231 --> 01:23:52,351
Better.

1468
01:23:52,551 --> 01:23:54,423
So what's the plan for today?

1469
01:23:55,075 --> 01:23:56,898
Um, well, we can stay here for a bit.

1470
01:23:56,935 --> 01:23:59,014
Because they rent DVDs at the front desk.

1471
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,948
We didn't come all this
way to watch DVDs, Clark.

1472
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:07,062
Hey Whoa, oh oh, Oye!

1473
01:24:17,455 --> 01:24:18,801
Is there alcohol in that?

1474
01:24:18,839 --> 01:24:20,472
Rum, vodka and Cointreau, sir.

1475
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,145
She'll have two, please.

1476
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,156
- Yes sir.
- Thank You.

1477
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:49,478
Oh, I put you in for scuba diving.

1478
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:51,523
Even though I personally didn't want to?!

1479
01:24:54,195 --> 01:24:55,284
- Hey!
- Hi.

1480
01:24:55,322 --> 01:24:56,580
- Hello.
- Hello

1481
01:24:56,782 --> 01:24:58,839
I am going to walk Karen back to her hotel.

1482
01:24:59,087 --> 01:25:01,386
Because she shouldn't
walk back alone, y'know?

1483
01:25:01,423 --> 01:25:02,564
How chivalrous of you!

1484
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:04,734
Yeah, very civic minded.

1485
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:06,528
Ah, piss off, the both of you!

1486
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,202
Yeah, I've got everything covered.

1487
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:10,663
- Do not worry.
- We will be fine.

1488
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:13,173
Alright, yeah, we'll see you later.

1489
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:16,057
- Bye!
- Have Fun.

1490
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:30,475
Do not, no! Leave 'em open.

1491
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:33,194
I want to see it.

1492
01:25:48,689 --> 01:25:51,579
Don't go back to your room tonight, Clark.

1493
01:26:46,404 --> 01:26:47,409
Just do it.

1494
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,917
No, I can't I can't and it's
gonna be too deep, I can't.

1495
01:26:49,953 --> 01:26:51,550
You can, you can do anything.

1496
01:27:01,236 --> 01:27:03,253
Why didn't you make me do that earlier?!

1497
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:04,671
That was amazing!

1498
01:27:04,832 --> 01:27:06,425
I don't know, Clark.

1499
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,387
Some people just won't be told!

1500
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:18,295
I do not want to go home.

1501
01:27:18,748 --> 01:27:21,843
This is It has been the best.

1502
01:27:23,176 --> 01:27:25,819
You're glad you came, right?

1503
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,695
Yes.

1504
01:27:45,937 --> 01:27:46,960
You.

1505
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,137
You are a something else, Clark.

1506
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:54,521
Well.

1507
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:22,987
I have to tell you something.

1508
01:28:23,622 --> 01:28:24,622
I know.

1509
01:28:25,296 --> 01:28:26,444
I know about Switzerland.

1510
01:28:27,371 --> 01:28:29,286
I have known, for months.

1511
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:32,069
Listen, I know

1512
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,583
that this is not how you
would have chosen it.

1513
01:28:36,152 --> 01:28:37,332
But I

1514
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,726
I can make you happy!

1515
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:42,227
- No.
- What?

1516
01:28:42,262 --> 01:28:43,619
No, Clark.

1517
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:47,305
I get that this could be a good life.

1518
01:28:48,038 --> 01:28:50,637
But it's not, "My life".

1519
01:28:51,241 --> 01:28:52,973
It's not even close.

1520
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,315
You never saw me, before.

1521
01:28:57,957 --> 01:28:59,617
I loved my life.

1522
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:03,084
I've really loved it.

1523
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:08,513
I can't be the kind of man,
who just accepts this.

1524
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:10,696
Yes, but you're not giving it a chance.

1525
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:13,511
You're not giving ME a chance.

1526
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:17,139
I, have become a whole new person

1527
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:19,711
these last six months, because of you.

1528
01:29:19,762 --> 01:29:20,426
I know.

1529
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:22,921
And that is why I can't
have you tied to me.

1530
01:29:23,977 --> 01:29:25,520
I don't want you to.

1531
01:29:26,511 --> 01:29:29,305
Miss all the things that
someone else could give you.

1532
01:29:30,972 --> 01:29:32,075
And selfishly

1533
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:33,907
I don't want you to look at me one day

1534
01:29:33,937 --> 01:29:36,182
and feel even the tiniest big of regret.

1535
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:37,195
Or pity.

1536
01:29:37,225 --> 01:29:38,465
I would never would think that!

1537
01:29:38,516 --> 01:29:39,953
You don't know that.

1538
01:29:40,835 --> 01:29:42,444
I can't watch you

1539
01:29:42,998 --> 01:29:45,184
wandering around the annex

1540
01:29:45,299 --> 01:29:46,785
in your crazy dresses

1541
01:29:50,048 --> 01:29:52,495
or see you naked and not

1542
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:56,480
not be able to.

1543
01:29:57,092 --> 01:29:58,096
Oh God, Clark!

1544
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,010
If you had an idea of what I
want to do to you right now.

1545
01:30:05,335 --> 01:30:06,665
I cannot live like this.

1546
01:30:07,043 --> 01:30:09,030
Please Will!

1547
01:30:09,293 --> 01:30:10,969
Please!

1548
01:30:11,308 --> 01:30:12,459
Listen.

1549
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:14,954
This.

1550
01:30:15,428 --> 01:30:16,663
Tonight

1551
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,313
being with you

1552
01:30:19,735 --> 01:30:21,896
is the most wonderful thing.

1553
01:30:21,909 --> 01:30:22,560
No!

1554
01:30:22,593 --> 01:30:24,423
You could have ever done for me.

1555
01:30:28,205 --> 01:30:30,266
But I need it to end here.

1556
01:30:32,036 --> 01:30:34,587
No more pain and exhaustion

1557
01:30:34,614 --> 01:30:36,701
and waking up every morning..

1558
01:30:36,814 --> 01:30:38,859
Already wishing it was over.

1559
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,760
It's not going to get better than this.

1560
01:30:44,635 --> 01:30:47,078
The doctors know it and I know it.

1561
01:30:50,272 --> 01:30:53,429
When we get back, I am going
to go to Switzerland.

1562
01:30:54,389 --> 01:30:56,453
So I'm asking you, if you

1563
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,465
really feel the things you say you feel.

1564
01:31:00,266 --> 01:31:01,336
Come with me.

1565
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:04,353
Yes I know, but

1566
01:31:04,401 --> 01:31:07,149
I thought that you were changing your mind.

1567
01:31:07,156 --> 01:31:09,260
Nothing was ever going to change my mind.

1568
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:11,853
I promised my parents six months.

1569
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,123
And that's what I've given them.

1570
01:31:16,245 --> 01:31:17,954
No, no!

1571
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:20,579
No.

1572
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:22,915
Don't say another word.

1573
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,296
You're so selfish!

1574
01:31:25,789 --> 01:31:29,178
I tore my heart out in front of you.

1575
01:31:29,226 --> 01:31:31,334
And all you can say is "no".

1576
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,363
And now,

1577
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:34,578
You want me to come and watch.

1578
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:36,934
The worst thing you can possibly imagine.

1579
01:31:37,206 --> 01:31:39,356
Do you have any idea of
what you are asking?

1580
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,054
I wish I had never taken this stupid job.

1581
01:31:44,085 --> 01:31:46,039
I wish I had never met you.

1582
01:31:47,687 --> 01:31:48,830
Louisa?

1583
01:31:53,887 --> 01:31:55,054
Louisa!!

1584
01:32:18,781 --> 01:32:19,869
You alright?

1585
01:32:20,976 --> 01:32:22,075
Fine.

1586
01:32:25,854 --> 01:32:27,073
Merci.

1587
01:33:48,932 --> 01:33:51,198
Oh look at you, you look wonderful!

1588
01:33:52,185 --> 01:33:53,185
You do.

1589
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:55,461
Great photos of you on the beach.

1590
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:58,016
- And also swam, and everything too, right?
- Yes, it was great.

1591
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:01,160
How was the flight?

1592
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:02,895
Well, we got here in one piece.

1593
01:34:04,899 --> 01:34:06,083
Are you hungry?

1594
01:34:06,114 --> 01:34:08,391
We can eat in the restaurant
in the Inter Continental.

1595
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:09,880
- I could eat.
- Excellent.

1596
01:34:10,265 --> 01:34:12,308
Louisa, let me give you a hand with those.

1597
01:34:12,537 --> 01:34:15,190
Actually, I need to get home.

1598
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:17,781
Oh c'mon. We want to know how you got on.

1599
01:34:17,813 --> 01:34:18,944
Let her go.

1600
01:34:30,459 --> 01:34:31,465
Louisa!!

1601
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,317
Louisa!! Louisa.

1602
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:38,469
Wait, Louisa please.

1603
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,514
You do not have to pay me.

1604
01:34:41,006 --> 01:34:42,399
I'm sorry.

1605
01:35:17,323 --> 01:35:18,477
Well?

1606
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:41,368
Sit down, Josie, love, please!

1607
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,687
Lou is upset enough.

1608
01:35:43,717 --> 01:35:45,226
And his parents know?

1609
01:35:46,928 --> 01:35:48,150
I mean.

1610
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,364
What kind of people are they?

1611
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,050
Mrs. Traynor, does not
know what else she can do.

1612
01:35:53,685 --> 01:35:55,245
It's his choice.

1613
01:35:55,276 --> 01:35:56,796
Some choices you don't get to make!

1614
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,311
He's not in his right mind!

1615
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:01,359
People who are vulnerable should
not be given the chance to

1616
01:36:01,383 --> 01:36:03,019
it's complicated, Mom.

1617
01:36:03,152 --> 01:36:04,286
It is not. It's simple.

1618
01:36:04,617 --> 01:36:06,020
- Mom?
- No!

1619
01:36:06,252 --> 01:36:07,721
You can't be a part of this.

1620
01:36:08,593 --> 01:36:10,389
It's no better than murder.

1621
01:36:43,635 --> 01:36:44,886
I tried, Dad.

1622
01:36:46,004 --> 01:36:48,096
I tried so hard!

1623
01:36:49,287 --> 01:36:50,817
But I failed.

1624
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,008
Who says you failed?

1625
01:37:03,504 --> 01:37:05,746
I'm not sure anyone in the world

1626
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:08,737
could ever persuade that man

1627
01:37:08,817 --> 01:37:10,949
once he'd set his mind to something

1628
01:37:12,102 --> 01:37:14,320
you can't change who people are.

1629
01:37:14,592 --> 01:37:16,180
Then what can you do?

1630
01:37:16,714 --> 01:37:17,910
You love them.

1631
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:21,262
No one could have done more than you.

1632
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:24,819
You have a heart as big as that castle

1633
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,658
and I love you for it.

1634
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:30,484
Have you seen Mr. Traynor?

1635
01:37:31,424 --> 01:37:32,694
They left.

1636
01:37:32,753 --> 01:37:33,906
This morning.

1637
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:38,669
Dad, have I made a huge mistake?

1638
01:37:45,557 --> 01:37:46,867
Call them.

1639
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:49,179
You still have time.

1640
01:37:55,965 --> 01:37:57,974
Do not worry, Mom will come 'round.

1641
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,540
I'll talk to her.

1642
01:38:00,311 --> 01:38:01,899
You're doing the right thing, Lou.

1643
01:38:02,894 --> 01:38:04,093
You have to go.

1644
01:38:05,031 --> 01:38:06,689
You were useless until you met him.

1645
01:38:48,362 --> 01:38:49,362
Hello.

1646
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:51,324
Hello.

1647
01:38:51,636 --> 01:38:52,887
He's just through there.

1648
01:38:53,398 --> 01:38:54,285
Okay.

1649
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,249
- Ma'am.
- Oh!

1650
01:38:56,656 --> 01:38:57,656
Thank you.

1651
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,600
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

1652
01:39:12,638 --> 01:39:15,977
The familiar sound of Louisa
Clark making an entrance.

1653
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:18,961
We'll leave you be.

1654
01:39:26,094 --> 01:39:27,098
Thank you.

1655
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,980
Don't tell me.

1656
01:39:38,354 --> 01:39:40,432
You've come to prepare my last cup of tea.

1657
01:39:41,932 --> 01:39:43,785
Actually no

1658
01:39:44,016 --> 01:39:45,339
I'm here to kidnap you.

1659
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:48,905
I am going to steal you and
I'm going to take you to, um.

1660
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:51,000
- Where?
- To Rio.

1661
01:39:52,383 --> 01:39:54,632
Or, my Mum and Dad's, I
haven't quite decided yet.

1662
01:40:18,453 --> 01:40:19,669
Come here.

1663
01:40:29,591 --> 01:40:30,823
Closer.

1664
01:40:45,784 --> 01:40:46,972
Look at me.

1665
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:51,107
Please look at me!

1666
01:40:52,339 --> 01:40:53,911
- I can't.
- Tough.

1667
01:40:54,243 --> 01:40:55,979
I need to see that face.

1668
01:40:57,961 --> 01:40:59,876
I need to see that face of yours.

1669
01:41:01,173 --> 01:41:02,348
Even if it is all

1670
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,899
pink and blotchy.

1671
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:11,044
You really are a most
impossible man, Will Traynor.

1672
01:41:11,072 --> 01:41:13,837
And the world will definitely
be a better place without me.

1673
01:41:14,066 --> 01:41:15,221
No.

1674
01:41:16,018 --> 01:41:17,539
No.

1675
01:41:26,365 --> 01:41:28,056
Don't be sad, Clark.

1676
01:41:29,677 --> 01:41:31,450
Tell me something good.

1677
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:44,528
I wish I lived.

1678
01:42:00,954 --> 01:42:02,538
Will you stay?

1679
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:07,034
As long as you want me to.

1680
01:42:56,782 --> 01:42:58,692
Can you call my parents in?

1681
01:43:58,623 --> 01:43:59,921
Clark.

1682
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,259
A few weeks should have passed
by the time you read this.

1683
01:44:03,713 --> 01:44:06,670
If you've followed the
instructions, you'll be in Paris.

1684
01:44:06,899 --> 01:44:09,999
In one of those chairs that never
sit quite level on the pavement.

1685
01:44:10,432 --> 01:44:11,887
I hope it's still sunny.

1686
01:44:14,432 --> 01:44:18,569
Across the bridge to your right
you will see L'Artisan Parfumeur.

1687
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,959
You should try the scent, Papillon Extreme.

1688
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:23,259
I always did think it
would smell great on you.

1689
01:44:23,488 --> 01:44:25,646
- Ca va?
- Oui, Ca va.

1690
01:44:25,678 --> 01:44:26,756
Merci.

1691
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:29,951
There are a few things

1692
01:44:29,992 --> 01:44:32,189
I wanted to say and couldn't,

1693
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:33,685
because you would have got all emotional.

1694
01:44:33,709 --> 01:44:35,158
And wouldn't have let me finish.

1695
01:44:38,382 --> 01:44:40,689
So, here it is.

1696
01:44:41,774 --> 01:44:42,909
When you get back home,

1697
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:45,043
Michael Lawler will give you
access to a bank account.

1698
01:44:45,067 --> 01:44:47,528
That contains enough to
give you a new beginning.

1699
01:44:47,761 --> 01:44:49,629
Don't start panicking

1700
01:44:49,676 --> 01:44:51,864
it's not enough for you
to sit around for the rest of your life.

1701
01:44:51,888 --> 01:44:54,300
But it should buy you your freedom.

1702
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,964
Wear those stripy legs with pride.

1703
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:11,743
Knowing you still have possibilities.

1704
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:15,310
Is a luxury, and knowing
that I might have given them to you has

1705
01:45:15,423 --> 01:45:16,888
eased something, for me.

1706
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:20,858
So, this is it.

1707
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:24,919
You are scored on my heart, Clark.

1708
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,984
You were, from the first day you walked in.

1709
01:45:26,999 --> 01:45:29,712
With your sweet smile and
your ridiculous clothes.

1710
01:45:29,713 --> 01:45:31,000
And your bad jokes.

1711
01:45:31,248 --> 01:45:34,773
And your complete inability
to ever hide a single thing that you felt.

1712
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:38,830
Don't think of me too often.

1713
01:45:39,455 --> 01:45:41,029
I do not want you getting sad.

1714
01:45:41,589 --> 01:45:43,258
Just live well.

1715
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:45,748
Just live.

1716
01:45:47,368 --> 01:45:49,648
I'll be walking beside you
every step of the way.

1717
01:45:51,726 --> 01:45:53,502
Love, Will

1718
