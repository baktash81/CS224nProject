Well, if he was DEA,
he helped you rob a bank.

and for that, I have no mercy.

The whole point of you
working with Bobby Beans

was to kill him off

Fee is we don't raise

Thank you, sir.

1365
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:10,017
I didn't mean to hit you like that.
I apologize.

1366
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,186
I'm listening,
sailor. Sit.

1367
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,287
Thank you, sir.

1368
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,261
QUINCE: Try the Admiral again for me.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, sir.

1369
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,713
ADMIRAL: And you believed
this stolen money

1370
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:42,016
would all be used
to fight drug cartels?

1371
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:44,452
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came
down the valid chain of command.

1372
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,754
Blind loyalty
is not loyalty.

1373
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,489
I know that, sir,
and that's why I'm here.

1374
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:50,424
Well, you've shown
a lot of tenacity

1375
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:52,727
and a lot of guts
bringing this to me.

1376
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,262
Thank you, sir.
That means the world comin' from you.

1377
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:59,500
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1378
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,736
Of course, sir. I mean,
you can just lock down the base.

1379
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,170
You can arrest
Commander Quince.

1380
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:06,173
The United States Navy
does not rob banks.

1381
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,375
Its personnel
did not rob a bank.

1382
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:12,213
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1383
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,781
If there was money
taken from the bank

1384
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,917
that was part of
an illegal CIA slush fund,

1385
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,253
the Navy had no knowledge
the fund existed.

1386
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,457
Your jacket has you
six months AWOL?

1387
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,992
Yes, sir.

1388
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,794
It's gonna stay that way.

1389
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:33,367
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise
be amended so he's also AWOL,

1390
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:36,036
making none of this
the Navy's problem.

1391
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,938
Sir, this isn't right.

1392
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,040
Well, I'd offer more,

1393
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,275
but when the hand
has gangrene,

1394
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:44,245
you chop it off
to save the body.

1395
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:47,982
You don't keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well.

1396

Have Petty Officer Stigman
dropped outside the main gate.

1397
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,265
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1398
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,268
I want him shot.

1399
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:11,138

men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

you're doin' this?

Or did the CIA kill her
like they did Jessup?

1404
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,401
What's it to you?

1405
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:41,602

Harvey has a nice ring to it.

I saw that.

1705
01:40:24,285 --> 01:40:25,585
Saw what?
You winked.

1706
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:27,186
That's a twitch.
Yeah, right.

1707
01:40:32,493 --> 01:40:34,394
You know,
for a guy who just blew up $43 million,

1708
01:40:34,396 --> 01:40:36,529
all of a sudden,
you are a very generous tipper.

1709
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,664
Who said I blew up
$43 million?

1710
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:41,701
What are you sayin'?

1711
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:45,238
I'm hearin' somethin'.
You're sayin' somethin'.

1712
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,073
Well, if you're hearin' it,
it's only because you're hearin' it,

1713
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:49,375
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1714
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:50,743
How much did you keep?

1715
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:53,146
Two million?

1716
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:55,782
That's like one each.

1717
01:40:55,784 --> 01:40:57,250
So now you get half?

1718
01:40:57,252 --> 01:40:59,252
Well, I shot half the guys.
So?

1719
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:01,587
Two million?
