1
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,475
<i>Good morning, New York.</i>

2
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,113
<i>Today we are talking about</i>
<i>cheese until the sun comes up.</i>

3
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,487
<i>Specifically,</i>
<i>bouchon cheese.</i>

4
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,255
<i>I like to pair this with a nice '77 sauvignon blanc.</i>

5
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,791
<i>It's perfect for an intimate</i>
<i>meal or for a large gathering.</i>

6
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,343
<i>You will never go wrong</i>
<i>with semi-soft cheeses.</i>

7
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,972
<i>Let us go to Scott</i>
<i>in Crown Heights.</i>

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,539
<i>He has been</i>
<i>wondering about Brie.</i>

9
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,684
<i>NASDAQ dropped</i>
<i>its noisy effort</i>

10
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,879
<i>to take over the New</i>
<i>York Stock Exchange.</i>

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,718
<i>It slunk away</i>
<i>saying it became clear</i>

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,815
<i>regulators wouldn't</i>
<i>approve a merger</i>

13
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,622
<i>of the US's two dominant stock exchanges.</i>

14
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>I think we have</i>
<i>Barbara in the Bronx.</i>

15
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,163
<i>She's got a question</i>
<i>about cheddar.</i>

16
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,895
<i>Go ahead, Barbara.</i>

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,867
You can have my rook,
but I will take

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,866
that.

19
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,833
Boom.

20
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,705
<i>It seems investors may be</i>
<i>in for an equally wild ride.</i>

21
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,816
Get that bike around back.
Come on, empty the truck.

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,381
Hey, it's the man in the suit.
Hey.

23
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,926
What are you doing walking
on my side of the street?

24
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,018
Very funny.

25
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,756
Punk-ass bitches walk on
the other side of the street.

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,922
Same jokes as yesterday.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,898
Walk by me again and I'm
going to whoop your ass.

28
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,297
Good morning, Mr. Shaw.
You are looking lean and mean today.

29
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,035
This is why
I love you, Lester.

30
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,736
You're the best
liar in New York.

31
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,244
Morning, Mr. Shaw.
Hiya.

32
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,644
Everything is set
for your dinner party.

33
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,581
I'm sending up some bouchon
paired with a '77 sauvignon blanc.

34
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,775
Very nice.

35
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,483
If you don't mind my saying,
are you sure you want

36
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,919
Secretary Lowe and Janet
Ramsey at the party together?

37
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,354
They were mentioned
again on Page Six.

38
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,189
Jesus! I totally forgot
they were screwing.

39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,955
Yeah.
Nice save, Josh.

40
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,222
What the hell
would I do without you?

41
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,959
You would have to
read the <i>Post</i> yourself.

42
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,623
No, I'm serious.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,763
I am kicking the tires on a couple deals.

44
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,325
I might buy a hotel
in Saint Bart's.

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,764
I'm looking for a GM.

46
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,328
I'm going to try
and steal you away.

47
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,168
If I could bring Lester,
we might have a deal.

48
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,140
Okay, deal.

49
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,638
All right.
Have a good one.

50
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,180
Josh, one more thing.

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,306
What is that, sir?

52
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,872
Checkmate.

53
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,213
You got a security
report for me?

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,783
Not much, Mr. K. A car alarm,
two homeless and a really loud dog.

55
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,385
Good morning, Josh.
Hey, Rose.

56
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,657
How was your weekend?

57
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,892
Good. I was here.
We steam-cleaned the garage,

58
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,661
had some killer take-out
from Punjab Palace.

59
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,396
You are a wild man.
That's me.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,767
Mr. K.

61
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,127
Hey, Odessa.

62
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,606
My work visa's about to expire.
You must find me a husband.

63
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,369
Okay. Can I have
my bagel first?

64
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,436
I need a man before these pricks
throw me out of the country.

65
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,176
All right, and what about Manuel?
He's a catch.

66
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,215
I tried.
He couldn't handle me.

67
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,584
Okay. Rose,
don't write that down.

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,920
Morning.
Morning, Kwan.

69
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,018
We have birthdays
in 3714 and 4399.

70
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,992
The Jameson twins like the
cupcakes from Magnolia,

71
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,501
Mr.
Causwell likes the hot fudge sundae at Sardi's.

72
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,661
And Mrs. Hightower
landed three days early

73
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,170
from Cairo,
be here in an hour.

74
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,263
Does Mr. Hightower know?

75
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,240
Josh, a word,
right now.

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,072
Yes, sir, Mr. Simon.

77
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,370
Where's Charlie?
I got an empty concierge desk.

78
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,075
I think he's checking
on Mrs. Cronan.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,880
Now that's bullshit! Mrs.
Cronan is at physical therapy.

80
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,749
He has got three minutes.

81
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,349
...can only be convicted if the
prosecution proves all the...

82
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,517
Miss lovenko.

83
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,651
Holy shit! What?

84
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,056
We do this thing,
you and I,

85
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,596
where you pretend not to study for the bar exam

86
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,756
and I pretend
not to notice.

87
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,124
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

88
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,701
See, we're doing it.
Doing what?

89
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,396
Right now, we're doing the thing,
where you pretend not...

90
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,460
No.

91
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,598
I know the exam is coming up this week,
so study in my office

92
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,301
during your lunch break, okay?
Because I never use it.

93
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,776
Okay, but I'm not studying,
so it would not make much sense.

94
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,109
Wait. Shh! Hear that?

95
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,338
Someone is buzzing.

96
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,950
Hey, shush!

97
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,077
Everybody, shush!

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,344
Who's buzzing?

99
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,619
I hear it.
It's faint,

100
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,950
it's muffled,
but I hear it. Fess up!

101
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,187
Who's buzzing?
Come on!

102
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,421
Who the hell is buzzing?

103
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,987
It's me, my bad.
I had it on vibrate.

104
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,323
Josh, this is
Enrique Dev'R eaux.

105
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,766
He's our new
elevator operator.

106
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,825
I didn't hire you.

107
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,996
He's a quarter Cherokee,
you know we need an Indian.

108
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,505
So give him a shot.

109
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,265
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Kovaks.

110
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,470
I've spent the last three years working at the BK,

111
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,978
and I'm ready for
the big leagues.

112
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,039
BK? What is that?
A building downtown?

113
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,180
No, it's a Burger King
in Times Square.

114
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,082
All right. Walk with me,
Mr. Dev'R eaux.

115
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,146
The average apartment at
The Tower costs $5.6 million.

116
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,590
It's the most expensive real
estate in North America.

117
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,093
We have the best views,
the most advanced security system,

118
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,825
keyless entry,
24-hour video vibration detection.

119
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,389
But you know what these
people are really buying?

120
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,760
White neighbors?

121
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,303
Us. The staff.

122
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,169
They pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week.

123
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,175
So there's no
cell phones, iPhones,

124
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,870
BlackBerries,
texting, tweeting...

125
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,105
They had a rule at the BK,
no sex in the storage room.

126
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,511
Same as your
phone rule, right?

127
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,116
No, not the same,
because your dick

128
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,652
has to come with you
to work, Mr. Dev'R eaux,

129
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,688
but your phone
can stay at home.

130
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,087
So don't hide it in your pocket
or tuck it into your sock,

131
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,921
don't tape it under your
balls or stick it up your ass,

132
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,893
because, eventually,
I will find it.

133
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,960
They never checked
my balls at the BK.

134
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,630
Sir, you can call me "Enrique" or "Lil<i>'</i>
Disco" or "The Puerto Rican Mohican,"

135
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,862
that's my hip-hop name.

136
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,103
Morning, Judge Ramos.
How did you do?

137
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,041
I ran the Reservoir,
15 flat.

138
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,135
Nice.

139
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,543
Where's Charlie?
I need my cigars.

140
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,513
I think he took Mrs.
Cronan to physical therapy.

141
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,708
I'll bring them up
the second he gets here.

142
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,841
Thank you.

143
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,976
- Hey, Lester.
- Good morning, Lester.

144
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,041
Hi, Lester.

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,850
What's invisible
and smells like worms?

146
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,413
Bird farts.

147
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,053
We've heard
that one before.

148
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,423
Have a great day
at school.

149
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,056
Morning,
Mr. Hightower.

150
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,254
Ma'am.

151
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,223
Sir, that package you ordered from
Cairo arrived three days early.

152
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,563
Hmm.
Yeah.

153
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,398
It's on its way from the airport right now.

154
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,563
Josh, can you
have the chauffeur

155
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,832
pick us up
at the back, please?

156
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,498
Already done.
Thank you.

157
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,236
Darling, let's go.

158
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,941
That guy's daughter
looks like a prostitute.

159
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,642
We're all about discretion here,
Mr. Dev'R eaux.

160
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,349
Right, right.
How do you guys split up the tips?

161
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,217
We don't. We never
take tips at The Tower.

162
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,550
No, I don't really want to talk about it right now.

163
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,215
Charlie.
- Sasha!

164
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,686
Your brother's coming,
I'm at work and I can't talk right now.

165
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,627
You're 20 minutes late!
Where are Judge Ramos<i>'</i> cigars?

166
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,755
Right here.

167
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,960
Josh, I'm freaking out.

168
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,593
Can I help you?

169
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,726
Go.

170
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,792
What?

171
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,169
We just went to the OB<i>I</i>GYN,
the baby is in the third trimester,

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
its head is six inches wide,
your sister has a tiny vagina.

173
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,377
Everyone tells me to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

174
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,969
In labor its head is
going to get crushed

175
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,775
or it's going to blow
out your sister's vagina.

176
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,076
Don't say the "V"
word in the lobby.

177
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,138
I called your
Uncle Marty.

178
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,277
He said all the women in your
family have teeny tiny vaginas.

179
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,580
I've been covering
your ass all week.

180
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,850
Simon is
breathing down my neck.

181
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,892
What are you doing?
I'm worried.

182
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,291
Did you hear what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

183
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,429
Simon is not going to fire me today.
I got the red flowers.

184
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,522
Red flowers?

185
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,623
Yeah, it's
Chinese New Year.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,065
Mrs. Jin will be
down here any second.

187
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,968
It's crucial the first thing she
hears be something positive.

188
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,164
Her entire year
depends on it.

189
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,196
Mrs. Jin.

190
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,575
Happy New Year.

191
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,782
Did you see that smile?

192
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,385
Wanted to see me?

193
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,555
Yeah.

194
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,399
Fitzhugh is
refusing to leave.

195
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,197
We've never had a forced eviction at The Tower.

196
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,529
If they drag Mr.
Fitzhugh and his family into the street,

197
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,698
it's bad for all of us.

198
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,132
Why don't you
talk to him?

199
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,436
This is your
responsibility, Josh.

200
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,239
The bank comes in the morning.
Get him out.

201
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,680
Mr. Fitzhugh,
it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

202
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,155
Good morning, Josh.
Are you alone?

203
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,221
Yeah.

204
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,468
Hey, did you see what
the market did today?

205
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,242
Went up 106 points.
Ask me why it did that?

206
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,339
Why?

207
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,646
I don't know,
but I used to know.

208
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,380
That's why they hired
me at Merrill Lynch.

209
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,582
Mr. Fitzhugh, you know this
apartment is now owned by the bank.

210
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,216
They'd like you to
vacate immediately.

211
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,090
We told the kids that we
were turning the apartment

212
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,856
into a park.
Going green.

213
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,788
That's how we explained
all the furniture

214
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,231
being sold and the tents in the living room.

215
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,828
Luckily, my children aren't very bright,
so they bought it.

216
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,873
But they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on.

217
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,273
Sir, the bank will be
here tomorrow morning.

218
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,642
I went to Yale 20 years ago,
and now I'm a squatter.

219
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,373
Can't wait for their reunion.
"Hello, nice to see you. I squat."

220
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,445
What about family?

221
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,283
No, I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

222
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,588
I'd sleep in my car,
but they repossessed it three months ago.

223
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,219
So, you see,
I have to stay here,

224
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,760
because we have
nowhere else to go.

225
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,527
It's illegal for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

226
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,966
I understand that.

227
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,365
But we might be doing some
elevator maintenance tomorrow.

228
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,274
I'm thinking that the elevators will be shut down

229
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,446
and those people from the bank will
just have to come back another time.

230
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,925
Because,
it's like you go down one.

231
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,422
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

232
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,164
Mr. Shaw, I see you met Mr.
Dev'R eaux.

233
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,226
This guy owns his own island with jet skis.
How cool is that?

234
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,896
He's our probationary
elevator operator.

235
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,803
He's still very early
in the interview process.

236
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,308
Why don't we finish the job
interview right now, Josh?

237
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,112
Suppose I ask you to pick
me up a cheeseburger,

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,477
Enrique,
what would you say?

239
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,981
How do you
like it cooked?

240
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,574
The thing is,
I like a certain kind of Brie on my burger,

241
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,177
and they only sell it at Danny's
Cheese Shop downtown.

242
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,812
I'm on my way.

243
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,414
And the beef has
to be grass-fed.

244
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,560
The best butcher shop in New
York is on Bleecker Street, sir.

245
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,189
Josh, hire him.

246
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,993
Yes, that was
my gut, sir.

247
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,125
And, Enrique,
one other thing.

248
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,363
I like to get my own burgers whenever possible.

249
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,664
I may have my own
private island in Belize,

250
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,675
but deep down I'm just an
Astoria boy like Josh here.

251
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,005
We come from
the same neighborhood.

252
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,238
That's right,
PS 104. Go Lions!

253
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,744
My first real job was shoveling
horseshit at Aqueduct Racetrack.

254
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,512
Don't you ever let me forget it.

255
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,848
I won't, sir.

256
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,316
All right, go downstairs
and get a nametag from Rose.

257
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,326
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

258
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,791
Why don't we hit it tonight, Josh?
Raise some hell.

259
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,962
We have to be back
here in nine hours.

260
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,029
Remember that time you danced
on that bar in Times Square?

261
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,404
I almost fainted.

262
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,875
That's a drunken dream
you had six years ago.

263
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,141
You were shaking your ass
up there like Tina Turner.

264
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,444
Running half naked
on Broadway

265
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,645
telling tourists you were
Mustafa from <i>The Lion King.</i>

266
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,153
That's ridiculous.
It never happened.

267
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,555
I was waiting to tell you.
This is going to be my last year at The Tower.

268
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,650
What?

269
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,888
In a few months,
I'm headed to San Diego

270
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,657
to spend a little
time with Lorraine.

271
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,859
I might even cruise around the
world with all the other old farts.

272
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,760
Wow.

273
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,535
That's great. That's really great.
I'm going to miss you.

274
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,532
I'll be thinking
about you, Josh.

275
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,939
Here's your bus.

276
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,274
Be thinking about how you danced on that bar.

277
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,279
Yeah!
I got it all up here.

278
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,939
I don't know
where you got that.

279
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,143
Circle of life, Josh.
Circle of life!

280
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,582
<i>Not many of you kill your</i>
<i>own Thanksgiving turkey,</i>

281
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,253
<i>but you might</i>
<i>want to consider it.</i>

282
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,827
Shit, Rita,
get your ass back in here!

283
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,956
I ain't going to be
chasing you all around.

284
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,125
Goodbye, Slide!

285
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,896
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

286
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,493
Not little shit like this.
Come on now.

287
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,095
I told you,
I don't even know nobody named Maria.

288
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,867
Yeah, well,
she sure as shit knows you, Slide!

289
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:02,930
It was a wrong number.

290
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,101
Then why did she ask
for you, stupid? Why?

291
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,906
It was a wrong number!
I just...

292
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,411
I don't know what
you are saying, bitch!

293
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,756
Lester, it's 9:15. Why is Mr.
Shaw's car still here?

294
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,814
Maybe he's sick.

295
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,155
That black sedan has been
parked there for two days.

296
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,864
Why no boot or ticket?

297
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,195
I called
the cops twice.

298
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,540
Do you remember
that morning robbery

299
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,943
at the International
last year?

300
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,540
I want you to slowly lock the
door and clear the lobby.

301
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,707
Stay calm.

302
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,420
Lock it down.
Code Black on all doors and elevators.

303
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,221
Repeat, Code Black.

304
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,787
What's Code Black?

305
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,396
Are you serious?
We talked about it at the meeting last month.

306
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,932
Let me see the outside
of the building.

307
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,024
I think we're
about to be robbed.

308
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,092
There were four guys
out there with guns.

309
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,428
Where did they go?

310
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,094
Let me see the garage.

311
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,305
Why is Stillman here?
Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

312
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,207
Mr. Shaw asked us
to call him.

313
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,143
Someone spilled wine
on his tablecloth.

314
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,181
He's bringing it
down right now.

315
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,648
Wait a second.
Those are not the Stillman brothers.

316
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,318
Oh, my God,
they're taking Shaw.

317
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,913
This isn't a robbery,
it's a kidnapping.

318
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,617
It's a kidnapping!
Call 911!

319
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,681
Yes, sir.

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,818
Code Black, Manuel!
Code Black!

321
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,883
What's Code Black?

322
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,292
Hey! Whoa!
Whoa!

323
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,856
Hey! Stop!

324
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,133
Shoot at the tires!

325
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,571
I only have my Taser!

326
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,672
Hey, stop!

327
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,930
Watch out!

328
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,431
Move in! Move in!
Move in!

329
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,263
Don't move.

330
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,841
Get your hands
in the air!

331
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,472
FBI, show me your hands.

332
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,616
- Let's go.
- Okay, all right.

333
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,049
Put them behind your back!

334
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,108
Take it easy.

335
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,684
No, get off him!
He's the victim!

336
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,754
That's Arthur Shaw!
He lives in The Tower.

337
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,225
He was bringing his laundry down.
They kidnapped him.

338
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,422
This was not a kidnapping,
it was an attempt to flee.

339
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,720
What?

340
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,026
Arrest him and get him out of here.

341
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,428
Josh, do me a favor,
turn off the heater and cover the pool.

342
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,995
I hate to waste money.

343
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,013
<i>Wall Street kingpin</i>
<i>Arthur Shaw,</i>

344
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,709
<i>number 138 on</i>
<i>the</i> Forbes <i>400 last year,</i>

345
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,117
<i>was arrested today in Manhattan</i>
<i>while trying to flee the city.</i>

346
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,280
<i>Sources have confirmed</i>
<i>that he'll be charged</i>

347
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,347
<i>with several counts</i>
<i>of securities fraud</i>

348
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,792
<i>and an immediate asset freeze of Mr.</i>
<i>Shaw's holdings has been ordered.</i>

349
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,126
<i>Shaw's lawyers</i>
<i>have called the arrest</i>

350
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,290
<i>"another example of the Wall Street witch-hunt,"</i>

351
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,596
<i>but sources at the SEC</i>
<i>believe the fraud</i>

352
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,364
<i>in this case could be</i>
<i>of epic proportions.</i>

353
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,103
In this country you're
innocent until proven guilty,

354
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,476
so no matter what you hear about Mr.
Shaw being a liar and a cheat,

355
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,243
or his entire business being
some sort of elaborate scam,

356
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,806
we simply don't
know the truth yet.

357
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,750
I've got shoes
to polish, Mr. K.

358
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,344
What does this
got to do with us?

359
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,220
For the last six years, Mr.
Shaw was on the board of The Tower.

360
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,590
So we have to find
a new board member?

361
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,090
No.

362
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,291
Several years ago at
one of the meetings,

363
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,129
he was asked to
do a favor for us.

364
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,101
He was asked to manage
all of your pensions.

365
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,159
Pensions?

366
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,465
And he did.

367
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,507
He took us on even though
it was a small account.

368
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,939
He agreed to handle it.

369
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,934
Who asked him
to do that?

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,280
I did, Rose.
I asked him.

371
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,175
Mr. K, what's left
in the pension?

372
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,152
Kwan, all this just happened,
so there's no way of knowing,

373
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,747
and by the way,
this could be a mistake.

374
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,157
How much, Josh?
Tell us.

375
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,489
Right now, they're
saying that anyone who

376
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,465
invested with Mr. Shaw
has been defrauded,

377
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,462
and that more than likely,
it's all gone.

378
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,268
There is no pension.

379
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,862
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

380
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,373
How did this happen?

381
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,969
The guy is the best
in New York

382
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,874
and he promised he could triple our portfolio.

383
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,003
So they're going
to get our money?

384
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,706
The guy had billions
of dollars, right?

385
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,873
Of course,
it's just a matter of time.

386
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,579
So we have to stay patient and be positive,
because it has to be there.

387
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,644
I heard on the news
when they arrested Shaw

388
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,690
that he only had $600
in his checking account.

389
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,994
Look, some of you may need
some time to process this.

390
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,120
If anyone wants
to go home,

391
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,721
I will call in a temp crew
for the rest of the day.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,994
I'm sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow.

393
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,730
Can I ask you
something, Mr. K?

394
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,827
Yeah.

395
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,565
Did he get your money, too?

396
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,005
Yeah, Odessa.

397
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,534
For the record,

398
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,512
I never asked anyone
to triple my portfolio.

399
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,381
<i>Just an hour ago,</i>

400
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,447
<i>a federal judge released Arthur</i>
<i>Shaw on $10 million bail,</i>

401
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,518
<i>on condition he remain under house</i>
<i>arrest at his penthouse apartment</i>

402
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,688
<i>on Central Park West.</i>

403
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,958
Mr. Shaw, I need
a statement from you.

404
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,021
You need to back off.

405
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,364
Can I get a comment
please, Mr. Shaw?

406
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,699
You need to back off.
Excuse me.

407
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,207
Here! Over here! Come on, Shaw!
Right here! Shaw!

408
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,368
Shaw, can we get a picture?

409
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,112
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

410
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,052
We're taking Shaw and his
attorney up to the penthouse.

411
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,020
I need Mr. Shaw's
personal security code.

412
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,885
24719.

413
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:56,451
That was my street address on Steinway
Boulevard in Astoria when I was a kid.

414
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,959
My client would like
access to the gym on 43.

415
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,232
Even serial killers get 15
minutes of exercise a day.

416
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,273
He has my permission
to jump out the window.

417
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,635
The rules of Mr. Shaw's
house arrest are simple.

418
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,907
Kovaks, no visitors without
prior permission from the FBI.

419
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,710
All incoming and outgoing
mail gets vetted by my office.

420
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,478
All food deliveries,
packages,

421
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,349
cleaning, repairs,
all that has to be cleared by the agent on duty.

422
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,582
You tell your staff
that this penthouse is now

423
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,090
a maximum security prison
and it will be guarded as such.

424
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,593
The FBI is in control of
the elevator and this floor.

425
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,928
What the hell is this?

426
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:38,768
Agent Denham,
that is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

427
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,238
owned and raced by the coolest
cat who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

428
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,273
This was his baby,

429
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,708
and now it's my baby.

430
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,939
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

431
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,210
And here I thought
you were an asshole.

432
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,115
I paid a million
for it 10 years ago.

433
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,120
I wouldn't sell it
for 10 times that.

434
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,554
We're 65 stories up.
How do we get it out of here?

435
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,123
You don't.

436
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,319
This car was taken
apart piece by piece

437
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,861
and reassembled
inside this room.

438
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,088
This car will eventually
be sold at auction

439
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,688
with the rest of
your belongings.

440
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,031
Only if I'm guilty,
Agent Denham, which I'm not.

441
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,004
If you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so,

442
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,872
and you'll be remanded into federal custody

443
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,174
and forfeit
$10 million bail.

444
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,681
You have yourself
a nice day, Mr. Shaw.

445
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,308
Kovaks, will you
come with me?

446
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,784
Josh, do me
a favor, will you?

447
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,713
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

448
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,256
Make sure you handle
all my food deliveries.

449
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,916
You're smart enough
to know I'm innocent.

450
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,720
I don't want the help
to spit in my coffee.

451
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:38,957
They wouldn't do that, sir.

452
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,894
Yeah, but you
get it, right?

453
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,999
Do it as a favor to me.

454
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
Sorry, we don't accept tips at The Tower.

455
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,772
Right, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I forget the rules.

456
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,541
Why did you let him
get away with that?

457
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,145
When he made that crack about
the help spitting in his coffee.

458
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,781
You wanted to hurt him.
Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

459
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,985
Sometimes residents say things
they don't mean. It doesn't faze me.

460
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,722
Either that or
you got no balls.

461
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,820
What?

462
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,764
I'm out of line.
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,299
I have balls,
all right.

464
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,028
I'm sure you got
big balls. Whatever.

465
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,434
I don't have to
defend my balls to you.

466
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,302
I'm just saying the guy stole from
everyone who works in your building

467
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,841
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass.

468
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,774
Maybe next time I'll
rip out his larynx,

469
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,779
but today I chose to do my job
as manager of this building.

470
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,138
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

471
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,718
Just that most guys from your block in Astoria

472
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,877
can't control
themselves.

473
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,285
And most girls from Forest
Hills don't end up in the FBI.

474
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,653
That's where
you're from, right?

475
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,991
Here.

476
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,593
This is where most white-collar
crimes are solved, the garbage.

477
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,865
When do you think you will
be getting the money back?

478
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm not really allowed to
discuss the case with you.

479
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,108
But you're allowed
to clothesline me?

480
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,871
I was apprehending
a fugitive.

481
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,140
He's only a fugitive
if he's guilty, right?

482
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,306
Oh!

483
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,679
Aren't you
the loyal friend?

484
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,477
I never said
we were friends.

485
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,110
You play chess together,

486
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,087
you're the one who asked
him to invest the pension.

487
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,491
I get his mail,
I open his car door,

488
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,618
I buy his cheese.
We're not friends.

489
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,327
Let me ask you something,
Kovaks.

490
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,592
If he's innocent,
where's the money?

491
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,723
How should I know?

492
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,664
The same way you knew
I was from Forest Hills.

493
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,999
You pay attention.

494
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,003
I just want to know what I'm
supposed to tell my staff.

495
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,245
Is that too much to ask?

496
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,180
Tell them he's guilty.

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,516
Get on the car!

498
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,952
Hey! Hey, hey!

499
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,956
Come on,
put your hands behind your back!

500
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,423
Come on, man,
what's this about?

501
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,426
This is bullshit! Shit!
That's police brutality, yo!

502
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,025
Come on now.

503
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,529
Man in the suit,
you seeing this shit?

504
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,087
You're my witness.
Take a cell phone picture.

505
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,633
Take a picture, man.

506
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,361
No, my cell phone
doesn't have a camera.

507
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,863
If you see Rita,
tell her I said to call her brother.

508
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,633
Rita?
Yeah, her brother's a bail bondsman.

509
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,798
Tell her I said
to use that money

510
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,501
I gave her to get
her teeth fixed.

511
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,441
Come on now,
what you got to be pushing me like that?

512
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,183
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the next Brooklyn bound</i>

513
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,088
<i>local train is now arriving.</i>

514
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,888
<i>Please step away</i>
<i>from the platform edge,</i>

515
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,330
<i>especially when trains are</i>
<i>entering and leaving the station.</i>

516
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,447
Hello.

517
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,786
<i>Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.</i>

518
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,527
Hey, what happened?

519
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,756
Lester tried to step in front
of a subway train tonight.

520
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,628
An off-duty
traffic cop was there

521
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,292
and pulled him back
at the last second.

522
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,199
They have him on
a 48-hour hold.

523
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,294
Where is he?

524
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,951
If you wanted a sick day,
all you had to do was ask.

525
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,121
Seriously, I need you back at work.

526
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,755
I'm going to tell the doctor
somebody pushed you.

527
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,488
It was a misunderstanding,
okay?

528
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,590
I gave it to him, Josh.
All my money.

529
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,691
I asked him to
invest it for me.

530
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,964
Shaw?
Yeah.

531
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,230
A couple of months ago,
I gave him everything I had, my life savings.

532
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,798
Six years
working the back door

533
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,935
at the Waldorf,
nine at the Carlyle,

534
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,606
three at the Pierre,
11 with you at The Tower.

535
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,848
That's 29 years
of opening doors.

536
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,354
$73,000 and change,
and I gave him every penny.

537
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,051
In a few months I won't have money for rent.

538
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,549
I can't retire now.

539
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,322
All those years of opening doors,
year after year.

540
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,965
Truth is, people can
open their own doors.

541
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,897
Not the way you do it.

542
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,171
Lester, he's going to pay you back every penny.

543
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,343
I promise.

544
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,616
Josh, please calm down.

545
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,676
Hold the elevator.

546
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,312
You can't go up there.

547
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,081
You're acting like a vigilante.
Move your hand.

548
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,386
I won't move my hand.
Move your hand!

549
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,858
Relax. You're not
using your head.

550
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,292
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Josh.

551
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,420
Hey.

552
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,623
So, they're evicting me this morning.

553
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,690
My wife already took the kids,
wants a divorce.

554
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,462
So, if you need me,
I'll be living in this box.

555
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,936
Can I ask you a question?
You're a Wall Street guy.

556
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,734
When did Shaw realize
that it was over for him?

557
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,638
Ten months,
maybe a year.

558
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,940
I heard he was interviewing
lawyers over the summer.

559
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,303
So if he took someone's
money a few months ago?

560
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,013
Probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances.

561
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,577
Throw his famous Labor Day party at the beach.

562
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,088
At a certain point,
it isn't about securities fraud,

563
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,180
it's about catering.

564
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,892
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

565
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,192
I'm going to the penthouse.

566
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,326
Wow! This is
going to be good.

567
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,228
Don't get up. Whoa!
Where do you think you're going?

568
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,967
We're just going
to get the trash.

569
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,906
And the breakfast order.

570
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,238
Go ahead.

571
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,137
Takes a village.

572
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,478
Good morning, Josh, Charlie, Enrique.
How are you doing?

573
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,717
How was your Labor Day party this year,
Mr. Shaw?

574
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,352
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

575
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,895
Surf and turf?

576
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,194
I've always tried to extend
you a certain courtesy,

577
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,756
but this tone
you're using...

578
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,893
What tone? Who gives
a shit about my tone?

579
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,195
What are you,
some kind of tone master?

580
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,873
Josh, come on.
I'm going to ask you one time, okay?

581
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,738
So you better
think really hard.

582
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,368
Why did you take
Lester's money?

583
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:09,376
He came to me,
he asked me to invest and I did. It was a favor.

584
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,082
Mm-hmm. $73,000?
A favor? Everything he had.

585
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,887
Did Lester ask you
to come up here?

586
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,221
Mr. Shaw,

587
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,922
a few hours ago,
Lester stepped in front of a subway train.

588
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,091
Oh, Jesus.

589
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,933
Here we go.
What are you doing?

590
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,532
Josh, you need to listen to me.
The FBI is lying to you.

591
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,631
Josh, put down the club.

592
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,435
Christ's sake,
don't do anything you can't undo.

593
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,038
Investing money is a gamble.
It doesn't always pay off.

594
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,048
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

595
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,449
Josh, come on.
No, really.

596
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,885
Do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to Lester?

597
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,178
Of course I feel badly.

598
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,816
I had no idea he was going to lose everything.

599
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,258
Lester has been a part of
my life for over a decade.

600
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,189
Then why haven't you asked
me whether he's alive or dead?

601
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,066
Josh, this car
is irreplaceable!

602
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,765
Not like doormen!

603
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,300
They make new ones
of those all the time.

604
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,776
Must be 50 new doormen coming
off the line in Michigan right now!

605
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,676
God damn it! Stop it!

606
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,545
Want some Brie with your burger?
Here you go.

607
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,108
Josh, don't!
Shh!

608
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,947
Want me to come
work for you, huh?

609
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,418
Want to steal me away to Saint Bart's?

610
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,020
Come on, let's go!
I'm ready to rock!

611
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,348
Mr. Kovaks, let me have
a swing at that shit!

612
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,951
No! Nobody touches
this car but me.

613
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,293
You think Steve McQueen is
the coolest cat that ever lived?

614
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,466
Guess what?
Today, Steve McQueen is my little bitch.

615
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,530
Ooh!

616
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,331
Ah!

617
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:38,965
Oh!

618
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,410
Whoops.

619
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,181
Don't worry,
I'll have the help come clean that up.

620
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,346
Let's go.

621
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,517
Josh, aren't you
forgetting something?

622
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,184
My breakfast order.

623
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,898
Do you understand
the shit-storm

624
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,229
that can be brought
down on this building?

625
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,169
Shaw's lawyer will shove harassment,
destruction of property

626
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,604
and civil rights charges
right down our throats!

627
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,164
Now, I don't care
what Shaw did

628
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,971
or how much money
he's accused of stealing.

629
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,376
And you know damn well I got
murdered by that son of a bitch!

630
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,778
But a line has been crossed,
and a gang of vigilantes

631
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,510
will not be tolerated
at The Tower.

632
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,676
You're all fired.

633
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,349
Hey, wait, hold on. Mr.
Simon, they had nothing to do with this.

634
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,547
They just
followed me up there.

635
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,611
I don't give a shit!

636
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,555
Mr. Simon, wait a minute,
my wife is eight months pregnant.

637
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,786
You should have thought of that
before you walked in that apartment.

638
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,021
We went up there
for Lester!

639
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,858
Lester's job is waiting for him when he gets out.

640
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,991
Meanwhile, the rest of you,
I want you out of the building right now.

641
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,879
Um, the carpet cleaners are coming tomorrow,
they start on 44. Okay?

642
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,391
Bye, Joshie.

643
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,985
Good luck with the bar.

644
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,724
I don't know what
you're talking about.

645
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,535
All right. Let's go, everyone.
Back to work, okay?

646
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,608
Hey, Charlie, wait!

647
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,342
Wait. I'll call Sasha,
all right.

648
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,440
I'll tell her you
tried to stop me.

649
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,678
Please,
don't do me any favors.

650
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,186
And, Josh,
don't pretend to care now,

651
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,882
I know you always
wanted to fire me.

652
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,351
That's because you
stink at this job.

653
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,992
So I stink? I stink?
Yeah.

654
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,495
The guy who made Mrs. Jin
smile on Chinese New Year?

655
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,455
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

656
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,889
She's what?

657
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,025
That's why she was smiling.

658
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,626
She's not Chinese,
she's Korean.

659
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,435
And you believed her?

660
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,234
Yeah, she's Korean.

661
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,469
All right, Josh,
maybe she's Korean.

662
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,311
Why are you whispering?
She is Korean.

663
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,813
What's important is that she
appreciated the gesture I made,

664
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,906
and that's more than I can say for some people.

665
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,819
Thanks for getting me fired.

666
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,036
Hey.

667
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,513
Hey. Thank you
for coming down.

668
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,176
Yeah, no problem.
You got something for me?

669
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,449
Yeah.
I probably shouldn't even be doing this,

670
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,183
because it violates
everything I believe in,

671
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,589
but I have to get my
employees<i>'</i> money back, so...

672
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,287
This is Shaw's travel schedule
for the last 10 years.

673
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,887
It's his guest registry.
Names ofjudges, politicians,

674
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,899
women,
tail number of his plane,

675
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,696
hull identification
number of his yacht,

676
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,531
names of his race horses
in West Virginia...

677
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,865
Gill's Pride
and Sunny Day.

678
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,263
Yeah, we have
all that, Kovaks.

679
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,536
And eventually they're gonna
sell his planes and his yachts,

680
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,511
and his horses,
and the bank is going to take it all.

681
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,172
You guys were his
smallest account.

682
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,915
I'm sorry.

683
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,576
It's okay.

684
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,086
Thought I'd give it a shot.

685
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,854
Kovaks,

686
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,525
you wanna get drunk?

687
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,924
Thanks.

688
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,470
I've got to be
honest with you, Kovaks.

689
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,268
The last time I drank this much at
a bar I made out with a fireman.

690
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,502
Really?
How long ago was that?

691
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,239
Tuesday.

692
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,607
You know,
you surprise me.

693
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,115
I saw the security tape of you
beating the shit out of Shaw's car.

694
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,676
That was badass.

695
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,452
Yeah, well,
badass is my middle name.

696
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,823
Nope. Your middle
name is Marvin.

697
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,362
I know that from
your file. Marvin.

698
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,424
All right.

699
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,460
That's my dead grandfather
you're laughing at.

700
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,263
What else is in my file?

701
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,695
Oh.

702
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,401
I know the year your
parents got divorced.

703
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,340
Your SAT scores.

704
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,036
You don't know
my SAT scores.

705
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,909
540, math.
480, verbal.

706
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,280
I retook those.
Your scores went down.

707
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,383
I have to
tell you something,

708
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,891
and I really shouldn't
be telling you this,

709
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,860
because it violates
everything I believe in.

710
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,396
Mmm-hmm.

711
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,955
We still haven't
found Shaw's safety net.

712
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,766
All these guys, they keep some cash
close by in case they have to run.

713
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,398
Shaw clears out all of his
accounts three months ago,

714
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,499
20 million and change.

715
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,737
But when we bust him,
the money isn't on him.

716
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,105
Wait.

717
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,211
$20 million?

718
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,417
There's a chance we'll
get lucky and find it.

719
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,622
And if we get lucky,
maybe you can get lucky.

720
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,158
I'm not lucky.

721
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,388
You just have
to be patient.

722
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,858
I don't really have
time to be patient.

723
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,901
Well, if you're
tired of waiting around,

724
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,129
you can always try
the old-school approach.

725
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,328
What's that?

726
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,270
Grab some pitchforks and a couple
of guys and storm the castle.

727
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,470
They'd never
see you coming.

728
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,603
I have to pee.

729
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,707
Ooh! I'm gonna...
I have to go.

730
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,115
Whoa, whoa.
You can't drive.

731
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,447
I'm gonna get a crab.

732
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,509
Crab?

733
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,080
Listen, you violated
three federal laws

734
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,785
when you beat up
Shaw's Ferrari.

735
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,818
So what?

736
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,830
So a lot of guys down at the
bureau want to buy you a drink,

737
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,365
and so do I.

738
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,630
Bye.

739
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,434
Goodbye.

740
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,954
Manuel.

741
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,585
Sorry, Mr.
K, I can't let you into the building.

742
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,857
No, no, I just have to grab some
stuff out of my office, okay?

743
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,023
I promise
I won't attack anyone.

744
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,088
I can't do it.

745
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:14,430
Or should I tell Mr.
Simon about you and the cougar in 2813?

746
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,305
Two minutes.
Okay.

747
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,750
Hi, welcome to Shake Shack.
What can I get you?

748
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,184
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

749
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,189
Welcome to Shake Shack.
What's shaking? We shake all day.

750
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,683
You like working here?

751
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,154
I cry at night.

752
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,987
You said you know
electrical engineering?

753
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,230
I'm on the phone
with the police.

754
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,769
They have a cruiser
in the area. Go away!

755
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,204
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh.
Can you open the door, please?

756
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,276
Hey.
Hey.

757
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,438
Why are you
staying in this motel?

758
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,483
I'm thinking of becoming a male prostitute.

759
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,410
I think I might
have a better idea.

760
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,095
Sasha told me
you took a job.

761
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,902
Oh, yeah. I'm using all the skills
you taught me as a concierge.

762
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,239
Thank you very much.
Hey, no spitting, blue shirt.

763
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,344
Suck it,
douche bag!

764
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,744
It's not a bad job.
Only problem is

765
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,782
I need 40 hours to
get on the insurance,

766
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,045
it's hard to get shifts,
but if I don't get on the insurance,

767
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,416
it's probably gonna end up costing us

768
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,478
around $20,000
to have the baby.

769
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,080
So we'll probably
have to sell it.

770
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,085
I need your help.

771
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,053
So you're saying you wanna rob
$20 million from Arthur Shaw.

772
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,259
Which you think he's
hidden in a secret wall safe

773
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,892
inside his
penthouse apartment.

774
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,527
An apartment which he's not allowed to leave

775
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,936
and is guarded by three FBI agents,
24 hours a day.

776
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,030
Two.

777
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,267
And you wanna do all of this in a building

778
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,604
with the most
advanced security

779
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,042
and surveillance
system in the world.

780
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,636
A building which we've all been
barred from ever entering again?

781
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,581
Yes. How do you
guys feel about that?

782
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,516
Well, I've really
enjoyed myself.

783
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,780
Thanks for the crackers.

784
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,913
Mr.
Fitzhugh, I know the money is in that safe.

785
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,685
How do you know?

786
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,283
Because in 2003,
Shaw remodeled.

787
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,660
He spent like 10 million to blow out the kitchen,
move the living room.

788
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,198
He even brought in
some guy from China

789
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,597
to do a whole
feng shui thing.

790
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,827
But he left
one wall standing,

791
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,392
dead center in the middle of the apartment.

792
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,767
That's where
he put the safe.

793
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,066
Maybe it's
a load-bearing wall.

794
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,800
No. No, it isn't.

795
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,102
We have the same
wall in my place.

796
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,871
We took it down
when we first moved in.

797
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,037
The FBI can't find the money,
because he hid it in the wall.

798
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,273
I know it!

799
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,118
So you guys
in or out?

800
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,409
Mr. Fitzhugh?

801
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,250
Come back to me.

802
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,023
Mr. Dev'R eaux?

803
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,824
You know how many weeks I'd have
to work at the BK to make 20 million?

804
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,163
18,600.

805
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,261
Charlie, come on.

806
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,703
Look at us.
We're basically waiters.

807
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,768
That's what we do. We bring people stuff.
We don't take things.

808
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,435
You and I know the movements of every person.

809
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,103
We know the schedules,
deliveries and codes

810
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,203
for every door
and window.

811
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,748
We've been casing the place for over a decade,
we just didn't know it.

812
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,374
We didn't know it,
because we weren't doing it.

813
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,941
But we were.
No.

814
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,782
Okay, where do the Lippmans
keep their passports?

815
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,713
In the freezer.
Mmm-hmm.

816
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,815
How many in vitro fertilizations
did Miss Hansen have

817
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,553
before she gave
birth to Jonah?

818
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,117
Six.
See? We know everything!

819
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,992
What's the pass code
for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

820
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,026
I just press
the PH button.

821
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,435
Come on, man.
I need you.

822
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,597
Yeah, you need me,
because you've got these idiots.

823
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,866
You think we're
getting our money back?

824
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,669
You think Lester is
getting his money?

825
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,403
I talked to the FBI.
It's gone!

826
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,871
So all this is about getting it back for Lester?

827
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,939
Yes! And Rose and Miss lovenko
and Manuel and you, you jerk!

828
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,209
Come on! Let's storm
the castle together.

829
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,221
Oh, like when they went
after Frankenstein?

830
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,688
No, it's a different
kind of storming.

831
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,691
It's a storming where the
peasants take everything back.

832
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,158
From like
the feudal lords and...

833
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,421
I'm in.

834
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,591
Holy shit! I'm in.

835
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,060
Holy shit! I'm in.

836
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,536
Well, now we're undefeatable,
aren't we?

837
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,834
Josh, we're not criminals.
We don't know how to steal.

838
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,172
It's okay,
I know someone who does.

839
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,469
Crack four!

840
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,854
You must have been saying
your prayers, Slide.

841
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,046
You made bail.

842
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,954
Slide.

843
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,627
Thought you might
need a ride.

844
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,402
I haven't driven
my Nova for a few months.

845
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,183
Did you know that in Spanish
<i>"No va"</i> means "It doesn't go"?

846
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,981
That's why they didn't sell
many in Latin America.

847
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,018
I didn't realize Rikers
was on an actual island.

848
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,993
I thought it was more of a...
I don't know, like a...

849
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,860
You know,
like the way Puget Sound is actually an inlet.

850
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,330
But they...

851
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,792
You hungry?
Can I buy you some lunch?

852
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,663
Slide, what are you doing?

853
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,763
Tell me why
you bailed me out!

854
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,032
Take your foot
off the gas!

855
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,440
Answer the goddamn
question first!

856
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,603
Slide!

857
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,272
Red light!

858
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,447
All right,
what's going on?

859
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,582
You wearing
a wire or something?

860
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,784
Some kind of police
undercover shit?

861
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,156
No, I'm not a cop!

862
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,127
Then you brought me out here
for some kind of freak shit, huh?

863
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,187
You want to stimulate my nut sack.
Is that what it is, punk?

864
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,596
No! Jesus!

865
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,998
Then what the hell we doing out here, man?
I don't even know your name.

866
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,002
I'm Josh Kovaks.

867
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,368
Man in the suit.
We talk almost every morning.

868
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,972
How come you
bailed me out, man?

869
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,600
I need help with something,
and I thought given our relationship

870
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,804
you might be
willing to help.

871
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,744
Relationship?
I ain't got no relationship with your ass!

872
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,803
Our history!

873
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,372
What history?
I see you walking by every now and then.

874
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,644
I say, "Hey, what's up,
little biatch?"

875
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,049
Just another
passer-by going by.

876
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,144
Just another
nigger walking by.

877
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,382
You don't remember 1971?
Mrs. Saltzburg?

878
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,158
We used to get dropped off at her
apartment every morning for day care.

879
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,626
In 1971 I'm six!
How am I supposed to remember some shit?

880
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,629
Come on, Darnell,
Mrs. Saltzburg!

881
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,688
Heavy-set German woman,
short goatee.

882
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,825
Man, you call me Darnell one more time,
I will beat you to death.

883
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,766
You don't remember
<i>Inch High, Private Eye?</i>

884
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,463
<i>Davey and Goliath?</i>
Remember Witchiepoo?

885
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,301
<i>H.R. Pufnstuf.</i>
You got freaked out by her?

886
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,397
Remember that
kid came over

887
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,999
and he stole my inhaler
and I couldn't breathe?

888
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,709
I do remember you!

889
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,078
You the little seizure boy that was
having them seizures all the time!

890
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,241
No, I never had
any seizures!

891
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,682
They were minor
spasms of the throat.

892
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,378
And I remember you would
start foaming up at the mouth

893
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,216
and your eyes would go crooked.
It was very scary!

894
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,516
There was no foaming.
That was you!

895
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,353
A lot of people have asthma when they're kids.

896
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,290
It's not a big deal.
I outgrew it. No. Seizure Boy.

897
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,487
You'd be on the floor rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

898
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,053
Asthma doesn't cause
seizures, all right?

899
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,996
Oh, really? Then how come nobody
wanted to play with your ass?

900
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,091
Nobody wanted to
have naptime with you,

901
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,430
nobody wanted to do
coloring with you or nothing.

902
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,491
Because of your
little seizures

903
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,037
and didn't nobody
want to catch that shit!

904
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,538
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, punk.

905
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,040
Why did you bail me out?

906
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,009
Because I have a job and I
thought that given your skill set

907
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,443
maybe you could
help us out.

908
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,070
What kind of
skill set is that?

909
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,047
Taking things that don't
necessarily belong to you.

910
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,257
Oh, little Seizure Boy want
to try to rob somebody, huh?

911
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,857
What you trying to steal?

912
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,459
$20 million.

913
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,233
Let's go get
something to eat.

914
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,334
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Slide.

915
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,813
You kidding, right?

916
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,315
These ain't the guys you
wanna try to do this job with.

917
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,444
Yes, this is Charlie and Dev'R eaux and Mr.
Fitzhugh.

918
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,680
This is a joke, right?

919
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,915
This guy is
the big time criminal?

920
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,013
Hey, what you say?

921
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,456
All right, guys, take it easy.
He's totally qualified.

922
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,016
He's been arrested
a bunch of times,

923
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,085
he pays no income taxes,
he's got two Doberman pinschers.

924
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,289
So let's show
him some respect.

925
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,457
So now we're like
<i>The Doberman Gang?</i>

926
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,557
Like the what?

927
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,531
It was a movie.
They trained Dobermans to knock off a bank.

928
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,072
Is that the one where Gregory
Peck was attacked by those dogs?

929
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,540
No, that's <i>Boys from Brazil</i>
with the cloned Hitlers.

930
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,577
Oh, shit. You guys ever
seen <i>Boys Don't Cry?</i>

931
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,737
When Hilary Swank
plays that dude.

932
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,110
That scared
the shit out of me.

933
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,949
Wait, Slide.
Sit down and talk with us for a second.

934
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,644
These guys ain't
got what it take.

935
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,879
I can look in
their eyes and see it.

936
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,079
First sign of trouble,
they're gonna be shitting in their pants.

937
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,589
They will not.
You don't know them.

938
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,082
You want me to prove it?

939
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,190
All right,
listen up,

940
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,821
y'all got 15 minutes to go out
there and steal me something.

941
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:00,955
What do you mean?

942
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,158
You heard what I said. In this mall,
right now, each one of y'all

943
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,667
go out there and individually
steal $50 worth of merchandise,

944
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,398
come back and put it on the table.
Then we'll talk.

945
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,608
Okay, 50 bucks,
no problem. Come on.

946
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,802
Can I go with you, Josh?

947
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,469
No, you ain't going with Josh,
you go by yourself.

948
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,570
Everybody
going by theirself.

949
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,705
Anybody can't
handle this, is out.

950
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,975
Okay. Guys,
we can do this.

951
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,710
It's just shoplifting.
You got 15 minutes, let's go.

952
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,752
And put your wallets on the table.
I don't want nobody cheating.

953
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,220
I don't want y'all to go buy
the shit and say you stole it.

954
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,450
All right, come on,
let's go.

955
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,498
This is a part of our Sexy
Little Things collection.

956
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,903
Oh, yeah, that's great.
Love that. Yeah.

957
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,439
Would you like me to
ring that up for you?

958
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,209
No, I think I'll just
live with it a little first.

959
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,719
These are very
pretty Bella earrings.

960
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,696
They're from our
Timeless Collection.

961
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,890
Do you have any studs?

962
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,628
Yes, several.

963
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,067
Right here.

964
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,338
Do you have any hoops?

965
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,842
Sir, all of our earrings
are on this display.

966
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,505
Do you have a catalog?

967
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,568
Uh...

968
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,513
I might have one in the back,
let me check.

969
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,285
How do those feel?

970
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,488
They feel a little tight.
Do you have them in a half size up?

971
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,690
Yeah, let me
check the back.

972
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,083
Hey, them two pairs of
drawers don't cost no $50.

973
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,221
$12 scented candle.

974
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,425
Okay, we'll get
to work tomorrow.

975
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,193
Wait a minute.
We all just proved ourselves.

976
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,757
How do we know you can
really pull this off?

977
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,099
You each stole
$50 worth of shit,

978
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,139
I stole $264 in cash.

979
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,800
Rule number one,
never give your wallet to a thief.

980
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,867
Later, bitches.

981
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,280
What are we doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

982
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,478
Can I get my jacket?

983
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,384
Everybody
shut up, right now.

984
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,984
In a robbery,
things can change quickly.

985
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,958
It can go from hot to cold,
just like that.

986
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,023
You have to be ready to adapt to the situation.

987
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,262
You have to be able
to think on your feet.

988
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,169
I was on a job a few days ago where
my homie got shot in the face.

989
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,498
He's kidding, right?

990
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,869
Get shot in the head,
it's over.

991
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,206
If you get shot in your head,
it's over. If you get shot in your face,

992
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,371
the bullet will go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

993
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,811
Then what you
gonna do, sissy?

994
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,610
Die. I'm gonna die.

995
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,641
I saw a television show once

996
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,186
about a guy who got shot
in the head with a nail gun.

997
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,881
He couldn't even remember
how to chew anymore.

998
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,389
He had to put
everything in a blender.

999
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,081
Yo, he couldn't
figure out how to chew,

1000
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,524
but he could
operate a Cuisinart?

1001
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,993
I don't think he
operated it himself.

1002
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,996
All right, could we just focus, please?
It's 16 degrees!

1003
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,531
That's right!
Let's focus!

1004
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,964
Now, earlier today
I taught you all

1005
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,626
how to pick a lock
with a bobby pin.

1006
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,828
I want y'all to
practice on this door.

1007
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,394
I've got bobby pins for all of y'all.
Here's your bobby pin.

1008
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,996
This is your bobby pin.

1009
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,905
Here's your bobby pin.

1010
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,809
This is your punk-ass
bobby pin. Take it!

1011
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,373
You unlock the door,
you won't freeze to death.

1012
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,547
I'm gonna be inside
having sex with Rita.

1013
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,521
Who's Rita?

1014
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,583
To get in the building,
we have to avoid seven exterior cameras

1015
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,096
and six doormen who work at two
entrance points in rotating shifts.

1016
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,564
Once inside,
we'll be faced with four security officers,

1017
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,067
who monitor a bank of
12 internal cameras,

1018
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,762
as well as two
floating security guards,

1019
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,361
who vary
the patrol route each day.

1020
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,497
If we make it
through all of that,

1021
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,699
we still have to get
through this gauntlet

1022
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,401
of employees to
get to the elevators.

1023
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,465
Questions?

1024
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,478
Yeah. Who's that
girl in the red dress?

1025
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,138
She got the kind of titties I like to play with.

1026
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,375
That's Mary-Ann from sales.
She's a lesbian.

1027
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,708
Okay, that's irrelevant.

1028
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,978
Mary-Ann
is a lesbian?

1029
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,883
She was married when she sold me my unit.

1030
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,047
She makes lesbian sex with
Lynn Rutherford from accounting.

1031
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,318
Okay...
Lynn is a lesbian?

1032
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,552
Wait, I'm lost.

1033
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,856
How many lesbians total
do we have to avoid?

1034
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,487
None. We're not
avoiding lesbians.

1035
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,897
I don't avoid lesbians at all.
I seek lesbians out.

1036
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,634
Lesbians got
the nicest titties.

1037
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,400
Straight women,
they have guys

1038
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,735
pulling and yanking on them
and sweating on them.

1039
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,240
Lesbians get touched
delicately by other lesbians.

1040
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,606
It's nice.

1041
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,235
Did anybody take in
what I just said?

1042
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,143
Well, it seems like there's
a gauntlet of lesbians.

1043
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,545
No. The...

1044
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,314
All right,
I'm just gonna keep going.

1045
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,982
1:27, NYPD makes third
pass in front of the building.

1046
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,321
The parking
enforcement officer

1047
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,123
only works the west
side of the street.

1048
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,787
She got
a fat ass, too.

1049
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,229
All right, baby,
I'll call you after lunch.

1050
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,560
I'm in a restaurant
with Josh

1051
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,897
and a couple of other guys
across from The Tower.

1052
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,897
Yeah. I love you.

1053
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,033
What are you doing?
It's supposed to be a secret.

1054
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,036
I can't tell my wife
I'm having a lunch?

1055
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,774
We're not having lunch.
We're casing the front of the building.

1056
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,338
Now they can trace
our steps back to us.

1057
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,975
I didn't tell her what
restaurant we were at.

1058
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,713
You said,
"The restaurant across from The Tower."

1059
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,778
I didn't say which restaurant
across from The Tower.

1060
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,949
Geez, a hamburger's $24.
We can't afford to eat here anyway.

1061
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,550
Hey, we can order whatever we like, because

1062
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,718
Lunch is on me.

1063
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,960
This is the main
electrical room.

1064
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,402
You can override the elevators from
here or shut them down completely.

1065
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,963
Mr. Dev'R eaux, who took some
courses at DeVry Technical Institute,

1066
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,303
is gonna be our
point man on this.

1067
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,071
Online.
What?

1068
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,106
I went there to go get my
master's in electronics,

1069
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,911
but somebody said,
"You got to go to college first."

1070
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,213
I was, like, "Yeah,
it wasn't in the brochure."

1071
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,749
Okay,
but you understand what...

1072
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,850
Absolutely. I weld stuff and I'm, like,
you flip it on and off.

1073
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,189
It's all about power.

1074
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,932
Hey, man, how is this supposed to
be right if you made it out of Legos?

1075
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,865
Well, the dimensions
are completely accurate.

1076
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,237
Yeah, who's this
little nigglet? Webster?

1077
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,671
Man, you might as well use
Lincoln Logs or Tinkertoys.

1078
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,968
I got your ski caps.

1079
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,202
What?

1080
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,871
No, no, no.
Ski masks. Masks.

1081
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,039
Yeah, but the guy said that these
were the warmest ever made.

1082
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,446
With pompoms?
You serious?

1083
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,576
You're such an idiot. I need a mask.
It has to cover your face.

1084
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,350
Josh, let's say
we get the money

1085
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,821
and make it outside,
then what?

1086
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,421
Slide is the only one with
no connection to The Tower.

1087
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,324
So he's agreed to hold the money for a week.

1088
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,419
Are you crazy?
You're gonna give this guy $20 million?

1089
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,486
He's a crook!

1090
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,964
What you say? Say it again.
I didn't hear shit.

1091
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,591
Speak into the microphone!
- Hey! Hey!

1092
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,862
Why don't you
say it again, punk?

1093
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,426
Come on, Slide, no guns.

1094
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,263
You running
things now, huh?

1095
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,773
Man in the suit got
it all figured out?

1096
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,536
No, man in the suit doesn't
have it all figured out,

1097
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,975
but man with the gun
needs to understand

1098
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,944
what man in the suit is trying
to accomplish here, all right?

1099
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,037
Why you talking like that?

1100
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,241
You were talking like that!
Why can't I talk like that?

1101
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,375
What you think, this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

1102
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,283
and roll this dude for $20 million without a fight?

1103
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,181
Look, no guns.
End of story, all right?

1104
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,918
What if we run into some
shit in there we don't expect?

1105
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,516
Trust me,
there won't be any surprises.

1106
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,392
It's the FBI lady
and two cops.

1107
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,403
Shit! We haven't
done anything yet.

1108
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,701
We're plotters. We've plotted.
That's a crime, right?

1109
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,797
Is that a crime?

1110
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:58,898
Everybody, just relax.

1111
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,340
You relax!
I'm out on bail.

1112
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,177
I'm gonna go in the closet.
I'm coming with you.

1113
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,974
Guys, it's okay,
I think she's here for me.

1114
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,139
Go find
your own spot.

1115
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,413
Hey, Agent Denham, what a surprise.
What's with the police?

1116
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,457
Josh, Arthur Shaw
is gonna walk.

1117
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,416
What?

1118
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,757
The judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing.

1119
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,159
They're acting
like he's untouchable.

1120
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,760
That's it? He just
gets away with it?

1121
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:23,821
That's not it.

1122
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,061
He's threatening to press charges against you.

1123
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,104
He wants you to
answer for the Ferrari.

1124
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,468
So they're here
to arrest me?

1125
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,133
He says he'll drop the whole
thing if you apologize.

1126
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,437
A sincere apology,

1127
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,578
that's what Shaw wants.

1128
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:36,771
And if I don't do it?

1129
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,581
Then these gentlemen
will read you your rights.

1130
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:02,097
You know what's considered the greatest
move in the history of chess, Josh?

1131
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,935
A man named
Frank James Marshall

1132
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,567
was losing to a man
named Levitsky in 1912,

1133
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,577
world championship
in Helsinki.

1134
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:13,947
And it looked like Marshall had no
chance until he moved 23 queen G-3.

1135
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,451
He deliberately
sacrificed his queen

1136
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,646
and the move was so shocking and surprising

1137
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,815
that Levitsky
never got over it.

1138
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,415
He lost the game
two moves later.

1139
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:28,055
And the move became known in the
annals of chess as the "Marshall swindle."

1140
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,459
I'm a very good chess player,
but I'm no swindler.

1141
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,008
What you did to my Ferrari
was the move of a small man.

1142
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,977
But now it's my move,
and I'm not sure how I want to play this.

1143
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,049
All I'd like
to say, Mr. Shaw,

1144
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,278
is someday I'm gonna find
a way to make things right.

1145
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,147
I don't care
what I have to do,

1146
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,518
I will find
a way to pay you back

1147
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,920
for everything
that has been done.

1148
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,091
Good, because I know how
difficult it must be for you

1149
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,629
to lose a service job
like this at your age.

1150
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:05,133
And one day when all this is ancient history,
I hope you can come back,

1151
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,964
maybe not as a building
manager at first,

1152
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,904
but somewhere where you can start over,
earn our trust.

1153
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,372
A doorman,
for instance.

1154
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,377
Now go home and practice your chess game.

1155
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,748
I'll study the "Marshall swindle," sir.

1156
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,946
Anybody can sacrifice
their queen, Josh.

1157
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,518
The real trick is
getting away with it.

1158
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,658
Thanks for the ride.

1159
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,562
Any time.
Oh, God, wait a minute,
