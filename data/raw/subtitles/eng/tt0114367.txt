1
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:25,157
The year 2078.
A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.

2
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:32,434
For 50 years, the New Economic
Block, the NEB Corporation, -

3
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,607
- has controlled mining
throughout the known solar systems.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,781
20 years ago, on Sirius 6B, -

5
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,363
- the NEB discovered the solution
to the energy crisis. Berynium.

6
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:49,532
But mining berynium unleashed lethal
doses of radiation and pollution.

7
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:53,872
''The Alliance'', a federation
of mine workers and scientists, -

8
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:57,083
- demanded mining be stopped.

9
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:01,089
The NEB 's reponse
was to declare all-out war.

10
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,590
This conflict has fuelled
a new cold war on Earth, -

11
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,893
- but so far the fighting
has been confined to Sirius 6B.

12
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:17,606
Massive NEB bombing raids have
devastated this beautiful planet.

13
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:22,273
Thousands have been killed
by deadly berynium radiation.

14
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:26,991
Now, in the tenth year of the war,
the survivors on Sirius 6B -

15
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:31,787
- are faced with a new threat
beyond imagination . . .

16
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,060
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.

17
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,451
Okay, l see your five.

18
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,961
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.

19
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,506
This game sucks.

20
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:47,180
This whole place sucks.

21
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,615
Lieutenant, l think you"d
better have a look at this.

22
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:35,388
What the hell is he doing here?

23
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,602
Tell the captain we"ve got
a situation. A NEB coming in.

24
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:47,570
- How did he get this far?
- l"m going to take him.

25
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,400
He"s mine.

26
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:17,303
- What are you waiting for?
- Something"s not right. He"s alone.

27
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:27,773
Here comes the cavalry.

28
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:45,256
No matter how many times
l see this, it still makes me sick.

29
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:59,437
l"m glad
those things are on our side.

30
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:06,361
Our side"s the good side, right?
Tell me again, it"s a little blurry.

31
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:11,078
We created them.
We didn"t have any choice.

32
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:15,830
Without the screamers
we"d have lost the war.

33
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:21,792
- ls the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.

34
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:27,802
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?

35
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:32,930
He had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us.

36
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:41,066
Well . . .
l guess l"d better take a look.

37
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:44,484
Are you going out there?

38
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:48,948
That"s a great plan.
lt"s probably some kind of bomb.

39
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:53,446
Get off your butt
and open the goddamn door.

40
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:12,595
Check your tabs, sir.

41
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,618
CRUClAL: TO ALLlANCE COM MANDER

42
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:50,280
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.

43
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,496
- ""Don Giovanni.""
- Don Giovanni?

44
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,750
What the hell do you want, Chuck?

45
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,664
Tear your eye away from that coin,
and l"ll tell you.

46
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,876
lt"s the portrait of a sphinx.

47
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:11,010
lt belonged to Augustus Caesar, the
first great emperor of the world.

48
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:16,092
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven"t
seen a NEB soldier in six months.

49
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,015
Why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer -

50
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,357
- trying to hand deliver this?

51
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:33,700
Priority seven. You and me . . . and
God, if he"s still paying attention.

52
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,944
l doubt it.

53
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:46,541
- ls it a trick?
- l couldn"t get into it, either.

54
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:50,415
- Don"t do that!
- Scared you, didn"t l?

55
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:55,304
Jesus!

56
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:06,263
""From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command.""

57
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:11,186
""To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency.""

58
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:14,732
""Demand immediate
peace negotiation.""

59
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:20,578
""Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed.""

60
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:24,958
""We await your arrival ASAP.""

61
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:29,206
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.

62
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:35,832
- We"ve been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?

63
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,296
The end of the war.

64
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:44,134
Maybe it"s another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back.

65
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,596
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:56,738
l want the following message
transmitted to San Francisco.

67
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:01,448
Have received first contact
from NEB army in six months.

68
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:06,659
They wish to open peace
negotiations. Please advise.

69
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:11,789
We picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport.

70
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:15,910
We"re 5 million miles
off of the shipping lanes.

71
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,926
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.

72
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:25,844
Joe, what do you make of this?

73
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:32,927
Looks like a map
of the forward command post.

74
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:37,933
- They"re laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?

75
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:43,650
They"ve been completely silent
for two weeks. Not even radio.

76
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:48,486
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?

77
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:06,004
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.

78
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:22,725
Joe, Chuck, l have some very
inspiring news for you all.

79
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:27,861
Alliance HQ has been keeping
it classified. Wrapped up tight.

80
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:32,695
The NEB Corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice.

81
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:37,663
We could actually end this war.

82
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:41,617
Reserves of berynium
have been found on Triton 4.

83
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:49,091
After extensive testing,
there"s no sign of radioactivity.

84
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:53,721
We are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement.

85
00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:00,225
We"d also renew contracts
with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.

86
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:05,023
These negotiations
are extremely delicate -

87
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:10,566
- and we can"t afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart . . .

88
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:14,274
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.

89
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:22,154
- There"s radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.

90
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:28,087
Morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit.

91
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:35,424
lt is imperative to make no contact
with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.

92
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:42,215
l"m sure you won"t do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now.

93
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:51,611
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.

94
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,692
Now they"re mining on Triton 4,
peace is in their interest.

95
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:59,316
- Thank God for Green.
- He"s a good man.

96
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:02,910
He prevented a war on Earth.

97
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:07,078
A war on Earth
might"ve done them some good.

98
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,833
lf those assholes
rolled around in the mud.

99
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:14,373
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.

100
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,297
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.

101
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:30,139
l just want to go home.

102
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:34,641
What"s the first thing you"ll do?

103
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,985
l"ve got no plans for the future.

104
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:41,820
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- lncome tax.

105
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:50,457
Are you going to look her up
when you get back?

106
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:55,915
- What for?
- You tell me.

107
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:01,630
She couldn"t take it.
She"s married and moved on . . .

108
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,672
. . . and l"m still here.

109
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:09,473
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?

110
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:13,687
lt used to be every minute,
then once a day.

111
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:18,149
About twice a year
l get a kick in the chest.

112
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:21,022
What did she look like?

113
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:25,607
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.

114
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:29,531
l left mine in the office.
Have you got one?

115
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:36,578
He must have been a brave man . . .
that NEB soldier.

116
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:49,793
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.

117
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:26,040
- They"re not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.

118
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:29,381
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.

119
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:34,592
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!

120
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:39,093
We"re going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.

121
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:45,807
""Sirius 6B Transportation.""
We"ve got no transportation service!

122
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:51,404
- What the hell is that?
- You"ve got to look at this.

123
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:58,743
- Look at this.
- And this. lt"s a bomb factory.

124
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:01,616
Holy shit!

125
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,707
A nuclear reactor!

126
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:10,118
- When did we last see one of these?
- What"s happening here?

127
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,623
Come on.

128
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:20,507
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. l"m all right.

129
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:24,810
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell"s a tab?

130
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:29,474
- This guy"s naked here.
- Hold on a second.

131
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,314
One second!

132
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,004
l"m out of here.

133
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,706
DEPT. OF DEFENCE

134
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:43,294
REVlSED

135
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,557
You wanted to see me, Commander?

136
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:06,816
Yeah.
At ease, we"re informal around here.

137
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,157
That"ll be all, Rodgers.

138
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:18,245
- How are you doing?
- Good . . . there"s a scar on my arm.

139
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:23,542
lf you go outside without a tab on,
you"ll lose your arm. Name?

140
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:28,127
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.

141
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:31,338
First class.

142
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:36,804
Level six? You can shoot
the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards.

143
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:42,397
lf you can load it, l can shoot it.
lnstructors used to call me ""Ace"".

144
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:46,693
- Everybody here calls me ""sir"".
- Yes, sir.

145
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:57,779
- Sir, what are they?
- lt"s a sword. Take a look.

146
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:03,907
Screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground.

147
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:10,249
- How do you know it"s dead?
- l yanked its brain out.

148
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:17,090
- That"ll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.

149
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:20,763
lt still has
a mechanical surface reflex.

150
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:25,347
They get shot up, but can still
swing a sword. Pretty smart.

151
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:30,982
Maybe too smart.
lt seems to have modified itself.

152
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:35,281
Where"s everybody else?
The guys who were with me?

153
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:40,324
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.

154
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:43,828
Now there"s one, including you.

155
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,497
Those guys . . .

156
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:57,419
l didn"t even know them.
l couldn"t even talk to them.

157
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:03,181
Jefferson . . . what in the hell
are you doing here?

158
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:09,019
There was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture.

159
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:15,860
- l wasn"t aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.

160
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:21,532
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.

161
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,993
Why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons?

162
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:29,198
To invade, attack
and extinguish the enemy.

163
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:34,158
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.

164
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:38,204
You were going to attack
the NEBs on Triton 4?

165
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:43,377
Yes . . . but we"re just a task force.

166
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:50,220
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are
on their way to Triton 4 right now.

167
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:54,225
- Secretary Green informed us . . .
- Secretary Green?

168
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:58,893
- That"s right.
- Secretary Green is gone.

169
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:04,903
He"s been gone
for almost two years.

170
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:10,233
We got a V. R. communique
from him yesterday.

171
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:16,700
Secretary Green was arrested and
eliminated by the Alliance command.

172
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:22,080
Two years ago.

173
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:33,590
Dismissed.

174
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:40,017
- l enlisted to fight . . .
- Dismissed, Jefferson.

175
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:45,695
- The NEBs have been running . . .
- Get out of here!

176
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:02,249
What in God"s name
are we doing, Chuck?

177
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:09,457
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!

178
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:15,803
You know as well as l do that
they can send us anything they want.

179
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:22,682
- That kid doesn"t know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.

180
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:27,398
Do you expect me to believe
that we"re being dumped?

181
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:32,644
That our 20-year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush?

182
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:35,859
They keep sending us provisions.

183
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:41,953
Will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe?

184
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:45,658
- l don"t buy it.
- Wake up, man!

185
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:50,544
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.

186
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:57,168
Green"s been shit-canned
and this whole place is a lie!

187
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:01,928
They just can"t
cut us off up here.

188
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,852
Families on Earth would raise hell.

189
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,305
And they won"t take us back there.

190
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:13,522
lf we sound off about this, nobody"s
going to fight their war for them.

191
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:18,570
They"re just going to let us
roll on and on up here.

192
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:22,027
We ain"t ever getting off here.

193
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:27,541
Marshall Cooper and
his NEB Command knows it, too!

194
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:30,163
He sent us a map.

195
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:36,788
Your solitary NEB grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing.

196
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:39,920
They know it"s pointless now.

197
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:46,381
- Where are you going?
- l"m going to NEB Command.

198
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,559
We"ll make our own peace right here.

199
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:58,819
NEB said they wanted two men.

200
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:08,032
Somebody"s got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky.

201
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:11,323
- l"ll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?

202
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:16,077
l"m not risking any more of our men.

203
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:24,673
This is your tab.
lt won"t work for anybody but you.

204
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:27,881
That makes me feel a lot better.

205
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:31,888
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.

206
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,437
Your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.

207
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:41,516
ln theory they work perfectly,
but radioactivity corrodes them.

208
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:45,442
- What then?
- We thank God you"re a good gunner.

209
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:03,125
l was remembering that day
up in Point Reyes.

210
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:07,840
- That bartender . . .
- With the monkey.

211
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:14,427
The beach. We sat drinking beer,
watching the humpbacks blowing.

212
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:20,684
You watched the whales, Joe.
l was watching other things.

213
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:25,232
We should go back there.
l"d like to see that again.

214
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:30,277
What, girls volleyball?

215
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:38,828
Hey, Joe . . .

216
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:41,915
l"ll see you soon.

217
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:46,959
On that day. Jefferson, are you
coming or are you breathing hard?

218
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,965
Good luck.

219
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,976
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.

220
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:57,401
Cicero reading you loud and clear.

221
00:30:57,654 --> 00:31:03,443
Next transmission will be 33:00
and then every 4 hours after that.

222
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:08,079
lf l miss one, don"t sweat it.
lf l miss two . . .

223
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:12,495
. . . move into the office,
change the music and carry on.

224
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:17,911
l'll take the office, but the
''Don Giovanni'' will have to go.

225
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,759
Roger, copy.

226
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,367
- The air is terrible out here.
- lt"s what"s in the air.

227
00:31:56,543 --> 00:32:03,079
- What, radiation?
- This"ll neutralize it. Here.

228
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:08,626
- lt"s an anti-radiation red.
- That"s what poisoned it?

229
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:15,637
That used to be the most profitable,
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.

230
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:20,188
lt produced berynium. The answer
to the world"s energy question.

231
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:24,355
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.

232
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:28,442
Then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation.

233
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:33,407
We thought we"d discovered gold . . .
but we discovered shit.

234
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:40,326
And you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs.

235
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:48,416
- How do you know it"s working?
- lf you don"t die.

236
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,975
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.

237
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,179
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?

238
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,351
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.

239
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:12,025
You just don"t have a clue about
what brought you here, do you?

240
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:17,192
You"d fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right.

241
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,995
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.

242
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:26,874
The Alliance was formed
to support you.

243
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:34,422
You"re right, Jefferson. And it
divided my country and my world.

244
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:40,097
So as much as you"re dying
to get shot by some NEB soldier, -

245
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:44,677
- we"re going to make peace
with these people, you and me.

246
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:50,144
We"re going to rip you off
of that experience.

247
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:57,399
Look at this place.

248
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:03,694
l came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the NEB.

249
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:06,871
We were all NEBs then.

250
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,544
The scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines.

251
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:18,714
The NEB Corporation threatened them,
and there was a stand-off for years.

252
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:22,883
They they started to rain everything
down on us.

253
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:26,756
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs,
bacteria crystals.

254
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:33,731
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.

255
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,106
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.

256
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:43,146
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.

257
00:34:43,324 --> 00:34:45,780
The screamer.

258
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,660
Save it.

259
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,955
They don"t eat rats, do they?

260
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:04,794
We"re not sure.
They"re scavengers and they learn.

261
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,474
They use everything. Rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel.

262
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,642
Maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax.

263
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:18,556
Are they machines? Are they alive?
l don"t understand . . .

264
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:22,148
l don"t have the answers, Jefferson.

265
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,364
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.

266
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:30,446
The first design was sent to us
from the Alliance on Earth.

267
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:33,739
lt"s all automated now.

268
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:39,252
No one"s been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran.

269
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:45,503
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?

270
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:50,170
They"re down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows?

271
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:55,552
Am l speaking Swahili?
That"s exactly what l mean.

272
00:35:56,893 --> 00:36:00,060
Hit the dirt!

273
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:11,358
Come out of there!

274
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:16,526
Come out of there!

275
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:20,244
Come forward.

276
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:29,293
- Stop.
- Can l come with you?

277
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,708
My God . . .

278
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:35,218
- Cover me.
- Go.

279
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:44,725
Jefferson.

280
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:08,160
You all right? lt"s okay.

281
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:20,919
What have you got there?

282
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,766
Let me see.

283
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:30,936
That"s a good guy.
No, you keep him.

284
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:36,102
That"s your friend.
Where do you live?

285
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:40,358
- ln there?
- Yes.

286
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,569
ln the ruins?

287
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:51,204
How many are you?
How many people?

288
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:55,788
- You"re alone? How do you survive?
- Food.

289
00:37:55,963 --> 00:38:00,292
- What kind of food?
- Different.

290
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:05,176
How do you keep away
from the screamers?

291
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:09,428
- The blades underground that kill.
- l hide.

292
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:14,429
- Can l come with you?
- No, you stay here.

293
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:20,395
Give me a macro-ration.
We"ll give you something to eat.

294
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:26,405
We"ll come back for you.
ln two or three days we"ll find you.

295
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:34,160
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.

296
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:41,249
- l want to come with you now.
- We"ll come back in two days.

297
00:38:41,423 --> 00:38:45,467
You take care of this guy, okay?

298
00:38:55,478 --> 00:39:00,934
We can"t just leave him here.
He"s a kid. He"ll never survive.

299
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:05,485
- What am l saying?
- Can l come with you?

300
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:30,083
- What"s your name?
- David Edward Dearing.

301
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:50,434
- Where"s your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.

302
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:54,278
You"ve been alone here
for four years?

303
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,242
Everything seems to be okay.
ls it safe to make a fire like this?

304
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:03,030
We want to let them know
we"re coming.

305
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:08,581
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?

306
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:13,997
l had this friend,
he used to eat them. Rats.

307
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:16,927
You"ll appreciate this . . .

308
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:22,801
You don"t just heat up the oil,
that makes them stick to the pan.

309
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:27,934
You get the pan hot, put the oil
in cold, then add your rats.

310
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:31,771
But don"t crowd the pan,
it sucks all the heat out.

311
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:35,691
You keep flipping them,
or they burn.

312
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:39,113
- My friend said . .
- Jefferson!

313
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:44,822
You must be confusing me
with somebody who gives a shit.

314
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:51,450
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.

315
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:56,207
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?

316
00:40:56,383 --> 00:41:01,210
lt"s cold.
We"re at 1 4 degrees north latitude.

317
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:05,515
We expect to reach
the NEB Command . . .

318
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:08,684
. . . in about four hours. Hello . .?

319
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:13,810
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.

320
00:41:13,982 --> 00:41:16,734
Chuck, you"re breaking up.

321
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:21,314
You"ll get your next transmission
at 00:00 hours.

322
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:26,068
- Libby, over.
- lt seems a little strange . . .

323
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:43,758
lf you"re gonna be a rock,
be a rock. Don"t be a bug.

324
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:48,672
Don"t do that to me!
l nearly pissed my pants . . . sir.

325
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:52,181
Things ain"t what they used to be.

326
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:13,136
Jefferson!

327
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:33,813
- Didn"t you hear it?
- No.

328
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,950
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?

329
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:52,456
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.

330
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:56,628
- Doesn"t it work if it"s nearby?
- lt stays on your arm!

331
00:43:56,802 --> 00:44:01,178
l"m already dragging one kid around.
Do l have to tie your shoes for you?

332
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,844
Your tab was on
and it was going for you.

333
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:13,021
What is this?
l"ve never seen this.

334
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,405
lt looks like an animal.

335
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,656
lt"s not an animal.
lt"s an upgrade.

336
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:30,367
- Maybe it"s a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.

337
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:34,669
We"re getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.

338
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:39,583
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.

339
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:46,257
You soap the socks the night before.

340
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:50,346
The water dries out
but the soap stays in.

341
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:55,560
- You"ve got soap against skin . . .
- Have you got a dimmer switch?

342
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:59,943
lf you put a teddy bear
in a microwave, nothing will happen.

343
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:04,274
- But a wet frog . . .
- Shut up.

344
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:49,582
Jefferson!

345
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:57,303
Goddamn screamer!
lt wanted to kill us.

346
00:46:57,471 --> 00:47:04,802
lt can see us and touch us.
l can"t tell what the signals say.

347
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:07,350
lt can talk.

348
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,324
- He"s a fucking toaster.
- That"s right.

349
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:34,085
Pinocchio"s not a real little boy.

350
00:47:34,256 --> 00:47:39,250
- Why didn"t it try to kill us?
- lt was tagging you.

351
00:47:39,427 --> 00:47:44,931
They"re smarter now. They get
into our bunkers. They tag along.

352
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,764
Who can resist a kid
with a hard luck story?

353
00:47:49,937 --> 00:47:54,564
Once it gets inside, the killing
starts. But you knew that already.

354
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:58,980
- You brought him in here.
- lt found us.

355
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:02,440
What is your reason for being here?

356
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:06,862
We were invited here
for a peace negotiation.

357
00:48:07,037 --> 00:48:13,039
Marshall Cooper sent this
from NEB headquarters.

358
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:21,078
You want to negotiate . .?

359
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:24,377
We ain"t gonna do it here.

360
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:34,641
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?

361
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:43,733
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.

362
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:20,867
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?

363
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:26,375
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

364
00:50:27,877 --> 00:50:34,377
- How is it out there?
- We"ve got a new kind of screamer.

365
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:38,844
- l can't hear you real well.
- lt"s a kid. A little boy.

366
00:50:39,013 --> 00:50:44,848
- Don"t let it into the bunker.
- l can't hear you.

367
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:48,102
There's too much interference.

368
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:11,705
That kid, he was like a person.

369
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:15,043
How did he know what to say?

370
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:19,542
You think Santa
makes them his little elves?

371
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:22,718
They"ve got more brains than you.

372
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:26,006
Fighting won"t solve our problems.

373
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:33,014
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.

374
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:37,565
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.

375
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:42,360
- What"s that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.

376
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:45,366
You guys brought them here.

377
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:48,569
Only after the bombing started.

378
00:51:48,745 --> 00:51:54,414
But now they don"t care what uniform
is covering your ass.

379
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:57,793
- Neither do l.
- Slow down, soldier.

380
00:51:57,794 --> 00:51:59,419
- Neither do l.
- Slow down, soldier.

381
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:03,206
Would you mind
taking that outside?

382
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:06,668
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

383
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:12,763
lt"s worth a lot more
when it ain"t all shot to . . . shit.

384
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:18,059
l"m letting you stay here out of
the kindness of my heart, Becker.

385
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:25,645
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.

386
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:32,024
Second, this is my place,
and nobody touches anything.

387
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:35,784
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.

388
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:41,458
No spitting.

389
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:47,039
Spare a cigarette?

390
00:52:56,183 --> 00:52:59,468
Well, gentlemen . . .

391
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,637
Live it up.

392
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,661
l haven"t had an American cigarette
in over a year.

393
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,621
There"s plenty back at base,
but l forgot to bring them.

394
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:36,342
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.

395
00:53:42,684 --> 00:53:45,638
What is this place, a commissary?

396
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:51,353
There hasn"t been a commissary here
in over two years.

397
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:54,895
Not since those blades arrived.

398
00:53:55,072 --> 00:54:01,026
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander . . .

399
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:03,609
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.

400
00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:07,737
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

401
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:10,953
- lt"s early in the day for that.
- Yeah.

402
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:15,496
l"m looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.

403
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:19,920
He"d be in the command bunker,
if there still is one.

404
00:54:21,137 --> 00:54:24,838
What about
your communication satellites?

405
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:29,014
lf they"re still working,
they"d be in there, too.

406
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,938
What do you mean by that?

407
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:35,854
You have no idea
of the hell you opened up.

408
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:43,606
We opened up? Just tell me
where the command bunker is.

409
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:49,453
You wouldn"t last ten yards
out there without me.

410
00:54:49,622 --> 00:54:54,616
- Have you seen it?
- l heard it.

411
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:58,293
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?

412
00:54:58,464 --> 00:55:03,292
Davids. l heard them
screaming into the bunker above us.

413
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:06,719
l heard the soldiers screaming.

414
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:09,426
Then it got very quiet.

415
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:18,099
Nothing . . .
except the smell of death.

416
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:28,358
- Still want a guided tour?
- lf Cooper is alive, l"ll find him.

417
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,653
l"ll take you to Command.
We"ll go underground.

418
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,459
- l want something in return.
- Speak.

419
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,417
- l want off this ashtray.
- Where?

420
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:52,803
Earth. How long do you think
l"m gonna last in here?

421
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:58,928
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.

422
00:55:59,104 --> 00:56:04,561
They"ve hung everybody
on this planet out to dry.

423
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:11,360
Good Lord, you"re beautiful.

424
00:56:14,994 --> 00:56:19,905
l can take you back
to the Alliance bunker.

425
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:24,031
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?

426
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:29,168
She"s taking me to NEB Command
and l"m taking her to Alliance.

427
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,958
Cosy.

428
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:37,798
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?

429
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:42,932
You can relocate anywhere
if you can get off this globe.

430
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:47,397
Or you can go straight to hell
for all l care.

431
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:52,192
You"re crazy.
You don"t know what"s down there.

432
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:56,940
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.

433
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:09,498
Look at this. lt"s one of ours.

434
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:14,297
She"s got everything.
And l found something else.

435
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:27,550
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.

436
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:32,639
Plutonium? Have l been
blowing smoke out of my ass?

437
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:38,938
We"ve not used nukes in this war yet
and we"re not going to use them now.

438
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:42,235
So leave it.

439
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:07,306
Okay, let"s get on the good foot.
Anybody that"s coming, come on.

440
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:11,259
""When he"s best,
he"s little worse than a man.""

441
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:16,146
""And when he"s worst,
he"s little better than a beast.""

442
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:20,361
l never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.

443
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:25,155
Ain"t it sharp enough yet?

444
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:32,446
lt"s never sharp enough.

445
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:49,464
l"m not sure if these tabs work,
but stay close to me and Jefferson.

446
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,090
Let"s go.

447
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:26,666
This leads to the maintenance tunnel
underneath the command bunker.

448
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:36,175
l ain"t going in there.

449
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:39,991
Don"t tell me a big guy like you
is scared of mice!

450
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:45,117
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.

451
01:00:45,289 --> 01:00:50,413
ls that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.

452
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:56,375
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!

453
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:32,365
We"re almost there.

454
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:04,150
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.

455
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:35,674
REDlSCOVER PARADlSE ON
SlRUS 6B

456
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:18,049
- What the hell is this?
- lt"s exactly what you think it is.

457
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:23,852
l knew it!

458
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:27,271
We"re all gonna die!

459
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:37,319
Jefferson, if that man moves,
or even farts, shoot him.

460
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,786
Shut up.

461
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:13,605
lf Richard Cooper were alive,
he"d be here, wouldn"t he?

462
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:25,986
The ComSat stabilizers
are all frozen.

463
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,832
This one"s free.

464
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:47,721
Uplink attempt initiated.
Sat Net downlink does not respond.

465
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:59,691
Malfunction.
Sat Net does not respond.

466
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,263
Way to go, Ross.

467
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:11,271
Can l come with you?

468
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:25,454
Jefferson, get everybody
out of here now. Do it!

469
01:07:25,623 --> 01:07:28,410
Go.

470
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:20,669
AUTONOMOUS MOBlLE SWORD
TYPE 1 REVlSED

471
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:44,020

472
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:10,421
AUTONOMOUS MOBlLE SWORD

474
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:22,056
Can l come with you?

475
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:38,912
We"re not leaving
without Hendricksson.

476
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:15,946
Can l come with you?

477
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:22,864
- Can l come with you?
- Jefferson!

478
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,289
Cute, Jefferson.

479
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:51,976
lt won"t take them long
to get through this door.

480
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,827
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.

481
01:11:48,995 --> 01:11:52,245
There won"t be a next time.
That was stupid.

482
01:11:52,415 --> 01:11:58,334
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?

483
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:03,711
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1 .

484
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:08,095
What"s the other type?

485
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:18,812
Can l come with you?

486
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:24,730
lt"s a . . . type 2.

487
01:12:24,904 --> 01:12:29,779
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!

488
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:35,157
- lt"s a wounded soldier.
- ""Help me. Help me.""

489
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:40,490
There were only a few reported.
We thought you"d discontinued them.

490
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:44,796
- We"ve never seen them.
- What do they look like?

491
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:49,258
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.

492
01:12:49,427 --> 01:12:55,631
l"m warning you . . .
just get off my back.

493
01:12:57,101 --> 01:13:02,605
They keep saying the same thing
over and over.

494
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:05,477
Just get off my . . !

495
01:13:08,569 --> 01:13:11,404
Exactly.

496
01:13:26,045 --> 01:13:32,960
He"s one of them.
He"s a machine. Type 2.

497
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:37,428
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.

498
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:41,345
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn"t take a sip.

499
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:47,307
That"s right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.

500
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,194
That"s blood.

501
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:08,908
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.

502
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:15,537
l see a human being who got
wasted for no reason at all.

503
01:14:24,474 --> 01:14:30,310
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn"t very human of you.

504
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:38,189
Until two days ago,
l didn"t even know you existed.

505
01:14:38,362 --> 01:14:42,194
You think l"m one of them?

506
01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:46,992
Then you"d better kill me, too.

507
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:53,959
See if l"ve got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.

508
01:14:58,547 --> 01:15:02,380
Do it!

509
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:08,763
Man, l"m out of here.
Anybody that"s coming, come on.

510
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:31,568
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

511
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:35,951
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

512
01:15:39,086 --> 01:15:42,751
lf you get killed,
will your man let us in?

513
01:15:42,923 --> 01:15:46,007
Not if he"s smart.

514
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:10,897
Do you want me to say l"m sorry?
Well, l"m not.

515
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:17,030
lt was a mistake.

516
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,787
l"ll kill you
before l let you make another one.

517
01:16:57,117 --> 01:17:00,568
Just got out of basic training,
didn"t you?

518
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:06,323
lt"s pretty obvious you"re a rookie.

519
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:12,171
You think you"re the centre
of the universe, but you"re not.

520
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,587
We"re just insignificant
little specks, you and me.

521
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:20,972
We"re not gonna change the world.

522
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:25,351
We"re not gonna win the war.

523
01:17:25,519 --> 01:17:29,350
Nobody"s gonna care that we die.

524
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:36,271
""Which many signify that you should
snarl and bite and play the dog.""

525
01:17:36,445 --> 01:17:40,692
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?

526
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,906
Very good.

527
01:18:32,748 --> 01:18:36,200
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.

528
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:38,702
Cicero, come in. Over.

529
01:18:41,006 --> 01:18:45,714
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we"ve got to get closer.

530
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,394
- Come on down.
- We"re right in front of the door.

531
01:18:55,395 --> 01:19:01,148
- Come on down.
- We"re right in front of the door.

532
01:19:01,317 --> 01:19:06,856
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.

533
01:19:07,031 --> 01:19:10,862
l"ve got NEBs with me.
Come on up.

534
01:19:11,034 --> 01:19:14,201
You're breaking up, Joe.

535
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:24,087
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.

536
01:19:29,093 --> 01:19:33,138
You come up, Chuck.

537
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,598
- Chuck, that"s an order.
- Come on down. Over.

538
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:47,859
- Chuck . . .
- Come on down. Over.

539
01:19:49,237 --> 01:19:53,816
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.

540
01:19:53,992 --> 01:19:58,072
Come on down. Over.

541
01:19:58,246 --> 01:20:07,166
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- l will open the door. Over.

542
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:12,668
l"m coming down right now.
Do you copy?

543
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:18,547
- Come down. Over.
- l"m coming in . . . Go!

544
01:21:28,121 --> 01:21:31,241
Watch the flame.

545
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:07,363
- Give me the nuke!
- What?

546
01:22:07,534 --> 01:22:11,863
Give me the mini-pluto
you stole out of the bunker!

547
01:22:17,084 --> 01:22:21,212
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.

548
01:22:22,964 --> 01:22:25,170
Hang on!

549
01:23:08,174 --> 01:23:09,591
Help me!

550
01:23:09,592 --> 01:23:12,165
Help me!

551
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:29,225
- Help me!
- Sir!

552
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:34,859
Help me!

553
01:23:35,032 --> 01:23:38,365
- Sir.
- l"m okay, Jefferson.

554
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:44,371
- What about you?
- Becker"s down. He"s wounded.

555
01:23:46,209 --> 01:23:49,708
Becker . . .

556
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:57,880
- He"s wounded . . .
- Hold on, man.

557
01:23:58,054 --> 01:24:00,924
Wounded.

558
01:24:01,765 --> 01:24:05,845
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!

559
01:24:06,019 --> 01:24:11,179
Down! Down to hell!
And say that l sent you there.

560
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,607
""l came into the world
with my legs forward.""

561
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:22,573
""And the woman cried,
"He was born with teeth!"""

562
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,264
l had no father.
l am my own father.

563
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:54,303
l have no brother
l am my own brother.

564
01:25:06,785 --> 01:25:11,944
This word love,
which old farts call blind, -

565
01:25:12,123 --> 01:25:16,167
- be resident in men like you,
asshole, but not in me.

566
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:20,627
l am my motherfucking self. Alone!

567
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:42,686
Jefferson!

568
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:53,281
We"re gonna die.

569
01:25:54,413 --> 01:25:57,864
You know that, don"t you?

570
01:26:05,215 --> 01:26:08,334
Yeah . . .

571
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:13,802
. . . but not today . . .

572
01:26:13,973 --> 01:26:18,433
. . . and not here.

573
01:26:18,602 --> 01:26:23,145
Where will we go?

574
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:27,443
Where do you go
when there"s nowhere else to go?

575
01:26:27,611 --> 01:26:29,319
Home.

576
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:31,447
Earth.

577
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:34,698
Earth.

578
01:26:34,867 --> 01:26:42,364
There"s an emergency escape vehicle
for use by the commanding officer.

579
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:46,669
lt"s hidden in these mountains
in a place named ironically -

580
01:26:46,837 --> 01:26:55,130
- for where they developed the
first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.

581
01:26:55,304 --> 01:26:58,091
l"ve never been there.

582
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:03,769
- What are you talking about?
- There"s a way off this planet.

583
01:27:10,276 --> 01:27:15,435
- Type 2?
- Hell if l know.

584
01:27:15,614 --> 01:27:20,275
l"ve never even seen this tag.
l"ve never even seen this language.

585
01:27:26,332 --> 01:27:29,250
Can l see it?

586
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:36,919
Yeah.

587
01:27:43,098 --> 01:27:46,846
God! l"m sorry.

588
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:51,764
Give it to me. l"m sorry.

589
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:58,857
l had to know.

590
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:04,281
No! Don"t do that . . .
you don"t need to.

591
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:27,691
- That"s the last one.
- lt"s okay.

592
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:32,026
According to this
we should be close.

593
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:36,612
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.

594
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,581
- ls it up there?
- lt should be.

595
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:46,248
- l don"t see anything.
- That"s the idea.

596
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:58,343
l can"t go on any more.
l don"t want to go on any more.

597
01:30:06,983 --> 01:30:09,901
Listen to me. l don"t have anybody.

598
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:15,739
l don"t have a family or a friend
or that kid Jefferson.

599
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:21,495
l don"t even have him.
But l have you, do you hear me?

600
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:25,364
l have you, and we"re going home.

601
01:30:29,629 --> 01:30:33,080
l"m taking you home.

602
01:30:41,598 --> 01:30:45,762
BERYNlUM WAS DlSCOVERED HERE
ON JULY 1 6, 2064.

603
01:30:47,354 --> 01:30:52,265
When l took over command,
this was coded in my bio-signature.

604
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:55,152
- lt only works for you?
- We"ll soon find out.

605
01:30:55,153 --> 01:30:56,398
- lt only works for you?
- We"ll soon find out.

606
01:31:03,536 --> 01:31:06,869
Then l"m with the right guy.

607
01:32:18,981 --> 01:32:23,443
- What do we do?
- l have no idea.

608
01:32:23,611 --> 01:32:26,945
Let"s try this chair.

609
01:32:27,115 --> 01:32:31,693
What about this?

610
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:35,035
Elevator activated.

611
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:40,118
Countdown to launch commencing.

612
01:32:41,378 --> 01:32:44,047
lt"s moving. Get on.

613
01:32:47,049 --> 01:32:51,462
Hang on.
The crane"s blocking the trajectory.

614
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:55,089
- l"ll be down.
- Okay.

615
01:32:55,266 --> 01:33:00,426
Please clear launch pad.

616
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:08,517
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.

617
01:34:21,847 --> 01:34:24,682
Launch sequence initiated.

618
01:34:24,849 --> 01:34:28,799
Time to launch: 15 minutes.

619
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:54,999
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?

620
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:59,913
l guess you"ll never see it again.

621
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:12,050
We all die alone, Joe.

622
01:35:52,807 --> 01:35:56,306
Like the new look, Commander?

623
01:35:56,477 --> 01:36:00,142
What do you think?
ls this me, or what?

624
01:36:00,314 --> 01:36:03,647
l liked the other face better.

625
01:36:03,817 --> 01:36:08,065
Do you know who l got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.

626
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:13,233
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?

627
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:17,075
Just like your buddy Chuck,
we ripped it off.

628
01:36:17,247 --> 01:36:21,494
He was screaming
something about God and Jesus.

629
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:38,094
You"re in the wrong place.

630
01:36:38,266 --> 01:36:42,596
l took his face.
He didn"t have much use for it.

631
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:45,392
But l like your face better.

632
01:36:46,942 --> 01:36:52,647
""She couldn"t take it. She married
and moved on, and l"m still here.""

633
01:36:57,201 --> 01:37:01,281
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.

634
01:37:01,455 --> 01:37:06,033
Down to hell,
and say that l sent you.

635
01:37:06,209 --> 01:37:11,451
""l came into the world
with my legs forward . . .""

636
01:37:57,716 --> 01:38:01,714
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Let"s go.

637
01:38:06,015 --> 01:38:09,182
- Prelaunch sequence complete.
- Joe . . .

638
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:16,474
- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.

639
01:38:19,904 --> 01:38:25,693
Get in. We"ve got eight minutes
for you to get out of here.

640
01:38:25,868 --> 01:38:31,158
- You know how to fly it.
- lt"ll fly by itself.

641
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:34,038
Shit!

642
01:38:36,836 --> 01:38:42,340
l"ll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.

643
01:38:42,508 --> 01:38:48,592
Rome, Egypt.
l"ll flip it. You call it.

644
01:38:48,763 --> 01:38:52,050
All right, Cleopatra, l"ll call it.
Rome.

645
01:38:56,313 --> 01:39:00,393
lt doesn"t matter. You"re going.

646
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:03,982
Now, go.

647
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:15,414
l can"t . . .

648
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:19,708
Pardon me, gentlemen,
would you mind taking that outside?

649
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:22,996
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

650
01:39:23,172 --> 01:39:26,623
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

651
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:32,212
We can smile, we can cry,
we can bleed.

652
01:39:32,388 --> 01:39:35,140
We can fuck.

653
01:39:37,768 --> 01:39:41,600
l wanted to tell you. l did.

654
01:39:55,202 --> 01:39:58,119
Not so fast.

655
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:55,001
Two minutes to launch.

656
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:06,844
Hey, bitch!

657
01:41:35,212 --> 01:41:38,581
Prelaunch burn complete.
90 seconds to launch.

658
01:41:55,355 --> 01:42:00,396
l didn"t want to . . .

659
