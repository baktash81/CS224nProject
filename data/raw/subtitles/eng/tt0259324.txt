1
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,053
It's said that the West
was built on legends.

2
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:02,991
Tall tales that help us
make sense of things too great...

3
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,029
...or too terrifying to believe.

4
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:10,697
This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.

5
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:24,685
Story goes that
every generation has one.

6
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:29,083
Some damned soul,
cursed to ride the earth...

7
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:32,691
...collecting on the devil's deals.

8
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:40,792
Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was
sent to the village of San Venganza...

9
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:46,673
...to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls.

10
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,406
But that contract was so powerful...

11
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,779
...he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it.

12
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,951
So he did what no Rider
has ever done before:

13
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,665
He outran the devil himself.

14
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:20,072
The thing about legends is...

15
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,674
...sometimes they're true.

16
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,284
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,158
...the amazing, blazing...

18
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,800
...stunt cycle spectacular!

19
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,918
How about a big round of applause
for Barton and Johnny Blaze?

20
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,295
Let's hear it for them, folks!

21
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:04,536
You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?

22
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:08,175
Young, think you know everything
there is to know.

23
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,908
When you do things
without thinking...

24
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,843
...you ain't making the choice,
the choice is making you.

25
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:16,955
- I was just doing it for the crowd.
- We both know why you done it.

26
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,126
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in a wheelchair?

27
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,462
Huh, hotshot?

28
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,934
Hey.

29
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,231
What's wrong, Roxie?

30
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,502
I'm leaving.

31
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,478
What?

32
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,973
My dad's sending me
to live with my mom.

33
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,552
- When?
- Soon.

34
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,482
What about us?

35
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:28,328
He says you're
not good enough for me.

36
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,360
That you're just a phase.

37
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,594
So, what are we gonna do, Johnny?

38
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:42,336
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike
and just keep going.

39
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:45,303
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

40
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,447
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

41
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,112
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.

42
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,411
- Johnny Blaze.
- Yeah.

43
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,178
Caught your show today.

44
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:34,515
Just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching you ride.

45
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,983
Oh, thanks.

46
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,017
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

47
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,050
You run a show?

48
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,997
Greatest show on earth.

49
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,101
Thanks, but no thanks.

50
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,702
What's wrong, Johnny?

51
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,307
Worried about your father?

52
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,347
What do you know about that?

53
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,350
Even a blind man
could see he's sick.

54
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,355
Thing about cancer
is the time it takes...

55
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,162
...the toll on the loved ones.

56
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,358
Johnny...

57
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,627
...what if I could help your dad?

58
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:26,796
Yeah? How?

59
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,574
How is not important.

60
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,806
What if I could make him better...

61
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,546
...give him back his health?

62
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:40,147
Would you be willing
to make a deal?

63
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,149
Name your price.

64
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,688
I'll take...

65
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,429
...your soul.

66
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,541
Okay.

67
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:09,080
By sunrise tomorrow, your father
will be healthy as a horse.

68
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:13,111
All you have to do is sign.

69
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, that'll do just fine.

70
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,381
Damn.

71
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,727
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

72
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:58,563
Dad?

73
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,325
- You look...
- Great, right?

74
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:05,731
Least that's what the doc said when
he looked at my x-rays this morning.

75
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,302
- What are you talking about?
- I've been sick, son.

76
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,808
When I finally get up
the nerve to tell you about it...

77
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,578
...I'm not anymore.

78
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:17,681
I can't explain it.
But I feel healthy as a horse.

79
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:20,916
Now, come on, hotshot.
I got a show to do.

80
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,324
Now, get my bike ready. Don't wanna
keep those people waiting.

81
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:33,864
Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!

82
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
head for the exits.

83
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,657
Please stay calm.

84
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:04,253
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here.
I'm here, it's gonna be okay.

85
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,396
Dad?

86
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,463
Dad? Dad?

87
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,581
You're no good to me dead.

88
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,264
You... You killed him.

89
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,869
I cured his cancer.

90
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,773
That was the deal.

91
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:25,275
But I couldn't let him
come between us.

92
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,037
You son of a bitch.

93
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,280
One day, when I need you...

94
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:34,952
...I will come.

95
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,450
Until then, I'll be...

96
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,695
I'll be watching.

97
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:45,628
Forget about friends.

98
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,062
Forget about family.

99
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,364
Forget about love.

100
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:01,071
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

101
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,566
You can't live in fear.

102
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,501
You can't live in fear.

103
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:03,867
Johnny, Johnny!
Johnny, Johnny!

104
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,045
Johnny, Johnny!

105
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,765
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!

106
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,801
You.

107
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:26,725
Ladies and gentlemen...

108
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,986
...please stay off the field
to allow paramedics through.

109
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,723
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!

110
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,508
JB, talk to me, man!

111
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,483
Heck, is the bike okay?

112
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,481
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,817
The bike's fine. God.

114
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,594
Thank you.

115
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,097
Let's go home.

116
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,694
Let's hear it for him, folks.

117
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,497
The amazing Johnny Blaze!

118
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,754
Yeah, come on, come on.

119
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,088
Get the front end down. Damn it.

120
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,561
Blaze is down.

121
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,565
- Have you tried not crashing?
- Have you?

122
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,665
Why don't you have a beer
and relax like everybody else, huh?

123
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,900
You know alcohol
gives me nightmares.

124
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,607
To each his own.

125
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,750
Oh, wait, could you go back?

126
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:08,325
There's a howler monkey special
on Discovery Channel tonight.

127
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,094
- Guys, hey.
- We've seen big moves and crashes.

128
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:14,063
But ask these riders
who it is they look up to...

129
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,896
...and the answer's a man who's not
even competing here, Johnny Blaze.

130
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,604
Yeah, that's because he's right here!

131
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,308
- greatest stunt rider of all time...

132
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,873
...but what we don't know is how
much longer can Blaze cheat death.

133
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,877
- Critics call it pay-per-view suicide...
- Put the monkey show on.

134
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,107
Mack, the monkey show?

135
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,081
- with no regard for his own life.

136
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,721
They call him Mr. Invincible,
and he'll have to be at his next jump...

137
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,857
...when Johnny Blaze
will attempt to clear...

138
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,994
...the length of a football field
from field goal to field goal.

139
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,298
What?

140
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:57,808
"What." You should be taking
a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.

141
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,703
I got lucky.

142
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:03,815
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky.
He's got one eye and no nuts.

143
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,280
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got
an angel looking after you.

144
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,117
- Yeah, maybe.
- Mack, you in?

145
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,820
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

146
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,860
Scoot over, ladies.
What's the ante?

147
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,224
Five card draw.

148
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,794
Maybe it's something else.

149
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:09,240
There you go.

150
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,948
It took you long enough.

151
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,360
I think you might be lost, boy.

152
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,100
Angels only in there.

153
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,935
Angels. Really?

154
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:41,110
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?

155
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,410
As a matter of fact...

156
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,059
I do.

157
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,141
Yep.
Love your neighborhood, Johnny.

158
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,975
You join the
Homeowners Association yet?

159
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:21,748
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten
a lock for your lift. That's great, great.

160
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,789
You've got a lot of expensive bikes
in here, I told you. How many times?

161
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,855
Well, JB, I said it before,
I'll say it again:

162
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:31,962
This place could use a woman's touch.

163
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,795
- So could you.
- Heard that.

164
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,906
All right, four out of five. Wreck
one more and you get the whole set.

165
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,475
Well, I'm glad to see
you found use for your books.

166
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,175
You want some jellies?

167
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,284
No. I don't want
none of your stupid candy.

168
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,487
I wanna talk to you about
something kind of serious.

169
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:01,919
I'm trying to relax, Mack.

170
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:05,256
Yeah, I understand. All right?
It's just gonna take a second.

171
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,303
It's about you jumping on the
anniversary of your dad's accident.

172
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,346
Can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

173
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,346
I want you to kick higher for me.
Can you get higher?

174
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,347
This jump, man, we...

175
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,019
Come on! Hit it!

176
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,249
Mack, you touch the Carpenters
or that chimp video again...

177
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:35,450
...and we got a scrap on our hands.
- This jump is nuts. All right, man?

178
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,592
I mean, field goal to field goal,
and now you're adding cars?

179
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,898
I mean, what are you
trying to prove?

180
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:44,196
That it's me.

181
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:45,969
That it's you?

182
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,873
Riding the bike.

183
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,070
Of course it's you, man.
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

184
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,142
You know what,
you're freaking me out.

185
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,371
You're freaking me out
because you're reading...

186
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,449
...this comparative exponential
religiosity crap.

187
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,510
It's getting in your brain.

188
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,390
I mean, what's going on, man?

189
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,050
Do you believe
people get second chances?

190
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,859
I... I don't know.

191
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:13,965
If somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake...

192
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,499
...do you think that person
should have to pay for it...

193
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,928
...every day
for the rest of their lives?

194
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,907
Are you talking about
your daddy's accident?

195
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:24,900
Well...

196
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:28,646
I'm just looking for a sign.

197
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,110
What kind of sign?

198
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,950
That I can take a negative
and turn it into a positive.

199
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:38,123
That I can have a second chance too.

200
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,960
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

201
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,231
I'll think about it.

202
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:40,350
I knew you were here.
I could smell your fear.

203
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:57,569
Hello, Gressil.

204
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,563
Why are you here?

205
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:09,213
Wallow.

206
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,046
And what do you want from us?

207
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:18,621
I've come for the contract
of San Venganza.

208
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,692
Legend has it that the contract
was stolen and hidden...

209
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,996
...in a graveyard not far from here.

210
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,029
And now you're gonna help me find it.

211
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,333
Abigor.

212
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,038
And when we find it, then what?

213
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,709
Then we'll take this world...

214
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,612
...one city...

215
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,543
...at a time.

216
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,649
What about Mephistopheles?

217
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,689
Don't... ever...

218
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:57,290
...say that name.

219
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:06,334
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!

220
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,775
Yeah!

221
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:18,779
Johnny B!

222
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,824
Hey, JB.

223
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:31,526
You're stepping on Karen.

224
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:39,067
What was it
you were gonna say, Mack?

225
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:42,540
I just ran a second check
on the ramps. They look good.

226
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,411
Crowd's kind of out of control.

227
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,480
Johnny, you know you don't
have to do this, don't you?

228
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:55,821
Does this suit fit all right?
It feels a little loose.

229
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,551
The suit's fine.

230
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:02,125
Would you bring me my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

231
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,830
You can't live in fear.

232
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,536
All right, we're up here on the right.

233
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,606
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.

234
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,404
- Have time for a quick interview?
- I don't know how long...

235
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,480
...you been doing your job,
but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.

236
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,480
Not even for an old friend?

237
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,322
Hey, Johnny.

238
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:43,828
Hi.

239
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:47,230
I'll do it.

240
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:52,707
Okay, and ready
in five, four, three, two...

241
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,380
How's your dad?

242
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:58,813
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

243
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:01,914
No one has ever attempted
such a distance before...

244
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:05,188
...three hundred feet
from field goal to field goal.

245
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,518
What's going through your mind
right now?

246
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:11,197
You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

247
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,799
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

248
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,673
Johnny, what drives somebody
to risk their life for entertainment?

249
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,306
I heard you got married.

250
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,607
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.

251
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,648
No?

252
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:34,420
Most of the time the press focuses on
the crashes, the broken bones...

253
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:35,848
...the costs of what you do.

254
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,920
Are there any other costs?

255
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,815
- commemorating this
epic milestone...

256
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,558
...in the life of
the world's greatest stuntman.

257
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,497
And remember, 40 percent
of all proceeds tonight...

258
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,564
...go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...

259
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,828
...dedicated to helping those in need
here in our home state...

260
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,466
Okay, well...

261
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:56,676
Thank you for this revealing peek
into the life of Johnny Blaze.

262
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,877
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

263
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,447
And we're out.

264
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,948
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?
- You know, we gotta get back.

265
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,514
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.

266
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,489
- Please.
- Sign this.

267
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,992
Roxanne?

268
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:29,272
- Come on, just one signature.
- You need to get back to your seat.

269
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,742
- You don't have to push.
- All right.

270
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:36,471
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
you two had some kind of history.

271
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,408
That was it, Mack.

272
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,282
The sign.

273
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:41,711
The sign?

274
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:46,690
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?
- No.

275
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,621
It hasn't started yet.

276
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,621
I'll buy you a doughnut.

277
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,332
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.

278
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:55,001
Let's go.

279
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,626
Thank God you listened to me,
took the cars out.

280
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,896
It would've been suicide otherwise.

281
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,399
This way if you come up short, see...

282
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:06,305
...you'll come down
on some nice, soft, green...

283
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,837
...grass.

284
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,849
Johnny Blaze will not be jumping
50 cars today as scheduled...

285
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,655
...but instead will be leaping
six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.

286
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:22,919
Never before has any man attempted
such a death-defying stunt.

287
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,694
I took the cars out.

288
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,368
Why? Why, JB?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

289
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,336
- Because you would have thrown a fit.
- Call me old-fashioned...

290
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:39,477
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice
makes me uncomfortable.

291
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,008
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?

292
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,984
You know what I've been
thinking about? A new stunt.

293
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,082
But instead of the cars
or the ring of fire...

294
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,581
...a helicopter.

295
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,996
My dad thought it'd be cool.

296
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,527
- He was right.
- Yeah.

297
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,094
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

298
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:08,030
Halfway down the ramp I want you
to hit the NOS, okay?

299
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:09,601
Do not hit the NOS too early.

300
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:12,368
If you hit it too early, you are screwed.
You got that?

301
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,072
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?

302
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,677
She's probably on the interstate
by now, huh?

303
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,589
How much NOS
did you put in the tanks?

304
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,763
Enough to shame the space shuttle.
Chief, go ahead.

305
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,442
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.

306
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:04,026
He made it!

307
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,625
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!

308
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,701
Let's hear it for him,
ladies and gentlemen.

309
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,430
Three hundred feet! A world record,
as only Johnny Blaze can do!

310
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,573
Yeah! Yeah!

311
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:26,441
Where's he going?

312
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:29,519
I'll say one thing about the guy,
he's got guts.

313
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:32,657
I mean, the other day I was watching
this, like, sports show...

314
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,760
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

315
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,660
Yeah, that might be a little hard.

316
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,093
I made it!

317
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,507
- Pull over!
- Do you want me to pull over?

318
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,712
- Drive.
- Driving.

319
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,154
Come on, Roxie,
I need to talk to you.

320
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,759
What's your name?

321
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,170
- What?
- What's your name?

322
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:20,004
Stuart!

323
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:22,499
- Johnny.
- Hi.

324
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,734
Well, Stuart,
can you help me out here?

325
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,778
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

326
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:32,815
Johnny, look out!

327
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:45,753
All right, I guess I see
how it's gonna be. Hang on!

328
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,717
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

329
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,886
Are you trying to kill yourself?

330
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:12,523
I wanna talk to you.
I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.

331
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,124
This is crazy. You are crazy.

332
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:16,756
I don't have time for this,
I have a story to edit.

333
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,224
You could have said no.

334
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:23,202
When they asked you to interview me,
you could have said no.

335
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,731
- Move your van out of the way!
- What are you trying to say?

336
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:30,966
Well, I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying that means something.

337
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,079
- Sorry!
- Don't mind them, they're fine.

338
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,282
We are on the side of the freeway.

339
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:41,051
Let's get some dinner.
You still like Italian?

340
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,853
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?

341
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,623
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

342
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,797
I understand now
like I understood then...

343
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,829
...and I have no hard feelings, none.

344
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:58,902
That's why they call it the past, because
it's passed. It's done, it's over with.

345
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,237
Too much?

346
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:15,884
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
the Plaza. Eight o'clock.

347
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,279
Yes!

348
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:22,153
Don't be late.

349
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,329
This is a sign, Roxanne.

350
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,631
There are no accidents.

351
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,733
Destiny and all that.

352
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:30,625
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

353
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,100
- Can you please sign my sister's book?
- Oh, sure.

354
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,271
- 300 feet.
- We love you.

355
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,936
Well, thank you.

356
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,200
Three hundred feet.
Pretty neat, pretty neat.

357
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:39,703
Right on, Johnny.

358
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,127
Mephistopheles.

359
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,657
I knew you'd come.

360
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,921
Long time no see, boys.

361
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,997
Where you been hiding?

362
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,168
I know why you're here.

363
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,395
I know what you're after.

364
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,940
It's my contract.

365
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,699
They're my souls.

366
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,645
We both know
you can't harm me here.

367
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:16,675
It's my turn to lead.

368
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,046
You will suffer for this.

369
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,721
Now, deal with my Rider.

370
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:26,188
Your favorite creation?

371
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,018
Send your precious Rider.

372
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:33,028
I will retire him
just like I will retire you...

373
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,193
...Father.

374
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,269
Thank you.

375
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,902
You can't live in fear.

376
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,931
You can't live in fear.

377
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,439
You made that jump.
No one else made that jump.

378
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:20,472
You're the best rider.

379
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,216
You deserve a second chance.

380
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,784
She's a sign.

381
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,466
Johnny.

382
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,495
Okay.

383
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:53,029
Johnny.

384
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,875
You.

385
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,582
Hello, Johnny.

386
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:41,349
Stay away from me.

387
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:43,521
A little late for that.

388
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,621
Nice bike.

389
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:50,627
Why are you here?

390
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,431
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.

391
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:55,965
All along.

392
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,092
Phoenix...

393
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,395
...Denver...

394
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,867
...Houston.

395
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,338
It was you. Keeping me alive.

396
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,545
No. No, Johnny.

397
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:08,277
It's all you.

398
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:10,876
You're the best.

399
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:14,148
And I'm your greatest fan.

400
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:18,218
The posters, the video games...

401
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:22,985
...the crowds screaming, chanting:

402
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,321
"Johnny.

403
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,930
Johnny.

404
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,925
Johnny."

405
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,672
It makes me so proud.

406
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,977
It's like watching an investment...

407
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:42,180
...that keeps growing and growing...

408
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:46,374
...until the day you cash it in.

409
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:50,077
That day is today, Johnny.

410
00:39:50,957 --> 00:39:53,949
Find the one known as Blackheart...

411
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,294
...and destroy him.

412
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,257
Find him yourself.

413
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:00,930
It doesn't work like that.

414
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,329
You're under contract, remember?

415
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,963
If you succeed...

416
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:11,508
...I'll return your soul.

417
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,241
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

418
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,672
You don't have any choice.

419
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,245
Hey.

420
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,558
You can't come in here.
This is private...

421
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:39,353
Property.

422
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,498
There was a cemetery here.

423
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,128
Yeah, a long time ago.

424
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:47,201
What happened to the graves?

425
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,603
They moved them.

426
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:52,375
Where?

427
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:58,172
- I don't know.
- Who would?

428
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:03,121
Saint Michael's church.

429
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:05,650
They're in charge of the whole thing.

430
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,550
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

431
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:13,197
That's what they keep telling me.

432
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:34,744
God!

433
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,450
Oh, no!

434
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:40,309
Looking for someone?

435
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,755
Back to hell.

436
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:48,324
We're not gonna have a meaningful
conversation now, are we?

437
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:50,662
You're going down.

438
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:53,457
I don't think so.

439
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:42,946
He ain't so tough.

440
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:53,655
Hey. Dirtbag.

441
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:07,463
Have mercy.

442
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,800
Sorry. All out of mercy.

443
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:27,754
Help me!

444
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,751
Wait.

445
00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:33,889
You think I'm pretty, right?

446
00:46:39,098 --> 00:46:40,827
Oh, God.

447
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,005
Give me the damn bag!

448
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:48,699
Help!

449
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,002
Help!

450
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:04,913
Thanks.

451
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:10,521
You.

452
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:11,920
Guilty.

453
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:19,803
Look into my eyes.

454
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:30,604
Your soul is stained
by the blood of the innocent.

455
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:34,481
Feel their pain.

456
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:39,156
No!

457
00:47:45,764 --> 00:47:46,753
Give me your wallet!

458
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,401
Let me go!

459
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:30,997
Morning, bonehead.

460
00:50:42,341 --> 00:50:43,808
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

461
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,909
I feel like my skull's on fire,
but I'm good. Thanks for the water.

462
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:48,077
Did you see my bike?

463
00:50:50,182 --> 00:50:51,581
Did I say something funny?

464
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:52,975
Ironic.

465
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,946
We're big on irony around here.

466
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:59,886
- It's out by the shed.
- Thanks.

467
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,592
It does.

468
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:03,726
What?

469
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:07,363
You're wondering if your bike
looks normal? It does.

470
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,892
And to answer your other questions:

471
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,932
Last night did happen...

472
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,865
...it wasn't a dream...

473
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:16,364
...and it will happen again.

474
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,707
Who are you?

475
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:23,039
Question is, who are you?

476
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:27,846
You are the Rider.
The Ghost Rider.

477
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:32,087
Get used to it, kid.
It'll be a lot easier.

478
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,225
If you don't, I got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you.

479
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:52,668
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

480
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:56,370
You'll need my help,
you expect to last the night.

481
00:51:56,848 --> 00:52:00,079
Last time I let a stranger help me
it didn't pan out so good.

482
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,977
This ain't something
you can run from, kid.

483
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,889
This day has been coming
since you made that deal.

484
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:17,230
Congratulations.

485
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,539
Your chances
just went from none to slim.

486
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:24,535
Sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link...

487
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:26,712
...between what happened
here in downtown...

488
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:29,108
...and the Broken Spoke massacre
in the desert.

489
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,178
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

490
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,484
And we're out.

491
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:36,581
- Captain Dolan.
- No comment.

492
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:39,486
Is it true they found a connection
between the massacre...

493
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,228
...and last night's victim
here at the city train yards?

494
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:47,928
No comment.

495
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:51,596
Off the record, captain.

496
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:56,903
Off the record?

497
00:52:57,211 --> 00:52:58,143
Piss off.

498
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,982
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.

499
00:53:07,988 --> 00:53:11,253
Sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell.

500
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,251
Sterilize that for me.

501
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:16,260
Sterilize.

502
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:23,799
In the boiling water.

503
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:25,969
Right. Okay.

504
00:53:27,341 --> 00:53:29,241
A little confused.

505
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:32,543
During the day you'll be normal.

506
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,680
But at night...

507
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,981
...in the presence of evil...

508
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,649
...the Rider takes over.

509
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:43,548
I remember now.

510
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:45,216
Last night.

511
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:52,195
There was some punk...

512
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,864
...and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

513
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:58,731
...and I turned it all against him.

514
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:01,102
The Penance Stare.

515
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:05,074
It sears the souls of the wicked.

516
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:09,111
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.

517
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,215
All the Riders have it.

518
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:18,248
Have there been others
with my "Ghost Rider" problem?

519
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,157
Been a few.

520
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:23,022
Last one was 150 years ago...

521
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:26,931
...in a little town
called San Venganza.

522
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,667
Nice town.

523
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,170
Nice people.

524
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:35,603
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

525
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,039
...one deal at a time.

526
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:42,746
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another...

527
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,712
...until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

528
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:52,716
...their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

529
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,261
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

530
00:54:57,798 --> 00:54:58,992
Blackheart?

531
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:03,102
He sent you after Blackheart?

532
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:05,165
And others.

533
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:06,933
The Hidden.

534
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:13,875
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

535
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:19,779
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

536
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,318
You better hang around here, kid.

537
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:30,162
They can't come
onto hallowed ground.

538
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,131
Thanks.

539
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,061
And thanks for the info.

540
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:38,271
I feel much better now that I know
I'm the devil's bounty hunter.

541
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,111
- Where you going?
- Somebody I gotta see.

542
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,108
That's a bad idea.

543
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,746
It wouldn't be my first.

544
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:56,320
Why'd you do it?

545
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:01,122
Why'd you make the deal?

546
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,157
I was a kid.

547
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,828
What'd you get in return?

548
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:12,470
Heartache.

549
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,474
Oh, my God.

550
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,985
It's hard to describe the destruction
here this morning.

551
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:37,356
Can I get you people
to stand back, please?

552
00:56:37,765 --> 00:56:41,132
I don't know. It seems like
something supernatural.

553
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:43,461
Could you tell us about
the Good Samaritan?

554
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,032
Well, I'll never forget him,
that's for sure.

555
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:51,040
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, really thin, like bony.

556
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:55,009
And he had this rad chopper,
it was all flames and stuff.

557
00:56:55,249 --> 00:57:00,312
Oh, and his face was a skull
and it was on fire.

558
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,388
"On fire."

559
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,187
Yeah, like:

560
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,329
Like that much fire.

561
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:14,898
And I know it sounds weird,
but it looked okay on him.

562
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:19,038
I mean, it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off.

563
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:22,507
Not sure what to add to that.

564
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:26,774
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

565
00:57:28,348 --> 00:57:29,246
Thanks.

566
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,884
- Roxie...
- Don't.

567
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:42,091
Now, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.

568
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:45,263
- Last night was inexcusable.
- No apologies.

569
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:48,297
See, you did me a favor last night...

570
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:51,026
...because you made me think
of then and now.

571
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:53,796
And when you left,
yeah, it hurt like hell.

572
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:56,134
But you know what? I got over it...

573
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:59,444
...and I went to college,
I got a great job.

574
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,805
But you, Johnny...

575
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,974
...you're just the same.

576
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,453
Oh, better paid, more fans...

577
00:58:07,888 --> 00:58:09,822
...but you're still just a carny.

578
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:16,327
Yeah.

579
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:18,828
Oh, man.

580
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,261
My dad was right.

581
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,025
You were just a phase.

582
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,575
That went well.

583
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,044
Hey, captain! I got something.

584
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:39,535
"End of days.

585
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:48,182
The host can gain control
of the possessing spirit...

586
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:52,653
...through concentration on
and manipulation of...

587
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,552
...the fire element
that exists within man."

588
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:10,435
I am speaking to the fire element
within me.

589
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:16,240
Give me control
over the possessing spirit.

590
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:39,663
- Hi.
- Hi.

591
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:43,008
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

592
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,345
I came to apologize.

593
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:51,115
I'm leaving town tonight...

594
01:00:52,352 --> 01:00:56,118
...and I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

595
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:59,424
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

596
01:01:00,594 --> 01:01:04,121
It was cruel and totally untrue.

597
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:06,025
And I feel really terrible about it.

598
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,461
Please, don't. It's okay.

599
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:12,303
Is something burning?

600
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,676
Oh, that must be coming from outside.
Neighbor's hibachi.

601
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:19,069
Bill, he just got it.

602
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,012
I still have that one.

603
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:22,647
You what?

604
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:27,376
I have that one too.

605
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,263
I remember that day.

606
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,564
There were a dozen people
waiting in line...

607
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:44,100
...and you went through
a whole roll of quarters.

608
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:47,605
Look at my face.
You can tell I was just terrified...

609
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:50,639
...that my dad was gonna
come in any second.

610
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,115
Okay, I just...

611
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:12,526
It's just... I think I should
walk you to your car.

612
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:17,832
See, it's not great timing.

613
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:24,243
You almost kill yourself
on the highway...

614
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:26,673
...so you can ask me out
and then you don't show.

615
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,547
Then you keep my picture...

616
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,842
...but when I kiss you, you try to
shove me out the door. What's?

617
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:33,514
What's going on?

618
01:02:35,522 --> 01:02:37,854
Don't you care about me at all,
Johnny?

619
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:42,227
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

620
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:45,358
Please.

621
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,733
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

622
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,732
Try me.

623
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:56,506
You'll think I'm crazy.

624
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:58,344
Maybe I am crazy.

625
01:02:58,578 --> 01:02:59,670
I hope I'm crazy.

626
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:03,178
In my job, I've seen and heard
just about everything.

627
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:06,781
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

628
01:03:07,854 --> 01:03:08,878
Off the record?

629
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,414
Yeah.

630
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,139
I sold my soul to the devil.

631
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,471
And now I have to spare you.

632
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:41,142
- Spare me from what?
- The devil, on account I work for him.

633
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:43,480
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.

634
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,689
Because you were
working for the devil?

635
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:49,862
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.

636
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:53,664
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

637
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,231
Whenever I'm around evil...

638
01:03:55,468 --> 01:04:00,462
Evil people, evil spirits.
- I change into...

639
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:03,231
What?

640
01:04:04,477 --> 01:04:09,380
Just a great big monster,
but I am learning to...

641
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,709
I'm getting control of it.

642
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:13,419
I'm trying to.

643
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,819
So tonight, you'll...

644
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,484
I believe so.

645
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:25,219
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea...

646
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:28,697
...that you run on home now, Roxie.

647
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:34,304
You're serious.

648
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:42,306
So this is your excuse?

649
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:46,643
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

650
01:04:57,464 --> 01:05:00,228
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

651
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:05,495
I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true...

652
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,264
...and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital.

653
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:09,408
You see, now that...

654
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:13,705
Or I realize that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories...

655
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:15,812
...than be honest with me...

656
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:18,980
...and I walk out of that door...

657
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:20,578
...forever.

658
01:05:47,414 --> 01:05:48,438
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

659
01:05:48,682 --> 01:05:51,708
Hands where we can see them!
Right over your head.

660
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:53,647
Johnny Blaze.

661
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:56,283
Yeah.

662
01:05:57,557 --> 01:06:00,924
Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.

663
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:03,455
You're coming with us.

664
01:06:05,598 --> 01:06:06,758
Okay.

665
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,767
Let's try this again.

666
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,838
What about him,
you remember him?

667
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,873
This guy was three years
from retirement...

668
01:06:18,111 --> 01:06:19,476
...never harmed a fly.

669
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:21,977
In fact, neither did
most of the corpses turning up...

670
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:24,510
...since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

671
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:27,914
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit!

672
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:29,719
Okay, let's take a breather.

673
01:06:32,726 --> 01:06:34,489
- It's warm in here.
- Warm?

674
01:06:34,728 --> 01:06:36,491
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?

675
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,822
A little.

676
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,928
You want a cigarette?

677
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:43,626
Okay.

678
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:45,936
Mind if I do?

679
01:06:51,644 --> 01:06:52,668
Okay, that was weird.

680
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:59,077
Look, Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

681
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:02,384
I'm asking you to help yourself.

682
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:06,023
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

683
01:07:06,726 --> 01:07:10,355
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

684
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:14,932
And you provide
a very, very important civil service.

685
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:16,999
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...

686
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:20,702
...I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

687
01:07:20,907 --> 01:07:24,434
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

688
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:27,137
Jesus Christ.

689
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:32,817
You gotta let me go.
The real killer's out there.

690
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,378
- Lookie here.
- But you're making a mistake.

691
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:37,816
What've we got?

692
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:40,591
Come on, move your ass!

693
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,054
Blaze, riding up to meet us.

694
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:45,693
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please,
you don't wanna put me in there.

695
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:47,524
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.

696
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,031
Oh, God.
Please, get me out of here!

697
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:00,707
You look like that Johnny Blaze.

698
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:05,076
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.

699
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:07,082
Nah, that is you.

700
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:09,182
- That's him!
- Yeah, it is.

701
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:12,682
I saw you jump in the state fair
a few years ago.

702
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:15,621
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.

703
01:08:18,131 --> 01:08:19,564
But you didn't.

704
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:21,562
Looks like somebody's tripping out.

705
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,801
You might be a big shot
out there, Blaze...

706
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:26,733
...but in here you're nothing
but a monkey in a cage!

707
01:08:26,973 --> 01:08:28,941
Now, I don't want any trouble.

708
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:30,973
I don't want any trouble.

709
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,543
Looks like trouble just found you.

710
01:08:35,148 --> 01:08:36,945
Nice jacket.

711
01:08:37,817 --> 01:08:39,114
Come on, man, leave him alone.

712
01:08:39,519 --> 01:08:40,486
Get lost!

713
01:08:40,653 --> 01:08:42,746
- The jacket's mine.
- Stop it!

714
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,521
Nice jacket.

715
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:23,523
Very nice.

716
01:09:43,316 --> 01:09:44,510
You.

717
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:47,944
Innocent.

718
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:23,244
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

719
01:10:26,192 --> 01:10:27,784
I've sinned a lot.

720
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,239
Hold it!

721
01:11:29,389 --> 01:11:31,380
Where's the contract
of San Venganza?

722
01:11:31,824 --> 01:11:33,689
I don't know
what you are talking about.

723
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:39,091
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting
it all these years, sworn to secrecy.

724
01:11:39,332 --> 01:11:41,391
Sworn to keep it
from the likes of you!

725
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,867
There's an old saying:

726
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:50,139
"Raise no more devils
than you can lay down."

727
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:52,742
My father raised one too many.

728
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:03,019
Calling all units. Reported 10-50
in the downtown area.

729
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:04,187
Proceed with caution.

730
01:13:05,284 --> 01:13:06,751
He's coming for us.

731
01:13:07,153 --> 01:13:08,347
Abigor.

732
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:10,448
You know what to do.

733
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:22,727
Rider.

734
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:51,227
I have a suspect fleeing west
on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.

735
01:13:52,999 --> 01:13:55,365
- That's a dead end. You got him.
- 10-4 on that.

736
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:03,273
What's the suspect's location?

737
01:14:03,509 --> 01:14:04,771
- Up.
- What?

738
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:07,844
The suspect is going up.

739
01:14:27,533 --> 01:14:28,966
Oh, my God.

740
01:14:43,115 --> 01:14:44,309
People, help me.

741
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,983
Go, go, go!

742
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:49,052
Surround him!
Make a perimeter! Let's go!

743
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:01,923
Come in, please.

744
01:15:15,514 --> 01:15:17,607
- Come here!
- No!

745
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:20,248
You're pissing me off.

746
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,217
Okay, okay.

747
01:15:22,455 --> 01:15:23,513
Sorry.

748
01:15:35,268 --> 01:15:36,428
Take a right.

749
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:47,244
You should've joined us, Rider.

750
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:49,004
Soon we will have the contract...

751
01:15:49,248 --> 01:15:53,150
...and then you'll only be a footnote
in the history of the new hell.

752
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:59,157
Time to clear the air.

753
01:16:12,138 --> 01:16:14,197
You're a slow learner,
aren't you, Rider?

754
01:16:15,975 --> 01:16:17,670
You cannot catch the wind!

755
01:16:29,288 --> 01:16:32,416
No!

756
01:17:07,259 --> 01:17:08,453
Oh, my God.

757
01:17:44,163 --> 01:17:45,391
Johnny.

758
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:53,368
Prepare to fire!

759
01:17:57,043 --> 01:17:58,135
- Fire!
- Don't!

760
01:18:32,778 --> 01:18:34,746
Now we know his weakness.

761
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:08,738
They know who I am.

762
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:12,177
- Who's that?
- What? Everybody.

763
01:19:12,551 --> 01:19:14,542
You don't watch TV?
What's the matter with you?

764
01:19:18,657 --> 01:19:20,352
Is this thing ever gonna end?

765
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:22,594
It'll end if you can catch him.

766
01:19:23,162 --> 01:19:24,459
What's really going on?

767
01:19:33,672 --> 01:19:35,264
"Carter Slade."

768
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:40,709
Legend has it he was
a Texas Ranger. Man of honor.

769
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:43,848
But he got greedy.

770
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:48,819
Found himself locked up,
waiting on the gallows.

771
01:19:49,688 --> 01:19:51,485
Stranger came to see him.

772
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:53,658
Offering freedom.

773
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:56,556
Slade made a deal.

774
01:19:57,463 --> 01:19:59,260
Ended up a Ghost Rider.

775
01:19:59,832 --> 01:20:01,493
What's he gotta do with this?

776
01:20:01,867 --> 01:20:03,732
Remember that contract
the stranger made...

777
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,195
...with the people of San Venganza?

778
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:11,142
The story goes that Slade
was sent there to collect all the souls.

779
01:20:12,244 --> 01:20:14,804
But what he found there was so evil...

780
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:18,479
...that he took the contract
and rode off.

781
01:20:18,951 --> 01:20:20,612
He stole it.

782
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:23,815
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

783
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:27,486
Some people say
he was buried with it.

784
01:20:27,726 --> 01:20:29,819
- Was he?
- I don't know.

785
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:35,894
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

786
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:40,471
That's why it's important for you to
stay away from friends and family...

787
01:20:40,706 --> 01:20:43,470
...anybody he can use against you,
because he will.

788
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:44,875
Roxanne.

789
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:57,346
Johnny?

790
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:04,688
Johnny?

791
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,227
God!

792
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:09,298
Sorry! Sorry!

793
01:21:09,735 --> 01:21:10,929
Ma'am, you gave me a start.

794
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,228
- I'm looking for Johnny.
- Yeah. You and me both.

795
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:17,704
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

796
01:21:17,943 --> 01:21:19,808
But I heard he got in trouble.

797
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:23,907
He got arrested, yeah? What for?

798
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:28,245
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

799
01:21:28,454 --> 01:21:31,218
Yeah, trust me, his career's
the least of it.

800
01:21:31,624 --> 01:21:34,422
You know, you seem like a nice lady,
and you're pretty and all...

801
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:37,220
...but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels...

802
01:21:37,463 --> 01:21:39,397
...then you showed up,
everything went to hell.

803
01:21:39,632 --> 01:21:42,226
So why don't you go back
to wherever it is you came from?

804
01:21:43,302 --> 01:21:45,634
I can't go back. Not now.

805
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,504
Then tell me what the hell's going on!

806
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,707
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

807
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:54,912
Look, you don't know me...

808
01:21:55,314 --> 01:21:56,372
...but I love him.

809
01:21:56,615 --> 01:22:00,745
So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything...

810
01:22:03,822 --> 01:22:06,382
Lately, he's been reading
these really weird books...

811
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:08,286
...and they're messing with his mind.

812
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,326
He's writing stuff down and staying up
late. And he does it over here.

813
01:22:12,564 --> 01:22:15,590
You can go through this stuff,
and I don't know if it means anything.

814
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:26,601
Where's Roxanne?

815
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:28,904
Dude. Where've you been?
Everybody's out looking...

816
01:22:29,348 --> 01:22:32,283
- Where is she?
- She's out looking for you.

817
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,494
Jesus.

818
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:54,000
Not even close.

819
01:23:02,414 --> 01:23:03,813
You have his heart.

820
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:10,980
Now I'm gonna break it.

821
01:23:13,759 --> 01:23:14,657
Roxanne?

822
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:21,456
Mack.

823
01:23:24,436 --> 01:23:25,368
Roxanne.

824
01:23:34,546 --> 01:23:36,514
Look into my eyes.

825
01:23:43,856 --> 01:23:46,347
Your Penance Stare
doesn't work on me.

826
01:23:46,558 --> 01:23:48,822
I have no soul to burn.

827
01:23:50,429 --> 01:23:53,125
I guess the Caretaker
forgot to mention that, huh?

828
01:23:53,732 --> 01:23:54,858
Surprise!

829
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:57,396
He sent you to bring me back.

830
01:23:58,003 --> 01:23:59,800
I'm not going back.

831
01:24:00,038 --> 01:24:01,767
I like it here.

832
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:06,935
He thinks you're better than me?

833
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:10,444
I don't know who's more pathetic,
you or him.

834
01:24:13,485 --> 01:24:17,478
Now, listen to me. And try to get it
through that thick skull of yours.

835
01:24:17,756 --> 01:24:21,055
You don't work for my father anymore.
You work for me.

836
01:24:21,627 --> 01:24:23,720
Get the contract from the Caretaker.

837
01:24:23,962 --> 01:24:28,865
Bring it to me in San Venganza
and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.

838
01:24:29,635 --> 01:24:30,897
And, Johnny...

839
01:24:35,874 --> 01:24:37,398
...don't make me wait.

840
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:59,724
Figured you'd be back, bonehead.

841
01:25:01,033 --> 01:25:03,524
Where's the contract?
I can't end this without it.

842
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:09,706
Just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself.

843
01:25:12,744 --> 01:25:13,972
It's not there, kid.

844
01:25:26,191 --> 01:25:28,125
Contract of San Venganza.

845
01:25:28,694 --> 01:25:30,025
Hell on earth.

846
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:34,496
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.

847
01:25:35,234 --> 01:25:36,667
And why is that?

848
01:25:37,903 --> 01:25:39,837
He may have my soul...

849
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,969
...but he doesn't have my spirit.

850
01:25:49,214 --> 01:25:52,945
Any man who's got the guts
to sell his soul for love...

851
01:25:53,252 --> 01:25:55,652
...got the power to change the world.

852
01:25:56,655 --> 01:25:58,213
You didn't do it for greed.

853
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:00,989
You did it for the right reason.

854
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,894
Maybe that puts God on your side.

855
01:26:04,796 --> 01:26:06,855
To him, that makes you dangerous.

856
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:08,999
Makes you unpredictable.

857
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,065
That's the best thing
you can be right now.

858
01:26:15,073 --> 01:26:18,065
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.

859
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:21,078
We better get moving.

860
01:26:23,682 --> 01:26:24,774
"We"?

861
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:49,566
I got one last ride left in me.

862
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:02,743
Carter Slade.

863
01:27:07,025 --> 01:27:08,549
Can you keep up?

864
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:18,793
Let's ride.

865
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:05,373
Stick to the shadows.

866
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:25,967
This is end of the trail for me.

867
01:28:26,705 --> 01:28:28,263
I got nothing left.

868
01:28:29,107 --> 01:28:32,838
I could only change one more time,
and I was saving it for this.

869
01:28:37,716 --> 01:28:40,412
God knows I've made
my share of mistakes.

870
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,345
Been trying to make things right
ever since.

871
01:28:45,957 --> 01:28:50,291
Guess all I can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance.

872
01:28:51,196 --> 01:28:52,254
Thank you.

873
01:28:52,798 --> 01:28:54,163
No.

874
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:55,990
Thank you, kid.

875
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:13,101
Surprise.

876
01:31:27,919 --> 01:31:28,943
Stop.

877
01:31:29,187 --> 01:31:31,382
You change, she dies.

878
01:31:33,024 --> 01:31:33,922
Do it, Johnny.

879
01:31:42,267 --> 01:31:43,529
Let her go first.

880
01:32:40,992 --> 01:32:42,425
Looks like you're out of time.

881
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:17,294
"This is the contract of San Venganza.

882
01:33:21,032 --> 01:33:22,329
All of you...

883
01:33:23,134 --> 01:33:25,602
...come to me!"

884
01:34:21,593 --> 01:34:22,617
Johnny!

885
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:40,666
My name is Legion...

886
01:34:42,414 --> 01:34:44,211
...for we are...

887
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:49,542
...many.

888
01:34:51,122 --> 01:34:53,556
Let's go. He got what he wanted.

889
01:34:56,161 --> 01:35:00,393
You go. I gotta get him to
the shadows. I gotta end this.

890
01:35:01,299 --> 01:35:03,062
Why? Why you?

891
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:06,099
It's been me since the day
I made the deal.

892
01:35:06,304 --> 01:35:09,171
I'm the only one
who can walk in both worlds.

893
01:35:09,674 --> 01:35:11,164
I'm Ghost Rider.

894
01:35:15,647 --> 01:35:16,579
Run!

895
01:35:27,392 --> 01:35:28,484
Come on, you son of a bitch.

896
01:35:51,449 --> 01:35:52,609
All of your world...

897
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:54,648
...all of your souls...

898
01:35:54,886 --> 01:35:57,480
...will be mine now.

899
01:36:11,903 --> 01:36:13,564
- Throw me the gun!
- It's out!

900
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,330
Throw it!

901
01:37:14,799 --> 01:37:18,200
How does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you?

902
01:37:18,436 --> 01:37:19,698
All their power.

903
01:37:20,905 --> 01:37:22,805
All their souls.

904
01:37:23,808 --> 01:37:26,242
A thousand souls to burn.

905
01:37:26,477 --> 01:37:28,877
Look into my eyes.

906
01:37:29,314 --> 01:37:32,681
Your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent.

907
01:37:34,986 --> 01:37:36,544
Feel their pain.

908
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:50,265
- Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

909
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:51,559
Kill you!

910
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,432
Stop it!

911
01:37:58,943 --> 01:38:00,240
Oh, God!

912
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:41,980
Monster.

913
01:38:43,588 --> 01:38:44,953
I'm not afraid.

914
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:12,311
Congratulations, Johnny.

915
01:39:13,751 --> 01:39:16,049
You upheld your end of the bargain.

916
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:20,715
It's time I take back
the power of the Ghost Rider.

917
01:39:21,926 --> 01:39:23,689
You get your life back.

918
01:39:24,729 --> 01:39:26,526
The love you've always wanted.

919
01:39:26,964 --> 01:39:29,432
You can start a family of your own.

920
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:32,594
There are more deals to be made.

921
01:39:33,104 --> 01:39:37,632
More people willing to give their souls
for what they desire.

922
01:39:38,109 --> 01:39:41,875
Let someone else carry this curse.
You're free now.

923
01:39:43,348 --> 01:39:44,679
After all...

924
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:47,381
...a deal's a deal.

925
01:40:00,465 --> 01:40:01,397
No.

926
01:40:03,368 --> 01:40:05,700
I'm gonna own this curse...

927
01:40:07,004 --> 01:40:09,495
...and I'm gonna use it against you.

928
01:40:10,475 --> 01:40:12,909
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...

929
01:40:13,611 --> 01:40:15,841
...it'll be my father's blood...

930
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:19,775
...and you'll find me there.

931
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:22,544
A spirit of vengeance...

932
01:40:23,488 --> 01:40:26,389
...fighting fire with fire.

933
01:40:27,825 --> 01:40:30,487
I will make you pay for this.

934
01:40:31,529 --> 01:40:33,463
You can't live in fear.

935
01:40:35,566 --> 01:40:37,591
No!

936
01:41:00,858 --> 01:41:03,122
So where will you go now?

937
01:41:04,595 --> 01:41:06,927
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.

938
01:41:10,968 --> 01:41:14,836
My daddy once said, "If you don't
make a choice, the choice makes you."

939
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:19,501
Yeah. But why do your choices
always keep us apart?

940
01:41:33,591 --> 01:41:35,616
Sure wish things could have
turned out different.

941
01:41:37,228 --> 01:41:40,129
No. This is what you are.

942
01:41:40,531 --> 01:41:42,999
This is what
you always were meant to be.

943
01:41:43,868 --> 01:41:45,199
You got your second chance.

944
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,061
Go out there and make the best of it.

945
01:42:16,734 --> 01:42:20,135
It's said that the West
was built on legends...

946
01:42:21,606 --> 01:42:24,006
...and that legends are
a way of understanding...

947
01:42:24,242 --> 01:42:26,802
...things greater than ourselves.

948
01:42:27,178 --> 01:42:29,510
Forces that shape our lives.

949
01:42:29,747 --> 01:42:32,978
Events that defy explanation.

950
01:42:34,151 --> 01:42:37,814
Individuals whose lives
soar to the heavens...

951
01:42:38,089 --> 01:42:39,989
...or fall to the earth.

952
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:43,924
This is how legends are born.

953
01:47:17,925 --> 01:50:11,325
