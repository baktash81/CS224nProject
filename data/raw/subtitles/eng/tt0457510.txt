<i>Nacho! Nacho!</i>

2
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,984
<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

3
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,049
For you.

4
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,384
One for you.

5
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,485
For you.

6
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,688
One for you.

7
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,458
One for you.

8
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,270
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

9
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,768
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

10
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,309
Today is especially delicious.

11
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,346
Orphans, smile and be happy,

12
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,288
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

13
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,855
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent

14
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:03,626
of the Immaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains

15
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,865
of Guadalupe.

16
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,239
Sister Encarnación.

17
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,161
Thank you, Brother.

18
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:46,176
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

19
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,924
Okay, new game.

20
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,961
-Go get it!
-Hey, that's my ball!

21
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,595
Sister.

22
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,573
I'm Ignacio.

23
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,372
God be with you, Ignacio.

24
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,040
Anyways,

25
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,651
I was wondering
if you would like to join me

26
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,688
in my quarters this night for some toast.

27
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,219
Look alive!

28
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,927
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?

29
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,058
-But the sister and I...
-You are always complaining

30
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,364
of never having priestly duties.

31
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,371
Here is your big duty, huh?

32
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,634
Go now,

33
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,208
so that Sister and I may talk
of holy things.

34
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,880
I like your cow.

35
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,909
Where is he?

36
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,963
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

37
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,530
Thank you for coming here today.

38
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,969
This man lived a good life.

39
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,506
He had a wonderful woman,

40
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,036
a lush garden,

41
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,422
and a collection
of Russian nesting dolls.

42
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,354
May he rest in peace.

43
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,316
Okay.

44
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,423
Hey!

45
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,486
Ramses...

46
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,842
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

47
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,914
GRAND PRIZE $200

48
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,949
ENTER TODAY

49
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,955
<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

50
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,663
Okay.

51
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,383
How's it going?

52
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,981
It's very late, Ignacio.

53
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,428
Give me a second.

54
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:27,904
Good toast.

55
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,609
So,

56
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,723
everyone calls you <i>güero.</i>

57
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,856
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia

58
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,099
and my father, a deacon from Mexico.

59
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,503
They tried to convert each other,

60
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,945
but they got married instead.

61
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,952
And then they died.

62
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,963
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

63
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,336
Tell me,

64
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,012
who is this Encarnación?

65
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,507
Well,

66
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,679
my favorite color is light tan.

67
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,451
My favorite animal is puppies.

68
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,557
I like serving the Lord.

69
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,063
Hiking.

70
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,126
Play volleyball.

71
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,895
You gotta be kidding me.

72
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,663
Everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do

73
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,640
every day.

74
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,872
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

75
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,510
The children, I love the children.
They are my heart.

76
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,187
But to tell you the truth,

77
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,383
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day,

78
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,427
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

79
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:30,262
And they don't think I know a buttload
of crap about the Gospel, but I do.

80
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,928
Okay?

81
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,470
Today, I saw a man in town.

82
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,680
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

83
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,980
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

84
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,555
Who was this man?

85
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,191
Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a <i>luchador.</i>

86
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,991
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

87
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,768
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

88
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,134
Whatever.

89
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,177
Be patient, Brother.

90
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,410
This, too, shall pass.

91
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,209
What is this?

92
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,679
Leftovers.

93
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,044
Enjoy.

94
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,151
There is no flavor.

95
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,516
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

96
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,018
Somebody stole them.

97
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,149
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

98
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,955
I was trying to...

99
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,295
-You are useless, Ignacio.
-Silence, Brothers.

100
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,728
This is the worst lunch I ever had.

101
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,601
Your only job is to cook.

102
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,907
Do you not realize
I have had diarrhea since Easters?

103
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,042
Okay.

104
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,310
Maybe I am not meant for these duties.

105
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,886
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

106
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,485
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

107
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,245
I think your food is good.

108
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,519
I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny,

109
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,384
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

110
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,917
Okay?

111
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,423
See you.

112
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,580
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

113
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,982
<i>Mucho</i> take it easy. I need your help.

114
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,816
Take out the legs!

115
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,091
Listen to me!

116
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,631
Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
but first I need a man.

117
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,960
Get off me!

118
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,995
Don't you see?

119
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,803
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

120
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,908
You're crazy!

121
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,742
Aren't you tired
of getting dirt kicked in your face?

122
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,941
I am!

123
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,147
Don't you want a little taste of the glory?

124
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,189
See what it tastes like?

125
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,346
No!

126
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,795
lf we win, we get 200 pesos!

127
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,732
Chancho!

128
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,367
Chancho!

129
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,439
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

130
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,038
Are you leaving us?

131
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,912
No, Chancho, I would never leave you.

132
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,953
I just need to borrow some sweats.

133
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,739
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

134
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,321
His hair. We bet his hair.

135
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,217
What?

136
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,227
You can take the Stallion.

137
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,492
I'll take the Pony.

138
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,792
I can't wrestle him.

139
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,858
But you are tall and fast like a gazelle.
You can do it.

140
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,664
Pray to the Lord for strength.

141
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,401
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

142
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,341
You have not been baptized?

143
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,542
Hey. How you doing?

144
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,084
He's good.

145
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,151
Hello!

146
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,359
I'm talking to you. I will come.

147
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,021
Save me a piece of that corn.

148
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,234
Save me a piece of that corn for later.

149
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,268
Hey. Take it easy.

150
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,249
Come on, Esqueleto!

151
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,656
Okay.

152
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,263
No problem. We are dancing.

153
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,244
That didn't hurt!

154
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,112
And then I disappear!

155
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,590
Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.

156
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,023
The shoe!

157
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,272
Anaconda squeeze.

158
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,306
Okay.

159
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:22,317
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

160
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,917
Semental! Semental!
Semental! Semental!

161
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,598
Those guys were
a couple of wussies, huh?

162
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,736
They scalped my hairs, okay?

163
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,907
-I look hideous.
-Come on, baby.

164
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,273
And you gave them permission
to hurt me like this.

165
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,712
But I couldn't have anybody see
my face, Steven, come on.

166
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,612
Tonight,

167
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,253
I felt something deep inside me,

168
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,415
I've never felt before.

169
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,630
Do you remember that one time

170
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,630
when everyone was shouting my name

171
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,564
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

172
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,228
Yeah.

173
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,138
And I saw them
knock you unconscious, all right?

174
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,679
What's this?

175
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,021
It's money. What did you think?

176
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,022
But we lost.

177
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,125
We all get a piece.

178
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,788
Listen,

179
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,360
the people, they like you guys.

180
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,928
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

181
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,050
Chancho.

182
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,188
When you are a man

183
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,826
sometimes you wear stretchy pants

184
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,894
in your room.

185
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,663
It's for fun.

186
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,231
Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.

187
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,847
I'm a little concerned right now.

188
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,491
About your salvation and stuff.

189
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,889
How come you have not been baptized?

190
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,660
Because I never got around to it, okay?

191
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,773
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me

192
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,712
because I only believe in science.

193
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,780
But tonight,

194
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,381
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

195
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,119
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

196
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,283
Praise the Lord!

197
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,829
Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.

198
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,917
Hey! Hey!

199
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,718
Tag me!

200
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,319
What? What are you doing?

201
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,285
No, no, no, no! No, no!

202
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,526
Ignacio.

203
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,563
<i>No! No, no, no! No, no, no!</i>

204
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,859
What the...

205
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,100
Move!

206
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,095
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

207
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,189
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

208
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,063
Chancho! Put him down!

209
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,329
-Fight! Fight!
-Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

210
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,406
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Please, stop it!

211
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,207
Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!

212
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,639
What's wrong with you?

213
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,807
But, Sister,

214
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,309
they are just <i>niños</i> trying
to release their wiggles.

215
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,152
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

216
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:31,290
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

217
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,027
I know it is fun to wrestle.

218
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,660
A nice pile-drive to the face,

219
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,798
or a punch to the face,

220
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,400
but you cannot do it.

221
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,202
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbor.

222
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,339
So you've never wrestled?

223
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,910
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

224
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:54,081
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies,

225
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,484
and the clothes,

226
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,749
and the free creams and lotions,

227
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,420
but my life is good.

228
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,426
Really good.

229
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,561
I get to wake up every morning
at 5:00 a.m. and make some soup.

230
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,093
It's the best. I love it.

231
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,696
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

232
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,208
It's fantastic.

233
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,805
Go.

234
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,512
Go away!

235
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,145
Read some books!

236
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,502
Have you ever had feelings for a nun?

237
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,335
No way.

238
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,379
There is this nun.

239
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,848
I just wish I could take off this robe
so she could see how strong I am.

240
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,789
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

241
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,588
Yeah, right.

242
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,462
Then I'll get kicked
out of the monastery.

243
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,898
I have an idea.

244
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:21,996
Tell me.

245
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,337
Take her on a date tonight

246
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,508
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up,

247
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,608
but we will let you win.

248
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,184
So where are you taking me?

249
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,690
Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.

250
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,549
There were two bums,

251
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,284
and I said to myself,

252
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,694
''Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel.''

253
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,234
Well, where are they?

254
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,034
I don't see them.

255
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,908
They should be coming by.

256
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,706
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

257
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,251
It was stinky.

258
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,987
But these are my recreation clothes.

259
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,758
-They look expensive.
-Thank you.

260
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,828
I mean, yes,

261
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,803
they may have
the appearance of riches,

262
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,430
but beneath the clothes, we find a man.

263
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,900
And beneath a man,

264
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,606
we find his nucleus.

265
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,419
-Nucleus?
-Yes.

266
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,760
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

267
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,792
Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun?

268
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,697
And if you guys
have a problem with that,

269
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,770
well, you can just fight me.

270
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,482
Okay.

271
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,588
You ready?

272
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,889
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

273
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,861
You ever seen these moves? Huh?

274
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,367
You see these moves? Huh?

275
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,028
You think you gonna... Huh?

276
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,765
-Come on!
-This way. I think he's over here.

277
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,120
Surprise.

278
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,651
Get that corn out of my face!

279
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,303
Release! Release!

280
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,275
I looked like a fool last night!
What took you so long?

281
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,517
It's no use.

282
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,750
I wanna be a great fighter,

283
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,324
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

284
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:40,996
Nacho.

285
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,466
I think I know someone
who can help you.

286
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,338
-The Lord?
-No.

287
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,739
He's a water gypsy.

288
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,444
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

289
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,880
Eagle eggs?

290
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,784
I'm not listening to you. You're crazy.

291
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,518
Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals.

292
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,094
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

293
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,365
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

294
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,475
In order for you to become empowered

295
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,876
by the eagle,

296
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,255
you must climb that cliff,

297
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,817
find the egg,

298
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,229
crack open one of them,

299
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,459
and then swallow the yolk.

300
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,335
So, what you're saying to me

301
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,208
is if I can eat this yolk,

302
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,474
my moves will become
the best in the whole world.

303
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,346
Definitely.

304
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,783
High five.

305
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,505
-Summon your eagle powers.
-What do you think I am doing?

306
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,211
Eagle powers, come to me!

307
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,748
Please!

308
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,551
Tag. Tag! Tag!

309
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,589
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

310
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,418
A lie!

311
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,655
They gave me no eagle powers!

312
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,188
They gave me no nutrients!

313
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,326
Sorry.

314
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,103
I don't want to get paid to lose.

315
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,333
I want to win!

316
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,251
I need professional help.

317
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,454
I need Ramses.

318
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,324
He's the best.

319
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,186
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

320
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,263
We must learn their ways.

321
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,727
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

322
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,764
Then we must go pro!

323
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,831
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

324
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,333
My area, <i>amigo.</i>

325
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,451
You see that guy over there?

326
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,497
His name is <i>Señor</i> Ramon.

327
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,495
He's Ramses' manager

328
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,602
and he owns all of the big arenas.

329
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,607
He's having a party tomorrow night.

330
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,310
We need to go and show him
we mean business,

331
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,141
that we are ready for the big leagues.

332
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,444
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

333
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:09,119
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

334
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,160
That is where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

335
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,765
And that is a crazy lady.

336
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,702
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

337
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,670
It's pretty dang exciting, huh?

338
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,307
Ramses!

339
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,021
-How do you know him?
-He's the best.

340
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,555
No, he's not.

341
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,553
May I have his autograph?

342
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,559
Please?

343
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,032
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

344
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,578
Ramses.

345
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,851
How are you?

346
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:15,680
Hi.

347
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,657
I was wondering
if the children could get a

348
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,465
signature from you and maybe a picture.

349
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,215
Listen, the kids are orphans.

350
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,311
They like you. You are the best.

351
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,560
This party's gonna be crazy.

352
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,063
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

353
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,802
Feel it.

354
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,138
Go on. I made them.

355
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,082
Go lay down.

356
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,949
Ignacio, I've been looking for you.

357
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,425
-Where have you been?
-I've been here.

358
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,892
I've been sleeping.

359
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,495
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

360
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,728
They are my PJs.

361
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,073
Can I come in?

362
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,768
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

363
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,736
Like maybe you are a floozy.

364
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:49,506
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen

365
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:51,979
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

366
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:53,344
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

367
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,678
-But when?
-Good night.

368
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:03,225
Hey, let go my blouse.

369
00:50:03,427 --> 00:50:06,021
We are wrestlers, too. We are invited.

370
00:50:23,547 --> 00:50:26,038
-Give me a boost.
-Okay.

371
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,882
Hey. What about me?

372
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,920
I don't think I can lift you.

373
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,788
You are too fat.

374
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,497
Good luck.

375
00:51:14,765 --> 00:51:16,130
<i>Señor</i> Ramon.

376
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:21,099
-Who are you?
-I am Esqueleto, the <i>luchador.</i>

377
00:51:22,673 --> 00:51:25,073
Everybody is a <i>luchador, mi amigo.</i>

378
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,468
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

379
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:36,184
Ramses, would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

380
00:51:39,323 --> 00:51:42,554
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

381
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:45,922
Win the Battle Jam next week.

382
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,025
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition

383
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:53,160
in front of 5,000 people.

384
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,539
Then you will be a pro.

385
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:33,801
I forgive you.

386
00:53:37,107 --> 00:53:38,938
Come here, soldier.

387
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:41,638
How did you get up here so fast?

388
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,238
Secret tunnels.

389
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,458
Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.

390
00:53:56,126 --> 00:53:59,527
That they save themselves for the ring.

391
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,396
Huh?

392
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:11,838
I love you.

393
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:30,126
Sing!

394
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:33,158
Sing something for Ramses!

395
00:54:35,332 --> 00:54:37,732
Okay, my friend, this one's yours.

396
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:39,026
What?

397
00:54:39,503 --> 00:54:40,993
This one yours.

398
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,422
<i>I am singing at the party</i>

399
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:04,088
<i>I am singing</i>

400
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:07,994
<i>It's my turn to sing at the party</i>

401
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:11,024
<i>Everyone is dancing</i>

402
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:14,036
<i>Happy party</i>

403
00:55:15,672 --> 00:55:20,507
<i>But Ramses is not dancing</i>
<i>He does not dance at the parties</i>

404
00:55:22,379 --> 00:55:26,543
<i>Ramses is number one</i>
<i>He knows the secrets of desire</i>

405
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:33,113
<i>Ramses is the one</i>
<i>He puts the people all on fire</i>

406
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:36,856
<i>Ramses</i>

407
00:55:47,037 --> 00:55:48,197
Steven!

408
00:55:49,273 --> 00:55:50,570
Come here.

409
00:55:59,216 --> 00:56:00,547
That party was lame.

410
00:56:01,251 --> 00:56:02,912
I hate that place.

411
00:56:08,725 --> 00:56:09,749
Hey!

412
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:20,235
Take it easy.

413
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:00,702
It sucks to be me right now!

414
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,976
-How come?
-How come you think?

415
00:57:07,985 --> 00:57:11,352
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

416
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:15,686
But it turns out he's a real douche.

417
00:57:17,427 --> 00:57:22,194
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

418
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:33,970
Forget it.

419
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:35,837
What?

420
00:57:37,014 --> 00:57:39,482
Because I can't go on living a lie.

421
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:43,410
Earth to Steven.

422
00:57:44,454 --> 00:57:45,853
I'm a friar.

423
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,721
I'm not for that world.

424
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:53,219
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

425
00:57:54,364 --> 00:57:57,424
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you!

426
00:57:57,534 --> 00:58:00,765
I'm sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans.

427
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:04,765
-What did you just say?
-I hate orphans.

428
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:08,403
-Say it again to my face.
-I hate them!

429
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:09,805
Come again?

430
00:58:09,913 --> 00:58:12,677
I hate all the orphans
in the whole world.

431
00:58:25,095 --> 00:58:27,063
I'm not listening to you.

432
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:31,799
You only believe in science.
That's probably why we never win.

433
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:33,969
We never win because you are fat.

434
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:49,814
<i>Buenos días,</i> Sister.

435
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:54,751
So, what you cooking?

436
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,757
Breakfast.

437
00:59:09,206 --> 00:59:12,835
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

438
00:59:13,477 --> 00:59:14,637
I know.

439
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:19,307
Well, where have you been?

440
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,186
I've been gone because I had
a lot of church-y opportunities lately,

441
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,982
outside of the orphanage.

442
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,221
Like what? Where were you last night?

443
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,666
To tell you the truth,
I went to a wrestling match.

444
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:43,128
You went to watch a wrestling match?

445
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,004
Kind of.

446
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:50,904
You are a man of the cloth.

447
00:59:51,581 --> 00:59:53,515
<i>Lucha libre,</i> it's a sin.

448
00:59:54,418 --> 00:59:56,249
But why?

449
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:59,754
Because those men fight for vanity,

450
01:00:00,357 --> 01:00:01,654
for money,

451
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:03,490
for false pride.

452
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,761
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

453
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,731
But is it always a sin to fight?

454
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,559
No.

455
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:18,764
lf you fight for something noble,

456
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:21,844
or for someone who needs your help,

457
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:25,074
only then will God bless you in battle.

458
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:31,080
You must pray for forgiveness.

459
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,393
Excuse me, Ignacio.

460
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:24,198
<i>Precious Father,</i>

461
01:01:24,307 --> 01:01:27,174
<i>why have you given me</i>
<i>this desire to wrestle</i>

462
01:01:27,277 --> 01:01:29,871
<i>and then made me</i>
<i>such a stinky warrior?</i>

463
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:35,307
<i>Have I focused too much on my boots</i>
<i>and all my fame and my stretchy pants?</i>

464
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:37,445
<i>Wait a second.</i>

465
01:01:37,554 --> 01:01:40,523
<i>Maybe you want me to fight</i>
<i>and give everything I win</i>

466
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:42,353
<i>to the little ones who have nothing</i>

467
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:45,155
<i>so they can have better foods</i>
<i>and a better life.</i>

468
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:48,655
<i>Yeah, maybe that.</i>

469
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:52,068
<i>Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam,</i>

470
01:01:52,202 --> 01:01:54,193
<i>I will know that you bless my mission</i>

471
01:01:54,304 --> 01:01:57,705
<i>and that you want me to be</i>
<i>a wrestling servant of you.</i>

472
01:01:59,976 --> 01:02:01,238
<i>I smell cookies.</i>

473
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:03,373
Flame! Flame!

474
01:02:05,649 --> 01:02:08,641
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

475
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:14,516
Roll, you fool!

476
01:02:21,097 --> 01:02:22,860
Flame, flame, flame!

477
01:02:53,496 --> 01:02:55,191
Yes, it's true!

478
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,393
I am Nacho, the <i>luchador.</i>

479
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:05,932
Who?

480
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:08,337
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

481
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,543
Nacho!

482
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,352
No. This is forbidden.

483
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:28,394
I knew it.

484
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,533
He is not a man of God.

485
01:03:35,538 --> 01:03:36,732
Tonight,

486
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,041
I will fight
the seven strongest men in town,

487
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,035
maybe the world,

488
01:03:44,214 --> 01:03:45,738
and I will win

489
01:03:46,216 --> 01:03:49,708
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

490
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:51,979
And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.

491
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:53,487
And with it,

492
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:56,949
I will buy the orphans a big bus

493
01:03:57,661 --> 01:04:00,721
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

494
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:02,763
I'm serious!

495
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,977
Nipple twist!

496
01:07:26,402 --> 01:07:28,267
You can't win them all.

497
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,276
Nacho!

498
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:45,282
Where are you going?

499
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:50,485
There is no place for me
in this world, Chanchito.

500
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:54,029
I don't belong out there

501
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:56,756
and I don't belong in here,

502
01:07:57,367 --> 01:07:59,665
so I'm going into the wilderness,

503
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:02,270
probably to die.

504
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,631
Well, you might need this.

505
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,719
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

506
01:08:17,353 --> 01:08:20,845
It was her lucky <i>machete.</i>
You can have it.

507
01:08:38,007 --> 01:08:40,305
I hope to see you again, little Chancho.

508
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:46,012
Maybe in the next life.

509
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:53,175
How did you find me here?

510
01:10:53,743 --> 01:10:55,370
I saw you from the village.

511
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:09,222
I have some news.

512
01:11:12,862 --> 01:11:15,524
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

513
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:20,692
He got injured.

514
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:45,987
Silencio bruised his bunions.

515
01:11:46,295 --> 01:11:48,456
They are swollen really hard.

516
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:53,395
He's not gonna be able to fight tonight.

517
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,501
You were second place.

518
01:11:57,006 --> 01:11:58,940
You get to fight Ramses.

519
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:03,038
But I have given up wrestling.

520
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:08,883
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

521
01:12:09,986 --> 01:12:12,716
And you got something
none of these guys have.

522
01:12:22,999 --> 01:12:25,194
The childrens need a real hero.

523
01:12:26,903 --> 01:12:29,895
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world.

524
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,506
Not anymore.

525
01:12:34,143 --> 01:12:35,542
I like them.

526
01:12:38,347 --> 01:12:40,315
And they need you, Nacho.

527
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,528
Okay.

528
01:13:41,711 --> 01:13:44,612
<i>Dear Sister, I know</i>
<i>you probably hate my guts by now</i>

529
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:48,741
<i>and already believe that I must have</i>
<i>died long ago in the wilderness.</i>

530
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:51,319
<i>But you are wrong, I'm still alive.</i>

531
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:54,756
<i>Tonight I'll be fighting</i>
<i>the greatest wrestler who ever lived,</i>

532
01:13:54,857 --> 01:13:56,324
<i>the great Ramses.</i>

533
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:57,756
<i>I know you don't like wrestling,</i>

534
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,023
<i>but know that I am leaving</i>
<i>all my monies to the orphans.</i>

535
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:05,396
<i>And if I die in the ring, know that</i>
<i>I always loved you as a brother in God.</i>

536
01:14:06,035 --> 01:14:07,263
<i>Ignacio.</i>

537
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:12,637
<i>P.S. lf we didn't end up taking</i>
<i>our vows of celibacy,</i>

538
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:17,241
<i>we could maybe get married</i>
<i>and have a family with some</i> niños.

539
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:20,181
<i>But, you know, whatever.</i>

540
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,475
<i>Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,</i>

541
01:14:23,653 --> 01:14:25,917
<i>hug, hug, big kiss,</i>

542
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:30,056
<i>little hug, kiss, kiss, little kiss.</i>

543
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:21,641
Ramses is the number one.

544
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:25,810
His legs are number one.

545
01:15:26,549 --> 01:15:29,450
His eyes are number one.

546
01:15:30,252 --> 01:15:33,085
His muscles are number one.

547
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:37,291
Ramses is the number one.

548
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,828
While I was in the wilderness

549
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:50,532
I wrote a song for Encarnación

550
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:54,373
in my mind.

551
01:15:55,878 --> 01:15:58,369
-Shall I sing it for you?
-Sure.

552
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:13,387
<i>When the fantasy has ended</i>

553
01:16:13,963 --> 01:16:16,955
<i>And all the children are gone</i>

554
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:21,325
<i>Something good inside me</i>

555
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:24,667
<i>Helps me to carry on</i>

556
01:16:24,774 --> 01:16:28,540
<i>I ate some bugs</i>
<i>I ate some grass</i>

557
01:16:28,644 --> 01:16:32,341
<i>I used my hand</i>
<i>To wipe my tears</i>

558
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:36,384
<i>To kiss your mouth</i>
<i>I'd break my vow</i>

559
01:16:36,485 --> 01:16:40,080
<i>No, no, no</i>
<i>No, no, no way, José</i>

560
01:16:40,356 --> 01:16:42,483
<i>Unless you want to</i>

561
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:46,652
<i>Then we'd break our vows together</i>

562
01:16:47,863 --> 01:16:52,232
<i>Encarnación</i>

563
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:55,599
<i>Encarnación</i>

564
01:16:55,704 --> 01:16:58,229
<i>Encarnación</i>

565
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,567
<i>Encarnación</i>

566
01:17:05,114 --> 01:17:06,843
They are ready for you now.

567
01:17:39,348 --> 01:17:42,840
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

568
01:18:04,707 --> 01:18:06,470
Maybe we should pray.

569
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:16,317
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

570
01:18:16,785 --> 01:18:18,184
-Amen.
-Amen.

571
01:18:18,988 --> 01:18:22,890
Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses!

572
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:30,892
Ramses! Ramses!

573
01:18:48,317 --> 01:18:49,614
High five.

574
01:18:50,519 --> 01:18:51,952
Take it easy.

575
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,325
Go, go, go, go, go.

576
01:20:16,472 --> 01:20:20,875
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

577
01:20:20,976 --> 01:20:23,069
Nacho! Nacho!

578
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,963
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

579
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,280
Timber!

580
01:23:58,594 --> 01:23:59,856
I did it!

581
01:24:26,021 --> 01:24:28,455
Hey! We did it!

582
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:30,917
Yes!

583
01:24:59,388 --> 01:25:00,446
Yes!

584
01:25:00,923 --> 01:25:02,584
-Yes!
-Yes!

585
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:10,862
Yes!
