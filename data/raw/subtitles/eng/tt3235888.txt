1
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,108
Hey. Are you OK?

2
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,694
Yeah.

3
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,784
You need some help?

4
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:28,415
No.

5
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,729
Annie?
What are you doing?

6
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:41,153
I'm fine, Dad.

7
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:00,233
What's the matter?

8
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,834
What's going on?

9
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,580
Annie?

10
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,864
Dad.

11
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,604
Hey.

12
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:12,560
I love you.

13
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,616
I know.

14
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,209
I know.

15
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,810
I just wanted you and Mom
to know how much I love you.

16
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:27,979
Dad, I'm sorry I can be such
a shit to you sometimes.

17
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,805
I don't know why I do that.

18
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,194
Just know that
I love you, OK?

19
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,587
I just really love you both.

20
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:17,959
Hey, Jay.

21
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,870
Hey. What's up?

22
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,129
Nothing.
Paul and Yara are here.

23
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,778
We're gonna watch a movie,
if you feel like it?

24
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,036
Actually,
I'm going out tonight.

25
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,641
That guy?

26
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,870
I like him.

27
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,470
Me, too.

28
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,036
I see you.

29
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,954
<i>You will have access to
advanced information,</i>

30
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,954
<i>relative to the time and strength
of the forthcoming atomic tests.</i>

31
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,230
<i>What about it?</i>

32
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:22,764
<i>You will provide us with that
information as soon as it is available.</i>

33
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,237
<i>I see.</i>

34
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:30,137
<i>You're afraid of an overload.</i>

35
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,237
<i>You can't tap enough electricity
wherever you get it from to control...</i>

36
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:36,896
<i>a strong enough charge.</i>

37
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:41,052
<i>You are a clever man, doctor.
Perhaps too clever.</i>

38
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:43,579
<i>And what makes you think
I'll give you any information?</i>

39
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:48,002
<i>It is the only way you can save
your own life when the time comes.<i>

40
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,661
<i>You will be transported to one
of our platforms in space...</i>

41
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,699
What are you reading?

42
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,137
<i>The Idiot.</i>

43
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,529
Is it any good?

44
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,411
I don't know yet.

45
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,495
It's about Paul.

46
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,867
Hey, Jay.

47
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,098
Hey, Paul.

48
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,312
Stop.

49
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,009
Hey, I have an idea.

50
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,747
What?

51
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,576
It got away.

52
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,931
You ever play the trade game?

53
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,894
No. What is that?

54
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,568
It's a people watching game.

55
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:57,292
My sister and I used
to play it when we were bored.

56
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,201
You're bored right now?

57
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,429
No. Shut up.

58
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,418
Let me finish.

59
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,773
OK. How do you play?

60
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:07,110
You start by watching the crowd.

61
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,386
Casually scope out
the people around you.

62
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,754
OK.

63
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,980
Now without telling me,

64
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,419
pick a person you'd want
to trade places with.

65
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:21,202
It can be anyone
for whatever reason.

66
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,212
OK, I got it.

67
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,553
Now I get two guesses
to figure out

68
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,707
who you picked

69
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,749
and why you want to
trade places with them.

70
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,900
OK, good luck.

71
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,625
That guy.

72
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,657
Nope.

73
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,479
OK then.
Who'd you pick?

74
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,427
Him.

75
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,046
The dad?

76
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,466
No, the son.

77
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,715
I mean how cool would that be
to have your whole life ahead of you,

78
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,876
you know?

79
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,989
Come on,

80
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,789
it's not like you're old.
You're 21.

81
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:08,196
I know, but...

82
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,306
look how happy that kid is.

83
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,297
Plus, at that age you could
go to the bathroom

84
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,673
any time time you want.

85
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,812
- Total freedom.
- Yeah.

86
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,385
He's probably taking a shit right now.

87
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:22,217
Yeah, exactly.
I can never get away with that.

88
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,664
OK, my turn.

89
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,379
OK.

90
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,923
OK, got it.

91
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,091
How about the girl
in the yellow dress?

92
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,174
Where?

93
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,019
Right there.

94
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,270
I don't see her.

95
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,081
Right there.

96
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,042
Are you teasing me?

97
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,889
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I don't see who you're talking about.

98
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,666
Can we go?

99
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:18,711
I'm sorry. I just,
I just don't feel well.

100
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,898
Can we, can we go
back to the car?

101
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,727
Is there someone in there
that made you want to leave?

102
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,913
Like an ex-girlfriend or something?

103
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,838
You said you saw a girl
with a yellow dress.

104
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:30,786
Is that someone that you knew?

105
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:35,043
No. I just felt sick.
I feel better being outside.

106
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,147
Thanks for walking with me.

107
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,528
Mom knows you smoke.

108
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:31,614
Yeah, but she'll cry if she
actually sees it happening.

109
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:34,558
Or she'll just steal your cigarettes.

110
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,150
How's it going with Hugh?

111
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,837
Good.

112
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:42,855
Mostly.

113
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,501
I don't know. He was acting
kind of weird last night.

114
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:47,845
Why?

115
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,764
He said he wasn't
feeling well but...

116
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,219
it seemed like
something was on his mind.

117
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,062
Have you...

118
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,030
- No.
- No.

119
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,523
I know he wants to. But...

120
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,249
I don't know. It seemed
different last night.

121
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,317
Do I smell bad?

122
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,854
Like, uh, cherry coke,
banana nicotine.

123
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,168
That's my favorite flavor.

124
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:21,269
Mom will love it.

125
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:50,153
Let's go back to the car.

126
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,952
It's funny,

127
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:23,148
we used to daydream about being
old enough to go on dates, and

128
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:26,418
drive around with friends
in their cars.

129
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,562
I had this image of myself

130
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:34,369
holding hands with a
really cute guy,

131
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:37,261
listening to the radio...

132
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,126
driving along some pretty road

133
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:42,500
up north maybe.

134
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:45,549
And the trees started to change colors.

135
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:53,342
It's never about going anywhere really.

136
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:59,239
Just having some sort
of freedom, I guess.

137
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:05,198
Now that we're old enough,
where the hell do we go?

138
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:20,307
Jay?

139
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,904
You awake?

140
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,346
I'm sorry.

141
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,061
What are you doing?

142
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,796
I'm not gonna hurt you.

143
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,884
Don't worry.

144
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:51,766
You're not gonna believe me,

145
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,480
but I need you to remember
what I'm saying.

146
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,401
OK?

147
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:05,722
This thing...

148
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,515
...it's gonna follow you.

149
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,248
Somebody gave it to me

150
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,423
and I passed it to you

151
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:23,094
back in the car.

152
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,220
It could look like
someone you know

153
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:30,506
or it could be a stranger in a crowd.

154
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,808
Whatever helps it
get close to you.

155
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:37,756
It can look like anyone

156
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,058
but there's only one of it.

157
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,083
Help.

158
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,417
Help!

159
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,369
Sometimes,

160
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,651
sometimes I think it looks like

161
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,325
people you love

162
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,544
just to hurt you.

163
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,582
I see it.

164
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,339
I see it.

165
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,377
Who is it?

166
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,825
You get rid of it,
OK.

167
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,159
Just sleep with someone
as soon as you can.

168
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,792
Just pass it along.

169
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,780
If it kills you,
it'll come after me.

170
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:04,990
Do you understand?

171
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:15,114
What the fuck do you want?

172
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,212
Jay,
I'm doing this to help you.

173
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,298
Just so you know it's real.

174
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:33,308
Help!

175
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,332
Help me!

176
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,665
Never go into a place that
doesn't have more than one exit.

177
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,976
It's very slow,
but it's not dumb.

178
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,256
Can I have some?

179
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,227
Yeah.

180
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,973
Listen to this.

181
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,467
<i>"I think that if one is faced by
inevitable destruction,</i>

182
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:25,259
<i>if a house is falling
upon you, for instance,</i>

183
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:28,166

184
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,759

186
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:36,029
That's why we're
drinking on the porch.

187
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,867
Is your Mom asleep already?

188
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,047
Almost for sure.

189
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,188
She wakes up at 5:15.

190
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,829
That would kill me.

191
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,067
So,

192
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,802
where's Jay at?

193
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,822
On a date.

194
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,332
Your turn.

195
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:57,230
Who is he?

196
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:58,904
Somebody new.

197
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,333
Of course.

198
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:02,586
Your sister's so pretty,
it's annoying.

199
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,807
It is annoying.

200
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,159
Well, at least she's nice.

201
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:24,236
Is everything OK?

202
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,244
Just don't let it touch you.

203
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,040
Jay!

204
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:18,643
What happened?

205
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,363
I don't know.

206
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:27,625
Those people are such a mess.

207
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,788
It was consensual?

208
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:39,817
Yeah.

209
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:44,088
And you've never seen
the woman before?

210
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,555
No.

211
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:49,697
OK.

212
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,392
Have you ever been to his home?

213
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,392
I know where it is, but

214
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,323
I've never been inside.

215
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:05,241
He said he was embarrassed
of where he lived.

216
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:57,463
Did she catch anything?

217
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,828
I don't think so.

218
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,599
Oh, poor Jamie.

219
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:07,847
Apparently, he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city.

220
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:10,135
The police searched the place.
They can't find him.

221
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,045
Oh, my God!

222
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,636
Breaks my heart,
the things he said to her.

223
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:17,951
So weird and sick.

224
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:24,720
<i>"I should have been a pair of ragged claws</i>

225
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:29,117
<i>Scuttling across floors of silent seas.</i>

226
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:34,724
<i>And the afternoon, the evening,
sleeps so peacefully.</i>

227
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,192
<i>Smoothed by long fingers,</i>

228
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:41,805
<i>Asleep... tired... or it malingers,</i>

229
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:46,288
<i>Stretched out on the floor,
here beside you and me,</i>

230
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:51,635
<i>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,</i>

231
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:55,848
<i>Have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis?</i>

232
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,756
<i>But though I have wept and fasted,</i>

233
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,328
<i>wept and prayed,</i>

234
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:05,130
<i>Though I have seen my head,
grown slightly bald,</i>

235
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:07,401
<i>brought in upon a platter,</i>

236
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:11,257
<i>I am no prophet
and here’s no great matter;</i>

237
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:15,185
<i>I have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker,</i>

238
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:18,422
<i>And I have seen the eternal Footman</i>

239
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,419
<i>hold my coat, and snicker,</i>

240
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:24,784
<i>And in short, I was afraid.</i>

241
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:28,969
<i>And would it have been worth it, after all,</i>

242
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:33,128
<i>After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,</i>

243
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:37,432
<i>Among the porcelain,
among some talk of you and me,</i>

244
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:39,231
<i>Would it have been worthwhile</i>

245
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:42,313
<i>To have bitten off the matter with a smile?</i>

246
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:45,316
<i>To have squeezed the universe into a ball?</i>

247
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,798
<i>To roll it toward some
overwhelming question?</i>

248
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:53,270
<i>To say: 'I am Lazarus, come from the dead,</i>

249
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:57,604
<i>Come back to tell you all,
I shall tell you all'</i>

250
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:01,017
<i>If one, settling a pillow by her head,</i>

251
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:04,923
<i>Should say,
'That is not what I meant at all;</i>

252
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,944
<i>That is not it, at all.'"</i>

253
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,897
Excuse me!

254
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,648
Excuse me!

255
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:41,386
Hello?

256
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:43,835
Hello.

257
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:45,896
There was an old woman at school today.

258
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,653
And she was staring at me.

259
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:52,008
It was like she was following me.

260
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,279
Did you know her?

261
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:57,192
No, but she freaked me out.

262
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:00,167
I didn't go back to class.

263
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:03,536
Did she say something to you?

264
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:08,977
Hugh told me that

265
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,912
he passed it on to me.

266
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,397
That something was gonna follow me.

267
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,592
That's all bullshit, Jamie.

268
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:23,180
Yeah, I know.

269
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:27,960
What exactly is supposed
to be following you?

270
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,386
I don't know.

271
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,113
You should tell Mom what you saw.

272
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:34,277
No.

273
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:37,994
Well, Jay,
I'm worried about you.

274
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,270
I could stay over tonight if it would
make you feel any better.

275
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:42,449
- No.
- No.

276
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:43,805
Just on the couch or something.

277
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,747
No.

278
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:49,005
Maybe just on the couch.

279
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:50,530
You should be more
worried about waking up

280
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,442
and finding Paul
humping your leg.

281
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,366
Um...

282
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:57,804
I'm choosing to ignore these insults
to my character.

283
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:01,965
Just keep your door locked.

284
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,455
Look,

285
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,277
I'm gonna stay up all night
and keep an eye out for anything weird.

286
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,432
Nothing's gonna happen, OK?

287
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,902
<i>Almost sounds like a girl.</i>

288
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,250
<i>A girl?</i>

289
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:56,509
<i>Perhaps.</i>

290
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:58,902
<i>Or a... monster.</i>

291
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:00,202
<i>Andre!</i>

292
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:01,971
<i>Andre!</i>

293
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:05,874
<i>Stop teasing him, Hans.
He's in love.</i>

294
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:46,147
I can't sleep.

295
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,368
Not in there.

296
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,490
That's OK.

297
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:53,163
Just sleep here.

298
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,561
<i>He hit us!
He's turning around!</i>

299
00:33:57,563 --> 00:34:00,122
<i>- Maybe not.
- We're in for it now. He knows we're here.</i>

300
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,391
<i>- Lock.
- Take it now.</i>

301
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,775
<i>Here he comes.</i>

302
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,088
<i>Don't miss, Andre.</i>

303
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,873
Are you OK?

304
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,969
Everything's gonna be cool.

305
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:38,228
It's funny.

306
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:43,108
I haven't spent the night over here
since we were kids.

307
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,746
There's a reason for that.

308
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:48,896
Shut up.

309
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm serious.

310
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,704
It's cool spending time with you.

311
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,291
Yeah.

312
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,340
You're my first kiss,
you know.

313
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,215
I know.

314
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:21,438
Was I not yours?

315
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,673
No, uh,

316
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,771
you were.

317
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:30,516
And then you kissed Kelly.

318
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,954
She told me.

319
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:38,070
You kissed two sisters.
That's kind of gross.

320
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,668
Do you remember

321
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:43,842
the time

322
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:47,340
that we found those
porno magazines

323
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:49,387
in the alley behind Barry's Pizza?

324
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,235
Yeah.

325
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,141
We were such stupid kids.

326
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,239
Ridiculous.

327
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:57,748
Yeah, we're all sitting out
on Greg's front lawn

328
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,588
with a dozen dirty magazines

329
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,601
just sprawled out everywhere.
And we're laughing.

330
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,315
We didn't even realize
how bad it was.

331
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,268
Oh, and Greg's mom,

332
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:11,063
remember her face when she came out
and saw us reading that shit?

333
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,474
And she scooped it up so fast.

334
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,547
And then she called my mom.

335
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:18,373
Kelly and I got
the sex ed talk the next day.

336
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,516
I got one too.

337
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,811
What the fuck?

338
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,791
Go look.

339
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,684
There's a broken window in the kitchen,
but...

340
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,802
there's no one there.

341
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,838
Are you sure?

342
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:47,715
Yeah. I mean whoever broke it
must have run away.

343
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,199
Maybe we should call the police.

344
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:51,813
I'm going to go wake up your sister.
She should call.

345
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,168
Jay?

346
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:02,039
Jay, can you open the door?

347
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:03,447
It's in the house.

348
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,603
What's going on?

349
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:07,385
There's nothing
in the house, Jay.

350
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,605
I saw it.

351
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,103
Open the door, OK?

352
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:14,396
It's in the kitchen.

353
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,262
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.

354
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,474
Open the door and
we'll figure this out.

355
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,480
There's nothing out here.

356
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:42,389
Get in.

357
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:50,115
Jay, why don't you sit down?

358
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,695
I need water.

359
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:54,539
Oh my God, I need water.

360
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,005
OK, I'll get you some.

361
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,231
No! Stay here!

362
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:07,150
There's something wrong with me.

363
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,947
Look, somebody broke the window.

364
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:11,182
That really happened.

365
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,936
Well, I saw a girl in the kitchen.

366
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:16,269
Jay,

367
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:18,157
I love you.

368
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,221
You're OK.

369
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:22,527
You don't believe me.

370
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:25,320
Mom?

371
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,284
Mom, is that you?

372
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,182
No, it's me.

373
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,286
Yara?

374
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,871
Yeah.

375
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,972
Don't open the door!

376
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:56,990
See? Everything's OK.

377
00:40:58,307 --> 00:40:59,911
Ahhhh!

378
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:00,983
God!

379
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,764
Wait!

380
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:04,523
Jay!

381
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,512
What are you doing?

382
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:25,349
Hey, Jay, wait!

383
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:28,902
Jay!

384
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,063
Jay!

385
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,547
You could have hurt yourself.

386
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:14,666
What are you doing?

387
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:20,985
I'm scared.

388
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,735
Me too.

389
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:24,273
We'll figure it out.

390
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,583
You can't tell Mom,

391
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:30,295
cause she'll freak out
and she won't believe me.

392
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,097
I know. It's OK.

393
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:35,489
What are you running from?

394
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:40,338
Do you see that?

395
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:42,487
I do.

396
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,333
It's... it's a person.

397
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:47,376
Greg?

398
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:49,780
What the hell's going on?
You OK?

399
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:51,692
Someone broke into their house.

400
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:53,190
Shit.

401
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,494
Did you call the police?

402
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:58,213
I don't want to go home.

403
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:00,141
Where do you want to go?

404
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:06,371
I... I need to find him.

405
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,181
The person who broke into your house?

406
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,001
No.

407
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,436
Hugh?

408
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:18,978
What did he really do to you?

409
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:26,541
OK.

410
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:29,125
Are you leaving?

411
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,152
No. I'm getting my car.

412
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:33,467
Someone's got to drive, right?

413
00:47:13,612 --> 00:47:14,947
Ahhhh!

414
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,088
God.

415
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:05,751
Ha ha ha!

416
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:55,938
Hey, come look at this.

417
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:01,750
What?

418
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,061
Is this him?

419
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:08,146
You recognize the jacket?

420
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,690
Lawson High School.

421
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:13,677
Somebody's got to
know his real name.

422
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:18,025
<i>Hello students, it's time
for your afternoon announcements.</i>

423
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,619
<i>Attention all girls interested in playing
club lacrosse this spring.</i>

424
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:27,065
<i>There will be an informational meeting
held in the LT431 room right after school today.</i>

425
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,106
<i>Final reminder for
all wrestlers.</i>

426
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,565
<i>Please hand in your permission
forms to Mr. Dwiggins today.</i>

427
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:36,708
<i>Also, your banquet is this Sunday
at 3:00 p.m. here at the high school.</i>

428
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,253
<i>It's time again for
the high school musical.</i>

429
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,889
<i>This year is,</i>
The Mouse That Roared,

430
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:43,925
<i>starting at 7:00 p.m.
to 9:30 a show</i>

431
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:47,822
<i>and another performance
tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.</i>

432
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:51,451
<i>Tickets will be $5 per student
and $7 for adults.</i>

433
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:55,615
<i>Hope you all have a great weekend,
and we'll see you here on Monday.</i>

434
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:56,260
- Did they know?
- Yep.

435
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:58,007
His real name is Jeff.

436
00:50:58,048 --> 00:50:59,063
Not Hugh?

437
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:00,639
Jeff Redmond.

438
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:02,849
Do we tell the police?

439
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:07,284
No.

440
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:53,289
Hello?

441
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:57,951
Hi, um... is Jeff here?

442
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:02,211
Yeah. Yeah, he is.
Do you want to come in?

443
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:05,639
Yeah.

444
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:08,271
Your friends?

445
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:17,172
Look, even though it's following you,

446
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,684
I can still see it.

447
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:22,014
It's not done with me either, OK?

448
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,836
Like I told you,

449
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:26,793
all you can do is pass it
along to someone else.

450
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:29,184
What the fuck are you
talking about?

451
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,777
Look, she can do the same thing I did.

452
00:52:31,802 --> 00:52:34,465
I mean, it should be easy for her.
She's a girl.

453
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,510
Any guy would be with you.

454
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:37,847
Just sleep with someone else and
tell him to do the same thing.

455
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:39,394
Maybe it'll never come back.

456
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,025
This isn't real.
I swear to you.

457
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,617
This is just some fucked up game!

458
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:47,626
Look, I'm not safe either, OK?

459
00:52:47,652 --> 00:52:49,452
We shouldn't even be
in the same place.

460
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:50,811
I'm sorry. You guys need to
get the fuck out.

461
00:52:50,836 --> 00:52:51,934
Hey!

462
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,028
Watch it.

463
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,762
If it kills her,
it gets me.

464
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:58,952
And goes straight down the line
to whoever started it.

465
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:01,601
Jay,

466
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,721
I'm sorry.

467
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:05,221
I wasn't trying to hurt you, OK?

468
00:53:05,246 --> 00:53:07,724
Someone did this to me too, OK?

469
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:10,355
Who did it to you?

470
00:53:11,364 --> 00:53:13,115
I met a girl at a bar.

471
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:16,942
It was a one night stand.
I don't even remember her name.

472
00:53:17,213 --> 00:53:19,813
I think that's where it came from.

473
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,407
Jeff, I don't believe you.

474
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:24,869
And, well, she might.

475
00:53:24,894 --> 00:53:26,480
But I think you're a fucking liar

476
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:28,188
and what you're doing to her
is some fucked up shit!

477
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:30,932
Do you guys see that girl
right there?

478
00:53:32,985 --> 00:53:34,731
- Yeah. - Uh-huh.
- Yes.

479
00:53:34,757 --> 00:53:36,490
Yeah.

480
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:38,817
OK.

481
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:41,539
OK, good.

482
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:44,315
Jay, listen.

483
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,148
Wherever you are,

484
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:49,041
it's somewhere walking
straight for you.

485
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:51,336
But it is walking.

486
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:52,452
If you drive far enough,

487
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:54,804
you could buy yourself
some time to think.

488
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:57,672
Decide if you want to
give it to someone else.

489
00:54:08,994 --> 00:54:12,210
Um, Greg?

490
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,186
Yeah?

491
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:17,300
Your mom's not gonna freak out?

492
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,144
She won't even know.

493
00:54:23,353 --> 00:54:25,427
It's really nice of you.

494
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,827
I love coming up here.

495
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:31,737
My dad, he, um

496
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:34,942
he used to take me hunting
a couple times a year.

497
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,416
It's not like super nice,
but...

498
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:40,969
it's cool.

499
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:53,565
Have you thought about what he said?

500
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,989
What?

501
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:00,119
Maybe passing it on?

502
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,862
I don't know.

503
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,262
Sucks sticking around
when everyone's gone home.

504
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:37,221
It's a bit lonely.

505
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,581
I'm right across the street,
you know.

506
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:45,943
I remember.

507
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:52,346
I guess I should
have been nicer to you.

508
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:09,481
You guys should
get in the water.

509
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,492
You want to?

510
00:59:14,686 --> 00:59:16,730
Maybe in a little bit.

511
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,804
Come on.

512
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:26,666
Oh! Oh my God!
Help me!

513
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,119
Jay,
what is it?

514
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:30,123
Please, help!

515
00:59:31,418 --> 00:59:32,916
Help me!

516
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,152
What are you doing?

517
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:14,719
Jay, please!

518
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:18,139
Stop shooting!

519
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,842
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Don't open the door!

520
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:57,219
- What did you do to the door?
- We didn't do that!

521
01:00:57,244 --> 01:00:58,594
It's trying to come in!

522
01:00:58,619 --> 01:00:59,918
There's nothing out here!

523
01:00:59,943 --> 01:01:01,074
Yes, there is.

524
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:03,193
Fucking son of a...

525
01:01:06,315 --> 01:01:08,050
Greg?

526
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:24,179
Greg, are you OK?

527
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:29,735
Greg?

528
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:39,336
Jay, what do you see?

529
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,648
Jay! Jay, wait!

530
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,150
Hey, that's my fucking car!

531
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:16,550
Have you seen it?

532
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:18,831
Nothing.

533
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,664
I'm waiting. Looking.

534
01:07:23,742 --> 01:07:27,233
It's been three days.
I don't think it's coming.

535
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:29,768
You believe me, right?

536
01:07:29,822 --> 01:07:31,791
You're not just playing along?

537
01:07:31,817 --> 01:07:35,099
No, I.. I.. I believe you.
I just...

538
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,777
I just don't think
it's following me.

539
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,289
Isn't that a good thing?

540
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,050
Yeah.

541
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,801
Hey.

542
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,548
How are you guys?

543
01:08:33,573 --> 01:08:35,601
OK.

544
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:38,225
How's, uh, how's Jay?

545
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,341
Not great.

546
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:45,615
Have you seen anything?

547
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,823
No.

548
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:48,819
Is, is it cool if I go in?

549
01:08:48,844 --> 01:08:50,569
I don't think so.

550
01:08:50,595 --> 01:08:52,865
She doesn't want
to open her door.

551
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:55,274
She's just hiding in there.

552
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,590
I thought she'd be doing better.

553
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:01,951
I can have her call you later?

554
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,527
Yeah.

555
01:09:03,551 --> 01:09:04,854
OK.

556
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:07,855
You really haven't seen anything?

557
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,327
Nope.

558
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:11,447
She didn't make it up.

559
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:14,798
We'll know sooner or later, alright?

560
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:17,578
That chair broke in midair.

561
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:20,239
I mean, something knocked me over,
and the door

562
01:09:20,265 --> 01:09:21,353
didn't break on its own.

563
01:09:21,377 --> 01:09:22,840
Look, something happened.

564
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:25,579
But it's not what she thinks, OK?

565
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:28,707
What do you think it was then?

566
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:34,032
I'll see you guys.

567
01:09:34,056 --> 01:09:37,051
- Bye, Greg.
- Bye.

568
01:11:25,328 --> 01:11:28,180
<i>Hi. You've reached Greg.
Leave a message.</i>

569
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:44,521
Greg!

570
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:47,573
Open the door, Greg!

571
01:11:57,797 --> 01:12:00,144
Greg, watch out!

572
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,935
Greg, don't open the door!

573
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:19,733
What the fuck, Mom?

574
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:43,201
Who is it?

575
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,122
Paul.

576
01:16:48,028 --> 01:16:50,274
Hang on.

577
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:30,378
It's gonna be here soon or later.

578
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:35,886
You could pass it on.

579
01:17:37,372 --> 01:17:39,332
You did once.

580
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:42,028
I shouldn't have.

581
01:17:42,795 --> 01:17:44,953
I could...

582
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:47,289
No.

583
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:50,676
I liked you too,
you know.

584
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:55,518
Why'd you pick Greg?

585
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,947
I thought he'd be OK.

586
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:04,444
He wasn't scared.

587
01:18:07,217 --> 01:18:10,715
We slept together in high school.
It wasn't a big deal.

588
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:40,662
I want to help.

589
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,958
Do you?

590
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,944
Yeah, I do.

591
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,627
Jay?

592
01:19:18,652 --> 01:19:20,996
Yeah?

593
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,609
Do you trust me?

594
01:19:26,503 --> 01:19:28,337
Do you remember
where we were

595
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,974
the first time we kissed?

596
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,601
Know where to go?

597
01:19:47,627 --> 01:19:50,631
I know how to get there... mostly.

598
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:55,439
I haven't been to the pool
since I was 14.

599
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:57,863
Who brought you there?

600
01:19:58,292 --> 01:19:59,538
OK.

601
01:19:59,576 --> 01:20:03,295
That's where I had my first beer.
I threw up the whole night.

602
01:20:03,323 --> 01:20:04,475
Into the pool?

603
01:20:04,501 --> 01:20:08,099
- No. Outside the car.
- And in the car.

604
01:20:08,155 --> 01:20:09,511
Paul used to pee in it.

605
01:20:09,536 --> 01:20:11,082
Eww, that's disgusting.

606
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,829
Whatever. There's chlorine.

607
01:20:58,838 --> 01:21:00,944
When I was a little girl,

608
01:21:00,984 --> 01:21:03,846
my parents wouldn't allow me
to go south of Eight Mile.

609
01:21:04,764 --> 01:21:07,761
And I didn't even know what that meant
until I got a little older.

610
01:21:07,786 --> 01:21:10,033
And I started realizing that

611
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:13,311
that's where the city started
and the suburbs ended.

612
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:17,920
And I used to think about
how shitty and weird that was.

613
01:21:17,944 --> 01:21:18,827
I mean,

614
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:21,506
I had to ask permission
to go to the state fair

615
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:24,280
with my best friend and her parents

616
01:21:24,305 --> 01:21:27,755
only because it was a
few blocks past the border.

617
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:30,605
My mom said the same thing.

618
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:26,030
How long do you think it'll be?

619
01:22:28,268 --> 01:22:30,323
I don't know.

620
01:22:30,349 --> 01:22:32,965
Hours, I bet.

621
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,801
Oh, my God!

622
01:26:29,474 --> 01:26:31,496
It just walked in the room.
It's right there.

623
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,057
It's here?

624
01:26:33,082 --> 01:26:34,621
Right there!

625
01:26:34,645 --> 01:26:37,710
Jay?
What do you see?

626
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:40,353
I don't want to tell you.

627
01:26:40,377 --> 01:26:42,788
Jay, I... I need you
to point at it, OK?

628
01:26:42,814 --> 01:26:46,113
Keep your finger aimed at it
so we can see where it is.

629
01:26:50,046 --> 01:26:52,675
Is it getting in the water?

630
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:57,789
It's just standing
there staring at me.

631
01:26:57,975 --> 01:26:59,399
It's moving.

632
01:26:59,443 --> 01:27:00,851
What's it doing?

633
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:03,537
It's walking.
It's just walking.

634
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,570
- Paul, I want to get out!
- No. Just wait for it to get in.

635
01:27:06,595 --> 01:27:08,640
No. I don't want to do this.
I just want to get out!

636
01:27:08,664 --> 01:27:10,286
- What the fuck?
- Jay!

637
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,569
Get out of there!

638
01:27:12,408 --> 01:27:14,345
She's going to get electrocuted!

639
01:27:14,546 --> 01:27:16,003
No, it didn't work!

640
01:27:16,029 --> 01:27:17,731
- You OK?
- Yeah.

641
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:20,466
- It didn't work.
- Thank God!

642
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:24,944
Jay, look out!

643
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:28,617
- Oh, my God! Somebody help her!
- What do we do?

644
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:47,229
What the hell is going on?

645
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:05,420
Jay, just keep pointing at it!

646
01:28:11,752 --> 01:28:13,610
It's right there!

647
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:18,317
Where is it?

648
01:28:19,672 --> 01:28:21,457
Watch out!
Don't get too close!

649
01:28:21,483 --> 01:28:23,824
It's right there!

650
01:28:25,286 --> 01:28:27,018
Yara!

651
01:28:34,786 --> 01:28:36,387
Where?

652
01:28:36,505 --> 01:28:38,283
Here?

653
01:28:38,908 --> 01:28:40,949
- Here?
- Right there!

654
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,569
Where is it?

655
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,488
- Jay!
- Come on, Jay!

656
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:11,259
- Give me your hand!
- Come on, come on, come on!

657
01:29:12,774 --> 01:29:14,059
Jay!

658
01:30:00,912 --> 01:30:02,993
Jay,

659
01:30:03,537 --> 01:30:05,016
do you see it?

660
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,600
Is it still down there?

661
01:32:43,779 --> 01:32:46,188
Do you feel any different?

662
01:33:02,247 --> 01:33:04,279
Do you?

663
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:11,769
No.

664
01:34:05,331 --> 01:34:08,908
<i>"When there is torture,
there is pain and wounds.</i>

665
01:34:08,932 --> 01:34:14,140
<i>Physical agony and all this
distracts the mind from mental suffering</i>

666
01:34:14,164 --> 01:34:16,676
<i>so that one is tormented
by the wounds</i>

667
01:34:16,702 --> 01:34:19,059
<i>until the moment of death.</i>

668
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:23,189
<i>And the most terrible agony</i>

669
01:34:23,215 --> 01:34:25,677
<i>may not be in the
wounds themselves</i>

670
01:34:25,703 --> 01:34:29,726
<i>but in knowing for certain
that within an hour,</i>

671
01:34:29,752 --> 01:34:34,199
<i>then within 10 minutes,
then within half a minute,</i>

672
01:34:34,225 --> 01:34:37,625
<i>now at this very instant,</i>

673
01:34:37,649 --> 01:34:39,846
<i>your soul will leave your body</i>

674
01:34:39,877 --> 01:34:42,972
<i>and you will no longer be a person.</i>

675
01:34:43,365 --> 01:34:45,645
<i>And that this is certain,</i>

676
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:50,608
<i>the worst thing is that
it is certain."</i>
