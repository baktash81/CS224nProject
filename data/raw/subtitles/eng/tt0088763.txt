ANNOUNCER: <i>October is inventory time.</i>

2
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:34,429
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota is making</i>
<i>the best deals of the year...</i>

3
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,639
<i>... on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

4
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,433
<i>You won't find a better car...</i>

5
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:42,312
<i>... at a better price with better service</i>
<i>anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

6
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,862
NEWSCASTER: <i>The Senate is expected</i>
<i>to vote on this today.</i>

7
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:55,241
<i>In other news, officials at</i>
<i>the Pacific Nuclear research facility...</i>

8
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,369
<i>... have denied the rumor</i>
<i>that a case of missing plutonium...</i>

9
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:01,331
<i>... was in fact stolen</i>
<i>from their vault two weeks ago.</i>

10
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:05,168
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed</i>
<i>responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

11
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:10,256
<i>However, officials now attribute</i>
<i>the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.</i>

12
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,052
<i>The FBI, which is investigating the matter,</i>
<i>had no comment.</i>

13
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,053
MARTY: Doc?

14
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,890
<i>Doc?</i>

15
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,143
<i>Hello! Anybody home?</i>

16
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,603
<i>Einstein, come here, boy.</i>

17
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,815
MARTY: What's going on? God.

18
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,651
<i>Jesus!</i>

19
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,112
<i>That is disgusting.</i>

20
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,324
Rock 'n' roll.

21
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,334
MARTY: Yo.
DOC: <i>Marty, is that you?</i>

22
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,461
Doc. Where are you?

23
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:56,965
DOC: <i>Thank God I've found you. Meet me</i>
<i>at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15.</i>

24
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,551
<i>I made a breakthrough.</i>
<i>I'll need your assistance.</i>

25
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,929
1:15 in the morning?
Doc, what's going on?

26
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,973
MARTY: Where you been all week?
DOC: <i>Working.</i>

27
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,184
MARTY: Is Einstein with you?
DOC: <i>Yeah, he's right here.</i>

28
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,728
You left your equipment on all week.

29
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,398
DOC: <i>My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.</i>

30
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:17,443
<i>Do not hook up to the amplifier.</i>
<i>There's a slight possibility of overload.</i>

31
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,821
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

32
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,282
DOC: <i>Good. I'll see you tonight. Don't forget.</i>

33
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,285
DOC: <i>1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.</i>
MARTY: Right.

34
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,588
DOC: <i>Are those my clocks I hear?</i>
MARTY: Yeah, it's 8:00.

35
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,132
DOC: <i>Perfect! My experiment worked!</i>

36
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,427
<i>They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!</i>

37
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,263
Wait a minute, Doc.

38
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,640
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

39
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,934
DOC: <i>Precisely.</i>
MARTY: Damn!

40
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm late for school.

41
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:55,083
MARTY: Jennifer.
JENNIFER: Strickland's looking for you.

42
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,836
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

43
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,798
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

44
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:06,427
This time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

45
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,762
The doc?

46
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:12,058
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

47
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,894
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

48
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,731
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

49
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,235
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

50
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:25,488
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

51
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:28,199
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

52
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,868
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:33,246
You got a real attitude problem.
You're a slacker.

54
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,834
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

55
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,170
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

56
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:43,882
Your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

57
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,384
Why even bother?
You don't have a chance.

58
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,386
You're too much like your old man.

59
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:52,432
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

60
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,644
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

61
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,231
<i>Next, please.</i>

62
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,075
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,704
<i>We're the Pinheads.</i>

64
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,540
MARTY: <i>One, two, three.</i>

65
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,709
</i>

66
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:40,146
<i>Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.</i>

67
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,398
<i>Hold it, fellas.</i>

68
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,151
<i>I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.</i>

69
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,487
<i>Next, please.</i>

70
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,533
<i>Next group, please.</i>

71
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,871
ANNOUNCER: <i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

72
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,998
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

73
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,000
MARTY: "Too loud." I can't believe it.

74
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,837
We'll never get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

75
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,381
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

76
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,758
I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

77
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,470
But you're really good,
and your audition tape is great.

78
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,889
You've got to send it in
to the record company.

79
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,766
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- I know.

80
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,019
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

81
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,313
That's good advice.

82
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,109
All right. What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

83
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,069
What if they say I'm no good?

84
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,238
What if they say, "You got no future"?

85
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,740
I can't take that kind of rejection.

86
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,827
I'm starting to sound like my old man.

87
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,912
- He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

88
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,790
He's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,877
Check out that 4x4.

90
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,088
MARTY: That is hot.
ATTENDANT: Back her up.

91
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:50,508
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

92
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,220
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

93
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,349
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

94
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,853
Lie out underneath the stars.

95
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,730
- Stop it.
- What?

96
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:07,150
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

97
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,279
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

98
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,365
My mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

99
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,409
I'd get the standard lecture about...

100
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:19,037
...how she never did that stuff
when she was a kid.

101
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,915
Look, I think the woman was born a nun.

102
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,709
She's just trying to keep you respectable.

103
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,920
She's not doing a very good job.

104
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,296
Terrible.

105
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,966
WOMAN: Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

106
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:36,137
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

107
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:40,600
<i>Thirty years ago, lightning struck that</i>
<i>clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.</i>

108
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:45,522
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society
think it should be preserved the way it is...

109
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,732
<i>... as part of our history and heritage.</i>

110
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,609
MARTY: There's a quarter.
WOMAN: Thanks.

111
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,611
WOMAN: Don't forget to take a flyer.

112
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:53,613
<i>Save the clock tower!</i>

113
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,491
Where were we?

114
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,994
JENNIFER: Right about here.
MAN: Jennifer!

115
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,291
It's my dad. I've got to go.

116
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,626
MARTY: I'll call you tonight.

117
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,002
I'll be at my grandma's.

118
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,505
Here, let me give you the number.

119
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:16,553
<i>'Bye.

120
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,807
RADIO DISPATCHER:

<i>Any unit, please respond.</i>

122
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,857
MARTY: Perfect. Just perfect.

123
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,574
BIFF: I can't believe you'd loan me your car...

124
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,784
...without telling me it had a blind spot.

125
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,494
I could've been killed.

126
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:26,039
Now, Biff, I never noticed...

127
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:30,001
...that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

128
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,503
Hi, son.

129
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,379
BIFF: Are you blind, McFly?

130
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,757
<i>How else do you explain</i>
<i>that wreck out there?</i>

131
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,093
MR. MCFLY: Biff, can I assume...

132
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,263
...that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage?

133
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,641
My insurance? It's your car.

134
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:47,685
Your insurance should pay.
Who's going to pay for this?

135
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,814
I spilled beer when the car smashed
into me. Who'll pay my cleaning bill?

136
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,775
<i>And where's my reports?</i>

137
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,196
I haven't finished those up yet,
but I figured since they weren't due 'til...

138
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,199
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

139
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,369
Think, McFly. Think!

140
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,329
I got to have time to get them retyped.

141
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:10,667
Do you realize what would happen
if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?

142
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,335
I'll get fired.

143
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,088
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

144
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,131
- Would you?
- Of course not.

145
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,676
I wouldn't want that to happen.

146
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,262
<i>Now, look.</i>
<i>I'll finish those reports tonight...</i>

147
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:25,598
...and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow.

148
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,725
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

149
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,686
Your shoe's untied.

150
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,397
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

151
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,399
<i>Got the place fixed up nice.</i>

152
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,653
I have your car towed to your house...

153
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,114
...and all you got for me is lite beer?

154
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,415
What are you looking at, butthead?

155
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,627
Say hi to your mom for me.

156
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,632
I know what you're going to say, son...

157
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,384
...and you're right.

158
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,886
You're right.

159
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,470
<i>But...</i>

160
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:07,307
Biff just happens to be my supervisor...

161
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,187
...and I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

162
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,981
But the car, Dad.

163
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,152
MARTY: I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

164
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,405
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

165
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,783
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

166
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:28,453
MR. MCFLY: I know, and all I can say is, <i>I'm...</i>

167
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,580
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,999
MR. MCFLY: Believe me, Marty, you're better off...

169
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:36,211
...without having to worry
about all the aggravation...

170
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:39,589
...and headaches of playing at that dance.

171
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:43,593
DAVID: He's absolutely right.
The last thing you need is headaches.

172
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:55,355
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

173
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,358
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

174
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,988
It would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

175
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:05,782
MARTY: Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

176
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,450
He's your brother, Mom.

177
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:11,287
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

178
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,665
We all make mistakes in life, children.

179
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,458
DAVID: Goddamn it. I'm late.

180
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,168
MRS. MCFLY: David, watch your mouth!

181
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:19,838
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

182
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:23,049
Come on, Mom.
Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.

183
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,676
DAVID: See you later, Pop.

184
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,804
Time to change that oil.

185
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:31,975
LINDA: Marty.

186
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,519
I'm not your answering service.

187
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,980
While you were outside
pouting over the car...

188
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,065
...Jennifer Parker called you twice.

189
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,692
MRS. MCFLY: I don't like her.

190
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:44,028
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

191
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:47,031
LINDA: Mom. There's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

192
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:50,952
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys.

193
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:54,372
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy or...

194
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,000
...sat in a parked car with a boy.

195
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,295
LINDA: Then how am I ever
supposed to meet anybody?

196
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:03,506
Well, it'll just happen.

197
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,009
Like the way I met your father.

198
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,220
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

199
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:11,014
It was meant to be.

200
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:13,600
Anyway...

201
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:17,437
...if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

202
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,105
Yeah, well.

203
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,609
I don't understand what Dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

204
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,195
MRS. MCFLY:
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

205
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,822
What, Lorraine? What?

206
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,825
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car...

207
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,036
...and brought him into the house.

208
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,872
He seemed so helpless.

209
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,669
Like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

210
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:44,923
LINDA: Yeah, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

211
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,424
<i>You felt sorry for him.</i>

212
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:49,594
You decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

213
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:52,680
No. It was
the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

214
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:56,684
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

215
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:00,855
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

216
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:07,111
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

217
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,491
It was then that I realized...

218
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:14,786
...that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

219
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:18,832
Oh, no.

220
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:43,607
Hello.

221
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:46,443
DOC: <i>Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</i>
MARTY: Doc.

222
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:50,406
No. No, don't be silly.

223
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:53,450
DOC: <i>Listen, this is very important.</i>
<i>I forgot my video camera.</i>

224
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,370
<i>Can you pick it up at my place</i>
<i>on your way to the mall?</i>

225
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:59,123
Yeah. I'm on my way.

226
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:26,400
Einstein! Where's the doc, boy?

227
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:21,830
Doc!

228
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:25,376
- Marty! You made it!
- Yeah.

229
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:30,089
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

230
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,757
Well, it's a DeLorean...

231
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:35,761
All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

232
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,222
- Is that a Devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

233
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,516
DOC: Not now.
MARTY: I'm ready.

234
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:45,062
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.

235
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:48,774
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

236
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:51,068
<i>This is temporal experiment number one.</i>

237
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:54,154
DOC: Come on, Einie. Get in there.

238
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:56,282
In you go. Sit down.

239
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,617
Put your seat belt on.

240
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,708
MARTY: Okay.

241
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,670
Please note that Einstein's clock...

242
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:12,673
...is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

243
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,009
DOC: Got it?
MARTY: Right. Check, Doc.

244
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,681
DOC: Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

245
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,898
MARTY:
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

246
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,941
DOC: Watch this.
MARTY: Yeah. Okay.

247
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,484
MARTY: Got it.

248
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,406
Jesus!

249
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:43,996
Not me! The car!

250
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:03,849
If my calculations are correct...

251
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,852
...when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

252
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,688
...you're going to see some serious shit.

253
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,059
Watch this!

254
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,454
What did I tell you?

255
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,000
88 miles per hour!

256
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:19,008
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

257
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:22,595
Jesus Christ!

258
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,181
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

259
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,808
Calm down. I didn't disintegrate anything.

260
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:32,188
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

261
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:34,148
Then where the hell are they?

262
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:37,318
The appropriate question is,
<i>"When the hell are they?"</i>

263
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:41,906
Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

264
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:45,034
DOC: I sent him into the future.

265
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:48,454
One minute into the future, to be exact.

266
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,707
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds...

267
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,835
...we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

268
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,216
Wait a minute, Doc.

269
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:04,929
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

270
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,224
...out of a DeLorean?
- The way I see it...

271
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,394
...if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with style?

272
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,731
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

273
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:18,442
Look out!

274
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,240
MARTY: What? Is it hot?
DOC: It's cold. Damn cold.

275
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:12,162
Einstein, you little devil!

276
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:18,210
<i>Einstein's clock is exactly one minute</i>
<i>behind mine and still ticking!</i>

277
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,340
MARTY: He's okay.
DOC: He's fine.

278
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,718
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

279
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,470
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

280
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:31,182
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

281
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:35,019
He skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time.

282
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:37,521
I'll show you how it works.

283
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:42,067
First, you turn the time circuits on.

284
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:49,909
DOC: This tells you where you're going,
this where you are and this where you were.

285
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:52,453
Input your destination time on this keypad.

286
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:56,165
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

287
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,294
DOC: Or witness the birth of Christ.

288
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:06,008
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

289
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,844
November 5, 1955.

290
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,099
Yes, of course.

291
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:17,144
November 5, 1955.

292
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,605
What happened?

293
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:23,067
That was the day I invented time travel.

294
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,027
<i>I remember it vividly.</i>

295
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,154
I was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock.

296
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:30,074
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

297
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:32,034
When I came to, I had a revelation.

298
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,829
A vision. A picture in my head.
A picture of this.

299
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,999
<i>This is what makes time travel possible.</i>

300
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,335
The flux capacitor.

301
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:42,795
Flux capacitor?

302
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,550
It's taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

303
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,177
My God, has it been that long?

304
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:53,430
Things have certainly changed around here.

305
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:58,519
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

306
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,481
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

307
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:07,653
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

308
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,869
This is...
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

309
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,913
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

310
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,876
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

311
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,170
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

312
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:27,047
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear?

313
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,674
Keep rolling there.

314
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,551
No, this sucker's electrical...

315
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:34,889
...but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

316
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:38,225
You don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

317
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,644
<i>Did you rip that off?</i>

318
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:46,400
Of course. From a group of Libyans.
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

319
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:50,863
I took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts.

320
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:53,908
DOC: Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
MARTY: Jesus!

321
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:26,023
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

322
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,818
DOC: Don't lose those tapes now.

323
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:31,862
I need that as a record.

324
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,240
Let's put this back here. There we go.

325
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,410
Almost forgot my luggage.

326
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:41,330
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

327
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:44,416
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future.

328
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,460
- That's where you're going.
- Right.

329
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:50,965
25 years. I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years...

330
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,175
...seeing the progress of mankind.

331
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,468
MARTY: Why not?

332
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,972
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

333
00:27:58,722 --> 00:27:59,723
MARTY: Doc.

334
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:03,519
Look me up when you get there.

335
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,814
Indeed I will. Roll 'em.

336
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:15,990
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

337
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,869
...am about to embark
on an historic journey.

338
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:23,873
What am I thinking of?

339
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,383
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

340
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:28,052
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

341
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:30,180
I must be out of my mind.

342
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,350
What is it?

343
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:43,943
My God.

344
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:47,280
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

345
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:49,574
DOC: Run for it, Marty!
MARTY: Who?

346
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,243
Who do you think? The Libyans!

347
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,290
Holy shit!

348
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:02,921
I'll draw their fire!

349
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,472
Doc, wait!

350
00:29:26,736 --> 00:29:27,987
No!

351
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:30,698
Bastards!

352
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,635
Go!

353
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,101
Go!

354
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:40,810
Come on! Move! Goddamn it!

355
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:43,771
MARTY: Jesus!

356
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,376
Holy shit!

357
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:08,963
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

358
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,016
WOMAN: Pa, what is it?

359
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,643
What is it, Pa?

360
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:06,980
Looks like an airplane without wings.

361
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,650
That ain't no airplane. Look.

362
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:32,839
Don't look!

363
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:34,549
MARTY: Listen...

364
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:47,979
Hello.

365
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:52,400
Excuse me.

366
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:57,572
Sorry about your barn.

367
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,204
It's already mutated into human form!
Shoot it!

368
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:08,541
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

369
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,339
BOY: Wait!

370
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:18,176
BOY: Shoot it, Pa!

371
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:23,598
MAN: My pine! Why <i>you...</i>

372
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:29,103
MAN: You space bastard! You killed my pine!

373
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:35,360
MARTY: Okay, McFly.

374
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:37,654
Get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream.

375
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:40,573
Just a very intense dream.

376
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:26,744
MARTY: Listen, you got to help me.
WOMAN: Don't stop, Wilbur!

377
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:30,832
It can't be.

378
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,506
This is nuts.

379
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:44,220
Come on.

380
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,473
Perfect.

381
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:44,675
ANNOUNCER: <i>Remember,</i>
<i>fellow citizens, the future is in your hands.</i>

382
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:48,428
<i>If you believe in progress,</i>
<i>re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

383
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:50,681
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

384
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:53,350
<i>Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform...</i>

385
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,936
<i>... means more jobs, better education...</i>

386
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:59,147
<i>... bigger civic improvements</i>
<i>and lower taxes.</i>

387
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:02,901
<i>On election day,</i>
<i>cast your vote for a proven leader.</i>

388
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,320
<i>Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

389
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:10,617
MARTY: This has got to be a dream.

390
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:29,761
MAN: Hey, kid. You jump ship?

391
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:33,140
- What?
- What's with the life preserver?

392
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,022
I want to use the phone.

393
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:42,232
It's in the back.

394
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:46,236
MARTY: Brown.

395
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,781
Great. You're alive.

396
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,420
Come on.

397
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:14,806
MARTY: Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
MAN: Are you going to order, kid?

398
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:17,934
Yeah.

399
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:19,895
<i>Give me a Tab.</i>

400
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,648
I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

401
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,733
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

402
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:27,569
MAN: You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

403
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:30,781
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

404
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,783
Something without sugar.

405
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:41,875
BIFF: McFly.

406
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:45,879
What are you doing?

407
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:47,923
Biff.

408
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,634
I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!

409
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:54,680
GEORGE: Biff. Guys. How are you doing?
BIFF: You got my homework finished?

410
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:58,100
Actually, I figured
since it wasn't due 'til Monday...

411
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:01,019
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

412
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,438
Think, McFly. Think!

413
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:05,399
I got to have time to recopy it.

414
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:09,236
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

415
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,029
I'll get kicked out of school.

416
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,699
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

417
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,577
- Would you?
- Of course not.

418
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:19,579
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

419
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:23,625
- What are you looking at, butthead?
- Get a load of his life preserver.

420
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,460
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

421
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:27,421
BIFF: How about my homework, McFly?

422
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,173
Okay, Biff.

423
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,053
I'll finish that up tonight and then I'll
bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

424
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:38,807
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Your shoe's untied!

425
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,476
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

426
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,314
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

427
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,796
- What?
- You're George McFly!

428
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,049
Yeah. Who are you?

429
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:14,843
Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

430
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,303
They're bigger than me.

431
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:18,680
Stand tall. Have some respect for yourself.

432
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:23,393
If you let people walk over you now,
they'll walk over you the rest of your life.

433
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:26,647
Look at me. You think
I'll spend my life in this slop house?

434
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,523
MAN: Watch it, Goldie.
GOLDIE: No, sir!

435
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:31,068
GOLDIE: I'll do something.
I'll go to night school.

436
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:33,403
One day, I'm going to be somebody.

437
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,364
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

438
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,823
Yeah, I'm...

439
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:38,867
Mayor!

440
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:43,538
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

441
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:47,376
- A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
- Wait and see. I will be mayor.

442
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:49,878
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley...

443
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,755
...and I'm going to clean up this town.

444
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,508
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.

445
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:59,513
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

446
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:01,473
I like the sound of that.

447
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:17,447
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

448
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,772
He's a peeping Tom!

449
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:57,696
Dad!

450
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:12,544
Wait a minute. Who are you?

451
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,634
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

452
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,304
<i>Come out here!</i>
<i>Help me take him in the house!</i>

453
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:29,311
Mom?

454
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:31,021
<i>That you?</i>

455
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:32,856
LORRAINE: There, there, now.

456
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:34,524
<i>Just relax.</i>

457
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,696
<i>You've been asleep</i>
<i>for almost nine hours now.</i>

458
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,368
I had a horrible nightmare.

459
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,497
I dreamed that I went back in time.

460
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:50,290
<i>It was terrible.</i>

461
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,376
LORRAINE: Well...

462
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:56,296
...you're safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

463
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:58,924
1955?

464
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,348
You're my...

465
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:08,433
My name is Lorraine.

466
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:11,645
LORRAINE: Lorraine Baines?
MARTY: Yeah.

467
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:14,231
But you're...

468
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:15,816
You're so...

469
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:19,236
You're so thin!

470
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,406
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

471
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:28,578
Where are my pants?

472
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:30,330
Over there...

473
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:32,499
...on my hope chest.

474
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:36,753
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

475
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:40,132
Calvin?
Why do you keep calling me Calvin?

476
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,968
That is your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein.

477
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,762
It's written all over your underwear.

478
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,099
I guess they call you Cal, huh?

479
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:51,268
No, actually, people...

480
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,562
...call me Marty.

481
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:57,232
Pleased to meet you, Calvin...

482
00:43:58,608 --> 00:43:59,985
Marty...

483
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:02,654
...Klein.

484
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:12,664
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No. Fine.

485
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:15,375
No. Good. Fine. Good.

486
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,838
That's a big bruise you have there.

487
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:23,025
STELLA: Lorraine, are you up there?

488
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,027
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

489
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:28,197
LORRAINE:
Quick! Put your pants back on!

490
00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:38,749
STELLA:
Marty, how long have you been in port?

491
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:41,335
MARTY: Excuse me?
STELLA: I guessed you're a sailor.

492
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:43,879
That's why you wear that life preserver.

493
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:45,381
Coast guard.

494
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:49,843
Sam, here's the young man you hit
with your car. He's all right. Thank God.

495
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:52,221
What were you doing
in the middle of the street?

496
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:55,015
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

497
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,935
Quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

498
00:44:58,018 --> 00:44:59,895
STELLA: You already know Lorraine.

499
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,064
This is Milton, this is Sally...

500
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:06,360
...that's Toby, and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

501
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:10,322
MARTY: So, you're my uncle Joey.

502
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,617
Better get used to these bars, kid.

503
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:17,955
STELLA:
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

504
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,667
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

505
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:24,169
Well, Marty, I hope you like meat loaf.

506
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:27,381
- Well, listen, I really ought to...
- Sit here, Marty.

507
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:32,553
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

508
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,098
Look at it roll.

509
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:39,226
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

510
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,821
Our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

511
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:53,324
Do you have a television?

512
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:56,660
Well, yeah.
You know, we have two of them.

513
00:45:56,785 --> 00:45:59,538
Wow! You must be rich.

514
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:04,084
Honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

515
00:46:09,757 --> 00:46:12,676
I've seen this one. This is a classic.

516
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,763
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

517
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:19,183
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

518
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:22,144
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

519
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:24,229
What's a rerun?

520
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:26,023
You'll find out.

521
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:28,400
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

522
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:30,486
Do I know your mother?

523
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,656
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

524
00:46:33,822 --> 00:46:37,159
STELLA: Then I'll call her.
I don't want her to worry about you.

525
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:38,410
You can't.

526
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:42,873
That is, nobody's home.

527
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:46,794
Yet.

528
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:50,089
Listen.

529
00:46:50,214 --> 00:46:52,758
Do you know where Riverside Drive is?

530
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:56,804
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple. East end of town.

531
00:46:57,096 --> 00:47:00,432
A block past Maple.
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

532
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:03,894
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

533
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,479
LORRAINE: Mother?

534
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:08,565
<i>With Marty's parents out of town...</i>

535
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,485
...don't you think
he ought to spend the night?

536
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,988
After all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

537
00:47:14,113 --> 00:47:16,073
That's true, Marty.

538
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:19,952
I think you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

539
00:47:20,077 --> 00:47:23,497
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- He can sleep in my room.

540
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,457
MARTY: I got to go!

541
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:27,960
Thanks very much. You were all great.

542
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,503
See you all later.

543
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:32,172
Much later.

544
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:38,762
He's a very strange young man.

545
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:40,306
He's an idiot.

546
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:43,809
<i>Comes from upbringing.</i>
<i>His parents are probably idiots, too.</i>

547
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,230
<i>Lorraine, you ever have a kid</i>
<i>who acts that way, I'll disown you.</i>

548
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:27,645
MARTY: Doc?

549
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:29,813
Don't say a word.

550
00:48:31,065 --> 00:48:33,609
DOC: No names. I want
to know nothing about you.

551
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:35,277
MARTY: Listen, Doc...
DOC: Quiet!

552
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:36,987
DOC: Don't tell me anything.

553
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:39,240
MARTY: You got to help...
DOC: Quiet.

554
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:43,827
I'm going to read your thoughts.

555
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:47,539
Let's see now.
You come here from a great distance?

556
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:50,084
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

557
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:53,462
DOC: You want me to subscribe
to the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

558
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:56,090
- No.
- Not a word now!

559
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:57,383
Quiet.

560
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:00,886
Donations.

561
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,013
You want me to make a donation...

562
00:49:03,097 --> 00:49:05,474
...to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

563
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,834
Doc...

564
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,505
...I'm from the future.

565
00:49:10,588 --> 00:49:13,591
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

566
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:18,805
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

567
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:21,641
My God!

568
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,481
Do you know what this means?

569
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:34,445
It means that
this damn thing doesn't work at all!

570
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:38,908
MARTY: You got to help me. You are the only
one who knows how your time machine works.

571
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:40,451
Time machine?

572
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,204
I haven't invented any time machine.

573
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:46,749
Okay. I'll prove it to you.

574
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:50,378
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.

575
00:49:50,503 --> 00:49:54,090
Look at my birthday.
I haven't even been born yet.

576
00:49:54,173 --> 00:49:56,217
And look at this picture.

577
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,553
It's my brother, my sister and me.

578
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:01,931
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
<i>"Class of 1984"?</i>

579
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,936
DOC: Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

580
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:10,189
I'm telling the truth.
You got to believe me.

581
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,109
Then tell me, future boy...

582
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:17,613
...who's president of the United States
in 1985?

583
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:21,200
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor?

584
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:25,330
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

585
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:30,001
DOC: I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
MARTY: Wait, Doc!

586
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:32,295
DOC: And Jack Benny is treasury secretary.

587
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:33,713
MARTY: Listen to me.

588
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,258
I've had enough jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy!

589
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:38,676
MARTY: No, wait, Doc.

590
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,056
MARTY: The bruise on your head.
I know how that happened. You told me.

591
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:45,725
You were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock...

592
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,061
...and you fell
and hit your head on the sink.

593
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:51,898
That's when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which...

594
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,151
...is what makes time travel possible.

595
00:51:08,247 --> 00:51:12,418
MARTY: There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

596
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,889
DOC: After I fell off my toilet...

597
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:27,308
<i>... I drew this.</i>

598
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,772
MARTY: The flux capacitor.

599
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:52,375
It works!

600
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,295
It works!

601
00:51:57,588 --> 00:51:59,966
I finally invent something that works!

602
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,927
You bet your ass it works.

603
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,889
We've got to sneak this back
to my laboratory.

604
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:09,100
We've got to get you home!

605
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:11,311
This is it.

606
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:15,481
DOC ON TV:
<i>Never mind that now.</i>

607
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,942
DOC: Why, that's me! Look at me!

608
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:20,278
- I'm an old man!
<i>- I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

609
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:22,405
<i>I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.</i>

610
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:24,532
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

611
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:26,617
What's this thing I'm wearing?

612
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,870
This is a radiation suit.

613
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:30,705
Radiation suit?

614
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,167
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

615
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:38,171
This is truly amazing.

616
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:40,882
A portable television studio.

617
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:45,053
No wonder your president has to be
an actor. He has to look good on TV.

618
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:47,013
MARTY: This is the part coming up.

619
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:52,560
<i>This sucker's electrical but I need a nuclear</i>
<i>reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

620
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:54,646
What did I just say?

621
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:01,110
<i>... this sucker's electrical,</i>
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction...</i>

622
00:53:01,235 --> 00:53:05,156
<i>...to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of...</i>
- 1.21 gigawatts!

623
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:08,701
1.21 gigawatts.

624
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,413
DOC: Great Scott!

625
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,168
What the hell is a gigawatt?

626
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:19,962
How could I have been so careless?

627
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:21,923
1.21 gigawatts!

628
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:24,676
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power?

629
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:26,302
It can't be done, can it?

630
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:29,806
MARTY: Doc, look.
All we need is a little plutonium.

631
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:34,477
DOC: I'm sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore...

632
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,313
...but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.

633
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,400
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

634
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:44,112
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.

635
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:46,447
I got a life in 1985.

636
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:48,616
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

637
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:50,868
Doc, She's beautiful.

638
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,871
She's crazy about me. Look at this.

639
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:56,124
<i>Look what she wrote here.</i>

640
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,126
<i>That says it all.</i>

641
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:01,587
Doc, you're my only hope.

642
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,466
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating...

643
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:08,761
... 1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

644
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:12,515
MARTY: What did you say?
DOC: A bolt of lightning.

645
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,394
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

646
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:19,564
We do now.

647
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,029
This is it!

648
00:54:26,738 --> 00:54:28,948
This is the answer.

649
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:31,576
It says here that a bolt of lightning...

650
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:35,955
...is going to strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night!

651
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:43,004
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

652
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:47,550
...channel it into the flux capacitor...

653
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,345
<i>... it just might work.</i>

654
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:55,058
Next Saturday night
we're sending you back to the future!

655
00:54:56,017 --> 00:54:57,894
All right. Saturday's good.

656
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:01,814
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

657
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:04,984
That is out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

658
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,028
You must not see or talk to anybody.

659
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:11,449
Anything you do can have repercussions
on future events. Do you understand?

660
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,327
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

661
00:55:15,036 --> 00:55:16,454
Marty...

662
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:19,832
...have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me?

663
00:55:21,876 --> 00:55:25,046
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

664
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:28,633
Great Scott! Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

665
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:36,015
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

666
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,269
MARTY:
His head's gone. It's like it's been erased.

667
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,023
Erased from existence.

668
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:52,407
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

669
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,910
DOC: According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

670
00:55:56,035 --> 00:55:59,288
If they don't meet, they won't fall in love,
get married or have kids.

671
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:01,708
That's why your brother's disappearing.

672
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:05,336
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you're next.

673
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,381
MARTY: Sounds heavy.
DOC: Weight has nothing to do with it.

674
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,008
Which one's your pop?

675
00:56:11,509 --> 00:56:12,677
That's him.

676
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,513
Okay. Okay, you guys.

677
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,560
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

678
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:22,520
Maybe you were adopted.

679
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,189
GEORGE: Okay, real mature, guys.

680
00:56:26,107 --> 00:56:28,651
GEORGE: Okay, pick up my books.
STRICKLAND: McFly.

681
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,194
That's Strickland.

682
00:56:30,903 --> 00:56:32,947
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

683
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:35,616
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

684
00:56:35,867 --> 00:56:38,870
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

685
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:39,954
No.

686
00:56:40,455 --> 00:56:43,291
- What did your mother see in him?
- I don't know.

687
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:47,211
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

688
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:50,089
He hit me with the car.

689
00:56:50,214 --> 00:56:52,175
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

690
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,803
It happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients.

691
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,180
Go to it, kid.

692
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,808
George, buddy.

693
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:03,603
I have been looking all over for you.

694
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,023
You remember me,
the guy who saved your life the other day?

695
00:57:07,899 --> 00:57:10,985
- Yeah.
- There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

696
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:16,616
Lorraine?

697
00:57:17,408 --> 00:57:18,660
Calvin!

698
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:22,413
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George McFly.

699
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:25,750
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

700
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:29,504
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

701
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:33,299
I've been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

702
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,717
Are you okay?

703
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:38,596
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on!

704
00:57:39,514 --> 00:57:41,307
Isn't he a dreamboat?

705
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:48,731
- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

706
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,943
Your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father.

707
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,237
Wait a minute, Doc.

708
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,907
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

709
00:57:58,032 --> 00:58:00,660
- Precisely.
- This is heavy.

710
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:02,912
There's that word <i>again.</i> "Heavy."

711
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:07,250
Why are things so heavy in the future?
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravity?

712
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:10,670
The only way we're going to
get them to mate is if they're alone.

713
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,131
You've got to get them to interact...

714
00:58:13,464 --> 00:58:15,508
...in some sort of <i>social...</i>

715
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:19,178
- You mean like a date?
- Right!

716
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,473
What kind of date?
What do kids do in the '50s?

717
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,226
They're your parents.
You must know them.

718
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:29,105
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

719
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,565
Nothing.

720
00:58:30,648 --> 00:58:33,735
DOC: Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

721
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,363
The Enchantment Under the Sea dance!
They're supposed to go to this.

722
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,450
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

723
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:44,329
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

724
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,581
MARTY: George, buddy...

725
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:50,251
...remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

726
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,009
What are you writing?

727
00:58:59,177 --> 00:59:00,428
Stories.

728
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:04,557
MR. MCFLY: Science fiction stories
about visitors...

729
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:08,061
...coming down to Earth
from other planets.

730
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,816
Get out of town!
I didn't know you did anything creative.

731
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,111
- Let me read some.
- No, no.

732
00:59:16,695 --> 00:59:19,614
I never let anybody read my stories.

733
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:21,658
MARTY: Why not?

734
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:26,580
What if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

735
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:32,002
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

736
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:35,255
No. No, not hard at all.

737
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,050
So anyway, George. About Lorraine.

738
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:41,803
She really likes you.

739
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:45,765
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

740
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,809
...to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

741
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:48,894
- Really?
- Yeah.

742
00:59:49,144 --> 00:59:51,980
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

743
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:55,358
Right here, right now, in the cafeteria?

744
00:59:55,442 --> 00:59:59,112
What if she said no? I don't know
if I could take that kind of rejection.

745
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:04,743
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

746
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:07,245
MARTY: Who?

747
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:10,165
Biff.

748
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,169
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- Come on. Leave.

749
01:00:14,294 --> 01:00:16,254
BIFF: You know you want it.

750
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:18,298
You know you want me to give it to you.

751
01:00:18,423 --> 01:00:21,343
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

752
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,930
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

753
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,890
Get your meat hooks off of me.

754
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:29,935
MARTY: You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks...

755
01:00:30,644 --> 01:00:31,645
...off.

756
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:34,147
MARTY: Please.

757
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:36,817
What's it to you, butthead?

758
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,278
BIFF: You been looking for a fight.

759
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,500
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break...

760
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,085
...today.

761
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:58,755
So why don't you make like a tree...

762
01:00:58,964 --> 01:01:00,590
...and get out of here.

763
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:13,311
MARTY: George!

764
01:01:15,397 --> 01:01:17,357
GEORGE: Why do you keep following me?

765
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,237
George, I'm telling you,
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance...

766
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,323
...I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
- I can't go.

767
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,618
I'll miss my favorite TV program,
<i>Science Fiction Theatre.</i>

768
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:32,038
Yeah, but Lorraine wants to go with you.

769
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:33,790
Give her a break.

770
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:37,627
I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance...

771
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:41,298
...and not you
or anybody else on this planet...

772
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,800
...is going to make me change my mind.

773
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,851
MARTY: <i>Science Fiction Theatre.</i>

774
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:25,759
Who are you?

775
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,225
MARTY:  <i>Silence, Earthling.</i>

776
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,145
<i>My name is Darth Vader.</i>

777
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:45,612
<i>I am an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>from the planet Vulcan.</i>

778
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:48,782
Marty!

779
01:02:52,077 --> 01:02:54,287
- Marty! Marty!
- George, buddy.

780
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,748
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing?

781
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,793
I overslept. I need your help.

782
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,879
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

783
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:05,423
Keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.

784
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:07,551
God! How do you?

785
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,097
MARTY: What made you change your mind?

786
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,100
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet Vulcan...

787
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:19,104
...and told me that if I didn't
take Lorraine out, he'd melt my brain.

788
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:22,274
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

789
01:03:22,357 --> 01:03:25,610
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. There she is.

790
01:03:25,944 --> 01:03:27,737
Just go in there and invite her.

791
01:03:27,821 --> 01:03:30,532
GEORGE: But I don't know what to say.
MARTY: Say anything.

792
01:03:30,615 --> 01:03:34,119
Say whatever's natural,
the first thing that comes into your mind.

793
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:37,164
Nothing's coming to my mind.

794
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:39,416
Jesus. It's a wonder I was even born.

795
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:42,085
- What? What?
- Nothing.

796
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:46,298
Tell her destiny brought you together.

797
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:50,218
Tell her she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

798
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:51,970
Girls like that stuff.

799
01:03:52,637 --> 01:03:55,807
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

800
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,019
- Yeah. Okay. Can you take care of that?
- Right.

801
01:04:17,162 --> 01:04:19,915
Lou, give me a milk.

802
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:22,542
Chocolate.

803
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:40,268
GEORGE: Lorraine.

804
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:42,187
My density...

805
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:44,731
...has popped me to you.

806
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:46,650
What?

807
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:51,446
What I meant to say was...

808
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:54,324
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

809
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:56,117
GEORGE: Yes.

810
01:04:56,451 --> 01:05:00,372
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

811
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,624
I'm your density.

812
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:04,918
I mean...

813
01:05:06,378 --> 01:05:07,629
...your destiny.

814
01:05:11,132 --> 01:05:12,050
BIFF: McFly.

815
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:19,266
I thought I told you never to come in here.

816
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,895
Well, it's going to cost you.

817
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,606
How much money you got on you?

818
01:05:27,232 --> 01:05:29,025
GEORGE: How much do you want, Biff?

819
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:39,035
BIFF: All right, punk.

820
01:05:39,244 --> 01:05:41,621
- Now I'm going to...
- Biff. What's that?

821
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:51,798
That's Calvin Klein. My God, he's a dream.

822
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:55,427
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

823
01:05:58,263 --> 01:05:59,973
MARTY: I'll get it back to you.

824
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,100
BOY: You broke it!

825
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:04,311
Come back here!

826
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:07,772
Look at him go!

827
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:10,358
Get him!

828
01:06:23,997 --> 01:06:26,124
BIFF: To the car! Go!

829
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:34,758
GIRL: What's that thing he's on?
BOY: A board with wheels.

830
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:36,385
He's an absolute dream.

831
01:06:36,468 --> 01:06:39,305
THUG 1: Come on, come on!
THUG 2: Look out for the car!

832
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,089
BIFF: I'm going to ram him.

833
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,931
ALL: Shit!

834
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:49,667
Thanks a lot, kid.

835
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:53,212
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

836
01:07:53,587 --> 01:07:56,674
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

837
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,676
I don't know...

838
01:07:59,218 --> 01:08:01,178
...but I'm going to find out.

839
01:08:06,725 --> 01:08:07,726

<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

844
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,576
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

845
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:26,787
Doc?

846
01:08:27,705 --> 01:08:30,666
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

847
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,169
Fascinating device, this video unit.

848
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,797
Listen, Doc.

849
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:41,719
MARTY: I haven't told you about...
DOC: One shouldn't know about his own destiny.

850
01:08:41,802 --> 01:08:43,387
- You don't understand.
- I do.

851
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:46,015
If I know too much
I endanger my own existence...

852
01:08:46,098 --> 01:08:48,475
...just as you've endangered yours.

853
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,438
You're right.

854
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:55,441
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

855
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:57,401
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

856
01:08:57,526 --> 01:09:00,070
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

857
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:02,281
- It's good.
- Thank you.

858
01:09:04,116 --> 01:09:08,412
We run industrial-strength electrical cable
from the top of the clock tower...

859
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:11,999
<i>... down, suspending it over the street</i>
<i>between these two lampposts.</i>

860
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:16,420
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook...

861
01:09:16,503 --> 01:09:19,590
...which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

862
01:09:20,507 --> 01:09:22,301
At the calculated moment...

863
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:25,054
...you start off from down the street...

864
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:29,224
<i>... driving directly toward the cable,</i>
<i>accelerating to 88 miles per hour.</i>

865
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:33,062
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night...

866
01:09:33,187 --> 01:09:36,774
...lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable...

867
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,109
<i>... as the connecting hook makes contact...</i>

868
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:42,821
<i>... thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts</i>
<i>into the flux capacitor...</i>

869
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:45,282
...and sending you back to 1985.

870
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:49,078
DOC: All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

871
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,290
I'll simulate the lightning.

872
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,758
Ready.

873
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:13,852
Set.

874
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:19,942
Release.

875
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,838
MARTY: You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence.

876
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:44,591
Don't worry. I'll take care of ideas.
You take care of your pop.

877
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:46,802
By the way...

878
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:49,138
...what happened today? Did he ask her out?

879
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:51,265
- I think so.
- What did she say?

880
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:04,194
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

881
01:11:17,499 --> 01:11:19,960
Hi, <i>Cal...</i> Marty.

882
01:11:21,086 --> 01:11:22,171
MARTY: Lorraine.

883
01:11:23,422 --> 01:11:25,299
How did you know I was here?

884
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,801
I followed you.

885
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:31,680
This is my <i>doc...</i> My uncle...

886
01:11:32,514 --> 01:11:34,475
...Doc Brown.

887
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:36,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

888
01:11:39,772 --> 01:11:43,108
LORRAINE:
Marty, this may seem a little forward...

889
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:45,527
...but I was kind of wondering...

890
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:48,364
...if you'd ask me to the...

891
01:11:49,156 --> 01:11:52,159
...Enchantment Under the Sea dance
on Saturday?

892
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:55,287
You <i>mean...</i>

893
01:11:55,704 --> 01:11:57,581
You mean nobody's asked you?

894
01:11:57,998 --> 01:11:58,916
LORRAINE: No.

895
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,418
Not yet.

896
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:06,131
- What about George?
- George McFly?

897
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:12,763
He's kind of cute and all, but <i>not...</i>

898
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:14,640
<i>Well...</i>

899
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:17,726
I think a man should be strong...

900
01:12:19,687 --> 01:12:21,897
...so he can stand up for himself...

901
01:12:22,982 --> 01:12:25,359
...and protect the woman he loves.

902
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:31,031
Don't you?

903
01:12:32,825 --> 01:12:33,659
Yeah.

904
01:12:34,743 --> 01:12:36,620
I still don't understand.

905
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:39,540
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her...

906
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:42,376
...if She's already going
to the dance with you?

907
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:45,129
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

908
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:47,089
She just doesn't know it yet.

909
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:50,217
That's why we got to show her
that you, George, are a fighter.

910
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:53,762
You're somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her.

911
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:56,974
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

912
01:12:57,182 --> 01:12:59,935
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, <i>Dad...</i>

913
01:13:00,019 --> 01:13:01,729
Dad-dad-daddy-o.

914
01:13:02,313 --> 01:13:04,523
You're coming to her rescue, right?

915
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:07,693
Let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?

916
01:13:07,776 --> 01:13:09,361
I'm going to be at the dance.

917
01:13:09,445 --> 01:13:12,531
- And where am I going to be?
- You'll be in the car, with her.

918
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:15,617
Right around 9:00,
She's going to get very angry with me.

919
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:18,078
Why is she going to get angry with you?

920
01:13:18,203 --> 01:13:22,750
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them.

921
01:13:25,127 --> 01:13:29,673
- You're going to go touch her on her...
- No. No, George, look.

922
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:32,468
It's just an act, right?

923
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,513
So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

924
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,100
You see us struggling in the car.

925
01:13:40,309 --> 01:13:43,479
You walk up, you open the door,
and you <i>say...</i>

926
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:46,690
Your line, George.

927
01:13:49,985 --> 01:13:52,821
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

928
01:13:55,157 --> 01:13:57,534
- You really think I ought to swear?
- Definitely.

929
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,286
Goddamn it, George, swear.

930
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:02,289
Okay. So now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

931
01:14:02,373 --> 01:14:04,249
I'm out for the count, right?

932
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,628
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

933
01:14:07,836 --> 01:14:09,963
You make it sound so easy.

934
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:12,883
I <i>just...</i> I wish I wasn't so scared.

935
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:16,553
There's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is self-confidence.

936
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:19,014
You know, if you put your mind to it...

937
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,433
...you can accomplish anything.

938
01:14:23,143 --> 01:14:25,688
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Hill Valley weather this Saturday night.</i>

939
01:14:25,813 --> 01:14:28,649
<i>Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.</i>

940
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:30,609
<i>Lows tonight, in the upper forties.</i>

941
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:33,362
Are you sure about this storm?

942
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:37,741
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

943
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:40,536
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

944
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:44,289
You've made a difference in my life,
given me something to shoot for.

945
01:14:44,373 --> 01:14:48,544
Just knowing
that I'm going to be around to see 1985.

946
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:50,504
That I'm going to succeed in this!

947
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:53,632
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

948
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:02,308
It's going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you...

949
01:15:02,391 --> 01:15:05,311
...about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

950
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:07,813
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

951
01:15:09,356 --> 01:15:10,858
I'm going to miss you.

952
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:18,490
- Doc, about the future...
- No!

953
01:15:18,574 --> 01:15:23,787
We've agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous.

954
01:15:23,912 --> 01:15:27,833
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

955
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:33,088
Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out
through the natural course of time.

956
01:15:34,131 --> 01:15:36,091
<i>"Dear Dr. Brown:

957

- What you got under here?
- No! Don't touch that!

966
01:16:15,339 --> 01:16:18,133
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

967
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:20,427
Got a permit for that?

968
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:22,429
Of course I do.

969
01:16:29,269 --> 01:16:32,106
DOC: Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

970
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:26,244
Do you mind if we...

971
01:17:26,327 --> 01:17:28,871
...park for a while?

972
01:17:29,831 --> 01:17:32,917
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

973
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,713
I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

974
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:40,007
What?

975
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:43,302
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

976
01:17:43,427 --> 01:17:44,512
No.

977
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:46,681
No.

978
01:17:51,352 --> 01:17:53,729
Lorraine, what are you doing?

979
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:56,649
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

980
01:17:56,774 --> 01:17:59,569
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

981
01:17:59,777 --> 01:18:01,654
- Why not?
- Because you...

982
01:18:02,405 --> 01:18:05,992
You might regret it later in life.

983
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:08,119
Marty, don't be such a square.

984
01:18:08,244 --> 01:18:10,997
<i>Everybody who's anybody drinks.</i>

985
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,295
Jeez, you smoke too?

986
01:18:18,713 --> 01:18:21,632
You're beginning to sound
just like my mother.

987
01:18:32,935 --> 01:18:36,522
<i>We're going to take a little break,</i>
<i>but we'll be back in a while...</i>

988

<i>... so don't nobody go nowhere.</i>

989
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:58,211
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

990
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:00,755
Lorraine...

991
01:19:01,797 --> 01:19:03,674
...have you ever...

992
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:08,679
...been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way, but when...

993
01:19:08,763 --> 01:19:11,933
...you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it?

994
01:19:12,016 --> 01:19:15,102
You mean like how
you're supposed to act on a first date?

995
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:17,146
Sort of.

996
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:20,483
I think I know exactly what you mean.

997
01:19:21,108 --> 01:19:22,360
You do?

998
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,530
You know what I do in those situations?

999
01:19:25,613 --> 01:19:27,907
- What?
- I don't worry.

1000
01:19:45,716 --> 01:19:47,593
LORRAINE: This is all wrong.

1001
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:50,012
I don't know what it is...

1002
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,851
...but when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing...

1003
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:57,812
...my brother.

1004
01:19:58,104 --> 01:20:00,815
<i>I guess that doesn't make any sense,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

1005
01:20:00,898 --> 01:20:02,525
Believe me...

1006
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:05,069
...it makes perfect sense.

1007
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:07,363
Somebody's coming.

1008
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:16,414
You caused $300 damage to my car,
you son of a bitch...

1009
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,958
...and I'm going to take it out of your ass.

1010
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,626

01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:37,883
DOC: Information about the future.
MARTY: Wait a minute.

1180
01:33:37,966 --> 01:33:39,927
I warned you about this, kid.

1181
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:42,805
The consequences could be disastrous!

1182
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:45,307
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

1183
01:33:45,432 --> 01:33:48,602
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

1184
01:33:48,727 --> 01:33:52,064
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1185
01:33:52,356 --> 01:33:55,025
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

1186
01:33:59,112 --> 01:34:00,489
Great Scott!

1187
01:34:08,455 --> 01:34:11,458
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1188
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,710
MARTY: Right! I got it!

1189
01:34:47,536 --> 01:34:48,787
Doc!

1190
01:34:56,461 --> 01:35:00,549
DOC: Come on, come on. Let's go!
MARTY: All right! Take it up!

1191
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:05,095
Go!

1192
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:13,187
Doc!

1193
01:35:14,438 --> 01:35:17,941
I have to tell you about the future.

1194
01:35:18,025 --> 01:35:22,321
DOC: What?
MARTY: I have to tell you about the future!

1195
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:23,822
What?

1196
01:35:23,906 --> 01:35:28,619
On the night I go back in time you get...

1197
01:35:32,247 --> 01:35:33,582
Doc!

1198
01:35:42,841 --> 01:35:43,759
Go!

1199
01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:47,012
- No, Doc!
- Look at the time!

1200
01:35:47,346 --> 01:35:49,473
You've got less than four minutes.

1201
01:35:49,598 --> 01:35:51,308
<i>Please, hurry!</i>

1202
01:36:02,945 --> 01:36:04,279
DOC: Yeah!

1203
01:36:57,499 --> 01:37:00,752
Damn it, Doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1204
01:37:00,878 --> 01:37:02,838
If I only had more time.

1205
01:37:05,841 --> 01:37:08,218
Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.

1206
01:37:08,302 --> 01:37:11,889
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1207
01:37:11,972 --> 01:37:14,099
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1208
01:37:16,059 --> 01:37:18,353
<i>Okay. Time circuit's on.</i>

1209
01:37:18,687 --> 01:37:21,356
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1210
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:23,859
Engine running. All right.

1211
01:37:26,737 --> 01:37:29,114
No. No, no.

1212
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:32,576
Come on. Come on. Not this time.

1213
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,231
MARTY: Come on.

1214
01:38:46,358 --> 01:38:49,111
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1215
01:38:50,779 --> 01:38:53,657
Please. Please. Come on!

1216
01:40:32,005 --> 01:40:33,382
Doc.

1217
01:42:08,961 --> 01:42:11,005
Crazy drunk driver.

1218
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,064
All right. Fred.

1219
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:32,652
You look great. Everything looks great.

1220
01:42:34,028 --> 01:42:35,029
<i>1:24.</i>

1221
01:42:35,154 --> 01:42:38,032
I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1222
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:44,038
No! No, not again!

1223
01:42:44,121 --> 01:42:46,582
Come on! Come on!

1224
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:01,597
Libyans.

1225
01:43:24,161 --> 01:43:25,246
MARTY: <i>No!</i>

1226
01:43:26,581 --> 01:43:27,915
<i>Bastards!</i>

1227
01:43:41,387 --> 01:43:42,722
TERRORIST: Go!

1228
01:44:17,131 --> 01:44:19,258
MARTY: Doc! Doc!

1229
01:44:26,265 --> 01:44:27,183
MARTY: No!

1230
01:44:41,822 --> 01:44:43,282
You're alive.

1231
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:54,085
Bulletproof vest?

1232
01:44:55,461 --> 01:44:57,421
How did you know?

1233
01:44:57,922 --> 01:45:00,591
<i>I never got a chance to tell you.</i>

1234
01:45:13,938 --> 01:45:17,942
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

1235
01:45:18,067 --> 01:45:20,027
The space-time continuum?

1236
01:45:20,611 --> 01:45:23,489
Well, I figured, what the hell.

1237
01:45:33,749 --> 01:45:35,626
MARTY: So how far ahead are you going?

1238
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:38,796
About 30 years. It's a nice round number.

1239
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,007
Look me up when you get there, all right?

1240
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,134
Guess I'll be about 47.

1241
01:45:43,426 --> 01:45:44,510
I will.

1242
01:45:45,094 --> 01:45:46,178
MARTY: Take care.

1243
01:45:47,305 --> 01:45:48,306
You, too.

1244
01:45:48,556 --> 01:45:50,850
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1245
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:54,228
MARTY: And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1246
01:45:55,104 --> 01:45:56,105
You bet.

1247
01:46:34,685 --> 01:46:36,479
</i>

1248
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,438
What a nightmare.

1249
01:47:13,616 --> 01:47:16,953
LINDA: If Paul calls, tell him I'm working
at the boutique late.

1250
01:47:17,036 --> 01:47:19,080
DAVID:
Linda, I'm not your answering service...

1251
01:47:19,205 --> 01:47:22,709
...and somebody named Greg or Craig
<i>called you just a little while ago.</i>

1252
01:47:22,792 --> 01:47:26,838
LINDA: Which one was it?
DAVID: I can't keep up with your boyfriends.

1253
01:47:29,424 --> 01:47:31,009
MARTY: What the hell is this?

1254
01:47:31,801 --> 01:47:32,886
Breakfast.

1255
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:35,680
DAVID: Did you sleep in your clothes again?

1256
01:47:35,972 --> 01:47:37,223
Yeah. L...

1257
01:47:38,391 --> 01:47:40,685
What are you wearing, Dave?

1258
01:47:41,102 --> 01:47:42,187
Marty...

1259
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:44,981
...I always wear a suit to the office.

1260
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:47,400
DAVID: You all right?
MARTY: Yeah.

1261
01:47:48,318 --> 01:47:50,528
MRS. MCFLY: We need a rematch.
MR. MCFLY: A rematch?

1262
01:47:50,612 --> 01:47:52,739
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1263
01:47:52,864 --> 01:47:54,574
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1264
01:47:56,784 --> 01:47:58,286
Mom! Dad!

1265
01:47:58,661 --> 01:48:01,206
MR. MCFLY: Hit your head?
MRS. MCFLY: Are you okay?

1266
01:48:01,289 --> 01:48:04,375
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1267
01:48:04,709 --> 01:48:07,170
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1268
01:48:08,713 --> 01:48:10,423
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1269
01:48:11,716 --> 01:48:14,469
MRS. MCFLY: Good morning, kids.
DAVID AND LINDA: 'Morning.

1270
01:48:14,594 --> 01:48:17,138
LINDA: Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1271
01:48:17,222 --> 01:48:20,809
I sure like her. She is such a sweet girl.

1272
01:48:21,351 --> 01:48:23,478
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1273
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:25,355
What? What, Ma?

1274
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:29,484
Aren't you going up to the lake?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1275
01:48:29,692 --> 01:48:32,237
We talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1276
01:48:32,445 --> 01:48:33,530
The car's wrecked.

1277
01:48:33,655 --> 01:48:35,156
MR. MCFLY: Wrecked?
DAVID: Wrecked?

1278
01:48:35,323 --> 01:48:37,534
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1279
01:48:37,617 --> 01:48:41,204
MR. MCFLY: I'm sure the car is fine.
DAVID: Why am I the last to know?

1280
01:48:41,538 --> 01:48:44,374
MR. MCFLY: See? There's Biff out there
waxing it now.

1281
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:49,337
Now, Biff, I want to make sure we get
two coats of wax, not just one.

1282
01:48:49,462 --> 01:48:53,591
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, Biff, don't con me.

1283
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,137
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1284
01:48:57,345 --> 01:49:00,223
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1285
01:49:00,974 --> 01:49:03,184
Biff. What a character.

1286
01:49:03,351 --> 01:49:05,728
<i>Always trying to get away with something.</i>

1287
01:49:05,854 --> 01:49:08,857
<i>I've had to stay on top of Biff</i>
<i>ever since high school.</i>

1288
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:12,527
MR. MCFLY: But, if it wasn't for him...
MRS. MCFLY: We'd never have fallen in love.

1289
01:49:14,279 --> 01:49:16,823
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1290
01:49:17,032 --> 01:49:19,701
Hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1291
01:49:22,454 --> 01:49:24,831
Honey! Your first novel.

1292
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:31,380
MR. MCFLY: I've always told you, if you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.

1293
01:49:31,588 --> 01:49:35,175
Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1294
01:49:35,467 --> 01:49:36,385
Keys?

1295
01:49:52,943 --> 01:49:55,404
- How about a ride, mister?
- Jennifer!

1296
01:49:57,072 --> 01:49:59,032
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

1297
01:49:59,408 --> 01:50:01,118
MARTY: Let me look at you.

1298
01:50:01,618 --> 01:50:04,496
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1299
01:50:04,579 --> 01:50:05,664
I haven't.

1300
01:50:06,581 --> 01:50:07,666
You okay?

1301
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:10,377
Is everything all right?

1302
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:14,214
MARTY: Yeah.

1303
01:50:16,466 --> 01:50:18,093
Everything is great.

1304
01:50:32,524 --> 01:50:33,442
Marty!

1305
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,903
You've got to come back with me!

1306
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:39,781
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1307
01:50:44,619 --> 01:50:46,413
What are you doing, Doc?

1308
01:50:47,789 --> 01:50:48,957
I need fuel.

1309
01:50:52,294 --> 01:50:54,421
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1310
01:50:54,796 --> 01:50:59,259
No, no. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1311
01:50:59,343 --> 01:51:02,220
DOC: Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1312
01:51:02,346 --> 01:51:05,849
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1313
01:51:06,141 --> 01:51:09,102
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, Marty.

1314
01:51:09,186 --> 01:51:12,522
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1315
01:51:12,606 --> 01:51:14,816
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1316
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:24,242
We better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1317
01:51:24,368 --> 01:51:27,954
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

1318
01:55:33,408 --> 01:55:35,452
