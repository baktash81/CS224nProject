1
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,500
Ladies and gentlemen, young and old,

2
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,000
this may seem an unusual procedure,

3
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,200
speaking to you
before the picture begins,

4
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,600
but we have an unusual subject -
the story of the birth of freedom.

5
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,500
The story of Moses.

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,400
As many of you know, the Holy Bible
omits some 30 years of Moses' life,

7
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,900
from the time he was
a three-month-old baby

8
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,800
and was found in the bulrushes
by Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh,

9
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,100
and adopted into the court of Egypt
until he learned that he was Hebrew

10
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
and killed the Egyptian.

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,700
To fill in those missing years
we turned to ancient historians

12
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,400
such as Philo and Josephus.

13
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,800
Philo wrote at the time that
Jesus of Nazareth walked the Earth,

14
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,200
and Josephus wrote
some 50 years later

15
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,600
and watched the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Romans.

16
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,400
These historians had access
to documents long since destroyed

17
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
or perhaps lost,
like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,200
The theme of this picture is whether
men are to be ruled by God's law,

19
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,000
or whether they are to be ruled by
the whims of a dictator like Rameses.

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Are men the property of the state

21
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,200
or are they free souls under God?

22
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,000
This same battle
continues throughout the world today.

23
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Our intention
was not to create a story,

24
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,900
but to be worthy
of the divinely inspired story

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
created 3,000 years ago.

26
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,600
The five books of Moses.

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,500
The story takes three hours
and 39 minutes to unfold.

28
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,200
There will be an intermission.

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Thank you for your attention.

30
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,500
And God said, "Let there be light."

31
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
And there was light.

32
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,900
And from this light
God created life upon Earth.

33
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,600
And man was given dominion
over all things upon this Earth,

34
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,400
and the power to choose
between good and evil,

35
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,900
but each sought to do his own will

36
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,800
because he knew not
the light of God's law.

37
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
Man took dominion over man.

38
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,200
The conquered
were made to serve the conqueror.

39
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,500
The weak were made
to serve the strong.

40
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,400
And freedom was gone from the world.

41
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,000
So did the Egyptians
cause the children of Israel

42
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
to serve with rigour,

43
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,400
and their lives were made bitter
with hard bondage

44
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,200
and their cry came up unto God
and God heard them.

45
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
And cast into Egypt,

46
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,000
into the lowly hut of Amram
and Yochabel, the seed of a man

47
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,200
upon whose mind and heart
would be written

48
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,000
God's law and God's commandments.

49
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,200
One man to stand alone
against an empire.

50
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Divine one, last night
our astrologers saw an evil star

51
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,600
enter into the house of Egypt.

52
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,300
Meaning war?

53
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,400
What nation would dare
draw the sword against us?

54
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,300
The enemy to fear is in Egypt.

55
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

56
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,200
The Hebrew slaves
in the land of Goshen.

57
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I number my enemies by their swords,
not by their chains, High Priest.

58
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,500
Chains have been forged
into swords before now.

59
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,700
There is a prophecy of a deliverer.
The star proclaims his birth.

60
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Then, let the Hebrews die.

61
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
Slaves are wealth, Commander.

62
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
The more slaves we have,
the more bricks we make.

63
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,400
I would see fewer bricks made
and fewer Hebrews in Goshen.

64
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
It is our eastern gate.

65
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Since this deliverer
is amongst their newborn,

66
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,300
only their newborn need die.

67
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Every newborn Hebrew man child
shall die.

68
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,800
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

69
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,900
So speaks Rameses the First.

70
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,000
No! Oh...

71
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, no!

72
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,200
Please! Please! No!

73
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,300
God of Abraham,
take my child into thy hands,

74
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,300
that he may live to thy service.

75
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,800
We have not even given him a name.

76
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,500
God will give him a name.

77
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Follow it, Miriam.
Watch it from the reeds.

78
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,400
See where the Lord will lead him.

79
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, Mother.

80
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,200
- Why didn't you say no?
- She didn't think of it.

81
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,900
Here! Throw!

82
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,500
- You're getting fat.
- Too many sesame cakes!

83
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,600
Catch a lotus and you catch a wish.

84
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,400
What will you wish for,
gold or a man?

85
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Gold, of course.

86
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,300
- That'll get any man!
- It won't fill an empty heart.

87
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,500
Quiet, you chattering geese.

88
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,500
Memnet, you're only happy
when you're miserable.

89
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,300
You fools! Talk of empty hearts
before the Pharaoh's daughter.

90
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,400
What is there in her heart
but the memory of a dead husband?

91
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,400
Look, there's something here!

92
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
Be sure it's not a crocodile!

93
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,400
Bithiah can charm tears
from a crocodile.

94
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,300
What is it, Bithiah?

95
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,900
Only a drifting basket.

96
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,800
- Shall we come and help you get it?
- Memnet, send the girls away.

97
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,100
Now see what you've done.
Back to the palace, all of you.

98
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,200
- All of you. Musicians, too.
- We wouldn't hurt Bithiah.

99
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,100
Bithiah's tired of you and so am I.

100
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,700
- You're tired of everything.
- Go on. Off you go.

101
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Go on. Hurry up!
You've hurt her enough.

102
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,100
- What have you found?
- The answer to my prayers.

103
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,700
You prayed for a basket?

104
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,100
No... I prayed for a son.

105
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,500
Your husband
is in the house of the dead.

106
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,300
He has asked the Nile god
to bring me this beautiful boy.

107
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,700
Do you know the pattern
of this cloth?

108
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
If my son is covered in it...

109
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,100
it is royal robe.

110
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,400
Royal? It is the cloth
of a Hebrew slave.

111
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,100
He was put upon the water
to save him from your father's edict.

112
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,300
I am the Pharaoh's daughter
and this is my son.

113
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,800
He shall be reared in my house
as the Prince of the Two Lands.

114
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,600
My mother and her mother were
branded to the Pharaoh's service.

115
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,000
I will not see a son of slaves
made a prince of Egypt.

116
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,500
You WILL see it, Memnet.

117
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,300
You will see him walk
with his head among the eagles.

118
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,300
You will serve him as you serve me.

119
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,700
Fill the ark with water.
Sink it into silence.

120
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,800
Raise your hands, Memnet.

121
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,000
What you have buried in the Nile
shall remain buried in your heart.

122
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
- Swear it.
- I will be silent.

123
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,300
The day you break that oath will be
the last your eyes shall ever see.

124
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,300
You will be the glory
of Egypt, my son.

125
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,200
Mighty in words and deeds.
Kings shall bow before you.

126
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Your name will live
when the pyramids are dust.

127
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
And...

128
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,800
because I drew you from the water,
you shall be called Moses.

129
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,800
He proclaims his coming from afar,
does he not, my son?

130
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,300
Such favour with the people
can be dangerous, Great Sethi.

131
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,900
To whom, Rameses? To me or to you?

132
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Fame can turn a prince
against his Pharaoh.

133
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,300
Envy can turn a brother
against his brother.

134
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Envy is for the weak.

135
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,100
Beauty is for the strong.
That is what you have in mind.

136
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,300
If you mean Nefretiri,
yes, my father.

137
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,700
Is it her beauty that attracts you

138
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,600
or the fact that she must marry
the man I choose to succeed me?

139
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
I am the son of your body.

140
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Who else could be your heir?

141
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,200
The man best able to rule Egypt
will follow me.

142
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,000
I owe that to my fathers...
not to my sons.

143
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,200
- Then I shall follow you.
- Shall you?

144
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,500
Do not let ambition
shave your prince's lock.

145
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,600
I sent Moses to destroy a city.
He returns in triumph.

146
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,400
I sent you to build a city.
Where is it?

147
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,300
It will rise when I have put fear
into the Hebrew slaves who build it.

148
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,400
But this I know, my father...

149
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,700
no pretended brother
will ever have your crown...

150
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
or Nefretiri.

151
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Indeed?

152
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,600
Whoever I choose
shall have my crown...

153
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,600
AND Nefretiri.

154
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,300
I think I see him, Memnet.

155
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,400
Yes, I can see him!

156
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,700
Listen, Memnet. Listen.

157
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,200
The trumpets tell all the world
he's come back to me.

158
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,300
Hear them.

159
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,600
And all those shouts are drowned
by the beating of my heart.

160
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,900
Do you hear, Memnet?
A whole city calls his name.

161
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
I hear them, Nefretiri.

162
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,600
The Lord Moses, Prince of Egypt,
son of the Pharaoh's sister,

163
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,600
beloved of the Nile god,
commander of the Southern Host.

164
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,300
Welcome home!

165
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Prince Moses!

166
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:53,000
Blessings be upon you. He has
brought down the pride of Ethiopia.

167
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,700
The old windbag!

168
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,600
- I agree with him.
- May your name be exalted on Earth,

169
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,800
even as the sun
is exalted in the heavens.

170
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,600
Welcome to my sister's son. We have
heard how you took ibis from the Nile

171
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,400
to kill venomous serpents when
you laid siege to the city of Sabba.

172
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,000
May my arms stay strong
in your service.

173
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:34,000
Who is this fair young god
come into the house of Pharaoh?

174
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,100
No need to tell you
how I share her joy at your return.

175
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
No need, my brother.

176
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,700
Great one, I bring you Ethiopia!

177
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,500
Command them to kneel
before Pharaoh.

178
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,500
Command what YOU have conquered.

179
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I bring the Ethiopian king
and his sister in friendship,

180
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
as an ally to guard
our southern gates.

181
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,100
My son has dealt wisely with you,
Ethiopia. Welcome as a friend.

182
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,000
Great king, I will ask
but one favour of your friendship.

183
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,300
This green stone
from our mountains...

184
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,400
that I may give it to your
Prince of Egypt...for he is kind...

185
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,600
as well as wise.

186
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,700
It is pleasing to the gods to see
a man honoured by his enemies.

187
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,300
And such a beautiful enemy!

188
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,700
See to their comfort.

189
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,900
Divine one, here is the full count
of Ethiopia's tribute.

190
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
Bearers!

191
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I am sending down the Nile 20 barges
of such wealth as you see here.

192
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Logs of ebony and trees of myrrh,
all for your new treasure city.

193
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,300
A handsome tribute indeed, Moses.

194
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,500
- But I have no new treasure city.
- And you will have none.

195
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,700
The slaves die rather than bend
their backs in your service.

196
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Why?

197
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,300
They believe a deliverer has come
to lead them from their bondage.

198
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
Deliverer?!

199
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,800
He has been foretold
since my father's time.

200
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,600
Now you make him
an excuse for your failure.

201
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,800
I do not make excuses.

202
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,500
If you doubt me,
let Moses build a city.

203
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
No! No. He's just trying
to keep Moses away from you, Sethi.

204
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Or you, perhaps.

205
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,900
I think our roosters would crow
more softly on another roof.

206
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
Stand before me, both of you.

207
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,100
Would you please
your Pharaoh, Moses?

208
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,300
- Your wish is my will.
- Then you build my city.

209
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,700
A wise decision. A noble task.

210
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Rameses, do you believe
this slave deliverer is a myth?

211
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,400
What I believe is of no account.

212
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,500
What matters is
the slaves believe in him.

213
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,300
Of course, of course.

214
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,900
Then you, too, shall go to Goshen.

215
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Learn if this deliverer
be a myth or a man.

216
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:21,200
If a myth, bring him in a bottle.
If a man, bring him to me in chains.

217
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,200
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

218
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,000
Your fragrance
is like the wine of Babylon.

219
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,600
I could...

220
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,500
But you are the throne princess
and by the Pharaoh's law,

221
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,200
you can marry only a Pharaoh.

222
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,800
I SHALL marry a Pharaoh...

223
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,700
you.

224
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,000
Rameses might not like that idea.

225
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,900
Sethi might. When you were gone,
I kept your name on his lips.

226
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,500
But unless you succeed,
you'll be prince of some province

227
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,200
and I'll be Rameses' wife.

228
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,900
Build a city for him
and Sethi will deny you nothing.

229
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,200
I will build the city for love
of Sethi, not the throne of Egypt.

230
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,200
But I am Egypt.

231
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Now the flame you lighted
burns close to the throne.

232
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,800
Your tongue would dig
your grave, Memnet.

233
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,700
A conqueror already conquered?

234
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,600
The first face I looked for
and the last I find. Mother.

235
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,300
I was thanking the gods
for your safe return.

236
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,600
But I find you in grave danger here.

237
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Intoxicating danger, Mother.

238
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,000
Marry her if you can, my son,
but never fall in love with her.

239
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,200
I'll be less trouble
than the Hebrews of Goshen.

240
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,400
You've guzzled enough.
Bring those bricks up and get on.

241
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,200
You, there's other swine to water.

242
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Get those bricks back on.

243
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,300
- Here! Waterlily!
- My name is Lilia.

244
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,500
To me you are a lily
and I want water.

245
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Joshua...

246
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,900
Joshua, I thought
you'd never come down.

247
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,700
Water before love, my girl.

248
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,400
Does it take the whole Nile
to quench your thirst?

249
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,400
No, just your lips.

250
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,100
Careful, my love.
Dathan's eyes can see through stone.

251
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,800
Dathan is a vulture feeding
on the flesh of his own people.

252
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,300
When he looks at me, I'm afraid.

253
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,100
If he touches you, I'll strangle him.

254
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,500
And bring death to 1 ,000 others?

255
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,700
Is life in bondage better than death?

256
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,800
Joshua, we must have hope.

257
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,500
God will send us the deliverer.

258
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,400
Hope? On the heels
of every hope walks Dathan.

259
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,800
You're Dathan, the Hebrew overseer.

260
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,300
CHIEF Hebrew overseer, mighty one.

261
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Baka, the master builder,
has told me that I can rely on you.

262
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,200
I am warmed by his favour.

263
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Rely on you to sell
your own mother for a price.

264
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,300
And who am I to deny the word
of the master builder?

265
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Where is this would-be deliverer
who would set the Hebrews free?

266
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,300
Who can say, immortal prince?

267
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
They do not confide in me.

268
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,200
- But it is possible to learn.
- No doubt.

269
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,900
You have rat's ears
and a ferret's nose.

270
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,500
To use in your service,
son of Pharaoh.

271
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,700
Add to them the eyes of a weasel
and find me this deliverer.

272
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Old woman! Old woman!

273
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,800
More grease under the centre stone.

274
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,800
- Yochabel!
- Help me!

275
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,500
Stop the stone!

276
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,400
Keep pulling up there.

277
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,600
Yochabel is caught. Stop the stone!

278
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,700
- Pull!
- You'll kill her! Stop the stone!

279
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,700
We don't stop a moving block
for an old woman.

280
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,500
Lay on the lash! Keep it moving!

281
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,100
Stop the stone! Stop the stone!

282
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,400
Hold the ropes!

283
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,700
- Cut the old woman loose.
- You'll die in a limepit.

284
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,100
- Joshua!
- Run to the prince and beg mercy.

285
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,100
Mercy from Rameses?!

286
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,400
No, the Prince Moses,
there on the pavilion.

287
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,600
After her! After her!

288
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,600
Stop her!

289
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Stop that girl!

290
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,900
The water girl, stop her!

291
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,100
Stop her!

292
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Mercy, Prince Moses!

293
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,100
- Mercy, Prince Moses!
- Come here.

294
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,400
- Mercy? What have you done?
- Not for myself, Lord Prince.

295
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,100
For a slave who saved Yochabel
and me from death between the blocks.

296
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,500
A delicate flower
to be pressed between stone blocks.

297
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
How were you saved?

298
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,500
- A stonecutter struck the overseer.
- There can be one punishment.

299
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,400
Blood makes poor mortar. Come.

300
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,100
Prince Moses!

301
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
Get away, you!

302
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,700
Would you bury the old woman alive
in a tomb of rock?

303
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,300
My noble one, it caught. I had
not the strength to free myself.

304
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,300
Your shoulder should not
bear a burden, old woman.

305
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,300
The Lord has renewed my strength
and lightened my burdens.

306
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,400
He would have done better
to remove them.

307
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,900
They use the old ones
to grease the stones, Lord Prince.

308
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
If they are killed, it is no loss.

309
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,800
Are you a builder or a butcher?

310
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,400
If we stopped when a grease woman
falls, the city would never rise.

311
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
The slaves must be driven.

312
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Their work lags for lack of food.

313
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,600
- You seem strong.
- I am a stonecutter.

314
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,800
- Pharoahs like their images deep.
- Hold your whip!

315
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,000
You know it is death
to strike an Egyptian?

316
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,700
I know it.

317
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,400
- Yet you struck him?
- To save the woman.

318
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,500
- What is she to you?
- An old woman.

319
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Lord Prince, send him to his death.

320
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,600
The man has courage.
You do not speak like a slave.

321
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,000
God made men. Men made slaves.

322
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,300
Which god?

323
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,500
The God of Abraham, the almighty God.

324
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,700
If he is almighty,
why does he leave you in bondage?

325
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,200
He will choose the hour
of our freedom and our deliverer.

326
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,200
- This man speaks treason.
- It is not treason to want freedom.

327
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,800
Release him.

328
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,900
Difficulty with the slaves,
my brother?

329
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,100
None that could not be cured by
a ration of grain and a day of rest.

330
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,100
A day of rest?

331
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,000
When your horses tire,
they're rested.

332
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,400
When they hunger, they're fed.

333
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,700
Slaves draw stone and brick.
My horses draw the next Pharaoh.

334
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,000
- Is any grain stored in Goshen?
- None that you would dare take.

335
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
The temple granaries are full.

336
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,900
Bring the push-pull men
and some women with baskets.

337
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,600
I will...great prince.

338
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,500
I warn you, Moses,
the temple grain belongs to the gods.

339
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,800
What the gods can digest will
not sour in the belly of a slave.

340
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,500
You, back where you belong!

341
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,200
I have the prince's orders.
Get 100 women with baskets.

342
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,900
Elisheba, bring your basket.

343
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,600
Push-pullers, follow me.

344
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,300
Out of the way!

345
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,000
Break open the bins.

346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
Out of the way. Stand back.

347
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,300
A-ha!

348
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,600
Well, well.

349
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,800
- Divine one...
- Hmm?

350
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,500
- There!
- Oh!

351
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:35,300
- My jackals have your hounds at bay.
- Dogs at bay are dangerous.

352
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,800
When they walk upright
and feed on temple grain.

353
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,800
You don't like Moses, but the city's
being built and I'm winning the game,

354
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,300
so don't interrupt us with trifles.

355
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,900
Before your city is finished
these trifles will surprise you.

356
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Life is full of surprises.

357
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,800
And today I have
one for you, my kitten.

358
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
And Rameses.

359
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,600
You crocodile!

360
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,500
Triples. You've lost.
I'll never let you win again.

361
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,300
Aha! You thought that by losing
to me you would win for Moses.

362
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,500
Well, crowns can be lost
by smiles and dimples.

363
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,400
- And so is patience.
- Yours.

364
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,500
Are my jubilee plans complete?

365
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,300
All but your proclamation for
the marriage of Rameses to Nefretiri.

366
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,800
No.

367
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,700
Are you sure it will be Rameses?

368
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Who else could succeed you?

369
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,100
Moses, of course.

370
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,200
Because of Moses there is no wheat
in the temple granaries.

371
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,300
You don't look any leaner.

372
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,200
- You're both generous with advice.
- Will you take mine?

373
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
I will choose my own successor.

374
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,100
Did you lose your head, my sweet?

375
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,600
You were to bring me the head of
the jackal who would free the slaves.

376
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,300
The slaves do not need a deliverer.
They have Moses.

377
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
Is that a riddle?

378
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,500
He gives them the priest's grain
and one day in seven to rest.

379
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,400
They call it the day of Moses.

380
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
- He makes himself a god.
- I prefer him as a man.

381
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,700
You would prefer him as Pharaoh.

382
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,400
- Are you afraid of Moses?
- Yes.

383
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,200
Ethiopia and Goshen are in his
hands and you are in between them.

384
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,700
He would not raise the slaves
against me. I've been his father.

385
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,500
Ambition knows no father.

386
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,800
Moses could no more betray you
than I could.

387
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
He can tell me that when he arrives.

388
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,200
- He will not be here, my father.
- What?

389
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,900
I sent for both of you.

390
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:22,000
His word is that he cannot attend
you, being pressed by other matters.

391
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,600
Did you hear that? Other matters?

392
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,700
My escort.

393
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,500
I will ride with you, my son,

394
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,000
to see what rears itself in Goshen,
a city or treason.

395
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,100
You lying adder! You'll destroy
yourself with your own venom

396
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,400
if you try to turn Sethi
against Moses.

397
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,900
You would turn Sethi against me.

398
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,300
Remember, my sweet, that you must
be wife to the next Pharaoh,

399
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,800
that you're going to be mine,
all mine, like my dog or my falcon.

400
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,700
Only I will love you
more and trust you less.

401
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,900
You will never do the things to me
you would have done to Moses.

402
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,900
I know you, my sweet.

403
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,800
You're a sharp-clawed,
treacherous little peacock.

404
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:53,300
But you're food for the gods
and I'm going to have all of you.

405
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:59,000
None of me. Did you think my kiss
was a promise of what you'll have?

406
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,100
No, my pompous one, it was to let
you know what you will NOT have.

407
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,500
I could NEVER love you.

408
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Does that matter?

409
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,300
You will be my wife.

410
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,800
You will come to me
whenever I call you.

411
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,600
And I will enjoy that very much.

412
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,300
Whether you enjoy it or not
is your own affair.

413
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,600
But I think you will.

414
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,300
That drop puts too much strain
on the stone. We need more sand.

415
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll risk it, Baka. There's little
time till the day of jubilee.

416
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,900
If the stone cracks,
you may crack with it.

417
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,300
Ready blue signal.

418
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,800
Blue pennant.

419
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,900
Blue pennant!

420
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,400
- The snubber is ready.
- Green pennant.

421
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,800
Mallet men, ready!

422
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,600
Mallet men, stand by!
Clear the main hawser!

423
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,300
Mallet men ready.

424
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,900
You are not pleased to see me here.

425
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,500
I am, Great Pharaoh, but now
I have important things to do.

426
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,200
Red pennant, stand by.

427
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,900
So Rameses tells me.

428
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,800
More important things
than obeying my orders.

429
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,800
You ordered me to finish this city.
That stone must be moved.

430
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,100
Red pennant.

431
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,900
Red pennant...strike!

432
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,900
- The stone will break.
- 2,000 slaves are on the ropes.

433
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,800
There is the obelisk of your jubilee.

434
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,000
Baka, put 1 ,000 slaves
to removing the sand

435
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,800
until the stone settles to its base.

436
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,500
Pharaoh is pleased?

437
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,900
With the obelisk, yes, but not with
certain accusations made against you.

438
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,600
By whom?

439
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,600
- You raided the temple granaries.
- Yes.

440
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,100
- You gave the grain to the slaves.
- Yes.

441
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,700
You gave them
one day in seven to rest.

442
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,300
Yes.

443
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,300
Did you do this to gain their favour?

444
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,700
A city is built of brick, Pharaoh.

445
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,800
The strong make many.
The starving make few.

446
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,700
The dead make none.

447
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,500
So much for accusations.

448
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Now judge the results.

449
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,600
The pylons commemorate your victory
at Kadish

450
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,700
where you broke the Amorites.

451
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,800
- Are there any higher in Egypt?
- There are none higher in the world.

452
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,200
With so many slaves,
you could build...an army.

453
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,500
But I HAVE built a city.

454
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,200
16 of these lions of Pharaoh
will guard its gates.

455
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,100
It shall be the city
of Sethi's glory.

456
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,200
Hmm.

457
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Are these slaves loyal
to Sethi's glory or to you, Moses?

458
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,000
The slaves worship their god...

459
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,900
and I serve only you.

460
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,200
Let your own image proclaim
my loyalty for a thousand years.

461
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,700
Superb!

462
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,700
And this you call treason?

463
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,000
Who would take a throne by force
that he has earned by deeds?

464
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,300
With this and Ethiopia,

465
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,300
your name shall be carved
beside mine on every pylon.

466
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,300
Yours, Rameses, will be nowhere.

467
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,000
In my judgement book, you have
accused your brother falsely.

468
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,200
Come.

469
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,700
Great Pharaoh,
he is the son of your body.

470
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
I need no help,
Moses, to hold what is mine.

471
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,800
I decide what is yours.

472
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,500
Come with me, Moses.

473
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,600
Will you lose the throne
because Moses builds a city?

474
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,600
The city that he builds
shall bear my name.

475
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,600
The woman that he loves
shall bear my child.

476
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,300
So it shall be written.
So it shall be done.

477
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,200
Yes. This is for the temple ceremony.

478
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,300
This...

479
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,700
Ah, this!

480
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,400
This for my wedding night.

481
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,000
You will never wear it.

482
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,500
Why not?

483
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,500
I have brought you a cloth
more revealing. Send them away.

484
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,800
Go, then, while I hear what this
puckered old persimmon has to say.

485
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,100
Well? What croakings
of doom have you today?

486
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,700
You prepare for a marriage
that will never be.

487
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,800
You've been drinking honey wine!

488
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,800
I shall not let the Pharaoh
and Rameses be betrayed.

489
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,600
Why should a slave care
which Pharaoh rules?

490
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,900
For 30 years, I have been silent.

491
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,500
Now all the kings of Egypt
cry out to me from their tombs,

492
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,900
"Let no Hebrew sit upon our throne."

493
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,100
What are you saying?

494
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,000
Rameses has the blood of many kings.

495
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,700
- And Moses.
- He is lower than the dust.

496
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,100
Not one drop of royal blood
flows through his veins.

497
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,100
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

498
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,700
I'll have you torn
into so many pieces,

499
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,600
even the vultures won't find them.

500
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,800
Who hatched this lie? Rameses?

501
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,700
Rameses does not know...yet.

502
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,700
You will repeat this to Bithiah!

503
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,200
Bithiah drew a slave child
from the Nile,

504
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,800
called him son and Prince of Egypt,

505
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,000
blinding herself to the truth
and the pain of an empty womb.

506
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,700
Were you two alone?

507
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,600
A little girl led me
to the Hebrew woman Yochabel

508
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,600
that the child might
be suckled by his true mother.

509
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,400
Take care, old frog.

510
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,600
You croak too much against Moses.

511
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,800
Would you mingle the blood
of slaves with your own?

512
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,000
He will be my husband.
I shall have no other.

513
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,700
Use this to wrap your first-born.

514
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,600
Torn from a Levite's robe.

515
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,900
It was Moses' swaddling cloth.

516
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,000
And your shroud!

517
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,200
You think I care whose son he is?

518
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,100
- Rameses does.
- You won't live to tell him.

519
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:49,000
Nefretiri! Have you closed your
doors to make a beggar of a prince?

520
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,900
I'm the beggar, Moses, begging you
to hold me in your arms. Kiss me.

521
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,400
You're no beggar, my love.

522
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,000
You're a conqueror
and I am your captive for life.

523
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,500
One lifetime will not be half enough.

524
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,400
You will be King of Egypt.

525
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,200
And I will be your footstool.

526
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,200
A man stupid enough
to use you for a footstool

527
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,500
would not be wise
enough to rule Egypt.

528
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,700
Princess! Ravens have dropped
a black feather at your door.

529
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,600
- Who can...?
- Leave the world outside.

530
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,100
Pardon, pardon, royal one.

531
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,400
- The old nurse, Memnet...
- I don't want to hear anything.

532
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,200
What about Memnet?

533
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,700
She's dead. She must
have fallen from the balcony.

534
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,400
I will not hear unhappy things
tonight. Go away!

535
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,100
Old Memnet must have walked
that balcony a thousand times.

536
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,900
What is the death
of one slave to us?

537
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
She was a faithful servant to you.

538
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,300
Can one so rich in love
be so poor in pity?

539
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,400
What kind of a woman
holds me captive?

540
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,600
One who loves you
and will not lose you.

541
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,600
One who will be your wife.
Nothing in the world can change that.

542
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,400
Neither Rameses' princely plots
nor Memnet's evil lies.

543
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,400
Memnet has always grumbled.
Why should it upset you now?

544
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Because she grumbled against you.

545
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,800
Oh, let her threats
be buried with her.

546
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,800
Look... The night's a crown of stars,

547
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,000
and the darkness a robe
of forgetfulness.

548
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,600
Let's share them.
We'll use the moon for a sceptre.

549
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,100
- A piece of Hebrew cloth!
- Memnet may have dropped it.

550
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,300
Memnet was not Hebrew.
Why would she have this?

551
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,500
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

552
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
Tell me.

553
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,400
She was taking it to Rameses...

554
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,200
- to destroy you.
- To de...?

555
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,300
How could Rameses destroy me
with a piece of cloth?

556
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,100
Moses, why do you question me?
Why do you care? Yes!

557
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,800
I killed her. What does it matter?
A hundred slaves die every day.

558
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,500
- It's forgotten.
- It is not.

559
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,300
- What is this to do with me?
- It makes no difference to us.

560
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,800
How could it make a difference?

561
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,600
A child was wrapped in it.

562
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,400
- What child?
- Bithiah took him from the river.

563
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,600
Memnet was with her.

564
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,700
Who was this child?

565
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Memnet is dead. No one need know
who you are. I love you.

566
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,200
I'll kill anyone
who comes between us.

567
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:05,200
Why did you kill for me? lf you love
me, do not lie. Who was the child?

568
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,900
Hold me in your arms.

569
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,700
Hold me...close.

570
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,600
You were not born
Prince of Egypt, Moses...

571
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,100
but the son of Hebrew slaves.

572
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,900
You believe that?

573
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,100
I'll believe anything
you want me to believe.

574
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,100
Say you are not,
I'll believe you are not.

575
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,900
Love cannot drown truth, Nefretiri.

576
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,800
You do believe it
or you would not have killed Memnet.

577
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,800
I love you.
That's the only truth I know.

578
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,400
Did this child of the Nile
have a mother?

579
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,400
Memnet called her Yochabel.

580
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,300
I will ask Bithiah.

581
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,700
How could you doubt me?

582
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,400
You did not doubt me when I held you
as you took your first step.

583
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,200
It's a wicked lie spun by Rameses.

584
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,300
Mother, did Rameses spin this?

585
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,500
The word of your mother
against a cloth found by Memnet?

586
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,300
How did you know it was Memnet?

587
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,500
Who else? Memnet nursed Rameses.

588
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,500
She shall pay for spreading his lies.

589
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,200
- She has paid.
- She's dead?

590
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,500
At the hand of Nefretiri.

591
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,700
Put away any fears or suspicions
that may remain with you, my son.

592
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:10,000
Why, your will will be law in Egypt
when you are crowned as her king.

593
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,800
Memnet spoke of a Hebrew woman
named Yochabel.

594
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,500
Did you ever know her?

595
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,800
No.

596
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,400
Yours was the face
I saw above my cradle,

597
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,000
the only mother I've ever known.

598
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:53,500
Wherever I am led
or whatever I must do,

599
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,000
I will always love you.

600
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,100
My chariot. I will drive to Goshen.

601
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,600
A chariot here in Goshen?

602
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:54,100
- You know who I am?
- It has been many years, great one.

603
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,400
Who are they?

604
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,000
All that remain of my children.

605
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,600
I will speak to you alone.

606
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,500
Why have you...?

607
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,300
- Why have you come here?
- Because Moses will come here.

608
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,500
My son?

609
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,700
No, MY son. And that's
all that he must know.

610
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,800
My lips might deny him, great one,
but my eyes never could.

611
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,800
You shall leave Goshen tonight.

612
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,100
We are Levites, shepherds of Israel.
We cannot leave our people.

613
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,000
Would you take from Moses
all that I have given him?

614
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Would you undo all that I have done?

615
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,200
I have put the throne of Egypt
within his reach.

616
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,200
- What can you give him?
- I gave him life.

617
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,700
I gave him love! Was it
your hand that dried his tears?

618
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,700
Was it your heart that ached for him?

619
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,000
Yes. My heart ached for him.

620
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,300
My arms ached to hold him,

621
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,200
but I dared not even touch
the hem of his garment.

622
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:21,100
His heritage from me could only have
been misery, poverty and the lash.

623
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:27,500
No, I will not take from him the
glory and riches you have given him.

624
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,500
For this you shall be well cared for.

625
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,100
You and your family shall be taken
from Goshen tonight.

626
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,300
No matter where you send me...

627
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,500
if the God of Abraham
has a purpose for my son,

628
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,000
he will come to know it
and fulfil it.

629
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,000
Come, gather your things.
I shall see you want for nothing.

630
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,300
You and your children
shall be given freedom.

631
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,600
Has my mother forgotten?
Only the Pharaoh can free a slave.

632
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,400
- Do not enter. There is sorrow here.
- Are you comforting it, my mother?

633
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,700
I followed you here to find
this woman, Yochabel...

634
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,900
You are the woman
who was caught between the stones.

635
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,000
- Until you came.
- My son, if you love me...

636
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:34,100
I love you, my mother,
but am I your son?

637
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,700
Or yours?

638
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,600
No, you are not my son.

639
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:49,100
If you believe that men and women are
cattle to be driven under the lash,

640
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:56,500
if you can bow before idols of stone
and golden images of beasts...

641
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,000
you are not my son.

642
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,000
My son would be a slave...

643
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:13,400
His hands would be gnarled
and broken from the brick pits,

644
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,800
his back scarred
from the taskmaster's whip,

645
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,800
but in his heart would burn
the spirit of the living God.

646
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,200
Are a scarred back and broken hands
the price of this god's favour?

647
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:31,700
This god is the hope of the hopeless.
YOUR place is in the palace halls.

648
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,100
You have mounted
to the sun on golden wings.

649
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,500
You belong to me,
to Nefretiri, to Sethi. We love you.

650
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,900
Do they love less who have no hope?

651
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:53,200
Will you swear in the name of this
god that you are not my mother?

652
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,200
We do not even know his name.

653
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Then look into my eyes
and tell me you are not my mother.

654
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,200
Oh, Moses, Moses, I cannot, I cannot.

655
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,900
I am your brother Aaron.

656
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,000
I am Miriam, your sister.

657
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,800
- I am your brother Moses.
- No! Get ready to leave. Hurry!

658
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,600
They're going.
The secret's going with them.

659
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,400
- No one need know the shame.
- Shame?

660
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,400
What change is there in me?

661
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,000
Egyptian or Hebrew, I am still Moses.

662
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,300
These are the same hands,
the same arms,

663
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,800
the same face
that were mine a moment ago.

664
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,300
A moment ago, you were her son,
the strength of Egypt.

665
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:24,300
Now you are mine, a slave of Egypt.
You find no shame in this?

666
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:30,800
There is no shame in me. How can I
feel shame for the woman who bore me?

667
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:35,200
- Or the race that bred me?
- God of my fathers.

668
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,100
Moses, what will you do?

669
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,000
This is the binding tie...

670
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,900
and here I will stay.

671
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,600
- Moses...
- To find the meaning of what I am.

672
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:06,100
Why a Hebrew...or any man,
must be a slave.

673
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,200
Put back your things.
You are not leaving.

674
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,300
Has she done more for you than l?

675
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:27,300
Will the life she gave you be more
useful in the black pits of slavery?

676
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,200
Cannot justice and truth
be served better upon a throne

677
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:41,600
where all men may benefit
from your goodness...and strength?

678
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,700
I do not know
what power shapes my way,

679
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,100
but my feet are set upon a road
that I must follow.

680
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,700
Forgive me, Bithiah.

681
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:11,200
God of our fathers, who has appointed
an end to the bondage of Israel,

682
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,400
blessed am I
among all mothers in the land...

683
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,400
for my eyes have beheld
thy deliverer.

684
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,600
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
that treadeth out the corn,

685
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,100
making straw
for the bricks of Egypt,

686
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,800
nor spare the arms that endlessly
winnow the grain in the wind

687
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,700
to separate the wheat from the chaff,

688
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,400
wheat borne stolidly
on the backs of countless slaves

689
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,400
from the heavy-laden Nile boats
to the teeming shore.

690
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,900
Endlessly they plod
beneath the sheaves of wheat

691
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,900
and endlessly return for more.

692
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,900
A golden harvest to the threshers,

693
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:09,900
a grain safe to feed the masters,
bitterness to feed the slaves,

694
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:16,300
and to feed the brick pits, straw,
carried on the bowed backs of women

695
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,500
down into the never-ending valley
of toil and agony,

696
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,700
stretching mile after mile.

697
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,400
An inferno of mud-soaked bodies,

698
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,300
where the treaders' feet
churn clay and straw

699
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,300
into the mixture
for the Pharaoh's bricks.

700
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,100
And everywhere the lash
of watchful taskmasters

701
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,100
ready to sting
the backs of the weary.

702
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,300
Blades chopping straw.

703
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,800
Mattocks chopping clay.

704
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,400
A ceaseless cycle
of unending drudgery.

705
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,100
From the mixing feet of treaders

706
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,900
to the pouring hands
of brick moulders

707
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,900
moves the constant stream of mud,
the lowly seed of tall cities,

708
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,100
day after day, year after year,
century after century.

709
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,800
Bondage without rest,
toil without reward.

710
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,700
These are the children of misery,

711
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,000
the afflicted,
the hopeless, the oppressed.

712
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,100
And he went out unto his brethren
and looked on their burdens.

713
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,900
Water...girl!

714
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,000
Dear, here's water.

715
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,500
That's a hard dance you do, old man.

716
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,800
We've been dancing it for 400 years.

717
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,600
It's a grim music.

718
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:01,700
And the only deliverer
that has come to us is death.

719
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,500
Back to work, you braying mules.

720
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,600
You're strange to the pits.

721
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,300
Your back is unscarred.

722
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,100
You bring a warm smile
with your cool water.

723
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,400
My smile is for a stonecutter.

724
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,400
- The water is for you.
- I thank you.

725
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,700
Your voice is not strange.

726
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,100
- You are...?
- One of many who thirst.

727
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,400
You there!

728
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,600
Come here.

729
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,400
That is Baka, the master builder.

730
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,800
- Does he call me or you?
- You! Water girl! I'm thirsty.

731
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,600
He does not thirst for water.

732
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,000
Beauty is but a curse to our women.

733
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:06,200
- Water, noble one.
- I'll have wine, the wine of beauty.

734
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,500
What beauty can my lord find
in these mud pits?

735
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,100
The lotus flower blooms
in the Nile's grey mud.

736
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:19,800
- She will do well as a house slave.
- Do not take me from my people!

737
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,500
There would be danger.

738
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,000
Danger from such lovely hands?

739
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,300
There are other hands,
strong enough to kill.

740
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,000
Our mud flower has a thorn.

741
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,800
Oh, please, Lord Baka, I beg you.

742
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,900
Tears...

743
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,600
When you have been bathed
in scented water,

744
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:46,100
when your limbs have
been caressed by sweet oils

745
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,700
and your hair combed with sandalwood,

746
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,400
there will be no time for tears.

747
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,000
She is not worthy of you.
Let my eyes...

748
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,500
Your eyes had best find the
deliverer, Dathan. Bring the girl.

749
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,100
May the hand of God strike him.

750
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,200
Dance, you mud turtles, dance!

751
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,500
You rot our bodies,
steal hope from our souls.

752
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,400
Must you also
shame and defile our women?

753
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,700
Dance you squealing goat!

754
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:36,100
We are not animals, we are men,
made in the image of God.

755
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,500
This will change your image.

756
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,900
Dance, you.

757
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,600
Get that straw cutter.

758
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,200
Leave him
or you'll be murdered with him.

759
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,400
I'll not leave a man
to die in the mud.

760
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,800
Thank you, my son.

761
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:18,200
But death is better than bondage,

762
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,300
for my days are ended
and my prayer unanswered.

763
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,000
What prayer, old man?

764
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,400
That before death closed my eyes
I might behold the deliverer

765
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:37,300
who will lead all men to freedom.

766
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,300
What deliverer could
break the power of Pharaoh?

767
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,100
You, mud-carriers,
throw this carrion to the vultures.

768
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,800
You, take his place.

769
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,300
And dance the straw
into the mud, you dogs.

770
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,500
Stand aside, you. Make way.

771
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,200
Clear a path.

772
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,600
Come on, get back. Out of the way!

773
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:43,400
I need another oarsman
for my barge, a strong slave.

774
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,200
- Your word is our will.
- The large one there.

775
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,300
You!

776
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,100
No, not that one.
The very dirty one there.

777
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,900
Yes, that one.
He may serve my purpose.

778
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,500
You!

779
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
YOU!

780
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,100
Out of the pit!

781
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,900
Out of the way! Back to work!

782
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,800
Clear a path!

783
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,100
Back to work!

784
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:29,500
First friend of the Pharaoh,
keeper of the royal seal,

785
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:35,200
Prince of Memphis,
Prince of Thebes,

786
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,200
beloved of the Nile god,
conqueror of Ethiopia,

787
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,100
general of generals,

788
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,000
commander of the Egyptian Host,

789
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,700
and man of mud!

790
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,500
Is that what you want? To be a slave?

791
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,500
Then why aren't you kneeling
at the feet of a princess?

792
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,500
I'm afraid the mud pits have
stiffened my knees, royal one.

793
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,300
Shall I call back the guards?

794
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:12,100
- Do you think they could bend them?
- Oh, Moses! Moses!

795
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,300
You stubborn, splendid,
adorable fool.

796
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,600
I'm not kneeling to a princess.

797
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,700
No. You are kneeling to a woman

798
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:32,400
who's been worried about you
day and night since you disappeared.

799
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,800
What is there in the mud pits
that could keep you from my arms?

800
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,700
My people.

801
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,900
Do you have to wallow
with your people? Smell like them?

802
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
If they are stained,
it's with the mud of slavery.

803
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,700
If they reek,
it's with the stench of injustice.

804
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:58,400
- Come back to the palace.
- And hide the truth from Sethi?

805
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,400
That I am Hebrew and a slave.

806
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,400
The truth would break
his dear old heart

807
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,500
and send Bithiah
into exile or death.

808
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,100
Stop hearing the cries
of your people.

809
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,800
Their god does not hear their cry.

810
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,000
Will Rameses hear it
if he is Pharaoh?

811
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,400
No. He would grind them
into the clay they mould,

812
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,300
double their labours.

813
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,500
What about me?
Think of me as his wife.

814
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,400
Do you want to see me
in Rameses' arms?

815
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,100
No.

816
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,900
Then come back with me.

817
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:44,600
Oh, Moses! The gods have
fashioned you for greatness.

818
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:49,400
The splendour of your name
will last beyond the pyramids.

819
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:55,000
As Pharaoh, you can free your people,
worship whatever gods you please,

820
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,600
so long as I can worship you.

821
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:15,600
I will come to you at the palace
on the day of Sethi's jubilee.

822
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,700
Come with me now.

823
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,000
No, my love.

824
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
First I have a call to make
on the master builder.

825
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,600
No, no, no, no, no.

826
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,300
Not red with the samil gown.

827
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:01,000
My eyes can best be used
elsewhere, Lord Baka.

828
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,200
Before you go, let them look
upon what you thought unworthy.

829
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,500
Who would let beauty
such as this go unseen?

830
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,700
Who would let such a flower
go ungathered?

831
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:21,400
Dathan, you can see only mud,
so pick up her muddy clothes and go.

832
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
Go, all of you.

833
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,700
Did you know that this golden web was
spun from the beards of shellfish?

834
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,800
- Please let me go to my home.
- You ARE at home.

835
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,900
Here, taste this.

836
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,500
The blood of Thracian grapes,
the wine of love.

837
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,000
No wine can change my love.

838
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,600
Then your love shall be my wine.

839
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,900
There's fire in the chariot house!

840
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,400
The chariot house.

841
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Guards! Guards!
Take water to the roof.

842
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,900
Dathan, take charge.
Guards, after him.

843
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,200
Pull it out of the shed.

844
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,900
Take it clear of the house.

845
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:21,100
No, your wings must not be singed,
at least not by that fire.

846
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,900
- Joshua!
- Run! The way is clear.

847
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,200
The master builder will not follow.

848
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,000
Neither will you, stonecutter.

849
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,600
Bind him between the columns.

850
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,700
See that his arms
are tightly stretched.

851
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,300
You will die on your feet,
stonecutter.

852
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,200
Now go after the girl.

853
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:13,700
And don't come back without her.

854
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,700
You foolish, stupid man!

855
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,100
I would have kept her
only a short while.

856
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,200
She would have returned to you -
shall we say - more worthy.

857
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,000
Now to whom shall I return Lilia?

858
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,800
You will not be there, Joshua.

859
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,200
You've seen me drive my chariot.

860
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:46,500
I can flick a fly from my horse's ear
without breaking his stride.

861
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,200
You've seen me use my whip.

862
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,000
You make no outcry, Joshua.

863
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,600
But you will.

864
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,600
You will cry for the mercy of death.

865
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,700
One day you will listen
to the cry of slaves.

866
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,400
This is not that day, Joshua.

867
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:21,400
You hold your tongue almost
as well as I hold my temper.

868
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,200
It's a pity to kill
so strong a stonecutter.

869
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,400
- Death will bring death, Baka.
- Who are you?

870
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,600
One who asks
what right you have to kill.

871
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,900
The right of a master
to kill any slave.

872
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,500
- Kill ME, master butcher!
- Moses!

873
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,900
Why have you done this?

874
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,400
- Where is Lilia?
- Gone.

875
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,600
Why are you dressed as a slave?

876
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:12,100
Why does a prince of Egypt kill
the master builder to save a Hebrew?

877
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,400
I am Hebrew.

878
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,100
God of Abraham.
Four hundred years we've waited.

879
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,900
The Pharaoh's soldiers
won't wait so long.

880
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:32,600
The Almighty has heard our cries.

881
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,600
You are the chosen one.

882
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,800
- I know nothing of your god.
- He knows YOU.

883
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,900
He has brought you to us.
You cannot turn your back upon us.

884
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,200
You will deliver us. The finger
of God points the way to YOU.

885
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:58,800
- Where was his body found?
- Buried in the sand, royal one.

886
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,000
This is Baka's knife.

887
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,800
There was no wound on the body.

888
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:11,100
Baka was a powerful man. It would
take strong hands to break him.

889
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,000
The slave, Joshua, is a stonecutter.

890
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,700
Go find me this Joshua.

891
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,400
Joshua's strength didn't kill
the master builder.

892
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,200
Now speaks the rat
that would be my ears.

893
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,300
Too many ears tie a rat's tongue.

894
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,500
Go. All of you.

895
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,500
Well? Who killed him?

896
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,700
I am a poor man, generous one.
What I bring is worth much.

897
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,400
I have paid you much
and you have brought nothing.

898
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,600
Now I bring the world...
true son of Pharaoh.

899
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:04,100
You offer me the world when you
cannot even bring me the deliverer.

900
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,300
Who killed Baka?

901
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,700
- The deliverer.
- Would you play at words with me?

902
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,300
No, lord prince.

903
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,400
This murderer has now fled
to some distant land?

904
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,300
No, lord prince.

905
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,200
Name him!

906
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,900
One who made himself
a prince and judge over us.

907
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,600
If he knew I were here,
he would kill me.

908
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:34,000
I will hang you myself
if you tire me further.

909
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:41,700
There are those who would pay much
for what my eyes have seen.

910
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:45,600
You haggle with me
like in a marketplace?

911
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,700
No, I will not haggle.
Here's your money.

912
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:59,100
But for ten talents of fine gold,
I'll give you the wealth of Egypt.

913
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,000
Give me my freedom
and I'll give you the sceptre.

914
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,500
Give me Lilia and I'll give you
the princess of your heart's desire.

915
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,700
Give me this house
and I'll give you the throne.

916
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,600
Give me all that I ask...

917
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:18,400
or give me leave to go.

918
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,000
I will give you more
than leave to go.

919
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,800
I will send you where you belong.

920
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,000
I belong in your service,
glorious one.

921
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,400
Very well.

922
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,200
I WILL bargain with you.

923
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:41,500
If what you say pleases me,
I will give you your price.

924
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,800
If not, I will give you
the point of this blade! Agreed?

925
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,800
Agreed.

926
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,800
The deliverer...

927
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,800
is Moses.

928
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,700
Draw one more breath to tell me why
Moses or any other Egyptian

929
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,200
would deliver the Hebrews?

930
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,300
Moses is not Egyptian.

931
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,300
He's Hebrew.

932
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,100
The son of slaves.

933
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
I will pay your price.

934
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,900
I am told, my tiger lily,
they're wagering against me.

935
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:05,700
- Two golden deber against one.
- Yes. I wagered five myself!

936
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:09,300
You'll lose if Moses
keeps me waiting any longer.

937
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,800
I double the wager. I'll watch
for Moses, you watch the dance!

938
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:44,700
While you wait to honour Moses,
I will honour Sethi's jubilee...

939
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,400
with a gift.

940
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,500
Strange gift.

941
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:57,200
You said if the deliverer
were a myth,

942
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:01,500
- to bring him in a bottle.
- It is empty.

943
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,400
Yes. Because he is not a myth.

944
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:09,200
- You have found such a man?
- Yes, Father.

945
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,000
In the midst of treachery
and treason,

946
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,000
with the blood of your
master builder on his hands.

947
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,200
Shall I summon him
to Pharaoh's justice?

948
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,800
Summon him!

949
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:31,700
- Bring the Hebrew in.
- Bring the Hebrew in.

950
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,900
Great Pharaoh,

951
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,200
I stand in the shadow
of your justice.

952
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,700
Whose work is THIS?

953
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,500
I warned you of his treason.

954
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,300
- Treason?
- Judge now if I spoke truly.

955
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,500
The evil star foretold him

956
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:35,000
as the destroyer of Egypt
and deliverer of slaves.

957
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,800
It is not possible.
A prince of Egypt!

958
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:45,100
He is not a prince of Egypt.
He is not the son of your sister.

959
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,100
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

960
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,900
Speak...

961
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,300
my son.

962
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:07,600
I am the son of Amram and Yochabel.
Hebrew slaves.

963
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,900
My brother, it was I
who deceived you, not Moses.

964
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,300
- He was only a child.
- Leave me.

965
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,700
I shall not see your face again.

966
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,600
Come to me.

967
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,200
I do not care who you are
or what you are,

968
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,400
but...

969
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,900
I want to hear from your own lips
that you are not a traitor,

970
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,200
that you would not lead these people
in revolt against me.

971
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,100
Tell me, Moses. I will believe you.

972
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,200
I am not this deliverer you fear.

973
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,800
It would take more than a man
to lead the slaves from bondage.

974
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,500
It would take a god.

975
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,400
But if I COULD free them,

976
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,200
I would.

977
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,100
What has turned you against me?

978
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,600
From the time my sister brought you
to the court, I loved you,

979
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:47,300
reared you,
set you before my own son,

980
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,100
because I saw in you...

981
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,800
a worth and a greatness
above other men.

982
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,100
No son could have
more love for you than I.

983
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,900
Then why are you forcing me
to destroy you?

984
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,900
What evil has done THIS to you?

985
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:12,700
The evil that men should turn their
brothers into beasts of burden,

986
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,000
to slave and suffer in dumb anguish,

987
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,200
to be stripped of spirit
and hope and faith,

988
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:27,500
only because they're
of another race, another creed.

989
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,800
If there IS a God,
he did not mean this to be so.

990
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,800
What I have done,
I was compelled to do.

991
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,500
So be it.

992
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,600
What I do now...

993
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,800
I am compelled to do.

994
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:00,300
No! No!

995
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
Rameses...

996
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,800
Egypt shall be yours.

997
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:19,100
Hear what I say, Rameses.

998
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:25,700
When I cross the river of death,
you will be Pharaoh in Egypt.

999
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,600
Harden yourself against subordinates.

1000
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,800
Put no faith in a brother.

1001
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,600
Have no friend.

1002
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,500
Trust no woman.

1003
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,300
I protected the helpless,

1004
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,200
I nourished the orphan.

1005
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,700
Great one!

1006
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:02,300
He who ate my bread
and called me Father...

1007
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,400
would make rebellion against me.

1008
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,300
What manner of death
do you decree for him?

1009
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:17,500
I cannot speak it.

1010
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,200
Let it be as you will.

1011
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,400
I will not live if you must die!

1012
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,300
The feet of a Hebrew slave
is not the right place

1013
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,600
for the next queen of Egypt.

1014
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,600
Take him away.

1015
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,900
Do not look upon the traitor.

1016
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,200
Let the name of Moses be stricken
from every book and tablet.

1017
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:15,200
Stricken from all pylons
and obelisks.

1018
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:19,600
Stricken from
every monument of Egypt.

1019
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:28,200
Let the name of...Moses...

1020
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,200
be unheard and unspoken...

1021
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,600
erased from the memory of men...

1022
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,600
for all time.

1023
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,400
No, Moses.

1024
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:02,300
It is I who will possess all of her.

1025
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:08,300
You think when you are in my arms
it will be HIS face you will see?

1026
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,100
Yes. Only his face.

1027
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,200
I defeated you in life. You shall
not defeat me by your death.

1028
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:21,000
The dead are not scorched
in the desert of desire.

1029
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,800
They do not suffer
from the thirst of passion

1030
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:30,300
or stagger towards
some mirage of lost love.

1031
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:33,900
But you, Hebrew,
will suffer all these things...

1032
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,900
- by living.
- You will let him live!

1033
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:40,700
I will not make him a martyr.

1034
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,800
No phantom will come between us
in the night.

1035
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,400
Yes, my sweet. I will let him live.

1036
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,200
Dead...

1037
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,900
you alone would possess him.

1038
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,400
From where I send him
there is no returning.

1039
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,300
And you will never know

1040
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:08,500
if he has found forgetfulness
within another woman's arms.

1041
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,200
Now, look upon each other
for the last time.

1042
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:58,500
Now look for the first time,
Abiram, upon the governor of Goshen.

1043
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,600
Dathan, my brother,
you have the favour of the Lord.

1044
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,600
I prefer the gratitude
of the prince.

1045
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,500
Nearer.

1046
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,900
Yes. Very lovely.

1047
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Not that purplish flower.

1048
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,300
The purity of white...

1049
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,000
will cool the blush of your cheek.

1050
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:51,100
Leave us. All of you.
You, too, my brother.

1051
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:55,600
Continue your playing...
but in the house.

1052
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,300
Yes. That's better.

1053
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,700
A flower behind a flower.

1054
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,400
Dathan, if you fear God, let me go.

1055
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,500
I'm here, girl,
because I put no trust

1056
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,100
in a desert god
and his mud-pit prophet.

1057
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,600
I prospered because I bowed low
before the Egyptians.

1058
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:26,300
Now the Egyptians bow low before me.

1059
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,400
Joshua wanted you.

1060
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,500
Baka wanted you.

1061
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,300
But you belong to ME.

1062
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:41,100
A gift from Rameses
to His Excellency.

1063
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:49,200
I will bow before you, Dathan.

1064
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,100
I will work my hands raw for you.

1065
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,700
But please...

1066
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,000
please do not shame me
before my Lord.

1067
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,800
Your Lord is the governor of Goshen.

1068
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,600
What difference to my shame?

1069
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,600
No difference to you.

1070
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,600
But to a condemned slave
like Joshua...

1071
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:19,500
it could make the difference
between death on the spikes

1072
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,900
and life in
the copper mines of Sinai.

1073
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:29,400
What would you do to influence
His Excellency's clemency?

1074
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,800
Anything, Dathan.

1075
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,500
Anything.

1076
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,500
Joshua will always
be grateful to you...

1077
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,400
my little mud flower.

1078
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:54,300
His fate is better
than the one that waits for Moses.

1079
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,400
The slave who would be king.

1080
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,400
Captain. Robe of state.

1081
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,700
His Hebrew mother brought it
to the prison before she died.

1082
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I'd rather this for your armour.

1083
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,800
You will have need of a sceptre.

1084
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,700
Give me this binding pole.

1085
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,600
Here is your king's sceptre

1086
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:43,400
and here is your kingdom...

1087
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:49,800
with the scorpion, the cobra
and the lizard for subjects.

1088
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,100
Free THEM, if you will.
Leave the Hebrews to me.

1089
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:00,100
Give this prince of Israel
one day's ration of bread and water.

1090
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:05,600
It will take many days to cross this
wilderness, if he can cross at all.

1091
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:16,900
I commend you to your Hebrew god
who has no name.

1092
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,800
If you die, it will be
by his hand, not by mine.

1093
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,900
Farewell, my one-time brother.

1094
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,200
Into the blistering wilderness,

1095
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,400
the man who walked
with kings now walks alone.

1096
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,800
Torn from the pinnacle
of royal power,

1097
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:25,200
stripped of all rank
and earthly wealth,

1098
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:30,600
a forsaken man
without a country, without a hope.

1099
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:36,400
His soul in turmoil,
like the hot winds and raging sands

1100
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:41,800
that lash him with the fury
of a taskmaster's whip.

1101
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:46,000
He is driven forward, always forward

1102
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,500
by a god unknown

1103
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,400
toward a land unseen.

1104
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,800
Into the molten wilderness of sin,

1105
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:01,100
where granite sentinels
stand as towers of living death

1106
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,300
to bar his way.

1107
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:08,700
Each night brings the black
embrace of loneliness.

1108
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,600
In the mocking whisper of the wind

1109
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,000
he hears the echoing voices
of the dark.

1110
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:36,600
His tortured mind wondering if they
call the memory of past triumphs

1111
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:41,400
or wail foreboding
of disasters yet to come...

1112
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:47,700
or whether the desert's hot breath
has melted his reason into madness.

1113
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:55,000
He cannot cool the burning kiss
of thirst upon his lips,

1114
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,100
nor shade the scorching fury
of the sun.

1115
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,000
All about is desolation.

1116
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:09,900
He can neither bless nor curse
the power that moves him,

1117
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,100
for he does not know
from where it comes.

1118
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,000
Learning that it can be more
terrible to live than to die,

1119
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:26,300
he is driven onward through
the burning crucible of desert,

1120
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,300
where holy men and prophets
are cleansed and purged

1121
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:35,400
for God's great purpose.

1122
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:40,500
Until, at last,
at the end of human strength,

1123
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:44,400
beaten into the dust
from which he came,

1124
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:47,900
the metal is ready
for the Maker's hand.

1125
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:13,600
And he found strength
from a fruit-laden palm tree

1126
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:18,700
and life-giving water,
flowing from the well of Midian.

1127
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,800
- If only sheep were men!
- Unmarried men!

1128
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:39,900
- Can you think of nothing else?
- I don't know. I've never tried!

1129
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:44,000
You needn't have painted your nails.
There isn't a man from here to Horeb.

1130
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:00,300
- What do you see, Sephora?
- What are you looking at?

1131
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,900
- A man.
- What?

1132
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,900
- Only one?
- Is he handsome?

1133
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,900
- Look at his sandals!
- Egyptian!

1134
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,200
- His robe is not Egyptian.
- Who cares?

1135
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,500
- He's eaten a whole bunch of dates!
- Could it be dangerous?

1136
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,500
- Are you sure he's alive?
- I hope so!

1137
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,700
Look. There's REAL trouble.

1138
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,400
Amalekites.

1139
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:43,300
- I'll talk to them.
- Talk? Get stones!

1140
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:52,200
- We drew this water!
- Out of the way, girl!

1141
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:56,200
This is the well of Jethro,
our father. You have no right here!

1142
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,600
Our goats don't know your father!

1143
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,900
- Jethro's mark is on the well.
- They can't read!

1144
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Nor can we!

1145
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:08,600
- He's the Sheik of Midian!
- Then let him breed sons!

1146
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,500
Let them be first
whose hands have drawn the water.

1147
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,800
The stranger is wise...and strong.

1148
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:35,700
Drive back your goats
until the sheep are watered.

1149
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:57,400
We should draw water for YOU
and wash the dust from your feet.

1150
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,800
Let me first remove his sandals!

1151
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,400
Never did a lost sheep
have so many shepherds.

1152
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:11,500
- We have no towel.
- My veil will serve.

1153
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:14,800
Let me pour the water!

1154
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:18,700
- Am I to be bathed or drowned?
- I'll hold it!

1155
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,400
Is it true that Egyptian girls
paint their eyes?

1156
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,600
Yes. But very few have eyes
as beautiful as yours.

1157
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:34,400
And who...? Who is the brave one
who stood against the Amalekites?

1158
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,800
That's Sephora. She's the oldest.

1159
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:42,600
Since you have already
divided the stranger among you,

1160
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,300
I will ask a welcome for him.

1161
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:48,900
- Our father is Jethro.
- He's Sheik of Midian.

1162
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:16,000
Strength to you, stranger.

1163
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:20,300
I am Moses.
Son of Amram and Yochabel.

1164
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:24,800
Health, prosperity, life to you,
Jethro of Midian.

1165
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,900
Sephora has told me
of your kindness.

1166
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,800
Let us break bread
while she brings meat.

1167
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,500
You have come far.

1168
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,000
- From Egypt.
- Across the desert? On foot?

1169
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,900
He who has no name
surely guided your steps.

1170
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:57,500
No name? You Bedouins
know the god of Abraham?

1171
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,600
Abraham is the father
of many nations.

1172
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,000
We are the children of lshmael,
his first-born.

1173
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:07,700
We are the obedient of God.

1174
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,600
My people look to him
for deliverance.

1175
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,500
But they are still in bondage.

1176
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:22,300
Tomorrow we go to the high pastures
beneath God's holy mountain.

1177
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:25,300
My tent would be favoured
if you joined us.

1178
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,800
I am a stranger in a strange land.

1179
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:34,400
I have no wealth,
no skill as a shepherd.

1180
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:40,600
And it is...death to give
sanctuary to a runaway slave.

1181
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,700
Slave?

1182
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,900
Not among our people. You have
wisdom. You need nothing more.

1183
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,900
And there are seven to teach you
the tasks of a shepherd.

1184
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:58,200
- Sephora is the eldest.
- You can learn best from her.

1185
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,400
I will dwell in this land.

1186
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:29,800
- Today he sleeps.
- Who sleeps?

1187
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,400
He who has no name.

1188
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,000
Did God live on this mountain?

1189
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:41,200
Sinai is his high place. His temple.

1190
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,500
If this god IS God,

1191
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:49,500
he would live on every mountain,
in every valley.

1192
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:55,600
He would not be only the god
of Israel or of lshmael alone,

1193
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:58,400
but of ALL men.

1194
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,200
It is said he created all men
in his image.

1195
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:07,500
And he would dwell in every heart,
in every mind...

1196
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,700
in every soul.

1197
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I do not know about such things.

1198
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,700
But I DO know that the mountain
rumbles when God is there.

1199
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:28,600
And the earth trembles
and the cloud is red with fire.

1200
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:33,900
At such a time, has any man ever
gone to see him face to face?

1201
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:38,900
No man has ever set foot
on the forbidden slopes of Sinai.

1202
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:42,700
Why do you want to see him, Moses?

1203
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,000
To know that he is.

1204
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:51,100
And if he is, to know why
he has not heard the cries of slaves.

1205
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:55,500
Moses, it would be death
to look upon his face.

1206
01:54:56,700 --> 01:55:01,400
How many of my people have died
because he turned away his face?

1207
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:05,500
Can a man judge God?

1208
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:11,500
No, Moses.
We cannot see his whole purpose.

1209
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:16,000
Even lshmael did not know that God
drove him into the desert

1210
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:19,200
to be the father of a nation.

1211
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:24,300
Is it not enough to know that he has
saved you from the Pharaoh's anger?

1212
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,700
How do you know that?

1213
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:34,600
You walk like a prince.
And you fight like a warrior.

1214
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,700
There is word in the caravans
of a great one

1215
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,500
who was driven out of Egypt.

1216
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:45,800
This is not the sceptre
of a prince...

1217
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:48,300
but the staff of a wanderer.

1218
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:53,200
Then rest from wandering.

1219
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,600
My father has many flocks

1220
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:58,600
and no son to tend them.

1221
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:02,500
There would be peace of spirit
for you, Moses,

1222
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:07,800
in our tents
beneath the holy mountain.

1223
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:11,000
You have strong faith in this God.

1224
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,100
But, for me,
there is no peace of spirit

1225
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,800
until I hear the word of God...

1226
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:22,200
from God himself.

1227
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,200
I wish every day
was a shearing festival!

1228
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:41,600
And all the men following you
like sheep to be sheared!

1229
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:45,400
- One would be enough!
- If he were Moses!

1230
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:51,200
Never before has our wool
brought so rich a payment.

1231
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:56,200
Moses has sold the whole shearing
of all the tribes in one piece.

1232
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:00,000
His words are truth.
His trading is just.

1233
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,300
Peace be with you, sheiks of Sinai.

1234
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,700
Why are you dressed like that?

1235
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,900
Aren't you dancing with us
before the sheiks?

1236
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,700
No, I am not going to dance
before the sheiks. Here.

1237
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:18,700
And I am not going to be displayed
like a caravan's wares

1238
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:21,600
before Moses or any other man.

1239
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,800
Tonight I tend the sheep.

1240
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:30,100
You needn't laugh.
Moses may not choose YOU either!

1241
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,900
Moses shall no longer
be a stranger among us.

1242
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,500
- Give him of our flocks.
- And let him choose.

1243
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:44,500
I shall give him choice
of my seven daughters for wife.

1244
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:49,100
The shadow of my wisdom has fled.

1245
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:52,500
Can a man choose
from among the stars of the sky?

1246
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:57,300
Consider them as they dance.
Cohab, strike a bow.

1247
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:22,100
- A pleasant task.
- Indeed!

1248
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:29,200
A bride, a shawl.
Choose one, not all.

1249
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:33,500
One shawl, one wife.
Your choice for life.

1250
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,400
One is a great price.

1251
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,900
- Which, Moses?
- Which will it be?

1252
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,900
Make your choice, Moses.

1253
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,800
It is a garden of many flowers.

1254
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:19,100
I wish you had my years
and I had your choice.

1255
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:25,900
In the tent of Jethro
there is dignity, honour, freedom...

1256
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,900
and beauty.

1257
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,800
All that a man could ask of life.

1258
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:34,300
But my heart is still
a prisoner of the past.

1259
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,400
I...I cannot choose now.

1260
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:43,200
- Strength to you, sheiks of Sinai.
- May God guide your heart.

1261
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:46,800
Moses...!

1262
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,900
Tonight he is awake.

1263
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,600
Which of my sisters did you choose?

1264
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:10,600
I made no choice, Sephora.

1265
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,400
She was very beautiful, wasn't she?

1266
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:24,300
This woman of Egypt
who left her scar upon your heart.

1267
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,100
Whose skin was white as curd.

1268
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:37,100
Her eyes,
green as the cedars of Lebanon.

1269
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:40,600
Her lips, tamarisk honey.

1270
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:44,400
Like the breast of a dove,
her arms were soft.

1271
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:49,900
And the wine of desire
was in her veins.

1272
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:54,100
Yes. She was beautiful...

1273
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:58,100
as a jewel.

1274
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:03,500
A jewel has brilliant fire...
but gives no warmth.

1275
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:12,300
Our hands are not so soft
but they can serve.

1276
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:17,400
Our bodies not so white,
but they are strong.

1277
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:20,800
Our lips are not perfumed...

1278
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:24,500
but they speak the truth.

1279
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Love is not an art to us.

1280
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,700
It's life to us.

1281
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:37,600
We are not dressed
in gold and fine linen.

1282
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:41,900
Strength and honour are our clothing.

1283
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:47,900
Our tents are not
the columned halls of Egypt...

1284
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:51,600
but our children
play happily before them.

1285
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:56,800
We can offer you little...

1286
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:02,000
but we offer all we have.

1287
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:06,700
I have not little, Sephora.
I have nothing.

1288
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:11,900
Nothing from some
is more than gold from others.

1289
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:17,800
You would fill
the emptiness of my heart.

1290
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:25,300
I could never fill all of it, Moses.

1291
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,700
But I shall not
be jealous of a memory.

1292
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,000
May the gods bless you

1293
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,600
as you go to join them
in the land of the dead.

1294
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:25,900
The old windbag.

1295
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,300
What an infernal fuss.

1296
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,200
After all,
dying is only a part of living.

1297
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:38,200
You won't die, old crocodile.

1298
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:43,100
You'll cheat death the way
you cheat me at hounds and jackals.

1299
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:47,400
I'm afraid he won't let me cheat
the way you do.

1300
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,400
You'll be Pharaoh by sunset, Rameses.

1301
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:00,800
I hope you're content...at last.

1302
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:05,800
I am content to be your son.

1303
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:09,400
You have restored Egypt
to her greatness.

1304
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:13,600
I shall make her greatness
feared among nations.

1305
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:17,700
No doubt, no doubt.
You can overcome anything...

1306
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:20,900
but your own arrogance.

1307
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,200
Don't exhaust yourself, great one.

1308
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,800
Dear great one.

1309
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:29,400
Why not, kitten?

1310
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:34,000
You are the only thing
I regret leaving.

1311
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,900
You have been my joy.

1312
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,200
And you, my only love.

1313
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,000
Uh-huh.

1314
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:46,300
Now YOU'RE cheating.

1315
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,300
- There was another.
- Yes.

1316
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:54,800
I know.

1317
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,200
I loved him, too.

1318
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:04,100
With my last breath,
I'll break my own law

1319
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,800
and speak the name of...

1320
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:11,300
Moses.

1321
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:30,700
The royal falcon
has flown into the sun.

1322
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:58,000
Did the little boy die in the desert,
my father?

1323
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:02,700
No. God brought lshmael and
his mother, Hagar, to a good land.

1324
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,800
The same God who lives
on the mountain?

1325
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:08,500
It may be, my son.

1326
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:14,300
Your mother is calling.

1327
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,500
Here!

1328
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:24,400
Moses!
There is a man among the sheep!

1329
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:26,200
You stay...

1330
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:32,600
Keep sounding the alarm.
Stay here till your mother comes.

1331
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,200
In the cleft, behind the rock.

1332
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,400
Your eyes are sharp
as well as beautiful.

1333
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,500
Tokar!

1334
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:04,400
Setaft! Back!

1335
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,900
Setaft, back!

1336
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,100
Come down!

1337
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:19,800
Down, Tokar!

1338
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,100
Praise God I have found you!

1339
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,300
Joshua?

1340
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,300
We thought you dead.

1341
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:35,600
In the copper mines,
the living ARE dead.

1342
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:38,800
Sephora! Bring water.

1343
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:46,300
How did you find me?

1344
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,900
A merchant buying copper
saw you in the tent of Jethro.

1345
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:56,900
Here, you too will find peace.

1346
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:00,200
Peace?

1347
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:03,400
How can you find peace or want it,

1348
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:07,700
when Rameses builds cities mortared
with the blood of our people?

1349
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:10,500
You must lead them out of Egypt!

1350
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:15,200
God made a covenant with Abraham
that HE would deliver the people.

1351
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,200
Am I the hand of God?

1352
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:22,400
- Sephora, give him water.
- Water! Bless you!

1353
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:25,900
The desert sun
has set fire to his mind.

1354
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,500
His name is Joshua.

1355
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:32,700
I once killed that he might live.

1356
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:37,000
They said you were condemned
but I knew you were chosen

1357
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
to take the sword of God
into your hand!

1358
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,400
I am not the man.

1359
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,500
I am a shepherd with flocks...

1360
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,900
That light on the mountainside...

1361
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:55,600
Do you see that strange fire?

1362
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:58,600
- A bush that burns?
- No.

1363
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:01,100
It is on fire
but the bush does not burn.

1364
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:06,200
Sephora, take him.
Serve him food in our tent.

1365
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:09,700
I will turn aside
and see this great sight.

1366
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,400
I am here.

1367
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:52,500
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.

1368
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:58,300
For the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground.

1369
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:07,100
I am the God of thy father.

1370
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,700
The God of Abraham,

1371
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:15,900
the God of lsaac
and the God of Jacob.

1372
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:20,600
Lord...

1373
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:25,000
Lord, why do you not hear the cries

1374
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,400
of their children
in the bondage of Egypt?

1375
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:33,700
I have surely seen the affliction
of my people which are in Egypt.

1376
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:41,700
And I have heard their cry
by reason of their taskmasters.

1377
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:44,300
For I know their sorrows.

1378
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:51,400
Therefore, I will send thee,
Moses, unto Pharaoh,

1379
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:56,200
that thou mayest bring my people
out of Egypt.

1380
02:11:56,200 --> 02:12:00,900
Who am l, Lord,
that you should send me?

1381
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,700
How can I lead this people
out of bondage?

1382
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:11,900
What words can I speak
that they will heed?

1383
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,400
I will teach thee what thou wilt say.

1384
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:20,500
When thou hast brought forth
the people,

1385
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:25,600
they shall serve me
upon this mountain.

1386
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:29,500
I will put my laws into their hearts.

1387
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:34,600
And in their minds will I write them.

1388
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:38,300
Now, therefore, go.

1389
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,900
And I will be with thee.

1390
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,800
But if I say to your children

1391
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:47,400
that the God of their fathers
has sent me,

1392
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:50,500
they will ask, "What is his name?"

1393
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,300
And how shall I answer them?

1394
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:58,000
I am that I am.

1395
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:05,500
Thou shalt say,
"I AM hath sent me on to you.

1396
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:21,400
Is the holy mountain
forbidden to men?

1397
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:24,900
Yes. And I am afraid for him.

1398
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,700
Then he is more than man, for look...

1399
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,400
Look at his face.

1400
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:49,300
He has seen God.

1401
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:12,800
Moses...your hair...your sandals.

1402
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:17,200
I stood upon holy ground.

1403
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:20,000
Can you tell us, Moses?

1404
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,500
My eyes could not look upon him.

1405
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:25,300
Did he speak?

1406
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:28,300
He revealed his word to my mind.

1407
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:32,500
And the word was God.

1408
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,600
Did he speak as a man?

1409
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:38,600
He is not flesh but spirit.

1410
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:42,100
The light of eternal mind.

1411
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:45,500
And I know that his light
is in every man.

1412
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:48,500
Did he ask something of you?

1413
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:53,900
That I go to Egypt.

1414
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,500
You ARE God's messenger!
He has set the day of deliverance.

1415
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:01,800
I will get water and bread
that we may leave at once.

1416
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:04,800
But Egypt holds death for you.

1417
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:08,000
If it be his will.

1418
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,900
Where he sends you, I shall go.

1419
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,500
Your God is my God.

1420
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:18,000
I will lead men against the armoury
and get swords!

1421
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:22,400
It is not by the sword
that he will deliver his people,

1422
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:25,100
but by the staff of a shepherd.
