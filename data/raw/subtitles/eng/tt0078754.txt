OK, one more time. From the top.
Six beats, all right?

00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:17,646
One, two, three, four. One, two...

<i>To be on the wire is life.</i>
<i>The rest... is waiting.</i>

<i>- Well, is all right.</i>

7
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,686
ls showtime, folks!

8
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:08,446
<i>They say the neon lights</i>
<i>are bright on Broadway</i>

9
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,124
<i>They say there's always magic in the air</i>

10
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,407
<i>But when you're walkin' down that street</i>

11
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:26,202
<i>And you ain't had enough to eat</i>

12
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:33,085
<i>The glitter rubs right off</i>
<i>and you're nowhere</i>

13

<i>They say the women</i>
<i>treat you fine on Broadway</i>

14
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:56,411
<i>But lookin'at them just gives me the blues</i>

<i>Cos how you gonna make some time</i>

16
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:05,201
<i>When all you got is one thin dime?</i>

17
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:11,562
<i>And one thin dime</i>
<i>won't even shine your shoes</i>

18
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:34,570
<i>They say that l won't</i>
<i>last too long on Broadway</i>

19
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:42,370
<i>l'll catch a Greyhound bus for home,</i>
<i>they all say</i>

20
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:47,844
<i>But they're dead wrong, l know they are</i>

- ls that your real name?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:06,564
- You sure you don't wanna change that?
- Well, if you give me the job l'll change it.

28
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:10,009
<i>But they're dead wrong, l know they are</i>

29
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,690

<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

35
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:36,606
- You were in <i>The Wiz?</i>
- Mr Gideon, l've never been in any show.

36
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,844
l had to put something on the card.
l really need ajob, so l lied.

37
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,242
ls all right, Rima. l lie all the time myself.

38
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,844
Oh, fuck him! He never picks me!

39
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,686
Honey, l <i>did</i> fuck him,
and he never picks me either!

40
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,767
- You were in <i>Traffic Jam?</i>
- Yes, sir.

41
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,970
- Who was the director of <i>Traffic Jam?</i>
- You were, Mr Gideon.

42
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:57,170
- Oh. How was l?
- Terrific.

43
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,926
- And who was the choreographer?
- You were, Mr Gideon.

44
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,129
- How was l?
- Fantastic.

45
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,602
Thas how you get ajob.

46
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:09,646
God, l hope he doesn't pick her.
She's uglier than a witch's tit.

47
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,372
The expression is "colder than a witch's tit".

48
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:16,446
- You've never seen a woman's tit in your life.
- Shh. Be quiet, you two.

49
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:21,288
OK, thank you all very much.
lt was a terrific audition. Just stay in line.

50
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:27,085
Now thas what l call a real drinker's nose.

51
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:31,052
And you should know, because
you're a real drinker, aren't you, Joe?

52
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,852
- Yeah.
- Also heavy into speed, aren't you?

53
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,211
- Yeah.
- Also sleep with a great many women.

54
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:45,731
- Real turn-off, huh?
- Just the opposite.

55
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:49,569
l'll make up my mind about the men later.
l know which girls l want.

56
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:53,123
Candy, Casey, Rima,
Jennifer and Victoria Porter.

57
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:57,206
- The one in the shocking-pink leotard?
- See if any are willing to be swing dancers.

58
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,602
- She's tone-deaf.
- With those legs, who cares?

59
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:03,163
Oh, Joey, l know you're in a hurry,
but l want to check your schedule.

60
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:07,212
- Same as always.
- Joey? Joey, can we talk a minute, please?

61
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:13,247
- Joey...
- What is it?

62
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:18,282
- You left me without a soprano again!
- Paul, please, will you let me handle it?

63
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,887
- What about Diane?
- What <i>about</i> Diane?

64
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,487
l've had her in three shows. She's wonderful.

65
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:28,044
At least she can sing. You left me
without a soprano. l gotta have a soprano!

66
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,805
Gentlemen, Mr Gideon...

67
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:34,330
The tall dancer with the blue eye shadow -
believe me, he'll hit the high notes.

68
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:40,009
The five Murray is talking to,
those are the girls l want. OK with you?

69
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:43,449
The tall girl, Victoria - l like her, Daddy.

70
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,524
Hm, she's all right.

71
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,612
l really screwed up <i>that</i> marriage.

72
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,606
Because l cheated. Oh, man,
l cheated every chance l could get.

73
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,404
OK with you, Audrey?

74
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:02,042
Sure. Fine with me.
What about this weekend with Michelle?

75
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:06,092
Oh, Jesus... l forgot.
l gotta work this weekend.

76
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,846
Oh, Joe! You promised her.

77
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:11,493
l know l promised, but what am l gonna do?

78
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,564
Thas OK.

79
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,806
- l'm sorry, Michelle.
- ls OK.

80
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:22,047
lf you want me, l'll be in the cutting room.

81
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,646
He promised me.

82
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:30,047
<i>- Some fucking father.</i>
<i>- Family?</i>

83
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,403
- Screwed up.
- Work?

84
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,972
All there is.

85
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:40,364
<i>If l were God, man...</i>
<i>And sometimes l think l am...</i>

86
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:45,731
<i>Depends on the shit you're smoking...</i>

87
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:51,331
<i>OK. If l were God, man,</i>
<i>everybody would live for ever.</i>

88
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:56,362
<i>No death, man.</i>
<i>No pennies on the eyes for anybody.</i>

89
00:09:56,453 --> 00:10:00,446
<i>Well, a couple of people, like my agent,</i>
<i>who booked me into this toilet...</i>

90
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,922
Why is he mumbling like that?

91
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:06,972
l'll tell you why. Cos l'm the dummy
who let him mumble like that.

92
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,770
- Try it.
<i>...death and the clap.</i>

93
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:15,051
<i>So far, l've managed to avoid one of them.</i>

94
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,330
<i>You know, man,</i>
<i>death is really a hip thing now.</i>

95
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,371
<i>But we all have</i>
<i>very different feelings about it.</i>

96
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,570
<i>For instance, to a Catholic,</i>
<i>death is a promotion.</i>

97
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,766
Excuse me, Stacy.

98
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,923
Women?

99
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:34,562
Hope?

100
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,087
<i>All this bullshit about "death with dignity".</i>

101
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,687
<i>You know what death with dignity is?</i>
<i>You don't drool.</i>

102
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,891
<i>Change-of-pace time. Request.</i>
<i>Here we go, Vic O'Dante. Hey!</i>

Beauty?

104
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,287
- Oh, you're a flirt.
- Mm-hm.

<i>Books, magazine articles, TVshows, Ken and</i>
<i>Barbie dolls who have a mutual suicide pact...</i>

Oh, man, how many times
do we have to look at the same thing?

110
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,962
Until he gets it the way he wants it.

111
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:18,002

Maybe we can get away with it.

00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,042
lt goes to the left. See?

161
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,569
l mean, like, l could always
have that fixed. Like that.

162
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,884
Do you think l could be?

163
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:17,689
You know. A movie star.
ln the movies.

164
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,408
Well, thas...

165
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:25,682
l don't know anybody
that could answer that question.

166
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:30,051
ls... is a very freaky business, you know?

167
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:36,531
Yeah, l know all about that,
but, like, l wanna know what <i>you</i> think.

168
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:39,571
Do <i>you</i> think l could be a movie star?

169
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,770
No.

170
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,844
Even with a nose job?

171
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:53,041
Well, thas fair.

172
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:02,963
Like you said, it is a freaky business, though.
You know, you could be wrong, right?

173
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,410
Right.

174
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,570
l don't dance so hot either, do l?

175
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,963
You will. l promise you.

176
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,370
You wanna go to bed?

177
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,285
Yeah.

178
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:20,286
l'm sorry. Oh, am l sorry.

179
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,933
- Katie!
- l shoulïve called first.

180
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,686
Oh, shit.

181
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:33,801
- Did l, like, screw anything up?
- No. <i>l</i> screwed it up.

182
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:38,366
Oh, l meant to call her.

183
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,611
Oh, boy, you are really something.

184
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,848
l'm Joey's mother.

185
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,767
Ever since he was so high,
he's had such a crush on you!

186
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:11,173
l've always been fond of Joe, too.

187
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,562
Of all the children, he was the least worry.

188
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,449
He worked in all those
cheap burlesque clubs.

189
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:21,043
Always around stark-naked girls!

190
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,010
But did it bother him? No.

191
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:27,771
He never paid any attention.
Never even looked at them.

192
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,806
<i>Amatis,</i> you love. <i>Amant,</i> they love.

193
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,652
<i>Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant.</i>

194
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,452
Hey, kid, what kind of language is that?

195
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:45,841
Oh, is not a language. ls just some
jokes l'm working on. Some crazy jokes.

196
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,567
<i>"Pu... Pu..."</i>

197
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,407
<i>Puella.</i> Girl.

198
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,373
"First Year Latin"?

199
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,444
ls my kid brother's.

200
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:12,170
- How old are you?
- 19.

201
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,609
Uh-huh. What year were you born?

202
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,729
Uh, 1930...

203
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:21,249
- Try 1934.
- Right. 1934.

204
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,324
1935?

205
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,083
1935, yeah.

206
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:29,289
Now try 1492.

207
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,649
See you around, kid.

208
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,924
Maybe we could have
a drink together sometime?

209
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,844
Oh, sure.

210
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:49,007
You notice we have small waitresses here.
You know why? Make the drinks look bigger.

211
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:51,812
Thas my favourite one.
The one with the big tips.

212
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,805
l got problems, too.
l went to see my psychiatrist.

213
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:59,569
l told him l have suicidal tendencies.
He says "From now on, you pay in advance."

214
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:04,283
Look, l don't have to do this for a living.
l have four chinchillas at home in heat.

215
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:07,526
No, l make a lot of money.
l just have trouble passing it.

216
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,083
l just have trouble passing it. ls this on?

217
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:14,043
First-year Latin!

218
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:18,923
ls three o'clock in the morning.
lsn't it past your bedtime?

219
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:23,884
l don't look for big laughs. l'll settle
for intelligent nods. Anything. Wink.

220
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:28,048
You better stop lying, or your nose will grow!

221
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,842
Ooh! <i>Something's</i> growing!

222
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:36,006
The drummer's not really with the band,
but he has the car. Married 14 years.

223
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:39,449
14 years, no children! Strict mother-in-law.

224
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,765
Les continue on. Right now, ladies
and gentlemen, here he is, Tops'n'Taps,

225
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:47,448
- may we present Mr Joe Gideon!
- You're on!

226
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:28,767
Joey's never done anything to disappoint me.

227
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,889
ls showtime, folks.

228
00:21:57,093 --> 00:22:00,449
- You believe in love?
- l believe in saying "l love you."

229
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,205
Helps you concentrate.

230
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:05,205
<i>Joe, they've asked me</i>
<i>to go on tour with the show.</i>

231
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,249
How long?

232
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:11,326
Six months. What do you think?

233
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,372
- And you say it all the time.
- l say it a lot. A lot.

234
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,569
- When?
- When it works.

235
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:21,362
You know, l love you, Katie, but l think
you have to do whas best for you.

236
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:25,207
- Just what do you mean, Joe?
- Sometimes it doesn't work.

237
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:31,968
l mean, for your sake, l think you should go.

238
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:47,091
Hello, Michael? ls Katie.

239
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:52,085
So, um, did you mean it about dinner?

240
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,368
Wally's at eleven?

241
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:58,445
You're surprised? <i>l'm</i> a little surprised.

242
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:03,806
Thank you. OK, Michael. Bye-bye.

243
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:11,685
l'm a little surprised too. lsn't that nice?
Now we're all a little surprised.

244
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,564
- Who was that?
- Michael Graham.

245
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,611
- Who is Michael Graham?
- The dancer in my ballet class.

246
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,923
Straight or gay?

247
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,283
What do you mean?

248
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:28,003
l mean is he looking to get laid,
or is he looking for Mr Right?

249
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,523
He's straight.

250
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,684
And tall.

251
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,527
Michael Graham is a very tall name.

252
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:49,373
Oh, goddammit!

253
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:54,130
How dare you use my phone, my telephone,
to call somebody who's not gay?

254
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,208
l see. You can go out
with any girl, any girl in town...

255
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:00,761
Thas right. l go out with any girl in town.

256
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,844
l stay in with you.

257
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,925
Joe, is not fair...
l'm spilling the coffee...

258
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:12,483
ls all wrong. Everything is all wrong.

259
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:17,681
Thas some set of rules you had for her.

260
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:19,650
Yeah, l know. l know.

261
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:23,169
But as long as you could
get away with it, right?

262
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:24,809
Right.

263
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:30,968
l don't wanna go out with Michael Graham.
l don't want a date. l have no small talk left.

264
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,649
l don't wanna fool around, l don't wanna
play games and l don't wanna fight.

265
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,203
l just want to love you.

266
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,844
Katie...

267
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:59,726
l try to give you everything l can give.

268
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,643
Oh, you give, all right. Presents, clothes...

269
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,328
l just wish

270
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:09,086
you weren't so generous with your cock.

271
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:17,244
Thas good.

272
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:26,051
Maybe l can use that some time.

273
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:39,404
Katie! About the goddamn tour...
l don't think you should go.

274
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:41,484
Wrong reading.

275
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:48,207
Softly and with feeling.

276
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:52,842
Don't go.

277
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,244
Please?

278
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:05,128
<i>- Why do you suppose she put up with it?</i>
- l can think of many reasons

279
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:09,126
- for wanting to be with you.
- Now don't bullshit a bullshitter.

280
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,964
Take off with us, take off with us

281
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:19,204
We're warmin' up, so take off with us

282
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,649
NY to LA-A-A

283
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,691
Goin' all the way-ay-ay

284
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,764
Won't you climb aboard?

285
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:31,892
You'll ride as smooth as glass

286
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:37,089
- ls perfect. Didn't l tell you?
- Up there, where the clouds are pillowy

287
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:40,404
You're as close to heaven as you'll ever be

288
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:43,485
Lean back, relax, here come the snacks

289
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:46,451
Drop your diet, have a fall

290
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:51,527
Don't stop with one, try 'em all

291
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:55,245
Music's ready to begin

292
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,564
Take out your headset, plug it in

293
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:01,531
Whas your answer, chu-hu-hum?

294
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,690
Are you gonna co-o-ome?

295
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,209
On the coolest, hottest trip

296
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,524
Thas ever been

297
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:15,088
Oh, is very, very good!

298
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:18,882
l think we might even get
a commercial tie-in with the airlines.

299
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,248
- You think so? Great.
- Audrey?

300
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:25,244
Well, ask...

301
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:31,282
Yeah, is OK.

302
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,568
Let me see what l can do with it.

303
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,407
l think is just what the show needs.
ls catchy, is bouncy. Right, Ted?

304
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,246
- Oh, yeah, very bouncy and catchy.
- Can we hear it again?

305
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,166
- l'd love to hear it again.
- Oh! Arnie...

306
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,206
Turn. Some fuckin' music.

307
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:53,083
- Turn back.
- Arch your back. Extend the right leg.

308
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,483
Ease your partner down gently.
Slide. Slide.

309
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,243
Slide!

310
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,766
<i>Have you ever slept with another woman?</i>

311
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,802
l once tried living with two girls.
Two girls at once.

312
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,927
- We lived together.
- Laughed together.

313
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:14,085
- Drank together.
- Smoked together.

314
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,324
Slept together.

315
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:24,568
Woke up one morning...
one of them was gone.

316
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,723
On the bureau, she left a note.

317
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:30,767
l'm sorry. l cannot share you any more.

318
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:34,732
l want you all to myself, or not at all.

319
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:39,046
Please, please try to understand.

320
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:42,284
l not only understood, l was flattered.

321
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:45,126
l was flattered that she felt
so strongly about me.

322
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,932
How did you know the note was to you?

323
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:58,326
<i>No. No, thas not me, man. No.</i>

324
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:00,483
<i>Somebody else, maybe, but not me.</i>

325
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,690
- What is this, Eddie?
- Not me. Talk to him.

326
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:07,527
Joey, l gotta talk to you
about these time sheets.

327
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:12,607
Three weeks now we've been on triple time.
The brass is eating my ass out!

328
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:15,048
You shot 82 days on a 65-day schedule.

329
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:18,250
On a four-month editing schedule,
you've gone seven months.

330
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,006
We're already 2.2 million
over the original budget.

331
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:26,451
Joey, God made the entire world in six days.
He didn't go on overtime once.

332
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:31,812
You can't even cut an hour-and-a-half movie
in seven months, on triple time?

333
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:34,612
Joey, l hate to do this.
l'm usually a very calm man,

334
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:38,083
but this whole thing
has got me terribly crazy.

335
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:41,609
l must put my foot down.
Joey, the whole thing has gotta stop.

336
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,332
lt has to stop. ls got to stop!

337
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:46,688
ltjust simply must stop!

338
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:51,688
Josh, l made changes in the monologue.
l think you'll like it. l have to go to rehearsal.

339
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,291
<i>At those prices, who can afford to live?</i>

340
00:29:55,373 --> 00:30:00,686
- Nice talking to you, Josh.
<i>- So l accept!</i>

341
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:03,446
Oh, my God. lt <i>is</i> better.

342
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:07,130
- God help us all.
<i>- Wait a minute. Real dead body.</i>

343
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:10,767
ls better.

344
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:15,405
OK, that looks pretty good. l like it.
Les go. Everybody down, in a straight line.

345
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:18,132
Move down, move down.
Move down, Victoria.

346
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,966
- And sing it out. Here we go.
- Five, six, seven...

347
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:26,685
And any seat you grab will be first class

348
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:30,561
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
And l don't like it.

349
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:41,804
Uh, double that.

350
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:45,044
- Which button?
- The white one, down.

351
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:56,529
Ah, that stinks. Les play something else.
Do me a favour. Take off your shoes.

352
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,605
- Whas that?
- ls a mint.

353
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:03,447
- Can l have one?
- No, come on, you wouldn't like it.

354
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,524
Let me try this.

355
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,606
Here, you stand over there,
then jump up on my shoulder.

356
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:12,127
Oh, God, you're getting heavy.

357
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:15,330
All right, put your leg in an arabesque.
There we are.

358
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:19,088
- How are things at home?
- They're pretty good.

359
00:31:19,173 --> 00:31:21,812
All right, watch your back now.

360
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:25,363
- Anything you wanna tell me?
- l promised Mom l wouldn't bring it up.

361
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,569
But you're gonna bring it up anyway.

362
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,008
Sit down. You can tell me
anything. You know that.

363
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:33,244
Gimme your wrists. Ready? And jump.

364
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,650
- ls just that l keep wondering, Dad...
- Bend your knees.

365
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,724
What is it you keep wondering?

366
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,122
Why don't you get married again?

367
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:44,087
Do a head roll.

368
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:50,524
l don't get married again because
l can't find anyone l dislike enough

369
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,922
to inflict that kind of torture on.

370
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:56,566
Hey, why don't you marry Katie?
She's terrific.

371
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:59,008
Keep rolling your head.

372
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,165
Straighten your leg. Yeah, you're right.

373
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,531
She's terrific. Thas exactly
why l don't wanna marry her.

374
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:11,249
Run off to the corner.
Jump and l'll catch you.

375
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,563
And Victoria? You're not too crazy about her.

376
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:16,963
Just run and jump.
Never mind that. Come on.

377
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:21,127
- What about the blonde?
- What blonde?

378
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:25,968
The one in Philadelphia with the TV show?
You know, the one Mom keeps talking about.

379
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:28,044
Oh, yeah, that blonde.

380
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,926
Jump up and wrap your legs around me.

381
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,402
Wrap around, thas it.

382
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:39,049
Why is it so important to you that...
Follow my hand.

383
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,125
Why is it so important to you
that l get married again?

384
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:44,568
Cos then you'd stop screwing around.

385
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:47,406
Hey! Watch your language.

386
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:51,610
- Oh, shit! Look at the time.
- Oh, Daddy, can't we stay longer?

387
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:54,491
- No, your mother will kill me.
- Oh, is so much fun.

388
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,851
No, no, absolutely. Come on.
Stop flocking your legs. Come on.

389
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:02,566
- Oh, please?
- No, no, no, no.

390
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:07,644
Besides, if you got married again, maybe
you'd have a baby and l'd have a brother.

391
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,883
l'll call Hertz and rent you a brother.

392
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:13,329
- Oh, very funny.
- Oh, everybody's a critic.

393
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,891
Showtime, folks.

394
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:29,245
Showtime.

395
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:31,643
Five, six, seven, eight.

396
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:35,131
Stop smiling. Lay back. Lay back.

397
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:39,609
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Candy, Casey, very good.

398
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:43,368
You're gonna do it again, Victoria.
Gary, Danny, les go.

399
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:46,365
Stop smiling. ls not
the high-school play. Count.

400
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,648
Five, six, seven, eight.

401
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,803
Hold it.

402
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,484
Stand on your right foot.

403
00:34:57,093 --> 00:34:58,970
Point your left toe.

404
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:03,205
Drop that shoulder.
Now, thas not too hard, is it?

405
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,965
Again.

406
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,244
Five, six, seven, eight.

407
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:15,772
Lay back, Victoria. Lay back.

408
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:17,206
Lay back!

409
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:21,002
Hold it, hold it.

410
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:34,207
- Sorry.
- No, you're right. l'm terrible.

411
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:38,730
l know l'm terrible. l look
in the mirror and l'm embarrassed.

412
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:43,841
Maybe l should quit. l... l just
can't seem to do anything right.

413
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:49,292
Listen, l can't make you a great dancer.

414
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,486
l don't even know
if l can make you a good dancer.

415
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:57,282
But if you keep tryin' and don't quit,

416
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:01,771
l know l can make you a <i>better</i> dancer.

417
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:06,444
And l'd like very much to do that.

418
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,204
Stay?

419
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:15,082
Are you gonna keep yelling at me?

420
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,405
Probably.

421
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:24,123
Five, six, seven, eight. One and two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two.

422
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:30,769
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. One, two.

423
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:40,244
Better.

424
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:48,366
Breathe deep. Again.

425
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,364
Hold it.

426
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:53,013
All right, you can turn around now.

427
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,524
Breathe deep.

428
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:00,804
Again.

429
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:05,404
All right, you can put your shirt on now.

430
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:08,087
Well, Doctor? Does he pass?

431
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,448
Good. Now l'm worth a million dollars.

432
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,605
Thas only if you die before February 1st.

433
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,127
Schedules, Goldie, always schedules.

434
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:20,288
Can we take you to lunch, Doctor?

435
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:28,803
And any seat you grab
will be first class

436
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:32,044
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

437
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,972
Nah, thas no good either. Les try this.

438
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:40,406
- Measure 412.
- l do the same as before?

439
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,643
Yeah, same thing, only l'll be behind you.

440
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:48,171
And any seat you grab will be first class

441
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:51,325
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

442
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:56,564
All right, les everybody try it.
Grab a partner. Come on.

443
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:58,723
OK, here we go. Ready?

444
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:00,726
Five, six, seven, eight.

445
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:06,763
And any seat you grab will be first class

446
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:08,844
Five, six, seven...

447
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:14,332
- Do it again.
- Once more, everybody.

448
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:19,691
Ready? Five, six, seven...

449
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:24,051
And any seat you grab will be first class

450
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:27,523
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:48,364
OK.

452
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:54,048
- OK, here we go. Once more, everybody.
- l gotta get outta here. l'll be back later.

453
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:59,366
- How does this look, Paul?
- l love it, love it.

454
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,164
No. ls too cute.

455
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:10,165
Ah! Oh, shit.

456
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:19,362
l can't go back to that room.
l can't face those dancers.

457
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:24,572
l'm stuck. They keep staring at me,
and nothing's coming out.

458
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,089
- Oh, boy, the number's lousy.
- My song, lousy?

459
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:31,848
No, not the song. Me, me,
the way l'm staging it.

460
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:38,051
- Maybe we should cut it.
- Cut it? l think l'll leave.

461
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:42,412
Paul, sit right there. Go back to bar 17.

462
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,564
And...

463
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:55,005
Did you hear what l said?
Nothing is coming.

464
00:39:55,653 --> 00:40:01,489
Don't worry, Paul, he always says the same
thing about every number, in every show.

465
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:04,926
Now how the hell do you know
what l always say?

466
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:08,926
- lt would be better if l stepped outside.
- Keep playing, Paul.

467
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:14,968
l'm only doing this goddamn show because
you wanna play that stupid 24-year-old girl.

468
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:18,284
Oh, l knew sooner or later you'd say that.

469
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:20,762
You <i>do</i> think l'm too old for the part.

470
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:23,963
Well, you're wrong.

471
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:28,331
l can play 24 years old,
and l'll damn well prove it.

472
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:31,007
You wanna quit the show? Quit the show.

473
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,609
You don't have to do anything for me.

474
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:41,327
Just don't kid yourself that you're doing this
show for any reason except guilt about me.

475
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,930
Guilt? What guilt?

476
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:48,565
For never going one day
when you were faithful to me?

477
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:50,609
Oh, that guilt.

478
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:55,726
Faithful, faithful... You're always
talking about being faithful.

479
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:58,373
Audrey, why do you think so small?

480
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:05,686
Besides, how do l know
you were faithful to me?

481
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:09,322
- You know l was.
- Thas right, l know you were.

482
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,964
- Oh, you meant to do that.
- Yes, l did.

483
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:17,683
You kept me working all the time.
l never had a <i>chance</i> to cheat.

484
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:20,128
What is this big hang-up about fidelity?

485
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:23,922
What makes being faithful
the greatest friggin' virtue in the world?

486
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,407
Excuse me.

487
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:28,565
Well, it is a great deal better

488
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,770
than the meaningless affairs
you keep tap-dancing through.

489
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:34,890
Those Stacys, those Victorias...

490
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:37,806
You're not even fooling Michelle
with Victoria, you know.

491
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:42,762
- Straighten that leg.
- lt is as straight as is ever going to get.

492
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:46,163
Oh, the Bonnies, the Wendys,
the Debbies, the Donnas...

493
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:50,087
l can't even remember
all their names. Give me a hand.

494
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:52,370
Keep playing, Paul.

495
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:58,531
Bet you can't either. Quick, tell me, what
was the name of the girl in Philadelphia?

496
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,162
The blonde with the television show?

497
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:07,651
Oh, the blonde with the television
show in Philadelphia?

498
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,328

Because that girl meant something to me.

499
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:15,452
The blonde with the television show,
her name was Sweetheart.

500
00:42:18,693 --> 00:42:21,161
- Honey?
- No.

501
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,964
Baby?

502
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:27,812
l can't remember her name.

503
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,123

504
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,807
- Dorothy.
- Who cares?

505
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:35,248
l can't remember her name.

506
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,361
The number's lookin' good.

507
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,444
Keep working.

508
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:53,730
- ls he gonna cut the number?
- No, l don't think so, Paul.

509
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:56,373
He's gonna cut it. He's gonna cut it.

510
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:03,691
Oh, God, that man.
He's gonna drive me crazy.

00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:19,524

00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:31,972
And, Paul, is not exactly

514
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:34,408
- Hm?
- ls a little different.

515
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,166

You're as close to heaven

00:45:57,653 --> 00:46:00,292
Whas your answer, chum?

Thanks, thanks a lot, but is

550
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:35,202
Smoke, smoke.

551
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,365
Smoke... Smoke...

552
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:42,730
The lights go down
and a light comes up over there.

553
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:48,521
Welcome. Welcome aboard Air Rotica.

554
00:46:48,613 --> 00:46:52,242

555
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,282

...but anywhere your desires
and fantasies wish to take you.

00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:03,202
Take off with us

558
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:06,613
Let us all get to know one another.

559
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:12,046
- Remember, we can take you anywhere.
- They're taking their clothes off.

560
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,361
Mm-hm.

561
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:18,049
Just reach out your hand
and introduce yourselves.

562
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:21,405
- My name is Sam.
- My name is Otto.

563
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,407
- My name is Jennifer.
- My name is Rima.

564
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:27,644
- Gary.
- John.

565
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:52,932
Uh-oh. l think we just lost
the family audience.

566
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:10,570
- My name is Candace.
- My name is Jennifer.

567
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:12,371

- My name is John.
- My name is Gary.

570
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:24,205
And don't forget about
our group fun, fun, fun plan.

571
00:50:31,053 --> 00:50:33,647
Now Sinatra will never record it.

572
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:26,644
Then an actor comes out
from the side of the stage and says...

573
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,206
- "Not once, during any of our flights..."
- Goodbye.

574
00:51:30,293 --> 00:51:32,807
- See you around.
- Hope to see you again real soon.

575
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:36,442
"...of any real human communication."

576
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,285
- Well, uh...
- Goodbye.

577
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:42,605
"Our motto is: we take you
everywhere, but get you nowhere."

578
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:54,923
Boy, l hate to hurt his feelings,
but we can't have that on a stage.

579
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:58,244
Take five.

580
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:06,364
Well?

581
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:10,968
Yeah, is, um... is, uh...

582
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:14,851
interesting.

583
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:17,003
Yes, very interesting.

584
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:19,323
Did you like it?

585
00:52:19,413 --> 00:52:22,246
- ls unusual.
- Mm-hm, very unusual.

586
00:52:33,893 --> 00:52:37,442
Oh, l don't think they liked it.

587
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,524
What do you think?

588
00:52:42,093 --> 00:52:47,611
l don't know about the audiences, but
l think is the best work you've ever done.

589
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,124
You son of a bitch.

590
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:03,052
Jesus Christ! Sex, sex, sex - can't he
ever think of anything else but sex?

591
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:06,531
Thas his sickness.

592
00:53:09,693 --> 00:53:13,003
Nah, nothin' l ever do is good enough.

593
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:17,928
ls not beautiful enough, is not
funny enough, is not deep enough...

594
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:20,288
ls not anything enough.

595
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:25,124
Now, when l see a rose, thas perfect.

596
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:30,765
l mean, thas perfect. l wanna look up to God
and say "How the hell did you do that?"

597
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:35,722
- "And why the hell can't l do that?"
- Thas probably one of your better con lines.

598
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:39,010
Yeah, it is. But that
doesn't mean l don't mean it.

599
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:42,083
<i>If l were God...</i>

600
00:53:42,173 --> 00:53:44,528
<i>Sometimes l think l am...</i>

601
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:48,522
<i>Depends on the shit you're smoking...</i>

602
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:52,891
<i>If l were God, man,</i>
<i>everybody would live for ever.</i>

603
00:53:52,973 --> 00:53:56,932
<i>No death, man. No pennies</i>
<i>on the eyes for anybody.</i>

604
00:53:57,013 --> 00:53:59,652
<i>You know, man, death</i>
<i>is really a hip thing now.</i>

605
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:01,811
<i>Death is in.</i>

606
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:07,172
<i>Books, magazine articles, TVshows, Ken</i>
<i>and Barbie dolls with a mutual suicide pact...</i>

607
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:09,209
<i>Buried them in a little shoebox.</i>

608
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:13,650
<i>Knew a guy who bought a pair of them.</i>
<i>He was into doll necrophilia.</i>

609
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:17,089
<i>If it cuts...</i>

610
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:20,643
<i>- All right, little thing. Oooh!</i>
- ls terrific.

611
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:25,648
<i>There's a lady in Chicago, man,</i>
<i>wrote a book. Dr Kübler-Ross, with a dash.</i>

612
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:29,772
<i>This chick, man, without</i>
<i>the benefit of dying herseIf,</i>

613
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:33,525
<i>has broken the process</i>
<i>of death into five stages.</i>

614
00:54:33,613 --> 00:54:36,571
<i>Anger, denial, bargaining,</i>
<i>depression and acceptance.</i>

615
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,883
- Thas it.
<i>- Sounds like a Jewish law firm.</i>

616
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:43,205
- Got time to make some changes?
- Not and make the screening tonight, no.

617
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:46,808
- l cannot believe people are gonna see this.
- Neither can l.

618
00:54:46,893 --> 00:54:49,691
- ls a bomb.
- Really?

619
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:54,722
Yeah, really. You'll have to make a speech.
Tell 'em is a rough cut, we're not finished...

620
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:57,725
- Tell 'em any excuse you can think of.
- Why don't you tell 'em?

621
00:54:57,813 --> 00:55:01,408
- l'm not gonna be there.
- You're not coming? Where you gonna be?

622
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:05,805
Hiding someplace, probably
vomiting, or drinking, or both.

623
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:08,168
We'll start recutting Monday morning.

624
00:55:09,053 --> 00:55:10,964
They bought that love story?

625
00:55:11,053 --> 00:55:14,523
Oh, l'm sorry.
l wasn't answering the phone.

626
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:16,604
l <i>think</i> they told me they liked it.

627
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:21,528
Just wasn't answering the phone...
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

628
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:24,242
No, l don't believe you either.

629
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,643
l'll have her home by 10.30, don't worry. Bye.

630
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:32,044
Oh, shit.

631
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:39,444
Hello. Stacy? Oh, listen,
l'm sorry. l'm in a meeting.

632
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,922
Just don't panic on the staircase.

633
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:46,332
At least three people said
how much they liked the screening.

634
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:51,327
One was my producer, one was
my lawyer and one was Michelle's mother.

635
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:55,645
Oh, Joe, everybody loved it. We tried to
tell you that last night. You wouldn't listen.

636
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:59,328
You know, that was the first R-rated
movie l ever saw, and l loved it.

637
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:02,723
- Did you understand it?
- Well, l understood everything

638
00:56:02,813 --> 00:56:06,931
except the part where the two girls
were in bed together and they were kissing.

639
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,969
What was that supposed to mean?

640
00:56:09,053 --> 00:56:11,044
- ls dinner ready yet?
- No.

641
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:15,883
- What was that supposed to mean?
- Well, Michelle, uh,

642
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:18,328
there are certain women who...

643
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:20,688
- Who...?
- Thanks a lot.

644
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:27,124
There are certain women
who just don't relate to men, so they...

645
00:56:27,213 --> 00:56:31,206
l think lesbian scenes are a big turn-off.

646
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,646
l shoulda cut it.

647
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:40,089
- Whas goin' on here?
- Never mind. You'll find out.

648
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:43,971
- Couldn't l be doin' somethin'?
- Just turn off the lights when we tell you.

649
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:50,130
- Turn on the phonograph when we tell you.
- Yes, ma'am.

650
00:56:51,973 --> 00:56:53,964
Oh, no, don't...

651
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:59,087
- Where'd you get those hats?
- Not tellin' ya.

652
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:01,971
Thas for us to know and for you to find out.

653
00:57:02,573 --> 00:57:07,931
- Oh, the lights, lights, lights.
- Joe, could you turn off the lights, please?

654
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:11,087
Now turn on those whachamacallit lights.

655
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,724
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:22,087
Crash!

657
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:27,645
Ladies and gentlemen, in honour
of El Stinko, El Blotto's screening

658
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:30,452
of Joe Gideon's new film, <i>The Stand-up,</i>

659
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:35,288
we are proud to present those two
dancing sensations Jagger and Gideon!

660
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:39,127
- Gideon and Jagger.
- Gideon and Jagger.

661
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:42,728
Give us our music, Joe.
ln an under-rehearsed tribute.

662
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:46,010
- Sit down, Joe, sit down.
- Sit down, Daddy.

663
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,284
And... go!

664
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:56,006
- l'm nervous.
- l'm nervous too.

665
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:02,208
Les go, les go.

666
00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:15,566
<i>When trumpets... were mellow</i>

667
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:19,569
<i>And everyone only had one fellow</i>

668
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:22,531
<i>No need to remember when</i>

669
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:25,605
<i>Cos everything old is new again</i>

670
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:28,605
l said everything old is new again

671
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:33,403
<i>Dancin'at your... Long lsland</i>
<i>jazz-age parties</i>

672
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:36,132
<i>Waiter, let me have some more Bacardis</i>

673
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,571
<i>Les order now what they ordered then</i>

674
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:42,645
<i>Cos everything old is new again</i>

675
00:58:43,413 --> 00:58:46,803
- <i>Get out your white suit, tap shoes and tails</i>
- Scoop, scoop...

676
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:50,044
- <i>Les go backward when forward fails</i>
- Strut.

677
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:53,569
<i>Movie stars that you thought are long-dead</i>

678
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:57,168
- <i>Now are framed beside your bed</i>
- Look familiar, Joe?

679
00:58:58,053 --> 00:59:00,408
<i>Don't throw the past away</i>

680
00:59:00,493 --> 00:59:03,212
<i>You might need it some rainy day</i>

681
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:06,572
<i>Dreams can come true again</i>

682
00:59:06,653 --> 00:59:09,963
<i>Cos everything old is new again</i>

683
00:59:10,053 --> 00:59:13,250
l said everything old is new again

684
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:17,292
<i>Get out your white suit,</i>
<i>your tap shoes and tails</i>

685
00:59:17,373 --> 00:59:20,445
<i>Les go backward when forward fails</i>

686
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:23,327
<i>Leave Greta Garbo alone</i>

687
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:26,689
- Go get him!
- <i>Be a movie star on your own</i>

688
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:30,561
<i>And don't throw... don't throw the past away</i>

689
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:33,929
<i>Oh, we're all gonna need it some rainy day</i>

690
00:59:34,813 --> 00:59:36,929
<i>Dreams can come true again</i>

691
00:59:37,013 --> 00:59:40,289
<i>Well, everything old is new again</i>

692
00:59:40,373 --> 00:59:43,922
<i>l said everything old is new again</i>

693
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:48,283
- Pretty pictures.
- <i>l might fall...</i>

694
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:52,162
l might fall

695
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:55,565
- <i>ln love...</i>
- Watch your feet.

696
00:59:56,013 --> 01:00:00,052
ln love

697
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:02,249
<i>With...</i>

698
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:05,444
<i>You again!</i>

699
01:00:12,573 --> 01:00:14,370
- Can we do it again?
- l don't wanna.

700
01:00:37,493 --> 01:00:39,643
ls showtime, folks.

701
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:44,369
And these two columns
revolve New York to LA.

702
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:47,445
And over here on the other side,
the same thing.

703
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:51,811
There's two staircases down here and
two more that come back into the orchestra.

704
01:00:51,893 --> 01:00:56,364
Oh, yeah, and this centrepiece
moves out for the interior scenes,

705
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,887
and up there, thas Stan.

706
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:02,926
You'll get familiar with it when we start.

707
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:08,565
OK, now, all l wanna do now
is to read easily through the script,

708
01:01:08,653 --> 01:01:12,407
and, frankly, l'm not too
familiar with it myself.

709
01:01:15,373 --> 01:01:20,322
So if we go through it, then you'll give Paul
and me some rough idea of what we've got.

710
01:01:20,413 --> 01:01:25,533
OK, no acting.
Everyone just take it easy. Easy.

711
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:28,284
All right, lights up.

712
01:01:28,373 --> 01:01:32,605
Audrey, you have your first number,
and then you begin reading on page two.

713
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:37,009
You see, Sammy, in California,
everybody needs a car.

714
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:41,450
l got a friend who bought a Mercedes
just to get to the bathroom.

715
01:03:11,693 --> 01:03:18,531
l guess only in America can a 24-year-old girl
like me own a house like this in Beverly Hills.

716
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:25,570
Thank you all very much.
You've done a wonderful job.

717
01:03:25,653 --> 01:03:30,852
Take an hour and a half for lunch.
Don't forget to sign the Boston hotel list.

718
01:03:54,693 --> 01:03:56,684
Excuse me.

719
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:08,164
There's no use to panic till
we find out what it really is.

720
01:04:08,253 --> 01:04:09,527
Do stop that.

721
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:15,532
<i>Dr Ballinger is looking at him now.</i>
<i>Ballinger is the best there is, Audrey.</i>

722
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:20,448
- Dr Hyman, we just left him. He seemed fine.
- Just fine.

723
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:24,367
Well, he called. He said he had
chest pains, his left arm was numb...

724
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:29,688
<i>l'm a little bewildered myseIf.</i>
<i>l checked him about a month ago.</i>

725
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:34,324
All right, who's in charge of this all-important
show that Mr Gideon keeps talking about?

726
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,131
l guess l am.

727
01:04:36,213 --> 01:04:39,967
Mr Gideon is having attacks of angina
that could lead to a massive coronary.

728
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:43,409
Oh, shit! l gotta get to rehearsals.
l'm fine. What do doctors know?

729
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:46,087
About angina, a little more
than show people.

730
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,609
lf you wanna leave, fine,
but l think you'll die. Can l see you?

731
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,684
Dr Hyman.

732
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:57,768
The pain is gone. Nothing wrong
with me a rewrite wouldn't cure.

733
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:01,528
- Couple of good jokes is what l need.
- You can't leave now.

734
01:05:01,613 --> 01:05:04,127
- Yes, l can.
- Damn it, Joe!

735
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:07,405
Didn't you hear what the doctorjust said?

736
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:08,642
Please, stay.

737
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:19,334
- Joey, l've been talking to Dr Ballinger...
- Jonesy, wait a minute.

738
01:05:19,422 --> 01:05:24,371
Let me talk to the star here. lf l stay,
how much time are we talking about?

739
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,930
At least two or three weeks.

740
01:05:27,022 --> 01:05:30,731
You've got to be kidding!
l got a show to put on.

741
01:05:30,822 --> 01:05:35,213
Jonesy, for Chrissakes, will you talk to these
people? They don't understand anything.

742
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:38,135
- Oh, Jesus...
- Whas wrong?

743
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,932
- Miss Collins. All right, easy.
- Damn it.

744
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:45,413
You guys are doin' this to me.
l wasn't sick until l got here.

745
01:05:45,662 --> 01:05:48,381
- Whas wrong with him?
- ls exhaustion.

746
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,813
You're lying to me.

747
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:56,291
Yes.

748
01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:02,933
<i>Uh, no. No, l'm not a member</i>
<i>of his immediate family.</i>

749
01:06:03,022 --> 01:06:05,536
<i>l'm, uh... l'm his girIfriend.</i>

750
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:10,856
Well, can l leave a message for him, please?
Could you tell him that K...? Hello?

751
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,976
<i>lt was just simply exhaustion.</i>

752
01:06:17,062 --> 01:06:19,530
<i>He just tried to do too much.</i>

753
01:06:19,622 --> 01:06:21,931
<i>Anyway,</i>

754
01:06:22,022 --> 01:06:25,537
we've made a decision
to postpone the show for four months.

755
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:29,212
- The doctors assure us Joe will be fine.
- There goes my new apartment.

756
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:32,851
Therefore the show will
definitely be done. l promise.

757
01:06:34,942 --> 01:06:39,413
Now, we're aware of the financial burdens...

758
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:43,381
l gave up a TV series. What a dummy.

759
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:50,334
We're prepared to try to get you
temporary jobs, or even lend you money.

760
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:53,937
Jonesy, Jonesy, easy on
the money, easy on the money.

761
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,021
All right, Larry, all right, OK.

762
01:06:57,822 --> 01:07:00,894
We don't have a lot of cash available, but...

763
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:03,780
what l'd like to say to you is,

764
01:07:03,862 --> 01:07:09,175
l... we... think of you all as family.

765
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,617
- Bullshit.
- And we want to do everything

766
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:15,581
we possibly can to keep you all together.

767
01:07:15,662 --> 01:07:18,972
<i>l was with him last night.</i>
<i>Already he's much better.</i>

768
01:07:19,062 --> 01:07:22,691
<i>l just left him an hour ago.</i>
<i>He was in a great mood.</i>

769
01:07:22,782 --> 01:07:25,694
<i>Making jokes, making passes</i>
<i>at all the nurses.</i>

770
01:07:25,782 --> 01:07:31,618
And he told me to tell all of you, he has
a terrific idea for a new hospital number.

771
01:07:31,702 --> 01:07:35,661
Hold it, Audrey, hold it.
Hospital number, hospital number!

772
01:07:35,742 --> 01:07:38,700
Just give me a minute.
Stanley, give me some room.

773
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:41,819
- How does the title "Hospital Hop" grab you?
- lt grabs me.

774
01:07:41,902 --> 01:07:43,893
Great, great.

775
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,895
- l think l got it. l got it!
- l think he's got it. He's got it.

776
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,576
Stan, help me out, please.

777
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:54,178
Clap your hands.

778
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:00,371
Cheer up.

779
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:03,890
<i>Les go! Everybody.</i>

780
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:20,374
And, Lucas, they are without question
an absolutely marvellous cast.

781
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:25,411
Now we gotta wait around for four months.
Maybe even lose them.

782
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:31,611
l can see where id be difficult to hold
a cast like that together. ls really a shame.

783
01:08:31,702 --> 01:08:35,775
And, of course, even after
four months, a heart attack...

784
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:39,542
There's no guarantee
that he'll be able to work.

785
01:08:39,622 --> 01:08:41,374
None.

786
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:44,101
Jules, is still too bright.

787
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:49,341
- Take number seven down five.
- And he's the greatest.

788
01:08:52,022 --> 01:08:55,935
And, Lucas, l think we have a sure hit.

789
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:58,732
A sure hit.

790
01:08:58,822 --> 01:09:01,131
Reads like a dream.

791
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:06,373
- l'd love to read it sometime.
- l'll get a copy to you this afternoon.

792
01:09:06,462 --> 01:09:09,340
Oh, l forgot. Wait a minute.

793
01:09:10,902 --> 01:09:14,338
l've got one right here with me.

794
01:09:14,422 --> 01:09:16,890
Dimmer five up to three.

795
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:19,737
Hold that, hold that. Thas good.

796
01:09:20,342 --> 01:09:23,698
Of course, l know you couldn't
care less about the money.

797
01:09:23,782 --> 01:09:26,137
What do you think about this, Lucas?

798
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:28,213
ls it any better?

799
01:09:29,662 --> 01:09:33,416
No. No, no. lt needs to be more... shadowy.

800
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:37,017
We talked about this, Jules.
ls a seduction scene.

801
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:40,372
All right, take the shadow lights to half.

802
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:45,178
How much... is Joe getting?

803
01:09:46,022 --> 01:09:49,492
5% of the gross until payoff,
then he goes to 6%.

804
01:09:49,582 --> 01:09:53,700
20% of all subsidiary rights,
including a movie sale.

805
01:09:59,222 --> 01:10:03,420
Well, of course
my schedule's impossible, but...

806
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:10,780
You know how l feel about you, Jonesy.

807
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:15,421
- You've been like a father to me.
- And you a son to me.

808
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:19,659
l always look for the worst in people.

809
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:24,258
- A piece of you in them?
- Yeah, a piece of me.

810
01:10:24,342 --> 01:10:26,412
And, generally, l find it.

811
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,574
Well, it may take you years, but you'll find it.

812
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:32,935
Oh, you're cute. You are cute.

813
01:10:40,342 --> 01:10:45,370
ls looking better. l think we'll move you
upstairs to a private room for a while.

814
01:10:45,462 --> 01:10:47,498
Oh, yeah.

815
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:51,291
But you'd better rest.
lf you don't, you're in for a lot of trouble.

816
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:54,294
Oh, l will, doctor.

817
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:57,340
l promise. l will.

818
01:11:12,662 --> 01:11:14,220
Mr Gideon.

819
01:11:22,262 --> 01:11:24,378
Mr Gideon, what are you doing?

820
01:11:25,062 --> 01:11:27,451
Oh, this? l was just getting rid of it.

821
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:30,693
l caught someone smoking,
and l told him a man in my condition

822
01:11:30,782 --> 01:11:32,932
shouldn't even be around smoke.

823
01:11:41,302 --> 01:11:44,374
l'm telling ya, Gideon,
l got real insight into you.

824
01:11:44,462 --> 01:11:47,454
There's a deep-rooted fear
of being conventional.

825
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:49,533
Right.

826
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:59,492
Your blood pressure is higher than we hoped.
Your cardiograms haven't improved one bit.

827
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:03,131
Now, if you don't give a damn,
is hard to expect us to.

828
01:12:11,382 --> 01:12:13,373
Mr Gideon!

829
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:19,895
l'll leave these menus with you. Please check
off what you want for the coming weeks, OK?

830
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:23,531
Monday, l'll have roast beef,
Tuesday, chicken, Wednesday, steak,

831
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:27,331
Thursday, l plan to be dead,
so... l'll just have something light.

832
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:29,299
Mr Gideon!

833
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:38,812
She wrote a little note on the back.
She said <i>you'd</i> understand.

834
01:12:38,902 --> 01:12:44,181
"Dear loving, giving, generous" -
underlined four times - "Dad,

835
01:12:44,262 --> 01:12:50,895
l hear nurses are nice people, hint, hint.
Your poor, brotherless daughter."

836
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:54,296
Joe, what does it mean?

837
01:12:55,222 --> 01:12:59,852
lt means she's inherited her mother's
determination, thas what it means.

838
01:13:11,582 --> 01:13:16,975
<i>Oh, no... Thank you, thank you. No, no...</i>
<i>You're wonderful, wonderful.</i>

839
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:20,611
<i>The word superstar is greatly</i>
<i>overused in this business.</i>

840
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:24,897
<i>But for my next guest, the word</i>
<i>superstar is totally inadequate.</i>

841
01:13:24,982 --> 01:13:29,021
<i>Whenever l do a benefit-</i>
<i>and l've done 150, 60, 70, this year,</i>

842
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:35,177
<i>all for very worthy causes - l can always</i>
<i>count on this dude to be right there with me.</i>

843
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:38,136
<i>l feel humbled in his presence.</i>

844
01:13:38,222 --> 01:13:42,340
<i>From deep, deep in here, ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen, let me lay on you...</i>

845
01:13:42,462 --> 01:13:45,022
- A great entertainer.
<i>- a great entertainer,</i>

846
01:13:45,102 --> 01:13:47,536
- A great humanitarian.
<i>- a great humanitarian,</i>

847
01:13:47,622 --> 01:13:52,218
- And my dear friend for 25 years.
<i>- and my dearest, dearest friend for 20 years.</i>

848
01:13:52,782 --> 01:13:56,741
- You missed by five years.
- Oh, boy, do l hate show business.

849
01:13:56,822 --> 01:14:01,054
- Joey, you love show business.
- Thas right, l love show business.

850
01:14:01,142 --> 01:14:02,780
l'll go either way.

851
01:14:13,702 --> 01:14:16,136
l got insight into you, Gideon.

852
01:14:16,222 --> 01:14:21,296
You know whas underneath?
The dreadful fear that you're ordinary,

853
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:23,054
not special.

854
01:14:23,742 --> 01:14:25,733
Right.

855
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:29,250
Oh, l think...

856
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,218
l think...

857
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:36,978
- l'm getting an erection.
- Oh, Mr Gideon, don't do that.

858
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:42,622
That sex thing, Jesus. Listen,
l wouldn't say you were a faggot,

859
01:14:43,302 --> 01:14:47,090
but you do have a lot
of feminine characteristics, right?

860
01:14:51,062 --> 01:14:52,734
Right.

861
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:03,217
You are foolishly and childishly
flirting with disaster.

862
01:15:03,302 --> 01:15:08,740
Joey, you're really crazy!
What do you wanna do, kill yourself?

863
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:15,215
Dr Ballinger told me to get a little exercise.

864
01:15:17,302 --> 01:15:20,100
Everything he does seems
to be a denial of his condition.

865
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,412
Dr Ballinger, every time l've seen him,

866
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:26,495
l get the impression that
he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.

867
01:15:26,582 --> 01:15:29,335
Yes, l know. But l think he cares a lot.

868
01:15:29,422 --> 01:15:32,539
OK, we'll limit his visitors
to no more than two.

869
01:15:32,622 --> 01:15:34,533
<i>Joe, l wish you could have been there.</i>

870
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:37,456
9.30 this morning,
before a single review was out,

871
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:43,936
the line at Cinema One was around the
block. The people know. The people <i>know.</i>

872
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:50,495
This broke every first-day record.
ls a blockbuster. l mean a <i>blockbuster.</i>

873
01:15:51,022 --> 01:15:55,334
And those guys in California...
You wouldn't believe the telephone calls.

874
01:15:55,422 --> 01:16:00,894
"Congratulations", they say. "We're <i>glad</i>
you took your time. lt was worth it."

875
01:16:00,982 --> 01:16:05,692
They said "Every dollar that we put
in that film is up there on the screen."

876
01:16:05,782 --> 01:16:09,570
l'm telling you, they're talking about
a $3.5 million advertising budget.

877
01:16:09,662 --> 01:16:13,132
3.5 million dollars! l'm sorry. Excuse me.

878
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:18,296
Do you believe that? 3.5 million dollars. This
picture is gonna go right through the roof.

879
01:16:18,382 --> 01:16:21,818
Right through... the roof.

880
01:16:22,302 --> 01:16:27,251
Look at those reviews. See it?
We did it. Joe, we did it.

881
01:16:27,342 --> 01:16:29,412
Where are the bad ones?

882
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,572
There are no bad ones.

883
01:16:31,662 --> 01:16:33,653
Josh...

884
01:16:33,742 --> 01:16:37,371
Well, there were a couple that
quibbled a little. l left them at the office.

885
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:41,296
Josh, l want you to do me a favour -
don't show them to me.

886
01:16:41,382 --> 01:16:43,976
Never. How were the television reviews?

887
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:48,852
l think we got Leslie Perry.
At the screening, she told me she loved it.

888
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:54,619
<i>Following Gideon's triumphant directorial</i>
<i>achievement with "50 Beautiful Girls, 50",</i>

889
01:16:54,702 --> 01:16:56,818
<i>when he won every possible award,</i>

890
01:16:56,902 --> 01:17:01,134
<i>it would be nice to report that</i>
<i>Mr Gideon's latest effort, "The Stand-up",</i>

891
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:04,259
<i>starring Davis Newman, was a better film.</i>

892
01:17:04,342 --> 01:17:08,540
Oh, boy, here it comes.

893
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:10,692
Joey, turn it off, please.

894
01:17:10,782 --> 01:17:15,902
<i>... falls into his characteristic weakness</i>
<i>of trying too hard to please, to entertain.</i>

895
01:17:15,982 --> 01:17:20,658
- Josh, no. l wanna hear it.
<i>- The razzle-dazzle sometimes obliterates...</i>

896
01:17:20,742 --> 01:17:23,654
- What does she know?
- She never gives a good review.

897
01:17:23,742 --> 01:17:27,735
That woman is totally unqualified
to criticise anything.

898
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:31,132
- She doesn't know a damn thing about film.
- Or anything.

899
01:17:31,222 --> 01:17:35,295
She's not even reviewing a film.
She's telling you how clever <i>she</i> is.

900
01:17:35,382 --> 01:17:39,057
<i>... where the has-been comic,</i>
<i>played impeccably by Davis Newman,</i>

901
01:17:39,142 --> 01:17:42,293
<i>demonstrates his former</i>
<i>brilliance in a monologue</i>

902
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:46,898
<i>where clearly director Gideon</i>
<i>gave Mr Newman free rein.</i>

903
01:17:46,982 --> 01:17:51,976
<i>Rising above rather commonplace material,</i>
<i>the actor creates a classic comic...</i>

904
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:55,975
l guarantee this picture
will do 30 million domestic, at least.

905
01:17:56,102 --> 01:17:58,855
- One of you better get somebody.
- What?

906
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:02,099
l think l'm in trouble.

907
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:05,891
<i>... chopping off the ends of scenes</i>
<i>before the drama is played out,</i>

908

<i>and a four-aspirin headache.</i>

909

<i>Using my four-balloon rating system,</i>
<i>l give "The Stand-up" haIf a balloon.</i>

- The truth? l'm scared.

911
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:36,174
Roll 'em.

912
01:18:36,262 --> 01:18:39,618

The heart is the viscus that maintains
the circulation of the blood.

918
01:19:11,742 --> 01:19:15,052
That means he had total blockage in...

919
01:19:15,782 --> 01:19:17,773
two arteries.

Remember last Tuesday night?

01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:27,335
lt was raining... very hard.

939
01:20:28,462 --> 01:20:31,499
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was raining. What about it?

940
01:20:33,582 --> 01:20:35,573
l called you at midnight.

941
01:20:36,502 --> 01:20:38,891
l must have been walking the dog.

942
01:20:42,582 --> 01:20:45,938
l don't have time for this sort of thing.

943
01:20:46,022 --> 01:20:48,058
You were with someone.

01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:50,660
Yes.

01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:55,130

956
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:35,533

01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:25,057
Assistants, secretaries, etc, 3,000.

977
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:29,454
Rehearsal halls and auditions... 9500.

978
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:32,056
Script and administrative, 1500.

979
01:23:32,142 --> 01:23:35,418
Managers, l'd say... ten.

980
01:23:35,982 --> 01:23:42,535
Advertising and printing, about 20,000.
Orchestrations, so far, around 10,000.

981
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:47,619
Legal, 10,000, auditing, 2,000,

982
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:51,339
payroll taxes... maybe seven.

983
01:23:52,102 --> 01:23:57,051
Well, seven. Author's advances, 10,000,
equity bonds, 50,000.

984
01:23:57,142 --> 01:24:02,580
Rehearsal salaries, and we've made some
advances to a few of the cast, about 43,000.

985
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,653
We're in for about...

986
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:07,936
$480,500.

987
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:11,301
Yes. Thas the figure l had here.

988
01:24:11,382 --> 01:24:13,293
And change.

989
01:24:15,142 --> 01:24:17,292
Let me try to understand.

990
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:20,692
Of that figure, how much do we recoup?

991
01:24:20,782 --> 01:24:24,616
Yeah, l'm confused too. Do we
get all of that, or part of it, or what?

992
01:24:24,702 --> 01:24:28,251
Simply, here are the options.
One, if Mr Gideon recovers

993
01:24:28,342 --> 01:24:33,177
and you resume production within the
180 days, we are not liable for any part of it.

994
01:24:33,262 --> 01:24:37,221
Two, if Mr Gideon should die and you resume
production with another director

995
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:41,341
within the 180 days, we are still not liable.

996
01:24:42,142 --> 01:24:46,738
Three, however, if Mr Gideon
should expire before February 1,

997
01:24:47,622 --> 01:24:50,261
<i>and you abandon production,</i>

998
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:52,856
we are liable for the full million dollars.

999
01:24:52,942 --> 01:24:57,094
This means, gentlemen,
you could make a profit of...

1000
01:24:59,022 --> 01:25:03,174
$519,500.

1001
01:25:04,582 --> 01:25:10,612
You could be the first show on Broadway
to make a profit without really opening.

1002
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:15,533
Well...

1003
01:25:16,622 --> 01:25:19,090
is all very clear to me.

1004
01:25:29,022 --> 01:25:31,490
<i>All this bullshit about death with dignity.</i>

1005
01:25:31,582 --> 01:25:35,575
<i>You know what death with dignity is,</i>
<i>man? You don't drool.</i>

1006
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:39,894
<i>Change-of-pace time. Request.</i>
<i>Here we go. Vic O'Dante. Hey!</i>

1007
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:42,450
<i>Death is in, death is in, my dear</i>

1008
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:44,453
<i>Death is the thing</i>

1009
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,931
Oh, thas very theatrical, Joe.

1010
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:49,013
Please don't try to talk.

1011
01:25:51,702 --> 01:25:54,535
- You wanna shoot it now?
- Huh?

1012
01:25:54,622 --> 01:25:59,093
- l can't understand him. l think he said "OK".
- Hospital hallucination, take one.

1013
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:04,257
<i>There's a lady in Chicago, man,</i>
<i>wrote a book. Dr Kübler-Ross, with a dash.</i>

1014
01:26:04,342 --> 01:26:09,177
<i>This chick, man, without</i>
<i>the benefit of dying herseIf,</i>

1015
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:12,095
<i>has broken the process</i>
<i>of death into five stages.</i>

1016
01:26:12,182 --> 01:26:15,618
<i>Anger, denial, bargaining,</i>
<i>depression and acceptance.</i>

1017
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:17,499
Playback.

1018
01:26:27,422 --> 01:26:29,538
After you've gone

1019
01:26:29,622 --> 01:26:31,692
And left me cryin'

1020
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:33,898
After you've gone

1021
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,092
There's no denyin'

1022
01:26:36,182 --> 01:26:38,013
You'll feel blue

1023
01:26:38,102 --> 01:26:40,662
You'll feel sad

1024
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:42,653
You'll miss the bestest pal ya

1025
01:26:42,742 --> 01:26:44,573
Ever had

1026
01:26:44,702 --> 01:26:47,421
There'll come a time

1027
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,094
Don't forget it

1028
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:51,457
There'll come a time

1029
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:53,260
When you'll regret it

1030
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:54,570
Some

1031
01:26:54,662 --> 01:26:55,697
Day

1032
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:58,296
When you grow lonely

1033
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:02,660
Your heart will break like mine
and you'll want me only

1034
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:04,972
After you've gone

1035
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:07,371
After you've gone

1036
01:27:27,182 --> 01:27:29,571
After you've gone

1037
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:36,773
After you've gone...

1038
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,370
Away

1039
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:39,941
Away

1040
01:27:40,782 --> 01:27:42,340
Cut!

1041
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:46,539
Wanna print it?

1042
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:51,093
Jesus, Joe, you're way behind schedule.
You gotta print it.

1043
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,173
Next setup.

1044
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:56,173
Katie, take two.

1045
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,533
Listen, huh?

1046
01:28:00,662 --> 01:28:02,618
Playback.

1047
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,331
You'd better change your way o' livin'

1048
01:28:37,422 --> 01:28:40,175
- And if that ain't enough
- She's right, Joe, you'd better listen

1049
01:28:40,262 --> 01:28:43,698
You'd better change the way
you strut your stuff

1050
01:28:43,782 --> 01:28:48,219
Cos nobody wants you
when you're old and grey

1051
01:28:48,302 --> 01:28:51,533
You better change your way today

1052
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:54,458
You better change your way

1053
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:56,419
Can you hear me, Joe? l'm talkin' to ya.

1054
01:28:56,502 --> 01:28:59,699
- Ya gotta lay off the booze, Joe.
- Axe the amphetamines.

1055
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:01,738
You gotta stop screwin' around, Daddy.

1056
01:29:01,822 --> 01:29:03,778
Ya better stop

Ya better stop, ya better change,

01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:18,251
Ya better stop and change your ways today

l said stop, change, stop!

1063
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,294
Please.

1064
01:29:23,382 --> 01:29:25,373
Cut!

1065
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:33,935
- Print it.
- Old Friends, take three.

1066
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:36,337
Playback.

1067
01:30:05,862 --> 01:30:08,854
Who's sorry now?

1068
01:30:09,102 --> 01:30:12,651
Who's sorry now?

1069
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:15,859
Whose heart is aching?

1070
01:30:15,942 --> 01:30:19,696
- Just look at you, Daddy.
- For breaking each vow

1071
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:24,173
- All those broken vows.
- Who's sad and blue?

1072
01:30:24,262 --> 01:30:27,937
Who's crying too?

1073
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:32,095
Just like we cried over you?

1074
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:35,618
- And we cried a lot.
- Oh, a lot.

1075
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:41,256
- Me too.
- Boo-hoo

1076
01:30:41,342 --> 01:30:43,731
Right to the end

1077
01:30:43,822 --> 01:30:47,132
- ls getting close, Joe.
- Just like a friend

1078
01:30:47,222 --> 01:30:52,376
- Where were ya, Joe? Where were ya?
- We tried to warn you

1079
01:30:53,142 --> 01:30:55,053
Somehow

1080
01:30:55,142 --> 01:30:58,498
You didn't listen, Daddy. You didn't listen.

1081
01:31:01,302 --> 01:31:04,977
You had your way

1082
01:31:05,262 --> 01:31:09,972
Now you must pay

1083
01:31:11,582 --> 01:31:21,776
We're glad that you're sorry now

1084
01:31:22,502 --> 01:31:23,981
Cut!

1085
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:30,137
You blew it. You forgot your line.

1086
01:31:30,222 --> 01:31:34,135
At the end you're supposed to say, uh...
Whas he supposed to say?

1087
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:38,773
He's supposed to say
"l don't want to die. l want to live."

1088
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:45,895
Well, if you can't say it, you can't say it.
We'll just have to cut it, thas all.

1089
01:31:45,982 --> 01:31:48,940
Cut it. Take me up. Next setup.

1090
01:32:13,302 --> 01:32:19,537
Some of these days

1091
01:32:19,622 --> 01:32:23,535
You're gonna miss me, Daddy

1092
01:32:23,862 --> 01:32:27,901
Some of these days

1093
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:31,577
You're gonna feel so lonely

1094
01:32:32,182 --> 01:32:35,458
You'll miss her huggin'

1095
01:32:36,022 --> 01:32:40,174
You'll miss her kissin'

1096
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:43,299
You'll miss me, Daddy

1097
01:32:44,222 --> 01:32:48,534
lf you go away

1098
01:32:48,782 --> 01:32:52,536
l'll feel so lonely

1099
01:32:52,622 --> 01:32:56,535
Just for you only

1100
01:32:56,622 --> 01:33:00,456
For you know, Daddy

1101
01:33:00,702 --> 01:33:04,217
You had your way

1102
01:33:04,302 --> 01:33:10,013
- A lot.
- And if you leave her

1103
01:33:10,102 --> 01:33:14,618
You know, you know, you're gonna, gonna,
gonna, gonna, gonna grieve her

1104
01:33:14,702 --> 01:33:20,732
You're gonna miss your sweet,
little, lovin', baby daughter Michelle

1105
01:33:22,422 --> 01:33:26,813
- Some of these days
- Don't die, Daddy! Don't die, please!

1106
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:28,255
Some of these days

1107
01:33:28,342 --> 01:33:31,652
You can't leave this poor
little kid without a father!

1108
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:36,099
- Some of these days
- She needs ya, Joe! She needs ya!

1109
01:33:36,182 --> 01:33:42,530
Some of these days

1110
01:33:46,782 --> 01:33:48,818
Oh! Oh, no.

1111
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:51,413
You don't have any lines here.

1112
01:33:54,902 --> 01:33:57,541
<i>Real dead body. Real dead body.</i>

1113
01:33:58,782 --> 01:34:00,773
End sticks.

1114
01:34:02,942 --> 01:34:08,539
Please don't try to talk. lf you wanna
tell me anything, just write it on this pad.

1115
01:34:12,302 --> 01:34:15,214
<i>No, no. Come on, not now.</i>

1116
01:34:17,262 --> 01:34:19,822
Please leave. Please.

1117
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:25,012
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l'm sure. Just go.

1118
01:34:25,102 --> 01:34:26,694
Am l alive?

1119
01:34:27,222 --> 01:34:29,258
All right, Joe.

1120
01:34:31,222 --> 01:34:33,861
Yes, you are alive.

1121
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:37,496
Now, this is gonna hurt a little...

1122
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:42,536
Hm. That came out nice.

1123
01:34:43,062 --> 01:34:46,134
Miss Paris, would you like
to see something nice?

1124
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:50,340
Oh, that is beautiful!

1125
01:34:50,422 --> 01:34:54,813
That is an absolutely beautiful scar, Dr Garry.

1126
01:34:54,902 --> 01:34:57,860
- Thank you.
<i>- How soon will he be able to work?</i>

1127
01:34:57,982 --> 01:35:01,531
Well, he's out of intensive care,
back in a private room.

1128
01:35:01,622 --> 01:35:05,854
The doctor says is just a matter of rest.
Two months, at the outside.

1129
01:35:05,942 --> 01:35:10,652
Oh, you know Joey. This morning
he said he could hardly wait.

1130
01:35:11,022 --> 01:35:13,456
Said he had a lot of new ideas.

1131
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,658
And not all that sex stuff, either.

1132
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:18,053
Now, thas terrific.

1133
01:35:18,142 --> 01:35:21,418
You must feel really good about that, Jonesy.

1134
01:35:21,502 --> 01:35:24,892
Relieved. We're all relieved.

1135
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:28,420
- Check, please.
- l did some thinking about your script

1136
01:35:28,502 --> 01:35:30,697
and l made a few notes.

1137
01:35:30,782 --> 01:35:32,659
Oh, my.

1138
01:35:32,742 --> 01:35:36,781
Use them, don't use them...
You know, whatever you want.

1139
01:35:37,462 --> 01:35:42,013
l hate to bother you,
but are you... Lucas Sergeant?

1140
01:35:42,102 --> 01:35:44,093
- Yes.
- Would you mind?

1141
01:35:44,182 --> 01:35:46,377
No, no. Not at all.

1142
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:51,780
l'm an actress and, next to Joe Gideon,
you're my favourite director.

1143
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:57,219
l'm so sorry your show was a flop.

1144
01:35:59,862 --> 01:36:03,821
- Best of luck with your career.
- Thank you so much.

1145
01:36:04,302 --> 01:36:09,422
Lucas, you put in an awful lot
of work on this. l'm moved.

1146
01:36:09,782 --> 01:36:16,779
For somebody to do something like this
just... just out of friendship... lt touches me.

1147
01:36:16,862 --> 01:36:20,298
Listen, what are friends for?
We're all rooting for each other.

1148
01:36:20,382 --> 01:36:22,942
l'm just pleased that Joe is well again.

1149
01:36:23,182 --> 01:36:27,573
- Hey, let me get this.
- No, Lucas, this is on me.

1150
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:29,653
l said l'll get this.

1151
01:36:32,502 --> 01:36:36,256
- l can't believe it.
- Joe, whas the matter?

1152
01:36:37,182 --> 01:36:40,811
- l'm having a heart attack.
- No, thas impossible, Mr Gideon.

1153
01:36:40,902 --> 01:36:43,097
l just gave you your medication.

1154
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:47,221
Goddamn it, he knows the symptoms.
Will you call somebody, please?

1155
01:36:47,622 --> 01:36:49,817
He can't be in pain.

1156
01:36:49,902 --> 01:36:51,893
Well, let me take his pulse.

1157
01:36:51,982 --> 01:36:54,780
- How can it be?
- Goddammit, get somebody.

1158
01:36:54,862 --> 01:36:59,652
But l just gave you your medication 20
minutes ago. You can't possibly be in pain.

1159
01:36:59,742 --> 01:37:02,302
<i>At least you're getting use</i>
<i>out of the equipment.</i>

1160
01:37:02,582 --> 01:37:07,497
Thas funny, Doctor. l gotta tell you,
it hurts like a son of a bitch.

1161
01:37:08,102 --> 01:37:10,457
Miss Briggs, two milligrams of morphine.

1162
01:37:11,102 --> 01:37:13,297
- Whas this?
- My name and address.

1163
01:37:13,382 --> 01:37:15,942
You can send my cheque there.

1164
01:37:17,262 --> 01:37:19,253
<i>Feeling any pain now?</i>

1165
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:20,377
Bitch!

1166
01:37:20,462 --> 01:37:23,135
No. But something is...

1167
01:37:23,902 --> 01:37:27,417
- something is breaking up in there.
- Now <i>that</i> l like.

1168
01:37:29,062 --> 01:37:31,622
Somethin's gone wrong.

1169
01:37:31,702 --> 01:37:34,136
<i>All wrong.</i>

1170
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:38,134
No... No...

1171
01:37:38,222 --> 01:37:41,419
Oh, my God... Where's Mr Gideon?

1172
01:37:41,502 --> 01:37:44,858
<i>Anger, denial, bargaining,</i>
<i>depression and acceptance.</i>

1173
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:48,821
<i>- Anger.</i>
- No. No. No!

1174
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:54,215
<i>Jesus Christ! Goddamn son-of-a-bitch,</i>
<i>pig-sucking bastards!</i>

1175
01:37:54,302 --> 01:37:56,213
Not now.

1176
01:37:56,302 --> 01:37:58,896
l don't know. We were busy
with an emergency

1177
01:37:58,982 --> 01:38:01,621
and the next thing l notice, he was gone.

1178
01:38:02,222 --> 01:38:05,134
<i>Denial. Denial.</i>

1179
01:38:06,502 --> 01:38:11,292
<i>"No. No, thas not me, man, no.</i>
<i>No. ls somebody else, maybe, but not me."</i>

1180
01:38:11,382 --> 01:38:14,692
<i>"Oh, no. You got the wrong...</i>
<i>How about my mother, man?"</i>

1181
01:38:14,782 --> 01:38:16,818
<i>"She's old. l'm weaned. l'm toilet-trained."</i>

1182
01:38:16,902 --> 01:38:22,295
<i>"l don't need her any more. Bye, Ma.</i>
<i>You've been terrific. l love ya! But not me."</i>

1183
01:38:23,822 --> 01:38:26,894
Oh, Jesus, don't take me out now.

1184
01:38:28,342 --> 01:38:32,938
Whas the matter?
Don't you like musical comedy?

1185
01:38:35,102 --> 01:38:37,980
<i>- Bargaining.</i>
<i>- Finished, or do you wanna run it again?</i>

1186
01:38:38,062 --> 01:38:40,701
Yes, l'd like to run it again.

1187
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:43,342
l'd like to run the whole thing again.

1188
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:47,902
<i>"Look, man. Come here, come here."</i>

1189
01:38:47,982 --> 01:38:50,655
<i>"Can we sit down and talk</i>
<i>about this like businessmen?"</i>

1190
01:38:50,742 --> 01:38:52,494
<i>"A negotiation, OK?"</i>

1191
01:38:52,582 --> 01:38:56,575
<i>"Look, l don't wanna haggle.</i>
<i>You'll find me a reasonable man, man."</i>

1192
01:38:56,662 --> 01:39:00,132
<i>"The blonde, the one on East 63rd Street</i>
<i>l see on Tuesday nights?"</i>

1193
01:39:00,222 --> 01:39:03,976
<i>"Gone. Finished. l'll never</i>

1194
01:39:04,062 --> 01:39:09,261
<i>"Right, no more hard drugs.</i>
<i>A little grass, maybe, but thas it. OK?"</i>

1195
01:39:09,342 --> 01:39:12,937
<i>"All right, look, man, l promise</i>

1196
01:39:13,022 --> 01:39:16,571
<i>"We got a deal, huh? Huh?</i>
<i>Guy drives a hard bargain."</i>

1197
01:39:18,102 --> 01:39:22,459
What are you staring at? l told you guys
before: too much smoking,

1198
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:27,900
too much boozing, too much
screwing around, ill get you every time.

1199
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:31,854
l'll be back.

1200
01:39:31,942 --> 01:39:36,094
Well, goddammit, find him.
l want him back in lCU, and right now!

1201
01:39:36,902 --> 01:39:39,018
- Damn fools.
<i>- Depression.</i>

1202
01:39:39,102 --> 01:39:43,175
And here he is, ladies and germs,
Tops'n'Taps,

1203
01:39:43,262 --> 01:39:47,096
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- tap-dancer <i>extraordinaire.</i>

1204
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:49,059
- lf l were God...
<i>- l'm dying!</i>

1205
01:39:49,142 --> 01:39:52,930
- And sometimes l think l am...
<i>- Oh, God, am l dying!</i>

1206
01:39:53,022 --> 01:39:57,891
- Depends on how much morphine l've had...
<i>- l'm dying. Nobody's dying but me.</i>

1207
01:39:57,982 --> 01:40:02,498
- l would spare this terrific tap-dancer!
<i>- The doctor's not dying.</i>

1208
01:40:02,582 --> 01:40:05,574
<i>He's alive in Florida, and l'm dying!</i>

1209
01:40:06,462 --> 01:40:10,137
No pennies on the eyes for me.

1210
01:40:11,982 --> 01:40:13,051
Please.

1211
01:40:13,142 --> 01:40:15,133
Right away, sir. Bye.

1212
01:40:18,982 --> 01:40:22,895
- Come on, we better try to find this guy.
<i>- "Oh, God!"</i>

1213
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:24,973
<i>"l'm dying!"</i>

1214
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:29,815
<i>"l'm paying $240 a day for the hospital room!"</i>

1215
01:40:30,982 --> 01:40:33,894
<i>"At those prices, man,</i>
<i>who can afford to live?"</i>

1216
01:40:34,822 --> 01:40:38,974
<i>So... acceptance.</i>

1217
01:40:41,782 --> 01:40:43,420
Oh, God...

1218
01:40:56,422 --> 01:41:00,620
l think you're the most
beautiful thing in the world.

1219
01:41:03,422 --> 01:41:05,413
l love you.

1220
01:41:45,342 --> 01:41:47,333
Just a cut on the head.

1221
01:41:47,862 --> 01:41:50,740
Oh, man, l won't have any trouble
at all keepin' him here.

1222
01:41:50,822 --> 01:41:54,053
He just wants to sit around
and sing old-time songs.

1223
01:41:54,142 --> 01:41:58,260
Oh, don't hurry, baby.
l'm havin' a pretty good time myself.

1224
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:02,897
- Now, Mr Gideon, where were we?
- How do you know my name?

1225
01:42:02,982 --> 01:42:06,531
Just found out. They're comin'
to get you, you know?

1226
01:42:06,622 --> 01:42:08,613
l knew they would.

1227
01:42:08,742 --> 01:42:11,461
- Can l have another?
- Oh, help yourself.

1228
01:42:14,302 --> 01:42:17,453
Could you do it one more time? Just for me?

1229
01:42:18,022 --> 01:42:20,217
Oh, yeah, l'd love to.

1230
01:42:20,902 --> 01:42:23,052
Five, six, seven, eight.

1231
01:42:23,142 --> 01:42:26,851
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag

1232
01:42:26,942 --> 01:42:30,014
And smile, smile, smile

1233
01:42:30,902 --> 01:42:35,339
Hey, pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

1234
01:42:35,422 --> 01:42:38,095
Smile, boys, thas the style

1235
01:42:38,182 --> 01:42:39,297
Here we go.

1236
01:42:39,382 --> 01:42:42,852
Whas the use of worrying?

1237
01:42:42,942 --> 01:42:46,491
lt never was worthwhile

1238
01:42:48,942 --> 01:42:50,933
Juicy!

1239
01:42:51,982 --> 01:42:55,133
So, pack up your troubles...

1240
01:43:09,822 --> 01:43:13,576
- You got it.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1241
01:43:13,662 --> 01:43:17,257
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag

1242
01:43:17,342 --> 01:43:20,334
And smile, smile, smile

1243
01:43:20,422 --> 01:43:22,777
OK, mister, you come along with us.

1244
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:25,615
Nice and quiet, now. Don't cause no trouble.

1245
01:43:25,702 --> 01:43:30,014
- Everything's going to be fine, all right?
- All right. So long, Tiger.

1246
01:43:30,102 --> 01:43:32,093
Later, Gideon.

1247
01:43:32,182 --> 01:43:34,821
This is just a rough cut, you know?

1248
01:43:34,902 --> 01:43:39,180
l don't have the titles in yet,
and the underscoring's not in.

1249
01:43:39,982 --> 01:43:42,337
ls not really finished.

1250
01:43:42,422 --> 01:43:44,333
l need more time.

1251
01:44:33,142 --> 01:44:36,532
<i>Thank you. Wonderful, wonderful.</i>

1252
01:44:36,622 --> 01:44:40,092
<i>Folks, what can l tell you</i>
<i>about my next guest?</i>

1253
01:44:40,182 --> 01:44:44,460
<i>This cat allowed himseIf</i>
<i>to be adored, but not loved.</i>

1254
01:44:44,542 --> 01:44:47,534
<i>And his success in show business</i>
<i>was matched by failure</i>

1255
01:44:47,622 --> 01:44:51,410
<i>in his personal-relationship bag.</i>
<i>Now thas where he really bombed.</i>

1256
01:44:51,502 --> 01:44:55,893
And he came to believe that work,
show business, love, his whole life,

1257
01:44:55,982 --> 01:44:58,894
even himself, and all thatjazz, was bullshit.

1258
01:44:59,022 --> 01:45:01,252
He became <i>numero uno</i> game player,

1259
01:45:01,342 --> 01:45:06,735
to the point where he didn't know
where the games ended and reality began.

1260
01:45:06,822 --> 01:45:10,974
Like, to this cat, the only reality...
is death, man.

1261
01:45:11,662 --> 01:45:15,257
Ladies and gentlemen, let me lay
on you a so-so entertainer,

1262
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:19,415
not much of a humanitarian,
and this cat was never nobody's friend.

1263
01:45:19,502 --> 01:45:23,654
ln his final appearance on the great stage
of life - you can applaud if you wanna -

1264
01:45:23,742 --> 01:45:25,812
Mr Joe Gideon.
