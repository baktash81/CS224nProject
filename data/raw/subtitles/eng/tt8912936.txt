1
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,488
We must hurry.

2
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:29,557
The planet won't survive
much longer.

3
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,391
Are you sure about this?

4
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,226
I'm afraid it's the only way.

5
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,638
Krypton is about to die.

6
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:50,743
But you, dear son, will live on.

7
00:01:58,282 --> 00:01:59,751
Krypto, no!

8
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:15,665
Oh! Krypto!

9
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,137
No.

10
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,574
Our boy will need a friend.

11
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,273
Watch over our son.

12
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,879
All right, wake up, buddy.
It is walk-o'clock.

13
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,517
Maybe I should let him sleep?

14
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,952
Okay, I let him sleep.

15
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:00,923
All right.

16
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:12,633
This is unpleasant
for both of us.

17
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,802
No. No, no. No, no.

18
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:20,340
Hmm.

19
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,914
Five more...
Five more minutes.

20
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,650
And I'm up.

21
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,419
Okay, Krypto.

22
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:36,187
We'll go for a walk.

23
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:47,396
Whoa!

24
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,359
Huh?

25
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,372
Mister Mxyzptlk
has finally been defeated.

26
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,642
Turns out, he just needed
to say his name backwards.

27
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,544
From Metropolis, I'm Lois Lane.

28
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,577
Hey, Lois.

29
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,449
I know you like these,

30
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,050
so I got you one
from actual Paris.

31
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,987
I don't know
why I said it like that.

32
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,089
And I got you one of these
from 43rd Street.

33
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:34,858
Which is, like, a full
three blocks out of my way.

34
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:36,059
During rush hour?

35
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,961
Wow, that's like
me flying to Mars.

36
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,730
What? You can fly?

37
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:42,098
I always thought the cape
was just a cute accessory.

38
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,367
Oh! So you think I'm cute.

39
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,103
I said the cape was cute.

40
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,037
You think I'm cute.

41
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,741
Are we lickin' faces right now?

42
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,814
Because if we're lickin' faces,
I gotta get in on...

43
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,979
Oh, what do I have here?

44
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,482
Squeezy Bruce!

45
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,583
Fetch!

46
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,451
Pup, up and away!

47
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,121
Okay, where were we?

48
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,657
Squeezy Bruce retrieved.

49
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,357
Hey, those guys look fun.

50
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,671
How about you go play with them?

51
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,830
So I'm eating my own vomit,
and then the...

52
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:19,932
So, I'm eating my own...

53
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:21,899
So I'm...

54
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:22,933
I'm...

55
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:27,004
I see you've retreated
to your Batcave,

56
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,006
but nobody can hide from
the long snoot of justice.

57
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,945
Hmm.

58
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:36,155
And then I says,
"If you don't want me

59
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,447
rubbing my butt in the carpet,

60
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,747
get hardwood floors."

61
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,593
Squeezy Bruce
has been retrieved.

62
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,384
Wait, do you know who this is?

63
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,621
It's Krypto the Super dog.

64
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,856
Okay.
You can have my pawtograph.

65
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,862
Listen, I'm afraid
I gotta keep it to just one,

66
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,430
or I'll be signing all day.

67
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:57,664
Now, if you'll excuse me,

68
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,967
I gotta get this back to my boy.

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,401
- He doesn't want it.
- I'm sorry, what?

70
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:04,003
Mr. Outside-Underpants.

71
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,471
He doesn't want the toy.

72
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:06,939
He's trying to get rid of ya.

73
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,075
What? That's ridiculous.

74
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,476
Superman and I are inseparable.

75
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,011
I'm his ride or die.

76
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,479
Oh, yeah?

77
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,181
Where you, uh,
sleeping these days?

78
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,583
I sleep in bed with Supes.

79
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:20,784
Except when Lois stays over,
then I have to move to my

80
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,820
extra special spot on the floor.

81
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:25,589
Brutal.

82
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,423
Same thing happened to me.

83
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,993
Nancy got a fiancee
and it was all over.

84
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,428
That's French
for "Bye-bye, dog."

85
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,764
Yeah, well, you don't
get Supes like I get Supes.

86
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,531
I mean, sure, the guy dates,

87
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,700
but he will never love anyone
except for...

88
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:43,404
I love you.

89
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:13,464
Um, are you okay?

90
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,566
Me? Yes, I'm... I'm fine.

91
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,670
I am fine. I'm totally...

92
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,072
Fine?

93
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,707
All right, good talk.
Pound it out.

94
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:35,850
This might sound crazy,
but now that we're together,

95
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:38,954
I think Krypto feels left out?

96
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:46,493
Yeah. I guess I'm, kind of,
his only friend.

97
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:48,796
That's sweet.

98
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,031
But maybe he'd be happier
if he had a new friend, too.

99
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:01,673
Good morning, friends.

100
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,977
So it begins.

101
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,646
Like clockwork, Carl will try
to flirt with Patty.

102
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,281
Ooh! Is that new perfume?

103
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,549
It's cat pee.

104
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,117
And have zero game.

105
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,652
Giving this handsome canine
just enough time to...

106
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,953
What you doin', Ace?

107
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,521
I'm bustin' loose, PB.

108
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,090
Sick of this
whole cage situation.

109
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,558
Oh, my goddess.

110
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:22,734
This is just
like when Wonder Woman

111
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,059
used her Bracelets of Submission

112
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,228
to escape Doctor Poison's
secret hideout.

113
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,863
Like... this!

114
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,265
Okay. Not exactly like this.

115
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,801
What if the rescue lady
catches you?

116
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,703
And locks you in the back room?

117
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,238
Where they only listen
to smooth jazz.

118
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:42,142
Relax, Chip. I got my girl,
Merton, running lookout.

119
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,045
These peepers
don't miss a thing.

120
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,980
If the rescue lady's coming,
you'll know it.

121
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,318
Perfect. Because I almost
got myself out of the...

122
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,819
Nope.

123
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,121
I think
the rescue lady's coming!

124
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,589
Thanks, Merton.

125
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,724
That's a...
that's a good catch.

126
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,892
I'm rooting for you, Ace.

127
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,727
But don't you wanna get adopted

128
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,194
and feel the warm embrace

129
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,563
of a middle-aged person
who lives alone?

130
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,766
Yeah. Who will be
your new best friend.

131
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,134
You're my best friends, dummies.

132
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:14,037
And you're all coming
with me to the farm.

133
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,973
I love when he talks
about the farm!

134
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:18,941
The farm upstate.

135
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:22,077
An untamed paradise
where animals run free

136
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,246
and they love and protect
one another.

137
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,648
And the lettuce grows on trees.

138
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,251
No shelter lady
watching our every move. Nope.

139
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,654
It's a 100% animal farm.

140
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,256
That doesn't sound
ominous at all.

141
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,823
It's perfect.

142
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,258
And when I get us
all outta here,

143
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,026
well, that's where
we're gonna go.

144
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,195
The dog is right.

145
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:44,663
He should seek his freedom.

146
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,265
You see that? Lulu gets it.

147
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:47,966
And he must destroy

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,936
all who stand in his way!

149
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:53,304
Wow. Well,
that just took a turn.

150
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,074
You may kid yourself
with your silly farm,

151
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:59,877
but I have the device!

152
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:03,013
For, one day soon,
when the stars align,

153
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:06,183
the device will bring me
ultimate power

154
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,326
and I will be more than free!

155
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,752
"Will be more than free!"

156
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,220
Exactly.

157
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,089
Lulu, whatever they tested
on you in that lab,

158
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,124
left you a few
guineas short of a pig.

159
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:18,126
That device
is just a pile of garbage.

160
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,894
You fear my brilliance.

161
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,096
Recede into shadows.

162
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,263
Recede into shadows.

163
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:23,665
Maintain eye contact.

164
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:26,033
Recede into shadows.

165
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,234
All right, boy,

166
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,203
I'll be right back
with a surprise.

167
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:31,004
And I will remain here,

168
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,773
posing under my secret identity.

169
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,377
Bark Kent.

170
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:41,013
So, what is new with you,
fellow normal dog?

171
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:46,151
Uh, I bit the FedEx guy
the other day.

172
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,719
Ah, fine job.

173
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:48,954
Who was he working for?

174
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:50,888
General Zod?
The Legion of Doom?

175
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,124
FedEx.

176
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:55,893
Of course!
The federation of exes.

177
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:57,727
Not to be trusted.

178
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,903
What is taking my owner so long?

179
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,739
So, Mr. Kent, you're looking
for another pet, huh?

180
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,841
Well, my dog's the best.

181
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,410
But I've got this girlfriend.

182
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,079
And I'm gonna ask her
to marry me tonight.

183
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,881
Aw!

184
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,716
- Congratulations.
- Thanks!

185
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,284
But he doesn't know that yet,

186
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,287
and I just think maybe
he needs a friend of his own.

187
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,723
Well, then I think Ace here
would be the perfect...

188
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,343
How do you feel
about guinea pigs?

189
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,438
I'll come back for
all of you guys after closing.

190
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:36,762
Stay strong.

191
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:39,831
There we go.

192
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,344
Oh, man, that hurt.

193
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,913
Yes. And that hurt me as well.

194
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:58,881
Due to the fact that I feel pain

195
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:01,017
as any ordinary canine would.

196
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,722
Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm kind of
in the middle of a prison break,

197
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:08,890
so could you please...?

198
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:09,958
Prison break?

199
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:14,028
Stop right there and cease
your unlawful activities,

200
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,363
dog I've never met.

201
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,131
The heck are you
talking about, man?

202
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,400
You the same dog

203
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,866
that was literally
just behind me.

204
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,835
Impossible.
That dog wore glasses.

205
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:25,038
Now surrender,
I don't want to hurt you.

206
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,806
Oh, okay,
so you wanna take it there.

207
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,240
You wanna throw paws, then fine.

208
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,075
But I should warn you,
I'm one-eighth Boxer.

209
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:32,911
And seven-eighths Chihuahua.

210
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,246
Chihuahuas are vicious.

211
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,914
Take that.
Take a little bit of this.

212
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,782
Tap out, and I'll let you out.

213
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:38,783
Here come the thunder!

214
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,485
You're gonna get it! Ahhh!

215
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,854
Oh, man. I'm getting a stitch.
Yeah, I gotta take a knee.

216
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,097
Oh, if I didn't get this stitch,

217
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:46,957
I had you where I wanted you.

218
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,292
Banana! Get me...
Get me a banana! Hurry up!

219
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:52,928
That's cold, man.

220
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,198
Aw! Aren't you
a little ray of sunshine?

221
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,202
What?

222
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,874
Oh, Krypto.

223
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,243
Oh, you think you're so great,
don't you, Super dog?

224
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,877
You think your dookie
don't stink.

225
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,413
My dookie doesn't stink.

226
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,482
Wait, wait, time out.
Are you serious, right now?

227
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:17,017
Yep, it actually
smells like sandalwood.

228
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,185
It's borderline aromatherapy,
if I'm being honest.

229
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,556
Whoa! Whoa!

230
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,023
You ain't normal, man.

231
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,957
Yeah, well,
at least I have an owner.

232
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,893
You can't own me.
I'm a wild animal.

233
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,129
Exactly. So, let's get you
back in the cage.

234
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,064
Supes is probably missing me.

235
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,298
Missing?

236
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,133
The dude tied you up
to the stop sign

237
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,336
and went into that shelter
to buy you a new friend

238
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,037
so that you'd give him
some space.

239
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,005
Gotcha.

240
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:43,574
Superman would never do that.

241
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,042
Well, it's literally
happening right now.

242
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,811
I'm just glad
that that new friend ain't me.

243
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,178
Easy, Carl.

244
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,932
Stop acting like
you don't know me.

245
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:55,585
Nice try, Houdini.

246
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,187
Well, you did say
you'd come back for us.

247
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,260
Ooh, adoption time.

248
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,462
One of us is gonna get someone
to snuggle with.

249
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,263
Yeah, don't get your hopes up.

250
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,297
They always pick the...

251
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,800
Here you go, baby.

252
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:15,901
Wow! First day.

253
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,138
Being a rescue animal
is easy and fun!

254
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,911
Hey. You'll get 'em next time.

255
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,947
Yeah. Next time.

256
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,087
I can't believe
that shelter punk

257
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,255
said I wasn't normal.

258
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,256
I'm a totally normal dog.

259
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,227
And no way Superman was in there

260
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,129
looking for a friend for me.

261
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,237
Hmm.

262
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:05,512
What's that?

263
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:16,356
Someone is dragging
a meteor toward the city?

264
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,294
Luthor.

265
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,067
Hello, gorgeous.

266
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:36,239
Oh, how I have longed for you
to enter my solar system.

267
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,607
It's a rock.

268
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,210
That rock, Mercy,
is 100% orange kryptonite.

269
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,546
Cool.
Another kryptonite scheme.

270
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,146
No, this is different!

271
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,549
Green kryptonite
takes away Superman's powers,

272
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,117
but orange kryptonite

273
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,595
Will give me superpowers.

274
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,954
You know, like, uh, invisibility

275
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:55,088
or, uh, laser-eyes,

276
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:58,258
or throwing playing cards
really hard.

277
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,595
I'm finally gonna be stronger
than that stupid...

278
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,962
You're not talking about me,
are you?

279
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,298
Yeah, I think he was talking
about me, too.

280
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,367
That's awkward.

281
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:08,668
Superman.

282
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:11,169
I'd expected you
and that mutt of yours

283
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,705
much sooner.

284
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,173
I'm gonna need you to
let go of that meteor, Lex.

285
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,274
Gladly.

286
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,683
Krypto, fetch!

287
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,096
That dog's a hero!

288
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,331
Krypto!

289
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,031
Good dog.

290
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,701
Let's put this thing back
in space where it belongs.

291
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,537
Ma'am. Baby.

292
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:00,078
Let's see
if you can catch it now.

293
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,350
Ah!

294
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:11,356
You forgot one thing, Lex.

295
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,025
Unlike you, I have friends.

296
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,469
Thanks for building

297
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,128
your stupid evil headquarters
on the river.

298
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,230
Very convenient
for the water guy.

299
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,099
I'm Aquaman!

300
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,435
Oh, great. These jabronies.

301
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:27,704
Uh, did somebody
call tech support?

302
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,272
Have you tried turning it
off and on again?

303
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,612
Thanks, buddy.

304
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,180
Buddy? No, these people
are work friends at best.

305
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,617
Please fasten your safety belts.

306
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,184
They are invisible.

307
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,020
Yeah, none of this stuff
is invisible.

308
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,456
It's really more transparent.

309
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:55,662
Hmm?

310
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,229
I like your laser thing.

311
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,698
But it looks better in green.

312
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,368
Yeah.

313
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,169
<i>LexCorp power suit engaged.</i>

314
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,171
<i>Seat warmer activated.</i>

315
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,341
Best billion I ever spent.

316
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:21,551
All I need is one little piece.

317
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,592
Aw, bless your little heart.

318
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,386
Did you think you
were gonna get to it first?

319
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:39,800
Thank you.

320
00:20:57,316 --> 00:21:00,719
I am what I was always
meant to become.

321
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:06,824
Huh? What is this?

322
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,561
But I'm supposed
to have superpowers!

323
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,162
They're overrated.

324
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:21,470
Good boy, Krypto.

325
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,349
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

326
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,608
Are you my super dog go?
Are you?

327
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,843
Oh! In the tongue.

328
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,879
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

329
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,847
I miss my parents.

330
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,081
Who threw that
kryptonite back into space?

331
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,637
Hello, gorgeous.

332
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,273
Oh, how I've longed for you
to enter my solar system.

333
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,692
You win this round, lettuce.

334
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,599
Guys, what's going on?

335
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,602
Nothing, PB.

336
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:37,236
Just the plan
that you all called crazy

337
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,739
turns out to be crazy good.

338
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:42,341
You see,
when I was back in the lab,

339
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,275
there was this human.

340
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,279
<i>He was evil, sadistic, hot.</i>

341
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,682
<i>And together
we were two scientists</i>

342
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:52,450
<i>searching for ultimate power.</i>

343
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,819
<i>Of course, there were missteps
along the way.</i>

344
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,655
<i>The red kryptonite
made my hair fall out.</i>

345
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:59,723
<i>Luckily, I had the bone
structure to pull it off.</i>

346
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:02,526
<i>Purple gave me
uncomfortably vivid dreams.</i>

347
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:05,795
<i>But the orange...</i>

348
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:08,364
<i>we knew the orange
would be different.</i>

349
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,232
<i>And we had a plan.</i>

350
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,435
<i>Until Krypto the Super dog
had to come and ruin it.</i>

351
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,696
<i>Stupid name. Named after
his planet. Oh, real creative.</i>

352
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,676
Thanks, Krypto!

353
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:21,918
I'm coming home, son!

354
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,244
Huh? What the heck
are you doing?

355
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,747
I'm freeing you from this
horrible animal testing lab.

356
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,483
No! This is my home!

357
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,518
And now this is your new home.

358
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,295
- You're welcome.
- What are you talking about?

359
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,588
Oh, you're the sweetest!

360
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,790
Unhand me, wench!

361
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,630
<i>So I bided my time
in this disturbing hovel,</i>

362
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:48,399
<i>preparing.</i>

363
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:52,003
<i>Because I'd figured out
something that even Lex couldn't.</i>

364
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:54,805
<i>Orange kryptonite
doesn't work on people.</i>

365
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,675
It only works on pets.

366
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:12,654
Uh, Lulu, are you okay?

367
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,390
Oh, I'm more than okay, pig.

368
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:18,727
I am what I was always
meant to become.

369
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,668
Lulu, hey. What?
Take us with you, okay?

370
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,503
Us shelter animals, you know,

371
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,372
we... we gotta stick
together, right? Solidarity.

372
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,340
Oh, Ace, I'm sorry.

373
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,743
I don't really have time
in my life right now

374
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,611
to take care of a pet!

375
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:49,019
Lulu, wait!

376
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,554
Do not leave us here!

377
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:52,922
Don't worry,
I'm sure someone wonderful

378
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:55,625
will adopt you any day.

379
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,360
What about me?

380
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:58,695
Oh, Whiskers.

381
00:24:58,728 --> 00:24:59,962
Of course. I'm not a monster.

382
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:04,900
Miss you. Love you. Have fun.

383
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,839
Hold on, PB. I'mma get us out.

384
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:14,776
I smell bacon!

385
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,576
Why is my mouth watering?

386
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,612
There's so much to unpack here.

387
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,681
Guys, I'm small!

388
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:24,517
What just happened?

389
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,486
No, seriously, what just
happened? I can't see.

390
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,989
The orange kryptonite
gave me powers, too.

391
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:32,625
This is my origin story.

392
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,793
And my uncle
didn't even have to die.

393
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,561
Uh, yeah, that's great.

394
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:39,964
But it ain't lookin' too good
for your old pal Ace.

395
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,666
Right. Wonder Pig,
still working on the name,

396
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:43,967
is on it.

397
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,038
Uh-oh.

398
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:53,576
- Ace, no!
- Ace!

399
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,553
I should be a lot more dead
right now, right?

400
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:06,987
Oh, my gosh.

401
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:09,056
The orange kryptonite
gave you powers, too!

402
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,724
You're super strong!

403
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:14,127
And your tail
is now made of fire.

404
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,995
I'm sorry. My what is who?

405
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:19,909
My tail! Ah, let go of my...

406
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,568
Oh, my tail... My tail on fire!

407
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:22,701
I got my tail on fire!

408
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,503
Ace, it's fine. See?

409
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:27,039
Huh?

410
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,740
You're invulnerable.

411
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,694
And I can shrink myself down
to the size of an...

412
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:36,113
Ah!

413
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,515
Still working out the kinks.
I didn't see anything.

414
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,118
You go get Chip, I'll get Mert.

415
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,096
In your face, lettuce.

416
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:07,441
Oh, great.

417
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,810
I'm the only one
who didn't get any super...

418
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:20,752
<i>Metropolis 97.2...</i>

419
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:22,921
<i>...smooth jazz.</i>

420
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,992
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Right.

421
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,427
Update.

422
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:33,063
I'm fast now, but I still
can't see.

423
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,970
Uh-uh. Here we go.

424
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:48,510
All right.
Thursday night TV night.

425
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:52,047
Time for my favorite show
with my bro in Metropo. Huh?

426
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,685
Huh? What the...?

427
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,654
Let me just iron that out.

428
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:03,924
They should call me
Iron Man. No.

429
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:05,625
Well, look at you, all spiffy.

430
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,527
Pretty dressed up
for the <i>British Bake Off.</i>

431
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,028
But you know what?
It makes sense.

432
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,981
This is the season finale.

433
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,900
You have a date?

434
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,536
On <i>Bake Off</i> night?

435
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,708
Aw! Hey there, little fella.

436
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:34,251
Nah.

437
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,687
Hey, Lois. Oh!

438
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:43,591
Oh. Listen, buddy, I...

439
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,494
It is pie week.

440
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,530
Your choice. Her or me.

441
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,198
What's gotten into you?

442
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,700
Bad dog.

443
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,669
What did you just call me?

444
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:58,071
That is way out of line, fella.
I mean, if you want...

445
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,584
We'll talk about this
when I get home.

446
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,478
I've missed you so much!

447
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,582
You left Squeezy Bruce
in the hallway again.

448
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,985
Fine.

449
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,753
I'll watch
the crusts crisp alone.

450
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,989
Bad owner!

451
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,270
<i>It's quite wet
right underneath as well.</i>

452
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,861
<i>Slightly soggy bottom there.</i>

453
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,771
Huh?

454
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,241
Kal-El, son of Jor-El,
I am Lulu,

455
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:41,109
daughter of Cinnamon,

456
00:29:41,142 --> 00:29:43,778
and you will kneel before me.

457
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:50,884
Wait a minute.

458
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,652
Aren't you the hamster
from the shelter?

459
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:56,055
I am a guinea pig,
and I said kneel!

460
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:04,662
Well, lookie-lookie what I got
from the old lab.

461
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,564
Help, Krypto...

462
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:17,308
You really should have made it
harder to find you.

463
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:19,576
Those glasses
aren't fooling anyone.

464
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,044
Moustache maybe,
but not glasses.

465
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:22,111
Whoa!

466
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,949
Why does this always happen
on date night?

467
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:29,294
<i>You've reached
the Justice League emergency line.</i>

468
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:30,986
<i>For Earth-One, press one.</i>

469
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:32,321
<i>For Earth-Two, press two.</i>

470
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,755
<i>For Earth-Three...</i>

471
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,857
Oh, man,
that looked like it hurt.

472
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,158
I hope it did.

473
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,068
Wow, look at you still trying.

474
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:49,769
Plucky.

475
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:52,605
Fine, then.
Mama likes a good fight.

476
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,981
<i>You always bake for a reason.</i>

477
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:05,850
<i>So, you make it
the best you can.</i>

478
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:07,252
<i>And you make it with love.</i>

479
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,074
Surrender.
I don't wanna hurt you.

480
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,141
No, no, no.

481
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,314
A little advice.

482
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,682
Never test a guinea pig. Okay?

483
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,825
I can't believe
he really left with her.

484
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:55,703
They're probably out there
playing fetch together

485
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:56,895
as I speak.

486
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,297
Ooh, he left me cheese!

487
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:03,100
Ah, I can't stay mad at the guy.

488
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:07,203
<i>Help.</i>

489
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,341
<i>Help.</i>

490
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:12,108
Superman?

491
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,987
Pup, up, and away!

492
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,166
What have you done to him?

493
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,837
I see someone
found his medicine.

494
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,039
A tiny shard of green kryptonite

495
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:50,376
cleverly concealed
in a hunk of Jarlsberg.

496
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:53,412
They always put it
in the cheese.

497
00:32:57,814 --> 00:32:59,317
You took me away from Lex,

498
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,320
so now I'm taking
Superman away from you.

499
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:05,988
Oh, uh, don't worry,

500
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:07,990
this is only step one
of my evil plan.

501
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:09,192
There's more.

502
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:10,227
No.

503
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:15,764
Must protect Super...

504
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:34,948
Superman!

505
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:36,025
I have to find...

506
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,790
Huh?

507
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,127
Father.

508
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,531
<i>Yes, it is I, Dog-El.</i>

509
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,266
<i>When you were just a puppy,</i>

510
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,768
<i>I recorded all my knowledge
in your collar.</i>

511
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,272
I know. You've always
helped me in the past,

512
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,905
and I could really use you now.

513
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:06,141
<i>Yes, it is I, Dog-El.</i>

514
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:08,211
We really need
a skip-intro button.

515
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:12,281
<i>Talk to me, my son.
What seems to be the problem?</i>

516
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,816
Superman.
He's been captured.

517
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,386
<i>Hmm.</i>

518
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:21,222
<i>I'm sorry.
I know how close you are.</i>

519
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:24,225
Yeah, I mean, we were.

520
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:27,059
<i>Well, you just can't sit there
feeling sad.</i>

521
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,095
<i>You have to go rescue him.</i>

522
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:30,364
You're right.

523
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:32,266
I'll save Superman,
and when I do,

524
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:35,066
he'll realize that I'm the
only friend he ever needs.

525
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,303
<i>Uh... That's not
exactly what I...</i>

526
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:39,070
But how am I
supposed to be a hero

527
00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:40,939
when I don't have my powers?

528
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:44,108
<i>It's not superpowers
that make you a hero, Krypto.</i>

529
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,876
<i>That's not your problem.</i>

530
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,545
Then what is it?

531
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,581
<i>- Your problem is you.
- You...</i>

532
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:52,249
Me? What do you mean, me?
Father?

533
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:58,589
A-ha!

534
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:01,056
That must be the vile rodent.

535
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:02,292
Don't worry, Superman,

536
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:04,092
I won't rest until I rescue you.

537
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,864
This is very restful.

538
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:11,098
Yes.

539
00:35:16,404 --> 00:35:17,871
Whoops.

540
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:19,573
We're gonna
have to work on that.

541
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:22,876
I never knew the stars
could be this beautiful,

542
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:24,377
and there's so many of them.

543
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,413
Look, there's one.
Oh, there's another one.

544
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:28,180
Look, there's one, too.

545
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:32,083
Eh! These stars are crap.
Wait till we get to the farm.

546
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:35,987
Yeah. Everything's
better at the farm.

547
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,089
Oh! Oh, yeah.

548
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:39,625
Um, yeah, about...
about the farm.

549
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:41,091
See, understand this.

550
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,093
There's always
a literal interpretation

551
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,395
and then... and then a more...

552
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:46,997
Where is she?
Where...?

553
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,333
Where...?

554
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,435
Okay. Where... Where is she?

555
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,905
Okay. Where is she?

556
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:57,239
Ugh.

557
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,074
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

558
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:02,611
I've, uh, I've never
really run before.

559
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,313
I... I usually
"Pup, up, and away."

560
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:07,981
Are you okay?

561
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,551
I'm fine, I'm fine.

562
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,487
I was just, uh,
hit by a car a little.

563
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,888
You never forget
your first time.

564
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:21,361
Wait a minute,
where do I know you from?

565
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:22,628
I can't put my paw on it.

566
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,263
Where is she?

567
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:32,002
Whoa. So, the powers
I saw were yours?

568
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,904
You hooligans can help me.

569
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,542
Hurry, there isn't much time.
We have to save Superman.

570
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:39,943
Superman?

571
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,947
Oh, of course!
You're that super dork

572
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,548
who got me
thrown back in the slammer.

573
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:48,251
What was it? Creepo? Crisco?
What's your name?

574
00:36:48,284 --> 00:36:51,287
No. It's Krypto the Super dog!

575
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,689
Oh!

576
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:54,356
Well, it looks like
we're both super now.

577
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,090
You know,
I still owe you a whuppin'.

578
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:57,925
- Hi-yah!
- Ow!

579
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,395
That was my good eye.

580
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,430
Now, wait. It was supposed
to be a fair fight.

581
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,207
Why didn't you block me
with some freeze heat

582
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:04,675
that was coming out your ears
or something?

583
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,501
Because, I... I...

584
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:09,002
I don't have my powers.

585
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:10,637
What?

586
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,540
I said I don't
have my powers anymore.

587
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:16,041
Did ya...?

588
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,310
You don't have your powers?

589
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,578
Yeah, that's what's going on.

590
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,146
You're just trying
to use us now,

591
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,114
because you can't handle it
on your own.

592
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:25,217
Look, I know these powers
are new to you,

593
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:28,051
but when one has an abundance
of power...

594
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,155
...they have a certain duty
to use that power to...

595
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,694
Sorry. You were
sayin' somethin'?

596
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:43,165
I was making
an inspiring hero speech.

597
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,105
How much did you have to drink?

598
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,441
I had two toilet bowls
and a bidet.

599
00:37:52,474 --> 00:37:53,984
A bidet, too, which is,
which is crazy.

600
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,286
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

601
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,745
But it's like
a dog water fountain.

602
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:59,113
You disgusting animal.

603
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,548
Pack, let's roll out.

604
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,982
I'll see you never, Narc Kent.

605
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,084
No! My best friend
is in danger,

606
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,620
and you have to help me.

607
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,521
Sorry, we got other plans.

608
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:12,090
Good luck with your danger.
We're going to the farm.

609
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:15,595
Oh, yeah! Lettuce trees, baby!

610
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:18,263
"Lettuce trees"?
What's this farm called?

611
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,631
The farm upstate.

612
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,267
That sounds made-up.

613
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,134
Oh, yeah?
Well, how would you know?

614
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,238
I grew up on a farm.
In a town called Smallville.

615
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,407
Now that sounds made-up.

616
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,075
So, which way
is this so-called farm?

617
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:34,611
Well, it's upstate.

618
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,380
So, that... that means
it's... it's up, obviously.

619
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:39,249
Okay. He's not
telling you the...

620
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,616
Can I steal you for a sec?

621
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:44,720
You lied about the farm,
didn't you?

622
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:47,623
Big time. Look, I had
to give them some hope.

623
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,733
- There's one there.
- No one was ever gonna adopt us.

624
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,426
There's one, too.

625
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,161
So, I promised them
it would be their new home.

626
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:59,733
You know, I'd be happy to take
you and your friends to my farm.

627
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:04,571
If you help me save Superman.

628
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:07,273
Wait a minute. Is this blackmail?
Are you blackmailing me?

629
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,342
No. I'm just asking you
for something,

630
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,645
which I will reward you for by not
revealing damaging information.

631
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:15,780
That is literally
the definition of blackmail.

632
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:19,116
Fine. We'll help you
get your dumb owner back.

633
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,319
You got yourself a super team.

634
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,154
Did someone just say super team?

635
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:28,124
Yay.
My destiny awaits.

636
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,428
Terrifying villains,

637
00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:34,364
deadly assassins,

638
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:36,666
I have come to recruit you

639
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:40,235
for a siege
of murderous savagery!

640
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:45,607
My fellow, furrier, guinea pigs.

641
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:48,843
I have sought you out
because you are apex predators.

642
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,745
Gods amongst men!

643
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:58,585
Okay, look. Pig to pig,
I need your help

644
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:00,554
because my owner
has gotten himself

645
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:03,255
into a bit of a pickle.

646
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,733
<i>Thwarted by the Justice League,</i>

647
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:07,560
<i>Lex Luthor now
finds himself behind bars.</i>

648
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:09,562
<i>I'll destroy you all!</i>

649
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,128
That's my best friend.

650
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:12,664
And mentor.
Best friend and mentor.

651
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:19,312
<i>Built to house
fearsome super powered criminals,</i>

652
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,580
<i>Stryker's Island

653
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,272
<i>inescapable prison.</i>

654
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,575
Which is where
you dorks come in.

655
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:27,410
You see, if I'm gonna get Lex
outta that dump,

656
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:29,110
I'm gonna need an army.

657
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:36,151
Um, actually, I think
we'd just rather stay here.

658
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,552
Yeah, I mean,
we get summers off,

659
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:38,820
all-you-can-drink water.

660
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:46,460
We even have Spanish class
every <i>miercoles.</i>

661
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,796
Oh, you have nothing...
until you've licked

662
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:52,265
from the cold steel
straw of power.

663
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:03,408
Not so fast.

664
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:06,178
Lois Lane told us
all about you, hamster.

665
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:09,680
Hamster? A hamster is a...
is a hacky sack!

666
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:12,516
A hamster is a mouse
that had too much for lunch!

667
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,418
We are guinea pigs

668
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,653
and when we're through
with you, buster, you'll know it.

669
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:17,821
Hmm.

670
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,843
What's going on?
That was your cue to attack.

671
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,612
Uh... Oh, sorry. I... I was
waiting for him to go first.

672
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,757
Yeah, but if I went first,
your fire would melt my ice,

673
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:50,216
so maybe the... the wing lady
should go first?

674
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:51,417
I have a name.

675
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,452
But then I'd set
her wings on fire,

676
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:54,930
and I don't think
any of us want that.

677
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:57,256
Well, you don't want
ice on wings.

678
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,766
- Why?
- They... It clogs the feathers.

679
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,425
Just get him!

680
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:13,771
Whoo! That was fun.

681
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:16,506
Now then, let's go free Lex.

682
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,375
Huh?

683
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,781
This ends now, sister.

684
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:28,417
I have you in my Lasso of Truth.

685
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,351
Oh, you want the truth?

686
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,919
The boots are a bit much.

687
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:46,499
Is this really the best way
to find Superman?

688
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,434
Because to me,
this just seems gross.

689
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,302
What do you mean, gross?

690
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,980
Smelling stuff is one of the
greatest joys of being a dog.

691
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,772
Next to licking
any part of your body.

692
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,606
I mean, I lick myself
all the time.

693
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,475
Well, that explains the breath.

694
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,844
You wanna find Lulu and
rescue Captain Hair Gel, right?

695
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,779
Well, I suggest
you start sniffing.

696
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:02,980
You know what they say,

697
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,549
smell is the sight of the nose.

698
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:06,817
No one says that.

699
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,285
Well, they should. Check it.

700
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,287
Uh-huh.

701
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,655
A poodle drooled right here.

702
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:15,033
Someone threw a perfectly good
pizza crust in that dumpster right there.

703
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:17,593
And on that corner...

704
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:19,828
That corner
right there... Oh, no. Dang.

705
00:43:19,861 --> 00:43:22,263
A pigeon got her heart broken.
I can still smell the hurt.

706
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:23,965
She was a heavy crier.

707
00:43:23,998 --> 00:43:26,568
It's a superpower
that every dog possesses.

708
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:27,968
Even a wack one like you.

709
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,037
I'm not wack.

710
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,705
Oh!

711
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:36,909
Ooh, is that a band-aid?

712
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,857
- It's walk-o'clock.
- What-oh-what?

713
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,691
- Nothing.
- Okay.

714
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,760
Because it sounded like
a super adorable nickname

715
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,661
you got for your walks
with your owner.

716
00:43:57,695 --> 00:44:02,031
All right, maybe this is when
me and Supes used to hang out.

717
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:04,601
Every morning,
since I was a puppy.

718
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:07,504
Aw! Well, you might
not have your Superman,

719
00:44:07,537 --> 00:44:08,937
but at least you have us.

720
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:11,039
A whole super team!

721
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,008
The Mighty Oink!

722
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,543
Squirrelverine.

723
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:16,878
Droolo.

724
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,412
Seriously? Droolo?

725
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:20,448
And wait, where's
Shell-on-wheels? Shell?

726
00:44:21,682 --> 00:44:23,684
What's happenin', sweet cheeks?

727
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:28,955
Ah, I get it.
The strong, silent type.

728
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,424
Who needs words?

729
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,559
Man, I wish
I still had my powers.

730
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:35,361
Yeah, what happened
to them anyway?

731
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:36,729
I ate some green kryptonite.

732
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:39,398
A Kryptonian's only weakness.

733
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:41,766
Why would you eat
your weakness, you dum-dum?

734
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,102
It was in some cheese.

735
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:46,971
A dog's only weakness.

736
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:49,007
Well, I ate a toy dinosaur once.

737
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,584
If we're goin' off that, I'd say
you probably got a solid two days

738
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,110
until that thing passes.

739
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:55,546
Unless it's a stegosaurus,
and then you just pray.

740
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:57,299
You guys, look!

741
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:05,087
M'kay, Wonder Woman
will stop her.

742
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:08,056
Goddess, no!

743
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:11,059
Um...

744
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:15,563
That sounded
like a bone breaking.

745
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:18,866
Is that even how it works?

746
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:25,004
I guess it's down to us.

747
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:27,507
Who's ready to go
save my best friend?

748
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,043
You want us to fight her?

749
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:32,611
She just took out
the whole Justice League!

750
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:35,013
And they all
have opposable thumbs.

751
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:38,950
Remember me
when I'm gone, Fabrizio.

752
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:45,656
Guys, relax. We'll be fine.

753
00:45:50,827 --> 00:45:52,796
Why are they so mad?

754
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,768
You see? Totally fine.

755
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,038
Now, let's hero up.

756
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:06,074
All right, team,
what are your stats?

757
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,743
Like, my powers include
heat vision, freeze breath...

758
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:11,045
And don't forget
the Solar Paw Punch.

759
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,414
What is that?

760
00:46:14,448 --> 00:46:16,550
Is that like a juice box
flavor or something?

761
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:19,986
No, it's Krypto's
most powerful move.

762
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,655
It requires him
to fly directly to the sun

763
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:24,857
<i>and absorb its deadly radiation,</i>

764
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:26,459
<i>turning himself into</i>

765
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,628
<i>a dog-shaped
thermal energy event.</i>

766
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,898
Not even Superman himself
has tried it.

767
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,766
Because he doesn't have paws?

768
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:37,101
Because it's not something
you come back from.

769
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,503
The punch causes a blast
which takes out

770
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:41,472
not only the villain
who gets hit with the blow,

771
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:44,074
but the hero who throws it.

772
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:45,942
Sounds like a terrible power.

773
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,120
Does sound like
a good juice box, though.

774
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:48,778
I would drink the juice box.

775
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,581
Okay, enough mayhem.
Thank you. We gotta go...

776
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:54,816
My goodness!

777
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,785
Look who's alive!

778
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:59,222
Well, let's correct that
little oversight, shall we?

779
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:10,197
Ace, deploy canine shield.

780
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:11,765
What is a canine...?

781
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:17,636
Evade!

782
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,841
Excellent shielding.

783
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,810
That seemed incredibly painful.

784
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,912
Anybody wanna switch powers?

785
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:30,982
You're up, pig.

786
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,017
Okay, PB, think big!

787
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,262
Squirrel, light 'em up.

788
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,832
No, no, no. I can't.

789
00:47:50,865 --> 00:47:52,168
Of course you can.

790
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:53,811
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

791
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:57,106
I could hurt someone.
Or they could hurt me.

792
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:00,541
Or maybe me freezing like this
is the worst thing.

793
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,056
Turtle, use your speed
and get them...

794
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,114
On it.

795
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,088
Where the am I?

796
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,526
You guys are
terrible superheroes.

797
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,996
I don't understand
why you're not getting this.

798
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:28,100
Yeah, well, there's a lot that you
don't understand about us, you fool.

799
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:29,967
Maybe if you
paid attention to... Huh?

800
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,868
- Oh, I'm paying attention.
- Help.

801
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,304
One-hundo percent attention.

802
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:35,972
So thick and swole, his abs.

803
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,174
His abs.

804
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:57,291
Risky move for a dog
with no powers.

805
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:59,293
Some would say heroic.

806
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,195
I would say dumb.

807
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,896
Where is Superman?

808
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:05,298
I'm not telling.

809
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:07,833
Classic evil.
Lex would be so proud.

810
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:09,602
This is really about Lex Luthor?

811
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:11,837
Don't you understand?
He was testing on you.

812
00:49:11,871 --> 00:49:15,073
We were colleagues.
We were scientists together.

813
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:17,909
You were the guinea pig.
Your hair fell out.

814
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:22,646
Yeah. Just like his did.
Lex needed me.

815
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:24,915
That's more than I can say
for your Superman.

816
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:27,252
Superman needed me.
He... he needs me.

817
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:28,818
Does he?

818
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:30,753
Because I'm pretty sure
he's gonna get

819
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:33,723
everything he needs from his...

820
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:36,592
fiancee.

821
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:41,097
Oh, no.

822
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,232
You didn't know
they were getting married.

823
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:45,733
I really am sorry,
'cause this must be

824
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:48,636
so painful to have to
hear this from me.

825
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,071
No. You're lying.

826
00:49:50,105 --> 00:49:51,839
Am I? Huh.

827
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:53,673
Well, then why
did this little bauble

828
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,142
fall out of his Underoos

829
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:57,010
the night I took him down?

830
00:49:57,043 --> 00:49:58,745
Look at it.

831
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:00,923
The cut's fine but the clarity
is murky as heck.

832
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:03,048
Face it, Wonder Mutt,
you're too late.

833
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,186
Your boy's getting hitched.
And that means...

834
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:07,753
Bye-bye, dog.

835
00:50:08,854 --> 00:50:10,688
But don't worry,

836
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:12,400
if Superman doesn't have room
in his life for you anymore,

837
00:50:12,424 --> 00:50:16,095
I'm sure you can, uh, crash
at the Hall of Justice.

838
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,907
Wow!
She threw that dog real far.

839
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,410
You know what's funny?
For a minute, I was worried

840
00:50:34,443 --> 00:50:37,712
when I saw that the orange
kryptonite gave you powers,

841
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:40,949
but then I remembered,
uh, you're you.

842
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:43,384
Come on, let's go,
little piggies.

843
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,853
What did I tell you? Isn't
this better than Spanish class?

844
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:47,886
<i>Si.</i>

845
00:50:51,023 --> 00:50:53,993
Hey, Lois Lane.

846
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:55,995
Always nice to see ya.

847
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:58,098
Talk, Lex.
I know you're behind this.

848
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:03,436
Impressive destruction,
but not my work.

849
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,737
Your name is literally
on the monster.

850
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,310
Looks like one of my
little babies is all grown up.

851
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:14,112
That's creepy.

852
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:16,713
Spill it, Lex. What have
you done with Superman?

853
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:20,016
Wherever Superman is,
it's got nothing to do with me,

854
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:23,052
or my company,
LexCorp International.

855
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,969
Hey! Stop chewing
on that Batarang.

856
00:51:43,003 --> 00:51:45,306
Bruce Wayne paid a lot
of money for that,

857
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:48,341
and then gave it to me
as a present.

858
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:51,010
Vic, can you override
their defenses?

859
00:51:51,043 --> 00:51:52,845
I can't do anything

860
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:55,148
while they got me
stuck in airplane mode.

861
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:57,449
All those protocols
for an alien invasion,

862
00:51:57,483 --> 00:51:59,285
nothing for little furballs.

863
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:03,455
These quadrupedal land maniacs
have made a giant mistake

864
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,956
messing with the King of...
Oh, whoa!

865
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,925
Hey, hold on.
Is that fish food?

866
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:11,828
Aw, someone was hungy.

867
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,798
<i>Lex Luthor denies involvement,
but is quote "team bad guy."</i>

868
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,834
<i>Luckily, Superman's dog
is on our team.</i>

869
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:20,770
Krypto?

870
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:24,440
Of course, Superman's dog
he makes out with. He'll save us.

871
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:25,840
No.

872
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,243
He doesn't have his powers.

873
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:32,080
But those other animals do.

874
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:35,250
And... and like, can't Krypto work
with them to... to save Metropolis?

875
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,951
Yeah, about that.

876
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:40,120
He's not the greatest
with other animals.

877
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:42,156
He better get it together soon,

878
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:45,125
or those ferrets
are gonna take over the world.

879
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,128
Is he okay?

880
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:53,299
Looks like he's still breathing.

881
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,799
Yep. He's alive.

882
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:56,134
Pay up, dog.

883
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,939
You bet on if I was alive?

884
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:04,108
Nope. I bet on
if you were dead.

885
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,042
I bet you were horribly maimed.

886
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:08,312
- What a fun game.
- Hey!

887
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:10,447
So, what, uh,
what is this place anyway?

888
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,249
Is this some type of fancy DMV?

889
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:15,385
Are you kidding?
It's the Hall of Justice.

890
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:18,388
This is where
the Justice League hangs out.

891
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,289
I bet they're all
super tight buds,

892
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,932
and they, like,
try on each other's clothes

893
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,568
and then they eat, like,
really fun snacks,

894
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:26,328
and then they probably just
tell each other everything.

895
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,797
Yeah. Everything.

896
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:40,374
He seems sad and defeated.

897
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:42,576
So, it is a DMV.

898
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:45,244
Maybe one of us
should go talk to him.

899
00:53:45,278 --> 00:53:46,479
Not it.

900
00:53:46,512 --> 00:53:49,315
Ace, you always know
what to say.

901
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:15,847
Watch out for the...

902
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:17,339
...invisible jet.

903
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,211
I just want to be alone.

904
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:25,879
This is the best place
to watch the sunset.

905
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:28,516
You wanna be alone, why
don't you go someplace uglier?

906
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:31,118
Besides, don't you
wanna save your Superman?

907
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:32,851
Of course I do.

908
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:34,853
He's my best friend.

909
00:54:34,887 --> 00:54:36,289
At least I thought he was.

910
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,592
Things are changing so fast,

911
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:42,328
he didn't even tell me
he was getting married.

912
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:44,161
That's what's got your leash
all twisted, huh?

913
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:49,200
Yeah, well,
people are complicated.

914
00:54:50,335 --> 00:54:51,469
How would you know?

915
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,470
Nah, forget it.

916
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:03,313
You had an owner.

917
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:07,283
Right. That's your business.

918
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:08,517
I am not gonna pry.

919
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:12,555
Was he nice?

920
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,325
They.

921
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,294
My owner was a family.

922
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:26,966
<i>A mom,</i>

923
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:28,635
<i>a dad,</i>

924
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,936
<i>and her.</i>

925
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:39,097
Ace, what you did
for that little girl...

926
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,733
Nah. It was nothin'.

927
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:44,268
I just did
what any dog would do.

928
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:47,171
And they just gave you away?

929
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,605
I don't blame them.

930
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,108
They were just
protecting their kid.

931
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,675
But you saved her.

932
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,277
And I'd do it again.

933
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,012
Worst day of my life,

934
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,614
but I wouldn't change
a thing about it.

935
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,348
Why not?

936
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:02,717
Well, when you love somebody,

937
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,220
and I mean,
you really love them,

938
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:07,389
you gotta be willing
to do anything for 'em.

939
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:10,591
Even if that means
letting them go.

940
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:13,694
Even if it hurts?

941
00:57:15,229 --> 00:57:17,497
Especially then.

942
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,998
You know what they say
about dogs, don't you?

943
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:21,501
Never feed us chocolate.

944
00:57:22,535 --> 00:57:24,070
We love unconditionally.

945
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,930
Excuse me, sir.

946
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:45,255
I am really bad at this.

947
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:46,523
That's just because

948
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,291
you're still learning
your powers.

949
00:57:48,325 --> 00:57:50,659
Every hero struggles like this.

950
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:53,462
Until they have
their training montage.

951
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:23,188
They're gonna
need a longer montage.

952
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:25,657
Those guys, well,
they suck visibly.

953
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,060
Yes, I... I can agree
with you there,

954
00:58:29,094 --> 00:58:30,628
but they're stronger
than you think.

955
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:34,632
PB just needs to love herself

956
00:58:34,665 --> 00:58:36,400
as much as she loves
everyone else.

957
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:39,736
Chip needs to feel safe.

958
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:42,372
And Merton...

959
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:44,474
Merton needs leafy greens.

960
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:45,608
You really know them, huh?

961
00:58:45,642 --> 00:58:47,109
It's called listenin'.

962
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:48,544
You learn a lot about someone

963
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:51,213
when you're locked up
with them forever.

964
00:58:51,246 --> 00:58:52,714
Wait a minute.

965
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:55,416
Lulu was in the shelter
with you, too.

966
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,684
What did you learn about her?

967
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:58,419
All that guinea pig
ever talked about

968
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,121
was world domination

969
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:02,690
and some bald dude
with nice hands.

970
00:59:02,723 --> 00:59:04,524
Lex.

971
00:59:04,558 --> 00:59:07,494
Of course. Stryker's Island.

972
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:09,629
She must be going there
to spring him.

973
00:59:09,663 --> 00:59:11,730
Not if we get there first.
Come on!

974
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:12,841
Watch out for the...

975
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,169
Invisible jet. Yep.

976
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:18,737
Maybe put up a sign.

977
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:20,471
Or rope it off.

978
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:22,106
Maybe some cones.

979
00:59:24,475 --> 00:59:27,412
Intruders. Intruders.

980
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:29,413
Adorable intruders.

981
00:59:30,781 --> 00:59:33,850
They are so cute.

982
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:37,386
No. That's my robot brother.

983
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:39,755
This is it.

984
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:41,857
Finally, the two great minds
of our generation,

985
00:59:41,891 --> 00:59:43,626
back together.

986
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:45,627
Your pet is coming
for you, Lexi.

987
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,898
Oh, no! Oh, gosh!
Cheese and crackers!

988
01:00:00,873 --> 01:00:03,810
Oh, my gosh. Wonder Woman
has sat, like, right where I'm sitting.

989
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,678
Actually, I feel like I am her

990
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:07,623
because I'm just, like, in
her stance, I'm in her seat.

991
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,657
And there's a peanut wedged
in the crack of the seat.

992
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:11,450
And now I'm eating her peanut.

993
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,852
More importantly,
can a dog fly a plane?

994
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:16,822
Of course.
I can fly. This can fly.

995
01:00:16,855 --> 01:00:18,789
It'll be just
like riding a bike.

996
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,725
Do you know how to ride a bike?

997
01:00:20,758 --> 01:00:22,460
No, I know how to fly.

998
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,295
Relax, we'll be fine.

999
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,698
Stop saying that!

1000
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,266
We're never fine!

1001
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:50,651
Who shot us down?

1002
01:00:50,684 --> 01:00:53,620
Wonder Woman's invisible jet
is invisible.

1003
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,822
It's really more transparent.

1004
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,560
Whiskers?

1005
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:03,829
Out of the way, cat child.
We have to get to Stryker's.

1006
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:06,965
Sorry, I can't do that.
Lulu saved my life.

1007
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:08,533
Now, I must take yours.

1008
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:10,201
Goodbye.

1009
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:27,583
In here.

1010
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,287
Okay. Everybody stay quiet.

1011
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,222
Uh-oh.

1012
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:35,824
- What "oh"?
- I'm gonna...

1013
01:01:35,857 --> 01:01:37,325
No, never mind.

1014
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,593
No, wait, never mind.

1015
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:39,794
Never mind, never mind.

1016
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:47,267
What's happening, handsome?

1017
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,335
Come on, we're both grown-ups.

1018
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:50,770
Don't leave me hanging, okay?

1019
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:55,874
Ay, she's going to see us.

1020
01:01:57,476 --> 01:01:59,411
PB, I'm gonna need you

1021
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:01,014
to get a little smaller.

1022
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:03,981
I know, I just can't control it.

1023
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:09,554
Even with powers,
I'm nothing like Wonder Woman.

1024
01:02:09,587 --> 01:02:14,025
One, two, kitty's coming for you.

1025
01:02:14,058 --> 01:02:17,527
PB, there's something you
should know about Wonder Woman.

1026
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:19,296
Praise be her name.

1027
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:21,931
Diana is fiercely independent,
completely her own woman.

1028
01:02:21,964 --> 01:02:23,833
And if you really
wanna be like her,

1029
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:25,234
you'll be yourself.

1030
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:39,480
I'm gonna rip you
limb from limb.

1031
01:02:39,513 --> 01:02:41,949
Okay, Chip,
time to light that kitty up.

1032
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:45,485
But what if the demonic
laser <i>gato</i> devours me?

1033
01:02:45,518 --> 01:02:46,486
Or all of us?

1034
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,887
Or she only spares me,

1035
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,024
and I forever
carry the guilt of survival?

1036
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,391
Chip, we all go to dark places.

1037
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:55,794
I thought about throwing
Lois Lane in the ocean.

1038
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:57,796
But you can't spend
the rest of your life

1039
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:59,731
stuck in your own head.

1040
01:02:59,765 --> 01:03:01,067
You're right.

1041
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:03,300
It is really scary in here.

1042
01:03:04,468 --> 01:03:06,904
Okay. You can do this, Chip.

1043
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:09,405
Get out of your head!

1044
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:18,781
All right, let's get
to the bottom of Merton.

1045
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:21,717
It all started
in Central City, 1854.

1046
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:26,320
I'm just a sweet
little purr-purr baby.

1047
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:27,755
Why won't you play with me?

1048
01:03:29,757 --> 01:03:31,826
And I had a whole period
in the '60s

1049
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:33,628
where I was basically
a full-time alchemist.

1050
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:35,929
Merton, we don't have time.

1051
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:38,365
Here. Try these.

1052
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:41,868
Whoa!

1053
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:44,004
None of you are turtles!

1054
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:46,906
This explains so much!

1055
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:48,808
Super-Pets,

1056
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:50,642
come out to play.

1057
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:56,648
That monster is lucky
I don't have my heat vision.

1058
01:03:56,681 --> 01:03:58,749
Good thing you've got
something better.

1059
01:03:58,782 --> 01:03:59,750
What's that?

1060
01:03:59,783 --> 01:04:00,851
Us, you idiot.

1061
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:07,623
Okay, pack. I have a plan.

1062
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,069
See you in heck.

1063
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:36,482
What's the matter?

1064
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:37,917
Cat got your tongue?

1065
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,386
Now!

1066
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,761
Boom-boom-boom. Here I go.

1067
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:52,697
Mrs. Fast Pants.

1068
01:05:11,847 --> 01:05:12,881
Mm.

1069
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,132
Meow, meow, buh-bye.

1070
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:40,805
Uh-oh.

1071
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:52,083
I still have eight more lives.

1072
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:54,951
Come on.

1073
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,519
How fun was that?

1074
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,521
A missile was shot
into my chest!

1075
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,832
Uh, that's one way to put it.

1076
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,167
There's no other way to put it.

1077
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,859
A missile was just shot
into my chest.

1078
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:06,728
<i>The threat was neutered,
thanks to Krypto and friends.</i>

1079
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,564
This is amazing!

1080
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:12,968
- Yes! Humanity is saved.
- No!

1081
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,903
My baby made friends.

1082
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:21,541
If you all had pets,
you'd understand.

1083
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:24,178
You know, I had a cheetah
once, but she ate my landlord.

1084
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:26,478
And tore up my couch.

1085
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:27,913
Man, I loved that couch.

1086
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:30,749
On the planet Oa,
I thought I had a pet raccoon,

1087
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,218
but he thought we were dating.

1088
01:06:32,252 --> 01:06:34,852
All the creatures of the sea
are my friends.

1089
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:38,489
Except for that one eel
who knows what he did.

1090
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:40,858
Yeah, I'm not really
an animal guy.

1091
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:42,793
Oh! Are you allergic or...?

1092
01:06:42,826 --> 01:06:46,030
As a child, I fell into
a well filled with bats.

1093
01:06:46,064 --> 01:06:48,066
I can still hear the screams

1094
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:50,834
as their dark wings
flapped around me,

1095
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:53,536
scratching my chubby,
childish flesh.

1096
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,938
I'm tormented
every waking moment.

1097
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:01,210
I really think a pet
would be good for you.

1098
01:07:08,216 --> 01:07:09,783
I got Lulu's scent.

1099
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,119
She's this way.

1100
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,022
Well, look at you being a dog.

1101
01:07:14,055 --> 01:07:16,789
Also, the prisoners
had egg salad for lunch...

1102
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:18,725
and down that hall...

1103
01:07:18,758 --> 01:07:20,160
Oh, dang,

1104
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:21,874
I think a robot guard
got his heart broken.

1105
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,663
Dolores.

1106
01:07:28,134 --> 01:07:31,270
I'll admit, sometimes it
can be a little too specific.

1107
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:38,076
Lex! I'm here!

1108
01:07:39,211 --> 01:07:41,778
- We're finally reunited.
- Halt.

1109
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,916
Ah. The student returns
to the teacher.

1110
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,917
Oh, good. Your marmot baby.

1111
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:50,586
Shove it.

1112
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:52,619
I'm his favorite henchman,
not you, you piece of...

1113
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:58,793
Now, I have a present for you.

1114
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:01,196
Um, it's not here,
but I have pictures of it.

1115
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,897
Loser, loser.

1116
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:04,632
Look at all their dumb outfits.

1117
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:08,236
Huh. My evil plan to take out
the Justice League.

1118
01:08:08,269 --> 01:08:11,172
Wow!
You really did study.

1119
01:08:11,205 --> 01:08:14,074
Ooh! And wait until
you see this.

1120
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:16,609
Okay, I don't know
how that got in there.

1121
01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:18,045
No one wants that, right?

1122
01:08:18,078 --> 01:08:20,213
Well, clearly, I've been hacked.

1123
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:22,248
Okay, let's get you out of here.

1124
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,316
Oh, I can't believe
this is finally happening.

1125
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,352
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

1126
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,827
This ends now, rodent.

1127
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,229
You were just defeated by...
Let me remember it.

1128
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:41,697
The League of Super-Pets.

1129
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:43,333
Brring, brring.
Hello, who's there?

1130
01:08:43,367 --> 01:08:45,035
Uh, the League of Super-Pets.

1131
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:47,836
Give it up, Lulu. It's over.

1132
01:08:47,869 --> 01:08:50,672
You idiots. You're actually
getting the hang of this.

1133
01:08:50,705 --> 01:08:53,009
I'm toast. I'm a goner.

1134
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:54,109
Not.

1135
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:58,679
No!

1136
01:08:58,712 --> 01:09:00,915
One more step
and the puppy gets it.

1137
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,850
Unless your friends

1138
01:09:03,883 --> 01:09:06,353
walk into those cells
over there.

1139
01:09:06,387 --> 01:09:08,122
Ace, attack. I'll be fine.

1140
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:09,957
You'll be a pancake.

1141
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:11,757
Okay, I'm gonna count to three

1142
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:13,359
and I'll start at two
'cause I'm evil.

1143
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:14,360
Two...

1144
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:16,296
All right, Lulu. You win.

1145
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:18,663
No! Don't listen to her.

1146
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,132
What choice do we have?

1147
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:22,301
Oh, I didn't know
they were gonna be so sad.

1148
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:25,903
He doesn't wanna go in the cage,

1149
01:09:25,937 --> 01:09:29,273
but he has to,
to save the other one.

1150
01:09:29,307 --> 01:09:31,375
Everyone is upset.

1151
01:09:43,452 --> 01:09:45,653
Okay. Now then, where was I?

1152
01:09:50,192 --> 01:09:52,160
Let me look at you, my pet.

1153
01:09:52,793 --> 01:09:54,095
Oh, Lex.

1154
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:17,182
Lex?

1155
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:18,316
Lex, what are you doing?

1156
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:20,385
We're a team.

1157
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:21,886
Lex, we were
scientists together.

1158
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:23,721
No. Lex, what are you doing?

1159
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:25,990
I mean, come on. You didn't
expect me to share credit

1160
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:27,391
with a rodent, did you?

1161
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,726
Lex!

1162
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:33,963
Oh!
Little turn of events!

1163
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,407
Lulu, I know you're hurting,
but join our pack.

1164
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,942
Hold up, wait! For real?

1165
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:48,909
She left us to die
in a fire, remember?

1166
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:50,877
Yeah, but if we work together,

1167
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:53,214
we can get outta here
and save Superman.

1168
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:56,716
Huh. You truly love him.

1169
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,984
Of course I do.

1170
01:10:58,018 --> 01:10:59,718
You're a fool.

1171
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:02,055
He'll only break your heart.

1172
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:04,391
Luckily, I'm going
to do you a favor,

1173
01:11:04,424 --> 01:11:07,825
and destroy him
before he gets the chance.

1174
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:09,461
What are you talking about?

1175
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:13,232
Oh, did I forget to mention
my evil plan's grand finale?

1176
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:15,333
In 28 minutes,
the entire Justice League

1177
01:11:15,366 --> 01:11:17,734
is gonna go kaboom.

1178
01:11:17,768 --> 01:11:22,239
If I can't have my guy,
then you can't have yours.

1179
01:11:22,272 --> 01:11:24,341
No. I won't let you hurt him.

1180
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:26,109
Just one question,

1181
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:29,112
how are you gonna stop me
when you're trapped in a cage?

1182
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:30,912
You're trapped, too, genius.

1183
01:11:30,947 --> 01:11:33,782
Yes, I know.
But just like at the shelter,

1184
01:11:33,815 --> 01:11:37,153
I always have an exit strategy.

1185
01:11:37,954 --> 01:11:39,187
Hey, girl.

1186
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:41,122
Dish, queen.
How'd it go with Lex?

1187
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:45,859
Okay, I feel
like I can say this now,

1188
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:47,328
I never liked him.

1189
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:49,029
Lex will pay for what he's done.

1190
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,499
Right alongside
the Justice League.

1191
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:58,071
You won't get away with this.

1192
01:11:58,104 --> 01:12:01,241
I say this with love.
You are all losers.

1193
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:04,276
You've always been losers,
and you'll continue to be losers

1194
01:12:04,309 --> 01:12:06,911
until the end
of your loser lives.

1195
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,014
Oh, and Krypto,

1196
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:11,215
I'll be sure to say goodbye
to Superman for you.

1197
01:12:19,023 --> 01:12:20,991
Well, well, well.

1198
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:23,159
If it isn't the Justice League,

1199
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:26,563
captured by me,
entirely on my own.

1200
01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:28,896
The guinea pig
did literally everything.

1201
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:32,201
Yes, gotta admit,
doesn't feel great.

1202
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:33,535
But it's all worth it.

1203
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:36,170
Because you chumps
are going down for good.

1204
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,311
It's no use.

1205
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:44,877
These cells were designed

1206
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,281
to keep anyone
with powers from escaping.

1207
01:12:47,314 --> 01:12:49,349
You'd have to be as strong as
Superman to get out.

1208
01:12:51,018 --> 01:12:53,185
Well, we can't just give up.

1209
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:55,288
There's a difference
between giving up

1210
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:57,223
and knowing when it's over.

1211
01:12:57,256 --> 01:13:00,292
Mm-mmm. No way.
Not for superheroes.

1212
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:02,027
I'm not a superhero.

1213
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:04,529
I'm not even a good dog.

1214
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:08,099
When I was a puppy,

1215
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,301
I promised
I'd watch over Superman.

1216
01:13:10,334 --> 01:13:11,935
And I failed.

1217
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:14,171
All because I was jealous
of Lois.

1218
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:16,273
Who wouldn't be?
Have you seen those bangs?

1219
01:13:16,307 --> 01:13:18,308
Ba-bang!

1220
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:20,510
Superman was my only friend

1221
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:23,212
and I was afraid to lose that.

1222
01:13:23,246 --> 01:13:25,080
But you can't blame yourself.

1223
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,182
I'm the only one to blame.

1224
01:13:27,215 --> 01:13:28,617
If I really was his friend,

1225
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,385
I'd have been there for him
no matter what.

1226
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,887
My father was right.

1227
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:35,489
My problem is me.

1228
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:43,163
I'm sorry.

1229
01:13:43,196 --> 01:13:45,165
Nah, man, you're good.

1230
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:47,600
You're just finally
being real with yourself.

1231
01:13:47,634 --> 01:13:50,169
You can't have justice
without truth.

1232
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:51,303
Thanks, Ace.

1233
01:13:52,237 --> 01:13:53,439
But it's too late.

1234
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:57,242
Are you sure
about that, <i>perrito?</i>

1235
01:13:57,276 --> 01:13:58,886
What do you mean?

1236
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:59,977
You're flying.

1237
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,045
What?

1238
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:02,113
I'm...

1239
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,648
My powers.

1240
01:14:03,681 --> 01:14:05,416
I'm back!

1241
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,584
The kryptonite has left the dog.

1242
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:10,120
Well, that does
smell like sandalwood.

1243
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,963
All right, time to save
the Justice League.

1244
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:23,298
Let's crack some skulls.

1245
01:14:25,467 --> 01:14:27,469
No, you've done enough.

1246
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:29,471
Um, say what now?

1247
01:14:29,504 --> 01:14:32,373
I started this
with one best friend to save

1248
01:14:32,406 --> 01:14:34,074
and now I have four more.

1249
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:36,110
Aw! He means us.

1250
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,479
I can't let you keep risking
your lives for my mistake.

1251
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:41,614
But don't worry,
when this is over,

1252
01:14:41,647 --> 01:14:43,882
I'm still taking
you all to that farm.

1253
01:14:44,517 --> 01:14:45,985
Pup, up and away!

1254
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:49,621
You believe that dog?

1255
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:51,223
Has an emotional breakthrough,

1256
01:14:51,256 --> 01:14:53,658
gets his powers back,
and then bounces.

1257
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:56,127
- I thought it was sweet.
- Me, too.

1258
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,929
I'm medium on it, you know,
if I'm honest.

1259
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:19,448
Time for the death of Superman.

1260
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,516
I'm not so sure about that.

1261
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:25,119
Ugh! This guy again?

1262
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:11,493
Any last words?

1263
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:14,996
I love saying that.

1264
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:18,299
Any last words?
Ooh, it is fun.

1265
01:16:18,332 --> 01:16:20,701
Hey.
You liked my little joke?

1266
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:23,270
Lockin' you up in the cell.

1267
01:16:23,304 --> 01:16:25,705
That was funny, right? Right?

1268
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:28,374
No, hey, come on, it's me.
Papa Lex.

1269
01:16:28,408 --> 01:16:30,143
No, hey... What? Come on!

1270
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,747
Yeah, I don't get paid
enough for this, no.

1271
01:16:37,216 --> 01:16:38,450
Lock the gates.

1272
01:16:43,321 --> 01:16:44,589
Ew, I can't wait that long.

1273
01:16:44,622 --> 01:16:46,557
Let's do it now.
I want to do it now.

1274
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:49,594
Are you sure about this?

1275
01:16:49,627 --> 01:16:51,595
I mean, the kidnapping
we could get behind.

1276
01:16:51,628 --> 01:16:54,698
We liked the kidnapping,
but if you do this, they'll die.

1277
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:56,199
That's the point of...

1278
01:16:56,233 --> 01:16:58,200
What did you think
we were doing?

1279
01:16:58,234 --> 01:17:00,269
Mark, Keith, suffer.

1280
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:04,206
Stand down.

1281
01:17:06,774 --> 01:17:08,519
Okay, Krypto, you are
definitely stalking me now.

1282
01:17:08,543 --> 01:17:10,044
I'm, like, creeped out.

1283
01:17:10,078 --> 01:17:11,679
Bye.

1284
01:17:16,283 --> 01:17:17,651
Fly over there.

1285
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:19,686
You mean,
toward the murder rodent?

1286
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,088
Where is Superman?

1287
01:17:21,121 --> 01:17:22,456
You're too late.

1288
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:24,090
I'm sending him back
to the place

1289
01:17:24,123 --> 01:17:25,725
from whence he came from.

1290
01:17:25,758 --> 01:17:26,759
Boop!

1291
01:17:34,533 --> 01:17:35,567
No!

1292
01:17:42,373 --> 01:17:43,707
What... What's going on?

1293
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:45,342
Uh, yeah, funny story.

1294
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:47,577
I, uh, turned my office
into a rocket ship.

1295
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:48,811
All billionaires have 'em.

1296
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:50,079
It's true.

1297
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:04,492
Krypto, there's a bomb
on the rocket.

1298
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:06,761
When it leaves
Earth's atmosphere,

1299
01:18:08,262 --> 01:18:09,764
it'll implode.

1300
01:18:16,169 --> 01:18:17,871
We're just coughing. Go!

1301
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,439
I'm coming for you, Superman.

1302
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:22,541
Uh-uh-uh!

1303
01:18:22,575 --> 01:18:23,742
Not so fast.

1304
01:18:27,613 --> 01:18:29,213
Who gets to live, doggy?

1305
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:32,283
The man you love,
or the woman he does?

1306
01:18:32,317 --> 01:18:34,285
You can't save them both
on your own.

1307
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:43,427
What's up, dog?

1308
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,828
Ugh, what is this? <i>PAW Patrol?</i>

1309
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:49,265
I thought I told
you guys to stay put.

1310
01:18:49,298 --> 01:18:51,267
When do we ever listen to you?

1311
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:55,170
Boo! I'm bored!

1312
01:18:55,203 --> 01:18:57,472
Let's get to the fiery crash.

1313
01:19:00,508 --> 01:19:01,675
You save Superman.

1314
01:19:01,709 --> 01:19:03,377
- From a rocket?
- I trust you.

1315
01:19:04,612 --> 01:19:06,547
Okay, but from a rocket, though?

1316
01:19:09,582 --> 01:19:10,817
Hop on, y'all.

1317
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,685
Because this pig right here

1318
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,488
is about to go ham.

1319
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:48,918
That thing took our Superman.

1320
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:51,386
She's goin' down.

1321
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,359
Merton, hit it.

1322
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:15,540
Ay!

1323
01:20:19,544 --> 01:20:21,246
It's over, hamster.

1324
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:23,414
Hamster?

1325
01:20:23,447 --> 01:20:26,918
A hamster is just
a dollar store gerbil.

1326
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:33,322
A hamster is a chipmunk

1327
01:20:33,356 --> 01:20:36,359
with nothing interesting
going on fur-wise.

1328
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:49,336
You're up, kid.
Open it like a can of tuna.

1329
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,991
Well, I loosened it for you.

1330
01:21:12,025 --> 01:21:13,926
Man, I hate bein' invulnerable.

1331
01:21:13,959 --> 01:21:16,895
Here we go.
This is gonna hurt tomorrow.

1332
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:18,529
Why couldn't
I have been stretchy?

1333
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:20,323
Or, like, gotten
a magic hammer or something.

1334
01:21:39,915 --> 01:21:41,016
No!

1335
01:21:52,026 --> 01:21:53,559
Face it.

1336
01:21:53,593 --> 01:21:54,928
- It's over.
- Huh?

1337
01:22:01,068 --> 01:22:02,801
Your Superman is no more

1338
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:07,073
and now his precious
little dog is about to...

1339
01:22:07,106 --> 01:22:08,707
What? What is it?

1340
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,341
Do I have something on my face?

1341
01:22:10,374 --> 01:22:12,376
Do I have a pimple?
Is it wet? Is it ready?

1342
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:13,677
Should I pop it?

1343
01:22:25,488 --> 01:22:28,457
Hey, guys. Big fan.

1344
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:31,293
Um... You all see
the giant pig too, right?

1345
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,796
No. How did they...?

1346
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:35,596
You forgot one thing, Lulu.

1347
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:38,033
Unlike you, I have friends.

1348
01:23:08,659 --> 01:23:11,361
You're right,
you do have friends.

1349
01:23:12,663 --> 01:23:15,133
But not for long.

1350
01:24:00,005 --> 01:24:02,573
Kneel before Lulu.

1351
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,449
Oh, come on.

1352
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,987
I said, kneel!

1353
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,703
- Try to keep up, turtle.
- Okay.

1354
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:37,881
Porcine creature...

1355
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:38,972
...follow my lead.

1356
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,877
Batman works alone.

1357
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:46,178
Except for Robin, and Alfred,

1358
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:47,914
Commissioner Gordon...

1359
01:24:57,022 --> 01:24:58,656
Don't mess up my half-fro!

1360
01:25:05,762 --> 01:25:07,064
I am Aquaman.

1361
01:25:13,136 --> 01:25:14,670
Get it, squirrel!

1362
01:25:14,703 --> 01:25:15,780
...Justice League,

1363
01:25:15,804 --> 01:25:17,173
Batgirl, Batwoman,

1364
01:25:17,206 --> 01:25:18,706
my IT crew,

1365
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,842
whoever Morgan Freeman played,

1366
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,044
Ah, what the heck.

1367
01:25:59,077 --> 01:26:01,044
Watch, you pathetic pooch,

1368
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:03,679
as I destroy
everyone you care for.

1369
01:26:03,713 --> 01:26:05,015
And there's nothing in the world

1370
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:06,716
you can do to stop me.

1371
01:26:13,555 --> 01:26:14,991
You're right, Lulu,

1372
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:18,059
there's nothing I can do
in this world to stop you.

1373
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:19,727
What are you talking about, man?

1374
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,996
And why was your syntax

1375
01:26:21,029 --> 01:26:23,298
so oddly structured
in that sentence?

1376
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:25,698
Keep an eye on Supes for me.

1377
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:28,102
Where's he going?

1378
01:26:28,135 --> 01:26:31,637
No. Not the Solar Paw Punch.

1379
01:26:31,671 --> 01:26:33,572
The juice box thing?

1380
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:34,941
But that'll kill him.

1381
01:26:34,974 --> 01:26:36,641
Krypto, no.

1382
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:46,184
You were right, Ace.

1383
01:26:46,218 --> 01:26:47,718
Whoa, whoa!

1384
01:26:47,752 --> 01:26:49,954
I am a few guineas
short of a pig.

1385
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:52,756
Uh...

1386
01:26:59,896 --> 01:27:00,897
Ah!

1387
01:27:10,638 --> 01:27:12,640
<i>Well, when you love somebody,</i>

1388
01:27:12,673 --> 01:27:14,942
<i>and I mean,
you really love them,</i>

1389
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:17,979
<i>you gotta be willing
to do anything for 'em.</i>

1390
01:27:18,012 --> 01:27:19,180
<i>Even if it hurts?</i>

1391
01:27:21,115 --> 01:27:22,215
<i>Especially then.</i>

1392
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:03,151
No!

1393
01:28:36,914 --> 01:28:39,016
Man, it sucks
being a canine shield.

1394
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,427
Oof.

1395
01:28:41,853 --> 01:28:44,054
I think my teeth
are still glowing.

1396
01:28:44,087 --> 01:28:46,156
You saved my life, man.

1397
01:28:46,189 --> 01:28:48,757
Hey, well, you were
in the middle of saving ours.

1398
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:51,794
You know what
they say about dogs.

1399
01:28:54,263 --> 01:28:56,308
So, something did get through
that super skull of yours.

1400
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,067
Don't make me take it back.

1401
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:04,339
- Bum, bum, bum.
- Bye.

1402
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,310
What?
What have you done to me?

1403
01:29:10,344 --> 01:29:12,179
I'm in hot dog water, aren't I?

1404
01:29:12,212 --> 01:29:13,413
No!

1405
01:29:13,447 --> 01:29:15,082
Yeah!

1406
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:27,058
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

1407
01:29:35,032 --> 01:29:36,367
I'm happy for you, buddy.

1408
01:29:38,802 --> 01:29:40,404
You know Krypto rescued me?

1409
01:29:40,437 --> 01:29:41,838
I know the feeling.

1410
01:29:43,273 --> 01:29:45,475
He rescued me a long time ago.

1411
01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:47,243
He's a good dog.

1412
01:29:52,014 --> 01:29:53,215
Come here, boy.

1413
01:29:56,518 --> 01:29:58,186
Hey.

1414
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,057
I'm sorry, Krypto.

1415
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,892
You know you'll always be
my best friend.

1416
01:30:05,926 --> 01:30:08,094
And nothing
can ever change that.

1417
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:15,201
Oh, one more thing.

1418
01:30:20,839 --> 01:30:22,217
Wow, look at that.

1419
01:30:22,241 --> 01:30:24,509
I did have this
whole thing planned, but...

1420
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:26,044
Oh, no, please,

1421
01:30:26,077 --> 01:30:26,978
this is exactly
how I always pictured it.

1422
01:30:27,011 --> 01:30:28,346
Giant evil guinea pig.

1423
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:30,981
This... This was
on my vision board. Really.

1424
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:32,983
You wanna keep going?

1425
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:34,251
Yes, I would. Thank you.

1426
01:30:35,285 --> 01:30:37,321
Lois Joanne Lane,

1427
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:40,856
make me the happiest
Superman in the universe.

1428
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,158
- Will you...
- Yeah, okay!

1429
01:30:43,559 --> 01:30:45,361
Prenup.

1430
01:30:53,368 --> 01:30:55,070
Squeezy Bruce!

1431
01:30:55,102 --> 01:30:58,472
That better be a licensed toy,
or I will freak out.

1432
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:06,379
Oh!

1433
01:31:06,412 --> 01:31:08,948
Hey, don't worry. I got you.

1434
01:31:12,017 --> 01:31:13,852
Okay, what's happening?

1435
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,220
Wow, this is so weird.

1436
01:31:15,254 --> 01:31:17,356
So beautiful!

1437
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,157
High-fiving so slow

1438
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:20,471
when we're both
really fast. Huh.

1439
01:31:22,126 --> 01:31:25,129
Princess Diana of Themyscira,

1440
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:27,031
I humbly present myself,

1441
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,966
Super Hog,
still brainstorming, to you.

1442
01:31:31,835 --> 01:31:34,437
You will be a mighty warrior.

1443
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:37,072
And cuddle buddy.

1444
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:42,177
Woe is me.

1445
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,492
No
One cares about the water guy.

1446
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,448
This water guy does.

1447
01:31:47,482 --> 01:31:49,083
Hey, my name's Keith.

1448
01:31:50,351 --> 01:31:53,086
Aw, little piggy kisses.

1449
01:31:54,154 --> 01:31:55,455
Hey, smokey.

1450
01:31:55,489 --> 01:31:56,923
You're looking
a little burnt out.

1451
01:31:56,957 --> 01:31:59,159
Need a light?

1452
01:31:59,192 --> 01:32:00,403
Oh, look at me!

1453
01:32:00,427 --> 01:32:01,527
Aw, come here.

1454
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,462
I'm Mark. And your name?

1455
01:32:07,066 --> 01:32:10,235
So, you are a dog.

1456
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:13,071
I am the Batman.

1457
01:32:13,104 --> 01:32:15,307
Sorry, I'm not
really great with animals.

1458
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,108
Yeah, I'm not
really great with people.

1459
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:19,310
Probably because of my
traumatic puppy hood.

1460
01:32:19,343 --> 01:32:22,046
As a child,
my family was taken from me.

1461
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:24,048
As a puppy,
I was taken from my family.

1462
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:25,848
So, I've steeled myself.

1463
01:32:25,882 --> 01:32:27,459
My emotions, always in check.

1464
01:32:27,483 --> 01:32:30,953
No one ever getting past
my impenetrable defenses.

1465
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:35,223
Ah, what the heck?

1466
01:32:37,392 --> 01:32:38,527
Good boy.

1467
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,829
Okay, the Batman loves you, too.

1468
01:32:44,598 --> 01:32:45,599
Oh! Hey, Pops.

1469
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:48,135
<i>Yes, it is I, Dog-El.</i>

1470
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:52,339
<i>Never eat chocolate.
That dog in the mirror is you.</i>

1471
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,175
<i>Fireworks suck!</i>

1472
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,877
<i>Tell Gail I said hey!</i>

1473
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:00,612
<i>Looks like you worked
everything out with Superman.</i>

1474
01:33:00,646 --> 01:33:03,649
Thanks to your advice,
I made some new friends, too.

1475
01:33:03,682 --> 01:33:06,018
And now I've gotta
bring them to Smallville.

1476
01:33:06,051 --> 01:33:07,811
I promised them
that it would be their new...

1477
01:33:10,355 --> 01:33:12,166
Aw!

1478
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,658
...home.

1479
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:43,117
Hey, Chip-tonite,

1480
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,661
- How's it going with Jessica?
- We're getting pretty close

1481
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:47,620
as person and pet.
She even put a ring on it.

1482
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:53,025
Nice costume game, PB.

1483
01:33:53,059 --> 01:33:56,094
Thanks! It even has magnets.

1484
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,471
Um, how long is this gonna take?

1485
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,141
I got a hot date
with two firemen's helmets.

1486
01:34:10,174 --> 01:34:11,909
Spoiler alert, they're twins.

1487
01:34:27,556 --> 01:34:29,123
You're late.

1488
01:34:29,157 --> 01:34:30,534
Sorry, me and the Dark Knight
were playing

1489
01:34:30,558 --> 01:34:33,027
a little bit of fetch.
Have you met Chewperman?

1490
01:34:34,462 --> 01:34:35,663
So disrespectful.

1491
01:34:35,696 --> 01:34:37,297
Y'all started it.

1492
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,698
So, what's the mission?

1493
01:34:38,732 --> 01:34:40,100
We can answer that.

1494
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:44,571
Okay, our intel indicates
a dog has been mutated.

1495
01:34:44,604 --> 01:34:45,671
This could be dangerous.

1496
01:34:45,704 --> 01:34:47,306
We have to stop him.

1497
01:34:47,339 --> 01:34:49,508
Tighten your collars.
We've got work to do.

1498
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,945
I ate the FedEx guy.

1499
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,315
Hey, I know that dog.

1500
01:34:57,348 --> 01:35:00,151
He's giant and blue
and about to crush us.

1501
01:35:00,185 --> 01:35:02,152
Can't crush what we have.

1502
01:35:02,186 --> 01:35:05,522
Say it back. Come on.

1503
01:35:05,556 --> 01:35:08,358
- Come on.
- Can't crush what we have.

1504
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:13,563
Super-Pets, activate!

1505
01:37:47,397 --> 01:37:48,866
<i>Hello?</i>

1506
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,468
Excuse me. It's me.

1507
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:54,337
Are any adorable animals
going to let me out?

1508
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,872
Maybe a cat? How 'bout a cat?

1509
01:37:55,906 --> 01:37:57,206
Nope.

1510
01:37:59,408 --> 01:38:01,911
I always knew this is how
it would end for me.

1511
01:38:01,944 --> 01:38:04,412
I always knew this is how
it would end for me.

1512
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,524
Oh. It's you. Hi.

1513
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,492
Let's be honest.

1514
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:21,862
The two of us are the real
brains behind this operation.

1515
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:23,363
Forget Lex.

1516
01:38:23,396 --> 01:38:25,164
We should team up.

1517
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:27,800
So, what do you say?

1518
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:30,369
You wanna come live
in a studio apartment?

1519
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,704
Like, with you?

1520
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:35,573
Like, pet-owner situation?

1521
01:38:35,606 --> 01:38:40,711
Hmm, uh, let me think.
Yes, yes! The answer is yes!

1522
01:38:40,746 --> 01:38:42,580
So, just something
to know about me.

1523
01:38:42,613 --> 01:38:44,514
I'm passionate
about world domination

1524
01:38:44,547 --> 01:38:46,683
and my nails need to be
trimmed twice a month.

1525
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,467
Fetch!

1526
01:44:21,177 --> 01:44:22,979
That's my toy.

1527
01:44:23,012 --> 01:44:25,214
Then, why is it in my mouth?

1528
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:29,517
Superman.

1529
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,786
Black Adam.

1530
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,587
Your owner's a hero, too?

1531
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:35,756
Antihero.

1532
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:39,160
It's basically exactly like a
regular hero except way cooler.

1533
01:44:39,193 --> 01:44:40,828
You make up your own rules,

1534
01:44:40,861 --> 01:44:42,529
and then you break them.

1535
01:44:42,562 --> 01:44:44,563
Also, you can ignore most moral

1536
01:44:44,596 --> 01:44:48,001
and ethical conventions
because no one can stop you.

1537
01:44:48,034 --> 01:44:50,536
Yeah, that sounds
a lot like a villain.

1538
01:44:50,569 --> 01:44:52,005
Antihero.

1539
01:44:52,038 --> 01:44:55,640
If he's anti a hero,
then isn't he a villain?

1540
01:44:55,673 --> 01:44:58,744
Admit he's an antihero or
Black Adam will destroy you.

1541
01:44:58,777 --> 01:45:00,279
Very villain thing to do.

1542
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:02,546
It's a fine line, not gonna lie.

1543
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:05,183
Well, whatever he is,
I bet he can't fly to Pluto.

1544
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:07,018
Oh, yeah? Watch him.

1545
01:45:12,588 --> 01:45:13,890
My toy.
