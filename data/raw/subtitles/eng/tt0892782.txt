1
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,516
Hey, Jerry.

2
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,146
You might want to check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

3
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,483
Look like some type of UFO
and it's heading this way.

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,152
How many times do I
have to tell you this.

5
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,362
UFOs don't exist and we
are never gonna see…

6
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,407
Wow. Its energy
signature is massive.

7
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,536
Holy Jesus, what do we do?
No one ever told us what to do.

8
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,789
The only reason I took this job is
cause you don't have to do anything.

9
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,125
Jerry, Stop it! We
calculate its impact point.

10
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,460
Looks like.

11
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,671
Modesto, California.

12
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,133
Supenova: this is Red
Dwarf. We actually have one.

13
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:18,388
Code Nimoy.
I repeat Code Nimoy.

14
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,401
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

15
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,820
Hurry, turn on the TV.
Turn it on now.

16
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,489
and some early morning
fog giving way to sunny skies.

17
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,698
75°F.

18
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,705
A perfect day to stop by the old folk
garden craft show down at the fair grounds,

19
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,584
or a perfect day to
marry Susan Murphy.

20
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,378
I love you baby.

21
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,923
I love you too.

22
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,843
And good morning Modesto…

23
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,097
<i>Channel 172</i>

24
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,024
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

25
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,277
Thanks, mom.

26
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,160
Ah, my little girl.

27
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
Daddy!

28
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,291
Now I want you to know that even
though I'm about to give you away…

29
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,378
I'll always be here
to take care of you.

30
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,801
Don't cry cause then you're gonna
make me cry and this leaves me a mess.

31
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,178
I can't help me oh.
I can't.

32
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,058
Hello, everyone. Attention attention.
Wedding starts in 30 minutes.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,937
My beautiful daughter in law.

34
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,813
–Hi, mama Dietl.
–It's like a fairy tale.

35
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,150
The weatherman and
the weatherman's wife.

36
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,028
–Oh, romantic.
–Ah, I know.

37
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,698
Just think… This time
tomorrow I'm gonna be in Paris,

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,787
and some day, we won't just be honeymo-
oning there. Derek will become an anchor,

39
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,416
or a foreign correspondant and
we'll travel all over the world.

40
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:54,836
Oh, honey, my
fingers are crossed.

41
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,466
One thumb is shorter than the
other. It runs in the family.

42
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,261
–Derek doesn't have that.
–It skips a generation.

43
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,097
Your kids are gonna have it.

44
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,523
Wow. You look beautiful!

45
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,819
So do you… I mean,
handsome. I mean…

46
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,740
Sorry, I'm just
a little frazzled.

47
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,825
I just spent way too
much time with our parents.

48
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,033
Don't worry, ok?

49
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,827
We'll be alone soon.
Just us.

50
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,498
Hmmm… eating cheese
and baguettes at the Sun.

51
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,378
Feeding each other
chocolate crepes.

52
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,049
–Is something wrong?
–No, it's just that…

53
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,719
There's been a
slight change of plans.

54
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,680
We are not going to Paris.

55
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
What?

56
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,516
Why not?

57
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,269
Because we are going
somewhere better.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,644
Better than Paris?

59
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,479
–Oh, yeah.
–Where?

60
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,898
–Tahiti?
–Nope!

61
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,066
Fresno.

62
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,443
Fresno!

63
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,445
Fresno?

64
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,700
In what universe is… Fresno,
better than Paris, Derek?

65
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,450
In the…

66
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:12,872
I got an audition to become channel
23's new evening anchor universe.

67
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,459
I got the call from
the general manager.

68
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,169
He wants me to come in
inmediately. Isn't that great?

69
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,130
Derek.

70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,756
That's…

71
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,675
amazing!

72
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,554
It's amazing. Fresno is like
the top 50 markets, isn't it?

73
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,558
Actually it's 55th. But
we are on our way, babe.

74
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,560
Now look about Paris…

75
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,939
Oh, it's ok… It's fine.
As long as we are together,

76
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:42,027
Fresno is the most romantic
city in the whole world.

77
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,737
I'm so proud of you.

78
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,489
Of us…
Not just of me.

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:52,120
I mean, of course, but we are a
team now. You are so proud of us.

80
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,041
Now get out of here. It's bad
luck to see me in my dress.

81
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,961
Oh, come on! You know I
don't believe in that stuff.

82
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,005
I'll be waiting
for you at the altar.

83
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,882
The handsome news anchor
in the tux, alright?

84
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,259
<i>I love you.
There, I said it.</i>

85
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,804
I love you too.

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,046
Susan!

87
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,007
Where could she be?

88
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,384
Susan!

89
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,845
Where are you?

90
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,687
Susan. Where've you been?

91
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,606
I think I just got
hit by a meteroid.

92
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,736
Oh, Susan… Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

93
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,907
My goodness, look at
you. You're filthy.

94
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:13,660
Thank God I have wet wipes.

95
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,074
You are… glowing.

96
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,534
Thank you.

97
00:08:54,576 --> 00:09:01,166
No, no Susan, you're like,
really glowing. You're green.

98
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,918
Oh, no!

99
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,295
Derek.

100
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,630
No.

101
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,346
What's going on?
What's happening here?

102
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,263
You are all shrinking!

103
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,808
–Na-ha, you are growing.
–Well, make it stop.

104
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,145
Get me the goverment!

105
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,231
This is impossible.

106
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,819
No. This can't be happening.

107
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,698
Wait, wait, everybody.
It's OK.

108
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,034
Have some champagne while
we're figuring this out.

109
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,577
Thumbs! Thumbs!

110
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,831
Derek help me!

111
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,884
Here comes the bride.

112
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,097
Oh, Carl. It's
her wedding day.

113
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,100
Derek!
Derek!

114
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,645
Hurts. Damn it.

115
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,606
<i>Hold your fire</i>

116
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,316
What's happening to me?

117
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:13,154
Don't panic, don't worry.
Whatever you do, don't drop…

118
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,906
Derek!

119
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,659
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

120
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,283
Who are you people?

121
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,661
What are you doing?

122
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,829
Stop it.

123
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,247
Be careful!

124
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,293
Get your hands off me.
Don't you know who I am?

125
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:30,130
Please. Just leave me alone!

126
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:52,402
Move it, move it!
Let's go, move it!

127
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,780
Derek!

128
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:03,455
<i>Let's get this
baby on the bus.</i>

129
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,837
Honey, can you hit the snooze?

130
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,840
Baby why'd you set the alarm?

131
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,886
We are on our honeymoon.

132
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,351
Hello?

133
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,979
What's going on?

134
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,068
Hello?

135
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:38,758
Quiet. She can hear us.

136
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,848
Hello?

137
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,059
Is there someone in there?

138
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,690
Could you please
tell me where I am?

139
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,540
What was that?

140
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,048
Hello.

141
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,675
Eeeewwww!

142
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,968
Would you stop?

143
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,595
Be careful!

144
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,805
Please.
Madam stop…

145
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:26,556
doing…

146
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,309
that…

147
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,731
Whatever mad
scientist made you,

148
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,234
he really went all out.

149
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,863
You can… talk.

150
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,414
Hi there!

151
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,667
Argg, my back!

152
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,461
Just kidding.
I don't have a back.

153
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,256
Forgive him, but as you
can see he has no brain.

154
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,760
Turns out you don't need one.

155
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,344
Totally overated.
As a matter of fact…

156
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,806
I don't even…

157
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,435
I forgot how to breathe.
I forgot how to breathe.

158
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,977
Help me, Dr Cockroach. Help!

159
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,231
Suck in, Bob.

160
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,652
Thanks Doc.
You are a lifesaver.

161
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,822
Wow, look at you. I know
what you are thinking.

162
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,160
First day in prison, you wanna take
out the toughest guy in the yard.

163
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,414
Well, I'd like
to see you try…

164
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,842
Gosh. What⁈
She is speechless.

165
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,676
She?

166
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:49,431
Yes Bob. We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

167
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,224
No way.
It's a boy.

168
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,977
Look at his boobies.

169
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,939
–We need to have a talk.
–Gentlemen,

170
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,984
I'm afraid we are not making
a very good first impression.

171
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,988
At least I'm talking. First new monster
in years we are gonna get like a wolfman,

172
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:08,283
or mummy, just, you know
somebody to play cards with.

173
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,870
Might we ask
your name, Madam?

174
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,871
Susan.

175
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,458
No, no, no. We mean
like your monster name.

176
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,420
Like what do people scream
when they see you coming?

177
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,505
You know… like:
“Look out. Here comes…”

178
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,424
Susan.

179
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,633
Really?

180
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,844
Suuuusan.

181
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,388
I just scared myself.
That is scary.

182
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,850
Yes! Eat time.

183
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,399
That is repulsive.

184
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,362
Oh, I love slipper!

185
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,539
Oh please God, please
tell me this isn't real.

186
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,583
Please tell me I just had a
nervous breakdown at the wedding,

187
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,668
and now I'm at a mental
hospital and I'm on medication,

188
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:04,089
and it's giving
me hallucinations.

189
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:15,268
Don't scare InsectoSaur. He is gonna
pee himself and then we'll all be in trouble.

190
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,521
Everyone run at the door? There's got
to be a door here. Where is the door?

191
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,065
It's ok, buddy.
Don't worry about it.

192
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:27,487
Who is a handsome bug?
You like it when I rub your tummy?

193
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,409
Please, somebody.
I don't belong here. Let me out.

194
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,954
Hey, hey. That
is not a good idea.

195
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,080
Let me out!

196
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:53,930
Monsters. Get
back in your cells.

197
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,577
Oh, thank goodness.
A real person.

198
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,289
You are a real person, right?

199
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,832
Not one of those half-person
half-machine… you know?

200
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,377
Whatever you
call those things?

201
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,336
–A Cyborg?
–Oh, no!

202
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,670
You are a cyborg?

203
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,548
Madam, I assure you,
I am not a cyborg.

204
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,717
My name is General
W.R. Monguer.

205
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm in charge of this facility. Now
follow me. It's time for your orientation.

206
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,112
In 1950 it was decided
that Jane and Joe

207
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,698
Public can not handle
the truth about monsters,

208
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,076
and should focus in more
important things like paying taxes.

209
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:59,247
So the goverment convinced the world
monsters were stuff of myth and legend,

210
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:05,251
and then locked them away
in this here facility.

211
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,295
But I'm not a monster.

212
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,297
I'm just a regular person.

213
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,469
I'm not a danger to
anyone or anything.

214
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,388
Don't let her get me!

215
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,015
Sorry.

216
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,609
–How long will I be here?
–Indefinitely.

217
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,653
–Can I contact my parents?
–No.

218
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,612
–Derek?
–Negative.

219
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,018
–Do they know where I am?
–No, and they never will.

220
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,907
This place is an X file.

221
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,829
Wrapped in a cover-up and
deepfried in a paranoid conspiracy.

222
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:46,876
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

223
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,317
7, 8…

224
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,655
899, 1000…

225
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,202
I did ten sets.

226
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,504
Ah, Susan.

227
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,800
You wouldn't happen to
have any uranium on you?

228
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,300
Just need a smidge.

229
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,928
Rescend Dr Cockrach toybox
privileges inmediately,

230
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,224
We just had the prison's
phycologist redecorate your cell.

231
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,269
Try to keep you all calm.

232
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,396
But I don't want a poster.

233
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:52,984
I want a real kitty,
hanging from a real tree.

234
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,819
I wanna go home.

235
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,573
Oh, come on, please don't cry.
Makes my knees hurt.

236
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,742
Don't think of
this as a prison.

237
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:08,833
Think of it as hotel you'll never leave
because it's locked from the outside.

238
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,960
Oh, and one other thing.

239
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:17,884
The goverment has changed
your name to Ginormica.

240
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:08,768
<i>Begin re-animation sequence.</i>

241
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,192
Who dares to wake me?

242
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:22,532
<i>Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the omega quadrant.</i>

243
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,826
The Omega quadrant?

244
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,328
Lame.

245
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:34,127
<i>The trajectory of the Quantonium
meteor has been traced to sector 72-4.</i>

246
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,213
<i>A planet locally
known as Earth.</i>

247
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,384
What a miserable
looking mudball.

248
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,554
Send a robot probe.

249
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:50,727
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme predujice.

250
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,438
I want it all!

251
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,149
Every last drop.

252
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,319
<i>Yes, Gallahxar.</i>

253
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:04,574
Nothing can stand
in my way now.

254
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:27,305
Don't rush me, Katie.
I'm just… not ready.

255
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,517
Oh, relax, Cuthbert.
it's just like dancing.

256
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,269
Al Lee.

257
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,979
Katie,

258
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,817
I have a gymnastic's meet
tomorrow, so maybe I…

259
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,861
Did you open this half?

260
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,030
Thank goodness.
It's the police.

261
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,242
We weren't doing
anything officer.

262
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah. Nothing at all.

263
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,960
Why did I even let
you talk me into this?

264
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,421
Maybe we should
get out of here.

265
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,797
Or maybe we should
go check it out.

266
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,882
Katie, are you nuts?

267
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:07,637
Wait. Don't
leave me alone.

268
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,099
My ankle.

269
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,560
I think it's broken.

270
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,187
Katie.

271
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:21,276
This is the worst date ever.

272
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,871
Katie, I'm frightened.

273
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,715
It was first spotted
at midnight last night,

274
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,341
by a couple in
romantic embrace.

275
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,844
No one knows what it
is or where it came from.

276
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:51,349
All branches of the military
were inmediately move on.

277
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,726
–What is that?
–OK.

278
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:59,856
I have just received word that
the president of the US has arrived,

279
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,068
and will attempt to
make first contact.

280
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,195
I must approach it alone.

281
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:09,074
This is all about
peaceful communication.

282
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:13,411
Yes, Sir Mr President.

283
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:50,782
Perimeter stable. Got a
vis on Papa Bear, all clear.

284
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,886
Commander.
Do something violent.

285
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:22,809
You heard the president.
Light them up.

286
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:34,988
Problem down here. Call in air
support. Call in air support.

287
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,842
Call in… hmmm.
Call in a full retreat.

288
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,846
Full retreat, full
retreat. All troops.

289
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,681
Papa Bear is on the move.

290
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,350
No, wait.

291
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,145
So that's how
you wanna play it?

292
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,688
Eat lead, alien robot.

293
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,193
–Evidently they eat lead.
–Get him on the chopper.

294
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:17,530
I'm brave. I'm a
brave president.

295
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,348
own approved goverment.

296
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,602
This right here has only
have about two weeks left.

297
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,606
If that think walks into a populated
area there will be a major catastrophe.

298
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,692
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone.

299
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,736
If we transport the
US to a safer planet…

300
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:58,239
I say we give this alien a green card
and make him proud to be an American.

301
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,036
Sir, it's at dire times like this when I stop
and ask myself: what would Oprah do?

302
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,829
Hang it all.
What's the point?

303
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,164
It's a disaster.

304
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:10,875
–Stop, sir.
–Don't do it! Stop, no!

305
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,629
That button lauches all
of our nuclear missiles.

306
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,256
Well then, which
button gets me a latte?

307
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:20,969
Ahh… That would
be the other one, Sir.

308
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,763
What idiot
designed this thing?

309
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,557
<i>You did, Sir.</i>

310
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,477
Fair enough.
Wilson, fire somebody.

311
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,645
Listen up!

312
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,359
I'm not going to go down in history
as the president who was in office

313
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,739
when the world came to an end. So somebody
think of something and think of it fast.

314
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,407
That's a good Capu-ccio.

315
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,952
<i>Mr President.</i>

316
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:52,792
Not only do I have an
idea but I have a plan

317
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:58,049
Now conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

318
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,800
and we all know
nukes ain't an option.

319
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:05,013
–Sure they are. I just…
–No, no, no the button, wait!

320
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:08,892
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr President.
These are dark times.

321
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,727
The odds are against us.

322
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,981
We need a Hail Mary pass.
We need raw power. We need…

323
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,443
Monsters.

324
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,820
Monsters!
Of course…

325
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,448
It's so simple.

326
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,950
I… I'm not following you.

327
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,556
Over the last 50 years I have
captured monsters on the

328
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,625
rampage and locked them up
in a secret prison facility.

329
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:38,672
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

330
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:43,134
Is he referring
to area fifty—

331
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:49,265
Mr President, say
hello to Insecta-Saur.

332
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,685
Miss Ronson, please.

333
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,979
Nuclear radiation, turned
him from a small grub,

334
00:30:55,021 --> 00:31:00,568
into a 350 foot tall monster,
that attacked Tokyo.

335
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,740
Here we have “The Missing Link”.

336
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,451
A 20.000 years
old frozen fishman,

337
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,912
who was thawed out
by scientists.

338
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:16,334
He escaped… Went on a rampage
in his old watering hole.

339
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,671
This handsome fellow
is Dr Cockroach Ph.D

340
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,089
The most brilliant
man in the world.

341
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,970
He invented a scientific
machine that would give humans,

342
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:30,390
the cockroaches'
ability to survive.

343
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:35,228
Unfortunately there
was a side effect.

344
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,065
Now, we call this thing BOB.

345
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:43,653
Could someone get
her out of here?

346
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,572
Thank you.

347
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,910
A genetically altered tomato
was combined with a chemically,

348
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,871
altered ranch-flavor dessert
topping at a snack food plant.

349
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:59,794
The resulting goo gained consciousness and
became an indistructible gelatinous mass.

350
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:05,342
And our latest
addition, Ginormica.

351
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,138
General, continue.

352
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:16,978
Her entire body radiates with pure energy
giving her enormous strength and size.

353
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,568
Sir, these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot.

354
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:24,571
Don't we already have
an Alien problem, General.

355
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,515
I don't think we need
a monster problem too.

356
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,243
You got a better idea nerd?

357
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,581
Ok. Stay where you are.

358
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:43,296
General, I propose we go forward with
your monsters vs aliens idea… thingy.

359
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,257
<i>Go fish.</i>

360
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:57,435
Do… you… have… any…

361
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,354
three's?

362
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:04,192
Yes, I do. How are you doing this?
You are the luckiest guy I know.

363
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:08,071
Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

364
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,825
What the…?
Hey.

365
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,494
They called me crazy,

366
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:19,749
but I'll show them.
I'll show them all.

367
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,504
Dr, I'd prefer you didn't
do your mad scientist

368
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:28,258
laugh while I'm hooked
up to this machine.

369
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,926
You're right Insecto.

370
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:33,473
You've been letting that crack
experiment on you for over a month.

371
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,725
I'm not a crack.
I'm a mad scientist.

372
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:37,769
There's a difference.

373
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,353
Guys. What choice do I have?

374
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:44,192
If he can make me normal or
even 6′8″, I can get out of here.

375
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,319
Get back to the life,
I'm supposed to have.

376
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,697
–I mean, I should be…
–Let me guess: Fresno?

377
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:51,197
Well, Fresno is
just a steppin stone.

378
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,286
Next stop: Milwaukee, and then
New York and then someday hopefully…

379
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,619
Yeah, we know: Paris.

380
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,956
Throw the switch, Dr.
But don't do the laugh.

381
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:04,544
Now, you'll feel a
slight pinch in the brain.

382
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:07,172
Sorry.

383
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,225
Susan!
Yuuhuu!

384
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,478
Am I small again?

385
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,815
I'm afraid not my dear.

386
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,443
In fact,

387
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:34,783
You may actually have
grown a couple of feet.

388
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,911
It's ok, Doc. We'll
try again tomorrow.

389
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,623
You really don't
get it. Do you?

390
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,957
No monster has ever
gotten out of here.

391
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,752
That's not true.
The invisible man did.

392
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,591
No he didn't. We just told you
that so you wouldn't get upset.

393
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,592
He died of a heart
attack 25 years ago.

394
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,052
Nooo!

395
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,345
Yeah.

396
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,931
In that very chair.

397
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:01,476
He still there?

398
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:06,358
You see what I'm saying? Nobody is
leaving, nobody is ever getting out.

399
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:09,818
<i>Good news, monsters.
You are getting out.</i>

400
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,071
Until today.

401
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,786
So let me get this
straight, Monguer.

402
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,453
You want us to
fight an alien robot,

403
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:26,292
And in exchange, the president of the US
has authorized me to grant you your freedom.

404
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,461
Ah! I can't believe it!

405
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:32,424
Soon I'll be back in Derek's arms…
or he'll be in mine.

406
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:36,302
I can't wait for Spring Break
back at Cocoa Beach just…

407
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,263
freaking everybody out.

408
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,893
And I'll go back to my lab and
finally finish my experiments.

409
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,935
No, no.
That's me, Bob.

410
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,604
Then I'll be a…
really giant lady.

411
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,398
That's Susan, Bob.

412
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,694
Fine, then I'll go back to
Modesto and be with Derek.

413
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,531
Yeay… that is
still Susan, Bob.

414
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,325
I think I at least deserve
a chance to be with Derek.

415
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:01,369
All right. Let's go.

416
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:25,562
Everybody move in an orderly
fashion. This is an emergency.

417
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:35,111
We are evacuating the city. Exact
change is appreciated, but not necessary.

418
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:03,264
Let's move out!

419
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:11,856
This is San Francisco!
This isn't far from my home.

420
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:15,278
Feel the wind on your
antennas. Isn't this wonderful?

421
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:19,447
I haven't been outside in 50
years. It's amazing out here.

422
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,494
It's a little hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

423
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:30,750
That'd be great to know that,
it'd be a very convenient truth.

424
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,628
Now, that's a robot!

425
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,546
It's huge.

426
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:38,843
Try not to damage it too much, Monsters.
I may want to bring it back to the farm.

427
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:42,347
No, no, wait. You didn't say
anything about it being huge.

428
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:46,599
Wait.
No, don't leave.

429
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,395
I think he sees us.

430
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:53,857
Hello, hey!
How are you doing?

431
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,402
Welcome. We are
here to destroy you.

432
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,614
I can't fight that
thing. I can't even…

433
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,907
I… I'm hyperventilating.

434
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,078
Does anybody have
a giant paper bag?

435
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,911
Relax.

436
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,065
Old Link got this
under control.

437
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,751
Hide in the city Susan,
you'll be safe there.

438
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,879
But stay away from the
Tenderloin. Gets a little daze.

439
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,925
Finally, some action. I'm gonna
turn that oversized tin can into a…

440
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:24,346
really dented oversize tin can.

441
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:30,894
OK. Does anybody have
a 20 on Insectosaurus?

442
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:36,941
Wow, would you look
at the size of that?

443
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,195
I got it, you guys I got…

444
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:44,032
Don't worry, I won't let go.
I'm wearing it down…

445
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,534
He's slowing down.

446
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:52,040
Get to the city, Link. I'll catch
up with you as soon as I can.

447
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:58,463
Or maybe… You'll
have to catch up with me.

448
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,508
No! No!

449
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:55,372
OK, ok I got this.

450
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:11,346
Yep. That hurt.

451
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:16,559
Get in.
I have a plan.

452
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,698
Hot dogs!

453
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:38,833
All right, Link. I'm going to
pull up alongside it. You get

454
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:42,544
up in there, get into its
central processing unit and…

455
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:46,589
Hey, guys.
Catch me!

456
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:54,514
Let's go, let's
go, keep it moving.

457
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:58,143
Hey, no honking.

458
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,815
Excuse me, moving out.

459
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:08,653
on your right…
no control.

460
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,921
Oh, no.

461
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,099
OK. It's gonna be OK.

462
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:41,354
Look, I'm gonna get you out
of there. Hold on a second.

463
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:47,400
You have to get off
the bridge before…

464
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,619
Help!

465
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,466
No, no, no!

466
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:15,220
Get away from me!

467
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:34,739
Coming through.
Watch it.

468
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:42,789
Hey, furrball.
Where've you been?

469
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,543
Yeah, I know. Papa is
a little out of shape.

470
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:54,092
Excuse me, he is trying to kill me.
Why is he doing that, why…?

471
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,184
Wow.

472
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,286
Wow!
You are doing great!

473
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,204
I'm doing everything!

474
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:28,877
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down.

475
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:33,715
A deflector shield.
Typical.

476
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:44,684
You can't crush a cockroach.

477
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:57,530
Right, right, right.
Here we go.

478
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,786
Insectosaurus!

479
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:04,829
Insectosaurus!

480
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,164
–BOB!
–What?

481
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,248
Help me!

482
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,794
Sorry, I was just staring
at this bird over there.

483
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:12,047
We have to get these
people off the bridge.

484
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,673
Got it.

485
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:18,885
No, Bob.
Move the conveyors.

486
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:23,807
Oh, yes, you're right.
My bad.

487
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,938
Go, go go, go.

488
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,034
Link!

489
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:47,288
Oh, I don't feel good.

490
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:52,502
Ok. Susan, you can do this.

491
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:42,886
All right. Let's
take this thing down.

492
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,812
<i>Retrieval has failed.</i>

493
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:57,067
<i>Don't get upset.
It happens to everyone.</i>

494
00:46:57,108 --> 00:47:03,531
That lower life form. Thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?

495
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:06,076
Send another probe at once!

496
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:09,414
<i>Quantonium can not
be retrieved via a robot.</i>

497
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:14,542
<i>Carbon-based life form, locally
known as Susan is now too strong.</i>

498
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:19,506
Oh, you think because you
are all big and strong…

499
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:26,012
and you can destroy my robot probe that
you're gonna send me running and hiding?

500
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:30,308
My days of running
and hiding are over.

501
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:37,816
Computer, set the course to Earth.
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself.

502
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:45,865
Even if I need to rip it out
of her body one cell at a time.

503
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,538
<i>Be careful.
It's hot.</i>

504
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,877
3 weeks ago, if you
would've asked me to defeat

505
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,672
a giant alien robot, I
would've said: No, can't do.

506
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:04,050
But I did it! Me! I'm so buzzing.
I mean, did you see how strong I was?

507
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:06,554
There probably isn't a jar
in this world I can't open.

508
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:09,806
You were positively
heroic, my dear.

509
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:12,978
I specially loved how you saved
all those people on the bridge.

510
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,981
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

511
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:19,858
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

512
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:26,322
Poor Link. After all that tough
talk you were out-monstered by a girl.

513
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:27,993
No wonder why
you are drepressed.

514
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:30,785
Hey, I'm not
depressed. I'm tired.

515
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,956
Why are you tired?
You didn't do anything.

516
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:36,960
Well, I haven't been sleeping
well, alright? I get sleepne-apness.

517
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,045
Apne… apnea…
Whatever. It's not fun.

518
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:43,840
So Link is a little rusty.
I mean, sleep deprived.

519
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:47,969
You'll be back to your old
self in no time. And so will I.

520
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,267
What happened to the “There isn't a
jar in the world I can't open” stuff?

521
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,853
Wait. Did you find a jar you
can't open? What was in it?

522
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:57,397
Was it pickles in it? Where's
the giant jar of pickles?

523
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:00,108
What my associate is
trying to say is that

524
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:06,863
we all think the new
Susan is the cat's me-wow.

525
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,074
I'm sorry.

526
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,952
Thanks, you guys.
That is so sweet.

527
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:16,373
But I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

528
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:21,171
So tell me exactly how this normal life
thing works with you being giant and all.

529
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,505
I'm not gonna be
a giant forever.

530
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:27,717
Derek won't rest, until
we find a cure for my…

531
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:30,345
condition.
We're a team.

532
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:35,350
We can all do with a Derek. Perhaps
some day we can make his acquaintance.

533
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,018
Really?

534
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,564
You guys wanna meet Derek?

535
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,822
First stop: Modesto.

536
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:52,661
Ginormica. I called your family
to let them know you coming home.

537
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:57,497
Now I also called the Modesto
PD, told them not to shoot at you.

538
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,126
Thanks, General.

539
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:17,017
Ok, remember. These people aren't
used to seeing anything like…

540
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:20,937
You, or you… or you…

541
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:29,362
So just be… you know, cool.
Just be, you know? Follow my lead.

542
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:39,205
Stop. That was an accident!
Don't destroy anything.

543
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:41,374
Susan?

544
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,668
Susie-Q!

545
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,671
Mom? Daddy?

546
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:50,383
Did they experiment on you?

547
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:54,220
No, mom.
I'm fine.

548
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:58,933
It's ok.
They are with me.

549
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:00,437
These are my new friends.

550
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:03,563
Oh, Derek.
I missed you so much.

551
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,192
Thinking that… some day
we'd be together again.

552
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:10,280
Just let hope I will not go again
to prison. I love you. I love this man.

553
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,405
No, BOB.
That's my mother.

554
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,659
You're suffocating her!

555
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,494
Honey.
Are you allright?

556
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:19,037
I taste ham.

557
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,458
Sorry, mom.
He is just a hugger.

558
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,793
Where's Derek?

559
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,128
He is at work, sweetie.

560
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,465
You know, how he
is about his career.

561
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,886
Well, we are not gonna
celebrate without him.

562
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:37,097
Susan. What do I do with
all your little friends?

563
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:42,102
Just put out some snacks.
They'll eat anything.

564
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:45,438
Oh, ambrosia!

565
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,651
How is it going?

566
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,528
Impressive girlfriend.

567
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:56,157
Way to cut up a rug Insecto.

568
00:51:57,325 --> 00:52:03,540
Who wants to go for
a swim with The Link?

569
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:09,671
Hi, I'm Benzoate
Ostylezene Bicarbonate.

570
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:13,591
Or you can call me BOB.
Whichever is easier.

571
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:17,679
Do I come on too strong?
I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty.

572
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:22,475
I've been in prison my whole life.
Why I mentioned prison?

573
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,730
Oh, I didn't mean to
scare you. I'm just gonna go.

574
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,440
Ah, I feel so stupid.

575
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:32,694
Everyone just stay calm. Whatever
you do, do not provoke them.

576
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:38,992
Anyone cares for atomic gin fizz?
It's got quite a…

577
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,785
Kick.

578
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:46,541
Chlorine, chlorine.
Chlorine in my eyes.

579
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:52,589
Everyone, run for your lives!

580
00:52:54,841 --> 00:53:00,055
What are they
running away from?

581
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:02,515
that's hilarious, Jim.

582
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:07,314
That's exactly the kind down home country
humor I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

583
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:11,566
This is Derek Dietl. Signing
off for the very last time.

584
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,652
Good night… Modesto!

585
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,571
<i>Channel 172</i>

586
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,824
<i>And… Cut!</i>

587
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:27,791
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

588
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:33,088
Oh, my goodness!

589
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:37,217
Wait, wait, wa… it!

590
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:40,178
Oh, Derek!

591
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:46,935
You wouldn't believe my last 3
weeks. Just wouldn't believe it.

592
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,731
Thinking about you was the
only thing that kept me sane.

593
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:53,024
Can't breathe!

594
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:55,944
Oh, my gosh.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry

595
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:59,197
Oh my God.
Is that better?

596
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,950
OK. OK.

597
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,205
I'm just still kind of getting
used to my new strength.

598
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,872
Wow, you really are big.

599
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:12,919
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still
the same girl you fell in love with.

600
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:16,548
Except you… Did just destroyed
the Golden Gate bridge.

601
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:20,512
Well, that was the only way I
was gonna stop that giant robot.

602
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,722
Did you ever think I could
do something like that?

603
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:24,014
No, I didn't.

604
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:32,480
I can honestly say that it never ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever ever occurred to me.

605
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:34,733
I know this is
a little weird…

606
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:39,154
Ok, it's a lot weird.
But we'll figure it out.

607
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:43,076
I know that together we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

608
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:46,828
Susan, try to look at
this from my perspective.

609
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,123
I have an audience that
depends on me for news,

610
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:53,501
weather, sports and
heartwarming fluff pieces.

611
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:55,797
So you expect me to put
all that on hold while

612
00:54:55,837 --> 00:54:58,258
you try to undo this
thing that happened to you?

613
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,760
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

614
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,010
Yes.

615
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,888
That's exactly what I expect.

616
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:08,935
What about the life that we always
talked about? Don't you still want that?

617
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:11,936
Of course.
I just…

618
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:15,565
Don't see how I can
have that with you.

619
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,609
Derek, please…

620
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,319
Don't do this.

621
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,863
You have to face facts, Susan.

622
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:25,035
And don't crush me for saying
this, but I'm not looking to get

623
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:29,704
married and spend the rest of
my life in someone else's shadow.

624
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:32,916
And you're casting
a pretty big shadow.

625
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:34,668
I'm sorry.

626
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:37,462
It's over.

627
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:41,091
Good luck, Susan.

628
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:52,268
<i>Leaving Modesto
Come Again</i>

629
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:29,389
Wow, what a shindig!

630
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:33,768
Your parents really
know how to throw it down.

631
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:38,775
That was a… great party. One of the best
I've been to, since I got out of prison.

632
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:41,401
I must have been at
a different party,

633
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:44,155
cause that's not how I
interpreted it at all.

634
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:45,740
I don't think your
parents liked me,

635
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,743
and I think that Jello
gave me a fake phone number.

636
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:52,954
Well, at least the
garbage was free and…

637
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,706
Who are we kidding?

638
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,668
We could save every city
on the planet and they'd

639
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,921
still treat us the same way
they've always treated us.

640
00:56:59,961 --> 00:57:02,881
Like monsters.

641
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:06,509
Right, monsters.

642
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:12,432
Anyway.
How… How is Derek?

643
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:18,355
Derek… is a selfish jerk.

644
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,857
–No!
–Yes!

645
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,692
All that talk about “us”,

646
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:26,363
I'm so proud of “us”.
“Us just got a job in Fresno.”

647
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:29,324
There was no “us”.
There was only Derek.

648
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:33,620
Why did I have to get hit
by a meteor to see that?

649
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,247
Idiot!

650
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:40,587
Why did I ever think life with
Derek would be so great, anyway?

651
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:43,298
I mean, look at all the
stuff I've done without him.

652
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:47,592
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

653
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,427
And that was amazing.

654
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:53,014
Meeting you guys.
Amazing.

655
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:56,101
Dr Cockroach. You can
crawl up walls and…

656
00:57:56,142 --> 00:58:00,190
build a supercomputer out of a pizza box,
two cans of hair spray and…

657
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,481
And a paper clip.

658
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:02,607
Amazing!

659
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:05,987
And you, you hardly need an
introduction. You are the Missing Link!

660
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:09,199
You personally carried 250
coeds off of Cocoa Beach and

661
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:11,451
still have the strength
to fight the national guard.

662
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:14,287
And the Coast Guard,
and also the Life Guard.

663
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:16,079
Amazing.

664
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:21,753
Bob, who else could fall from unimaginable
heights and end up without a single scratch?

665
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:22,836
Link?

666
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:23,586
You!

667
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:26,423
Amazing!

668
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:31,761
Good point, Insecto. Susan,
don't shortchange yourself.

669
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:38,893
Oh, I'm not gonna shortchange
myself… ever again.

670
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:48,194
Susan!

671
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:58,163
Way to go Insecto!

672
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:11,593
Insecto look out!

673
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:20,018
Insectosaurus.
Nooo!

674
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:31,112
It's gonna be alright.
Look at me.

675
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:32,615
Don't you close those eyes.

676
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:36,159
Don't you dare
close those eyes.

677
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:39,412
You can't…

678
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,753
Mom?

679
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:18,618
You must be terrified.

680
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,289
You wake up in a strange
place, wearing strange clothes.

681
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:28,712
Imprisoned by a strange being,
floating on a strange hovering device.

682
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,630
Strange. Isn't it?

683
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:31,673
Hardly.

684
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,925
It's not the first time.

685
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:36,386
Wow. You really get around.

686
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:39,848
To the extraction chamber.

687
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:41,935
Look, what is it that
you want from me?

688
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,854
You have stolen what
is rightfully mine.

689
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,732
I didn't steal
anything from you.

690
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:51,735
Your enormous grotesque
body, contains Quantonium.

691
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:55,822
The most powerful
substance in the universe.

692
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:59,617
Did you really think you
could keep it from me?

693
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:02,746
That's, what this is
all about? You destroyed

694
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:07,000
San Francisco. You terrified
millions of people…

695
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,920
You killed my friend,
just to get to me?

696
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:12,213
Silence.

697
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:16,134
Your voice is
grinding on my ear knobs.

698
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:22,140
It's a shame you won't be around to
see what the power of Quantonium can do,

699
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:26,227
in the tentacles of someone
who knows how to use it.

700
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:29,022
I know how to use it.
Just…

701
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:34,527
Don't bother. That force
field is impenetrable…

702
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:38,281
What the flagnog!

703
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:52,295
Ha! That should
stop your puny…

704
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:55,215
Computer. Close door hangar 2.

705
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:57,217
Close door hangar 3.

706
01:01:57,258 --> 01:02:00,387
Close hangar 4.

707
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:03,932
Close them all!

708
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:53,565
Computer.
Begin extraction.

709
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:38,485
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

710
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:42,072
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

711
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:43,573
Your planet, perhaps?

712
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,618
You keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet.

713
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,458
If you wanted to stop me, you should've
done it when you possessed the Quantonium.

714
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,875
Now you are nothing.

715
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:58,880
There innocent people down
there, who didn't do anything.

716
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:03,011
There were innocent people on my
home planet, before it was destroyed.

717
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,680
Look, I'm sorry your
planet was destroyed.

718
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,183
Oh, don't be. I'm the
one who destroyed it.

719
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,266
Confused?

720
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:16,731
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

721
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,151
Computer… initialize
cloning machine.

722
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:23,321
<i>Yes Gallahxar</i>

723
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,908
Many zentons ago,
when I was but a squid

724
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:31,955
I found out my parents were…

725
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:35,792
No child should ever
have to endure that.

726
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:40,088
So I went on the
road, with a giant…

727
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,882
And soon thereafter
was married.

728
01:04:42,924 --> 01:04:48,013
Things were going well,
until she wanted to…

729
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:54,352
and then I was all: “no way” and she
was all: “yes way” and I was like…

730
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:59,024
But I've told you
too much already.

731
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:03,903
Let the birth of my
new planet now called,

732
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:08,950
Gallahxar's Planet begin!

733
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:37,270
<i>Once again, a UFO
has landed in America.</i>

734
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,567
<i>The only country UFOs
ever seem to land in.</i>

735
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:46,154
<i>Excuse me… What's
that, Henshaw? Okey-dokey.</i>

736
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:54,996
<i>We now take you live to a transmission
from the alien spacecraft.</i>

737
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:56,623
<i>Humans of Earth</i>

738
01:05:56,665 --> 01:06:00,877
<i>I have come in peace.
You need not fear me.</i>

739
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:03,672
<i>I mean you no harm.</i>

740
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:09,012
<i>However, it's important to note that most
of you will not survive the next 24 hours.</i>

741
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:13,099
<i>Though those of you who do survive,
will be enslaved and experimented on.</i>

742
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:18,812
<i>You shouldn't take any of this
personally, it's just business.</i>

743
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:20,647
<i>So, just to recap:</i>

744
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:24,402
<i>I come in peace. I mean you
no harm and you all will die.</i>

745
01:06:24,442 --> 01:06:28,154
<i>Gallahxar out.</i>

746
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:40,375
Ok. Boys, set the terror level at code
brown cause I need to change my pants.

747
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:53,555
What are we gonna do now Doc?

748
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:55,765
I don't know.

749
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,226
I'll tell you what
we are gonna do.

750
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,897
We are not gonna let
Insecto die in vain.

751
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:10,447
We are gonna get up there, find Susan
and we're gonna take that alien down.

752
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,077
Alright gentlemen. You
got enough juice in those

753
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:17,497
jetpacks to get you up there,
but not enough to make it home.

754
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:21,708
I'll come get ya if I can.
If I don't, it means I'm dead.

755
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,169
Or late.

756
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,547
I've been your warden
for close to 50 years.

757
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:30,175
That's no longer the case.

758
01:07:30,216 --> 01:07:33,261
For what it's worth.

759
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,472
That's rude.
What do we do?

760
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:42,604
No, Bob, that's not rude.
That's a sign of respect.

761
01:07:49,277 --> 01:07:50,822
General, it's targeting us.

762
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:54,199
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

763
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,744
Steady, steady.

764
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:03,667
Hard right, hard right.
Hard right!

765
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:09,005
Can't shake it.
I can't shake it.

766
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:15,762
Hang on to your socks.
We are going for a ride.

767
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:29,734
That's why I always wear
a parachute, Lieutenant.

768
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:35,365
You can let go of
me now Lieutenant.

769
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:11,651
–Who are you signaling? We're here.
–Hey, zip it.

770
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:19,242
Hail, Gallahxar.

771
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:22,996
No, no, not all
of you. You, there.

772
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,497
How do I do this?

773
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:27,419
Three back. No, no, no.
That guy, next to you.

774
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:29,044
The one I'm pointing at.

775
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:34,591
You the one…
You clone. Yes, good.

776
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,927
Take the prisoner
to the incinerator.

777
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:40,555
She is useless to us now.

778
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:45,477
–Hail, Gallahxar.
–Hail me.

779
01:09:57,614 --> 01:10:00,408
Ginormica ain't so…

780
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,077
Ginormic any more.

781
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:05,665
How are we supposed to get to her?
There's too many of them.

782
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:09,292
It's impossible.

783
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:19,386
I may not have a brain,
gentlemen. But I have an idea.

784
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:26,518
This is not gonna work.

785
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,989
Halt!

786
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:43,910
I…

787
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:49,457
Gallahxar, command you to hand
over the prisoner this instant.

788
01:10:49,499 --> 01:10:52,210
Clearly you are
defective beyond repair.

789
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:58,800
Guards, take this defective
clone to the incinerator.

790
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:02,012
Well, what are you
waiting for? You and you!

791
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:03,888
What, seriously?

792
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:09,602
Yes. Take the prisoner and the
defective clone to the incinerator.

793
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:11,730
Ah, of course, Sir.

794
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:14,983
And here's the security pass,
just in case.

795
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,819
–Would you like a gun?
–Yes I would.

796
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:21,448
Hey, guys, look.

797
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:29,497
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

798
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:32,971
Don't mention it. We monsters
got to stick together.

799
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:36,921
But I'm not a monster
anymore. I'm just… me.

800
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:41,509
My dear, no matter what
your size, you'll always be…

801
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:45,096
Nothing, but a filthy
carbon based lifeform.

802
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:48,725
Hail, Gallahxar.

803
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:55,732
These disguises are the bomb!

804
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:58,526
That's it.
Follow me.

805
01:11:58,568 --> 01:12:01,571
The only way to save the…
–Hail Gallaxhar.

806
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:03,908
The only way to save…
–Hail Gallahxar.

807
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:06,870
The only way to save the Earth, is to
blow up this ship before the invasion.

808
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:07,621
Hail Gallaxhar.

809
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:10,123
Hail Gallahxar. Before
the invasion starts.

810
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:14,959
–So, how are we gonna do this?
–We need to find the main power core.

811
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:18,214
Excuse me, could you direct
usr to the main power core?

812
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:25,762
Gladly, it's right there.
Above the extraction chamber.

813
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,981
Thank you very much.
Hail Gallaxhar

814
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:37,774
–Watch out!
–Wow, look out, brainless.

815
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:39,275
Give me that thing.

816
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:44,739
Weapon like this, needs to be in
the hands of somebody responsible.

817
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:47,242
What?

818
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:50,036
Hail, Galaxar?

819
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:52,872
–Monsters
–<i>Monsters.</i>

820
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:55,166
Monsters?

821
01:12:55,208 --> 01:13:01,423
Attention. All aliens,
destroy all monsters.

822
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:05,677
You want some of this?

823
01:13:08,513 --> 01:13:14,978
You wanna hurt my friend.
You'll have to go through me.

824
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,939
Oh, yeah.

825
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:50,221
Looks like we made it.

826
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:11,868
–OMG.
–<i>Good morning, intruder.</i>

827
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:17,999
<i>You'll never figure
out my color code.</i>

828
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:24,297
A hexadecimal colorcode system.
This won't be, but a moment.

829
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:34,641
Red, green, blue, yellow, orange, baby
blue, purple, pink, brown, mocca, avocado…

830
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:40,271
Doc, come on! Dance.

831
01:14:40,313 --> 01:14:45,070
<i>Your bustied tired dance moves are
no match for my security protocols.</i>

832
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,570
We can't hold them
off much longer.

833
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:50,200
One thing you don't
know about me, my dear.

834
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:55,245
My… Ph.D… is in… dance.

835
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:00,208
<i>Security protocol breached</i>

836
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,294
<i>Ship has been set
to self-destruct</i>

837
01:15:03,336 --> 01:15:08,299
<i>Total annihilation
in T minus 6 minutes</i>

838
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:12,971
–What? Launch the invasion then.
–<i>Invasion no longer possible.</i>

839
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:22,731
Oh, spaceballs. Divert the Quantonium to
the bridge and prepare my escape capsule.

840
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:38,455
Look at that. They're all
running scared. Monsters win.

841
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,458
I don't think that's
why they're running.

842
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:47,005
<i>Ship will self desturct
in T minus 5 minutes</i>

843
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:50,342
Hail Gallahxar.

844
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:54,888
We are not gonna make it.

845
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,437
Hang on.

846
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:21,331
That's no use.
It won't budge.

847
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,960
If I was still Ginormica,
I could do this.

848
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,546
Susan. Get out of here while
you still got the chance.

849
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:30,048
No, don't say that.
I'm not leaving you guys.

850
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:34,596
Yes you are. Rendez-vous with Monguer.
He is outside the ship, waiting for you.

851
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:37,097
Go, while there's still time.

852
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:42,018
<i>Ship will self destruct
in T minus 4 minutes</i>

853
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,983
Don't you worry about us, Susan. You finally
have the chance to get your old life back.

854
01:16:47,023 --> 01:16:52,028
I don't want my old life back.

855
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,454
They think they've stopped me?
They've stopped nothing!

856
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:08,878
<i>Female carbon based lifeform
or “Susan” not contained</i>

857
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:20,557
Attention robot probes.
Crash the earthling.

858
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,337
<i>Robot bay has been destroyed</i>

859
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:54,674
Fire phaseoids cannon.

860
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:18,448
Are you crazy?
You could've killed me!

861
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:20,285
Then we understand each other.

862
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:23,912
Now, open the doors
and let my friends go.

863
01:18:23,953 --> 01:18:25,330
Or what?

864
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:30,335
You don't actually think you
are a match for me, do you?

865
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:35,382
<i>Quantonium has been
successfully diverted to the bridge</i>

866
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:38,718
<i>Escape capsule,
ready for transport</i>

867
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:44,557
Like I told you before. You should've
defeated me when you had the Quantonium.

868
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:48,520
Have fun exploding.

869
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,005
Now, open the doors!

870
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,507
Even if I wanted to I couldn't.

871
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:20,929
That's what happens when you
set the ship to self-destruct.

872
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:22,637
Now we're all gonna die.

873
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,058
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

874
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:27,892
Susan…

875
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:30,770
I wouldn't be so sure.

876
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:35,400
And the name is Ginormica.

877
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:50,415
<i>Total annihilation in
T minus 1 minute</i>

878
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:53,878
–It's been an honor knowing you, Doc.
–The feeling is mutual, my friend.

879
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:56,629
I'll see you guys
tomorrow. For lunch.

880
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,800
–That's right, Bob.
–There'll be candy, cake, balloons.

881
01:20:00,842 --> 01:20:02,761
Cake and balloons for lunch?

882
01:20:02,802 --> 01:20:09,809
It's got to be the best
day ever. I love you guys.

883
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:45,428
<i>Total annihilation
in T minus 30 seconds</i>

884
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:48,932
Where's Monguer?

885
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:50,477
He's supposed to be here.

886
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:57,482
He said the only reason he
wouldn't be here is if he was dead.

887
01:20:57,524 --> 01:21:00,318
Or late.

888
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:07,158
Insectosaurus.
You're alive!

889
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,496
And you're a butterfly.

890
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:17,293
<i>8, 7, 6, 5, 4…</i>

891
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:27,345
–<i>3, 2, 1…</i>
–Come on, come on.

892
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:36,146
<i>Hmm, nothing happened.
Maybe my count—</i>

893
01:22:01,629 --> 01:22:04,632
Oh, great.

894
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:08,636
Oh, boy!

895
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,472
Susie-Q!

896
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:13,141
–Daddy!
–Oh, Susan.

897
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:16,811
Ever since you were a
baby I knew that some day,

898
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:21,151
you would, you know, save the Earth
from an invasion from outer space.

899
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:24,152
Thank you, but it
wasn't just me, mom.

900
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:27,238
Excuse me. Hello. Coming
through. How are you?

901
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,615
Susan!

902
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:29,908
Derek?

903
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:33,330
Baby, I thought long and hard
about what happened between us.

904
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:37,874
And I want you to
know, I forgive you.

905
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,501
You forgive me?

906
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:42,255
Of course. It wasn't your
fault you got hit by a

907
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:45,216
meteor and ruined everything.
And you know what?

908
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:47,302
I say maybe you
didn't ruin everything.

909
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:52,681
I just got a call from New York.
They offered me network.

910
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:55,894
All I have to do is get an
exclusive interview from you.

911
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:56,893
Really?

912
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:00,772
Yeah, I get my dream job
and you get your dream guy.

913
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:04,567
It's a win-win for team Dietl.

914
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:08,822
Derek, that's amazing.

915
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:10,949
Is the camera rolling?

916
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,868
Absolutely…

917
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:17,999
Good. Because I wouldn't want
your fans out there to miss this.

918
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:20,000
This is Susan Murphy saying…

919
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:23,837
Goood byeee Derek!

920
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:31,136
Bob, could you…?

921
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:37,934
Derek, you are a selfish
jerk. And guess what?

922
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:40,645
I've met someone else.
She's lime green.

923
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:43,817
She has 14 little chunks of
pineapple inside of her.

924
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:47,360
And she is everything
I deserve in life.

925
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:53,908
I'm happy now, Derek,
without you. It's over.

926
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:56,202
Monsters!

927
01:23:56,244 --> 01:24:00,417
I'm so proud of you I could cry, if
I hadn't lost my tear ducts in the war.

928
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:04,417
But now crying will have to wait.
The world needs you again.

929
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:05,630
What is it, General?

930
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,965
Seems a snail fell into
a French nuclear reactor.

931
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:16,723
As we speak, Escargetua is
slowly making its way to Paris.

932
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:19,602
Well, I've always
wanted to go to Paris.

933
01:24:19,642 --> 01:24:21,144
Now, who's with me?

934
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:25,982
What do you say
Butter-Fly-Sauros?

935
01:24:26,024 --> 01:24:27,150
We're in.

936
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:32,072
–I'm in!
–Count me in, too.

937
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:39,037
Au revoir, sweetie.
Have a safe flight.

938
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:42,874
Yeah.
And hang on.

939
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:57,097
Goodbye, Derek.
Good luck getting over me.

940
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:01,101
Ahh, Bob. It's me,
he's never gonna get over.

941
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:05,355
Wait, wait, wait.
You were dating Derek too?

942
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:09,484
That two-timing jerk!
