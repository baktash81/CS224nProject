1
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,344
(buzzer)

2
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,680
One, two...

3
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,516
- (buzzer)
- ...three, four,

4
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,103
five, six, seven...

5
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,856
- (unlocks door)
- ...eight, nine, 10.

6
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,025
(door opens)

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,321
(muffled screaming)

8
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,867
That was better.

9
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,870
- (grunts)
- (screaming stops)

10
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,508
(door slams)

11
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,676
(woman screaming)

12
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,625
- He got a book on puppy training.
- I know. I saw it.

13
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,126
(tsks)
Oh.

14
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,172
Maybe by Christmas
I can make it work.

15
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,716
- Really?
- Don't say anything yet.

16
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,346
Oh, my God, you are so sexy
when you make secret plans.

17
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,724
(laughs)
Thanks.

18
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,151
Okay.

19
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,947
(engine starts)

20
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,161
- Mom: Love you.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

21
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,830
Mom: When you're at camp
this summer.

22
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,582
- Boy: I can still go to camp?
- Mom: Of course.

23
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,960
Your dad's working six days a week
and I'll be working again soon.

24
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,837
Dad: So let's not worry, huh?
You're going to camp.

25
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,217
Mom:
Thanks, sweetie.

26
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,928
- We'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

27
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,848
Hey, don't take the bus home, okay?

28
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,057
- Take a cab.
- Don't be silly.

29
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,434
- Take a cab.
- No.

30
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,227
You know how expensive
cabs are these days.

31
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,897
No. Another 40 bucks is not gonna
break the mortgage.

32
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,857
Seriously, no bus.

33
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,358
And you wonder
why I love you so much.

34
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,152
- 'Cause I'm a catch.
- I know that.

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,362
Hey, champ, you look after
your mom, okay?

36
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,323
Boy: 'Kay.

37
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,242
- In one ear and out the window.
- (mom laughs)

38
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,205
Boy: Oh, look.
"Shifter" is playing?

39
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,333
Hey, you wanna
go see that instead?

40
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,544
Dad said no way.

41
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,672
Well, Dad's not here.
It's just you and me.

42
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,507
- Really?
- Come on, let's do it.

43
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,218
You're gonna have to hold my hand
during the really scary parts.

44
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,055
- Boy: I'll hold it the whole time.
- (laughs)

45
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,189
Did you see when
that guy's face came off?

46
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,067
No. My eyes were closed
and my ears were shut.

47
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,277
Ugh. Aren't you worried
about nightmares?

48
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,613
- Mom, I'm nine now.
- Ha.

49
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,115
Hi. Can we get a taxi, please?

50
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,742
- Mom. Mom.
- Right away to the--

51
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,954
Oh, you know what? We're good.
We don't need one.

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,372
Thanks.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
Come on.

54
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,380
Let's get you in.

55
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,387
Hey there.
Can we get 1085 Chestnut?

56
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,515
- The big park.
- Driver: Got it.

57
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,142
Mom:
Hey, hon. It's us.

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,686
We are in a cab
and we're on our way home.

59
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,854
- (video game beeping)
- Love you.

60
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,486
- Mom: Dude, what happened?
- Boy: I went through a door.

61
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,154
You watched the movie.
You should know.

62
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,865
Sorry.
Did your face fall off yet?

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,201
- No.
- (laughing)

64
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,537
I can't believe you missed that part.

65
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:41,340
Um, excuse me,
that was our exit.

66
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,387
"Don't take the bus," he says.
"Take a cab."

67
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,555
You gonna call Dad?

68
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,392
Well, I would, but now
I'm not getting any service.

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,688
I think if you just keep
going straight, then-- okay.

70
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,732
Um...
(chuckles)

71
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,317
You know where we are?

72
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,487
Sir? Could you just pull over?

73
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,909
Hey, listen, um...

74
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,995
I've got a child back here
and you're beginning to scare

75
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:15,207
the bejesus out of me,
so if you don't pull over right now,

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,501
then I'm not only gonna report you
to the cab company,

77
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,003
but to the fuckin' police as well!

78
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,171
Pull over!

79
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,215
Boy:
Mom, is everything okay?

80
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,844
Mom: Just let us out, please.
Just stop the car and talk to me.

81
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,846
This is scaring us.

82
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,140
- All right, just let us out here.
- Mom. Mom.

83
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,059
Mom: I won't report you.
I won't say anything.

84
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,188
- Just keep trying the doors.
- No, Mom, I'm staying with you.

85
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,690
Mom:
Open these fucking doors!

86
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,151
- Baby, baby.
- (door handle thudding)

87
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,819
Boy:
I can't! I can't!

88
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,238
- Mom: Let us out of the car!
- (pounding)

89
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,823
Damn it!

90
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,369
Let us out of the fucking car!

91
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,289
Oh, God.

92
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,876
(shouts)
Now, you fucker!

93
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,172
Motherfucker!

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,132
Oh, God.

95
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,842
Okay, he stopped.

96
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,845
- He's getting out.
- Boy: What is happening?

97
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,640
Mom: I'm gonna talk to him.
You're gonna take the phone.

98
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,600
When I scream, "Run,"
you're gonna run.

99
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,268
- It's gonna be okay.
- Boy: No.

100
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,436
- I'll find you.
- Mom, no.

101
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,022
- I will find you, baby.
- No, I'm not leaving without you.

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,483
It's gonna be okay.

103
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,236
- Oh, my God! Wait!
- (crying) Mom!

104
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,321
- Don't you--
- (punch lands)

105
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,542
(crying)
Mom? Please.

106
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,707
Mom, are you okay?

107
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,376
Mom:
Oh, my God.

108
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,546
- (door opens)
- Mom: Look at me. Look at me.

109
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,298
- We're gonna be okay, all right?
- Boy: What does he want?

110
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,466
We're gonna be fine.

111
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,306
Boy:
Leave her alone!

112
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,313
Mom!

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,148
No!

114
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,816
Mom!

115
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,235
Just stay in the car!

116
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,321
- No!
- Mom! Mom!

117
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,990
(screaming)

118
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,159
Mom.

119
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,037
Please. Please. Please.

120
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,378
Mom?

121
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,093
- Mom?
- It's okay.

122
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,595
Mommy's fine, baby.

123
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,972
Mommy's fine.
Just stay in the car.

124
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,142
You're gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

125
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,311
You're gonna be fine, baby.
Stay in the car.

126
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,147
Cover your ears.
Cover your ears.

127
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,754
(mother screaming)

128
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,138
(sobbing)
Mom.

129
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,557
(screaming stops)

130
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,268
No. No!

131
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,562
Mom! Uh.

132
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,079
You look like your mother.

133
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,583
My dad's gonna find you.

134
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,795
If-- if that's what you believe.

135
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,965
(grunts)

136
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,051
Ah!

137
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,767
That is the last free shot
that you will ever get.

138
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,520
You will skip dinner.

139
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,818
(groans)

140
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,032
I want my mom.

141
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,412
Well, she's not coming back, ever,

142
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,582
so get used to it.

143
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,386
Boy: Mom.

144
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,766
(TV turns on)

145
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,316
(clock ticking)

146
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,287
You smell like piss.

147
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,218
I didn't ask for you.

148
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:47,182
But since you're here,
I'm going to make the most of it.

149
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,395
You will have one job.

150
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,105
(opens door)

151
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,107
You do what I say.

152
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,610
You clean up my house.

153
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,406
Garbage bags, mops,
bucket, broom--

154
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,575
they are your tools.

155
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,453
Breakfast.

156
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,997
You will serve me breakfast

157
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:14,501
every morning
for the rest of your life.

158
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:19,756
You will not eat or drink anything
without my permission.

159
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,511
You only eat after I have eaten,

160
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,723
and only what I have
left on my plate.

161
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,977
- (button clicks)
- (buzzer)

162
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,812
You hear that?

163
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,690
That means that
I'm bringing one back.

164
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,069
You have 10 seconds
to open these locks.

165
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,993
Every night I bring home
a newspaper.

166
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,498
After I finish reading it,
I want you to try and find stories

167
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,167
about missing people.

168
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,586
You cut them out
nice and neat...

169
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,754
The licenses.

170
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,757
...and you put them
in the scrapbook.

171
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,760
Cash. See?

172
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,057
There is no phone in this house.

173
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,102
The TV is off limits unless I offer it.

174
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,025
If someone knocks at the--

175
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,194
well, no one's gonna knock.

176
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,784
If you steal from me,
you get a beating.

177
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,204
If you try and escape
or you don't keep the house clean,

178
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,623
you get a beating.

179
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,753
If you make me nervous
or get in my way at all, a beating.

180
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,466
From now on, this is your world.

181
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:50,847
It is only you, me, and them.

182
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,774
I will call you Rabbit.

183
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,944
(wind howling)

184
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,914
On page 12,
there is a nice piece

185
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:21,003
about you
and your mother missing.

186
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,967
Put it in the scrapbook.

187
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,308
(door opens, closes)

188
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,567
(car engine starts)

189
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,155
(garage door opens)

190
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,909
(garage door closes)

191
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,514
(grunts)

192
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,011
You going somewhere, Rabbit?

193
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,724
You get an A for effort.

194
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,270
I know every move that you make.

195
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,902
Help!

196
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,532
Everything you do
I let you do!

197
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,201
Go ahead, let it out.

198
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,955
Help!

199
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,748
- Somebody!
- Let it out.

200
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,792
- Help!
- That's it.

201
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,794
- Let it go. Let it go.
- Help, somebody!

202
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,922
- Come on.
- Help!

203
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,466
Dad!

204
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,262
You are so fucking predictable.

205
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,888
Somebody!

206
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,808
And a fucking embarrassment.

207
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,768
Help!

208
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,147
Come on.

209
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,734
Come on, Rabbit.

210
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,904
Hey, Rabbit,

211
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,948
what are you gonna do with that?

212
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,372
Don't be a quitter.

213
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,420
Rabbit, you have to follow through.

214
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:13,049
Following through
is the key to life.

215
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,136
Come on down.
I'll tell you what--

216
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,807
you come down and I will
give you a running start.

217
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,185
Go ahead.
Come on.

218
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,856
Come on, kid!

219
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,651
Come on, kid.
That's it.

220
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,779
That's it. Go.

221
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,742
Come on,
give it all you've got.

222
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,162
Come on, let it go, kid.

223
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,040
Let it go, kid.
Come on.

224
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,836
You're a paper doll.

225
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,138
(scrubbing)

226
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,218
(crying)

227
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,265
(mock crying)

228
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,143
(crying)

229
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,902
(door slams)

230
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:05,495
(Bob crying)

231
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,627
(TV playing)

232
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,039
Women love flowers.

233
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,707
Reporter on TV:
...aren't releasing any information

234
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,877
until they complete
their investigation.

235
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,130
A government bill that cracked down
on laboratory experiments on animals

236
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,215
is expected to become law today.

237
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,427
Animal rights activists have been
pushing for the bill for nine years

238
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,471
and have taken part
in mass demonstrations

239
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,306
throughout the nation.

240
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,397
Thanks.

241
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,744
2314 Grafton.

242
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,218
I'm... real sorry, Dad.

243
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,183
- Dad--
- Not a fucking word.

244
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,857
(slaps)

245
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,577
I've known you all your life...

246
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,206
and you're nothing special.

247
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,419
You're nothing special.

248
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,757
(grunts, slaps)

249
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,000
(door closes)

250
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,169
(chains rattling)

251
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:26,339
Did your dad toss a ball around

252
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,259
with you in the backyard?

253
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,053
You know, after school,
like-- or Sundays?

254
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,599
I mean,
did he do things with you,

255
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,477
teach you things?

256
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,521
Or was he just fucked?

257
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,197
Do you want to learn things?

258
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,324
To really learn?

259
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,704
Because it's important
as hell to know shit.

260
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:02,125
Otherwise, people will--
they will walk all over you.

261
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,425
I got things

262
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,386
that you should learn.

263
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,054
Okay.

264
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,399
You are not going to be ignorant.

265
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,446
You're going to study
and you're going to learn.

266
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,455
- About what?
- People--

267
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,458
what makes them tick,
what makes them work,

268
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,711
what's in the gut and the head.

269
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,091
Why?

270
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,677
Because without education,
you're fucked.

271
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,768
I mean,
you've seen some things.

272
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,398
I've showed you
some things for sure,

273
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,817
but you haven't understood them.

274
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,159
You ever do a puzzle?

275
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,245
You know, the kind of puzzle
that has the picture

276
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,956
on the outside of the box?

277
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,000
That's what people are--

278
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,629
pictures on the outside,
pieces inside.

279
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:39,305
This book is about
the human puzzle.

280
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,602
You study this,
you learn it,

281
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,689
and you know how to take people apart,
put them back together,

282
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,691
understand them.

283
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,484
Oh.

284
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,947
So study it and--
just study.

285
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,741
You don't want to be
shackled to this house

286
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,201
for the rest of your life,
do you?

287
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,619
- No.
- Good.

288
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,288
There's hope for you yet.

289
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:08,501
So, study hard,

290
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,715
and then maybe you and I can
work out a deal.

291
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,801
A deal for what?

292
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,928
Some freedom.

293
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,432
You know, get off the chain,
get out of the house,

294
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,392
get a girl.

295
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,519
You're older now.

296
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,273
I think that...

297
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,278
you should have a taste
of a woman real soon.

298
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,209
I won't take the puzzles apart.
I won't kill them.

299
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,090
(sighs)

300
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,429
I give you a gift of knowledge

301
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,557
and you fuck it away!

302
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,102
You are looking to be shackled
to this fucking wall

303
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,563
for the rest of your life, mister.

304
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:32,085
I wasn't gonna show you this,
but now that you're being a shit...

305
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,506
That's your dad.

306
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,674
He remarried.

307
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,552
Dad.

308
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,016
He's got a new wife, a new life.

309
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,562
You see this, kid?

310
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,606
That is not someone
that misses you.

311
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:02,156
You got me and no one else.

312
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,622
Here, have a beer.

313
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,670
No, thank you.

314
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,804
- Can I still study the books?
- Yeah, have at it.

315
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,723
That's good.

316
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,852
- Give me an answer.
- I-- I'm not sure.

317
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,438
That's not the answer I'm looking for,
not by a long shot.

318
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,315
But I'm not sure.

319
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,192
If we gotta stay here all night,
then that's what we'll do--

320
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,235
we'll stay here all night.

321
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,589
Bob: All right, give me
your best guess.

322
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,092
- It could be...
- Yes?

323
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,094
...small-cell carcinoma?

324
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,263
Yes. Nice. Good.

325
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,015
That's good.

326
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,244
(woman screams)

327
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,165
(screaming continues)
No!

328
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,920
No!

329
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,713
(thuds)

330
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,343
(woman screams)

331
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,929
- (thuds)
- (man yells)

332
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,264
(door opens)

333
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:50,950
(murmuring)

334
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,750
How do I get out of here?

335
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,550
Which way?

336
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:12,221
Which way is out?

337
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,809
I'll take you with me.

338
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,981
I don't want your fucking blanket!

339
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,067
Please!
I just wanna go home.

340
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,153
How the fuck do I get out of--

341
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,738
(dull thud)

342
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,089
(crow cawing)

343
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,883
Go.

344
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,393
That's it.
Come on.

345
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,692
That's what you want
in a girl-- some fight.

346
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,779
There's no sport in easy.

347
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,787
- You thinking stupid thoughts?
- No.

348
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,414
No, I'm not thinking,
just listening.

349
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,208
Good.

350
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,918
Listening is good.

351
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,344
Come on.

352
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,724
She was quite a ride, too.

353
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,853
She sure could run.

354
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,150
Hey, let's play.

355
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,695
Come on.

356
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,863
Come on, one round.
Come on.

357
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,204
Okay. Okay.

358
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,039
Okay.

359
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,263
All right.

360
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:30,025
Ellen Rand.

361
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,944
22 years old.

362
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:36,407
Her birthday:
February the 19th.

363
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,952
Lied like a rug
about her weight big time.

364
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,627
Thank you.

365
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,013
Jennifer Elizabeth Wyatt.

366
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,730
1642 Melvin Road, apartment 7.

367
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,691
Organ donor.

368
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,402
Born September 7th.

369
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,363
And you said that she was honest
about her weight.

370
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,616
She put 126.

371
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,080
I don't know about weight.

372
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,958
Well, you will.

373
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,478
You'd better go in.

374
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,780
Well, there they are now.

375
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,032
Your mother's been
worried sick about you boys.

376
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,708
- Man: School good today, Bobby?
- Yeah.

377
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,710
Lying sack of shit!

378
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,421
(bangs)

379
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,553
You think you're better than I am
just because I got laid off?

380
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,931
Aren't you, Bobby?

381
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,894
Big man making money.

382
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,354
(groans)

383
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,066
(Bob groaning)

384
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,445
You're such a big man now.
Let's see you in action.

385
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,114
(Bob crying)

386
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,744
Get your fuckin' clothes off,
Bobby, now!

387
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,955
(shouting)

388
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,624
Man:
Take him, Joanne.

389
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,919
Put him inside you.
Let him show you how big he is.

390
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,629
(crying)
It's okay.

391
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,467
(shouting)

392
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,597
(crying)

393
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,058
You're a fucking whore, Joanne.

394
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,268
(crying)

395
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,647
It's okay.

396
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,069
Get off me.

397
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,612
Honey.

398
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,869
(Bob shouts)

399
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,976
(screaming)

400
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,436
(panting)

401
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,799
(girl giggling)

402
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,183
Hi. Hi.

403
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,227
I'm Mary.
(hiccups)

404
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,021
Mary.

405
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,277
I need to pee.
(laughing)

406
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,905
Which way is the powder room?

407
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,704
Which way?

408
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,873
I gotta go.

409
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,421
Please?

410
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,173
I gotta go.

411
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,219
Show her where
the powder room is, Rabbit.

412
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,305
Show me.

413
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,517
Oh.

414
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,563
Not that powder room.

415
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,273
The other one.

416
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,032
- Oh!
- (chains rattling)

417
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,451
Ooh, kinky.

418
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,412
You're gonna tie me up?
(laughing)

419
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,375
You guys.

420
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,128
That's not cool.

421
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:27,049
Gotta be...

422
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,636
I guess you could smoke.
I'd rather you didn't.

423
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,055
(laughs)
You'd rather I didn't?

424
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,390
Okay, well, I have to pee.

425
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,559
So if you're gonna hold out
on the powder room,

426
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,603
I'm gonna smoke.

427
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,313
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- (lighter clicking)

428
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,274
Remember I saw you dancing?

429
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,194
- Yeah.
- Remember?

430
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,571
I love dancing.

431
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:52,116
But you didn't dance.

432
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,660
(humming)

433
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,371
- It's--
- (girl laughs)

434
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,376
It's okay. Everything is--
it's gonna be okay.

435
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,211
(pats)

436
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,466
I think I'm too drunk.

437
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,176
I'm drunk.

438
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

439
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,723
Don't be silly.

440
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,725
Everything will be okay, right?

441
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,144
(giggles)

442
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,312
Well, say it.
Say, "It's okay."

443
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,232
- It's okay.
- Now come here.

444
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,528
It's okay.
It's okay.

445
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,698
It's okay. It's okay.

446
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,200
(gagging)

447
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,605
- Carotid artery.
- Yes, carotid artery.

448
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,773
(gasping)

449
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,605
Mary.

450
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:21,223
(whimpers)

451
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,150
(cries out)

452
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,323
(Rabbit cries out)

453
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,409
(grunts)

454
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,293
(Rabbit grunts)

455
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,297
(Rabbit cries out)

456
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,843
(shouts)

457
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,140
(Rabbit panting)

458
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,726
No!

459
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,894
(sobbing)

460
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,494
Bob:
I got something for you.

461
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,334
This is a school yearbook.

462
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,630
You see?

463
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,799
It has...

464
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,228
Tell me when you see
something you like.

465
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,209
Pick it up.

466
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,044
I don't want it.

467
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,424
Pick it up.

468
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,856
Where do you think that you are
right now on the food chain, Rabbit?

469
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,655
I won't do it.

470
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,871
No kid of mine is gonna grow up

471
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,541
uselessly educated.

472
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,670
I'm not your kid.

473
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,672
The fuck you're not.

474
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,510
Pick it up.

475
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,396
Look around.

476
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,693
What do you see?

477
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,865
Do you see anything that says
that you aren't my kid?

478
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,286
That we aren't family?

479
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,204
Do you see?

480
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,209
Now pick it up.

481
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,961
Pick it up.

482
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,175
Yeah.

483
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,847
Good.

484
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,648
I don't wanna hear a sound
out of you the rest of the night.

485
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,652
I don't wanna know that you exist.

486
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,747
(door opens)

487
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,875
- Thank you.
- (door closes)

488
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,906
Bob:
We made the news again.

489
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,202
They don't know anything,
the cops.

490
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,458
We are a mystery.

491
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:25,337
No evidence.
In one ear and out the window.

492
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,717
It is a good day to be me, Rabbit.

493
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,348
I'm done with this scrapbook.

494
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,360
Good. Right.

495
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,906
It's full.

496
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,534
Well, I will get you another one.

497
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,703
It's good to keep a record.

498
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,916
Why do you do what you do?

499
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,671
What the fuck?

500
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,965
I asked why you do what you do.

501
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,053
- Why do you do what you do?
- You make me.

502
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,432
Well, that is a good answer.

503
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,851
Then I guess they make me
do what I do.

504
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,272
Who does?

505
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:30,110
Them...

506
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,238
under the dirt, in the book.

507
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,989
Them.

508
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,745
They never asked to be murdered.

509
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,548
Oh, you are

510
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,925
growing a pair all of a sudden.

511
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,475
And they did.

512
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,603
- They asked.
- When?

513
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,654
The day that they were
fuckin' born.

514
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,242
I don't understand.

515
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,995
Oh, you fuckin'...

516
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,836
You are f--

517
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:34,299
are you trying to make me
fucking insane?

518
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,802
Do I have to spell it out for you?

519
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,346
They are all fucking whores!

520
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,974
They are all fucking sluts!

521
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,103
They seemed like
nice people to me.

522
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,856
(mocks) "They seemed
like nice people to me."

523
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,235
Oh, you are--

524
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,405
oh, you gotta get laid.

525
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,200
You are getting fucked up
in the head.

526
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,877
Gotta get your taste
of a woman for sure.

527
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,091
Nothing like the taste of a woman
to make you clear.

528
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,791
(silent)

529
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,885
Did you find one yet?

530
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,896
We'll see.

531
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,815
(clears throat)

532
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,945
Somewhere...

533
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,620
Somewhere in here
there is a Mrs. Right.

534
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,961
Somewhere in here.

535
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,030
(whimpers)

536
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,205
Find her. Come on.

537
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,749
Pick one.

538
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,417
Don't be shy.

539
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,003
Don't be shy.
Come on.

540
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,339
Find one.
Find one. Look.

541
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,384
That's it.
Where, oh, where could she be?

542
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,970
Pick one!
Come on.

543
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,030
I think that's a good choice.

544
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,581
Oh, yes.

545
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:54,183
(banging)

546
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,352
(muffled yelling)

547
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:08,114
- (banging continues)
- (Bob humming)

548
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,171
(door opens)

549
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,009
(door closes)

550
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,318
She's ready.

551
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,282
Come on.

552
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,503
Rabbit.
(patting)

553
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,022
(sighs)

554
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,159
You're scared.

555
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,205
That's okay.

556
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,125
Everyone's scared the first time.

557
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,918
Yeah.

558
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,178
(gasps)

559
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,932
(whimpering)

560
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:03,020
Bob:
You said to me that

561
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:07,942
you didn't want to be chained
to the wall your whole life,

562
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,485
didn't you?

563
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,030
Come on.

564
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,743
Let's go.

565
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,172
Come on.

566
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,132
Come on. That's it.
Come on.

567
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,552
Yeah. Come on.
That's it.

568
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,896
There's only one

569
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,816
real way out for you

570
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,444
to prove to me
that I can trust you.

571
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,657
And there's only--

572
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,368
there's only one way to do that.

573
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,248
Yeah.

574
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,377
Let's go.

575
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,884
You gotta prove it to me.

576
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,012
You gotta prove it.
Come on.

577
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,373
(crying)

578
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,766
(groans)

579
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,644
Come on.

580
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,066
- Okay.
- (muffled whimpering)

581
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,443
Be quiet.

582
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:19,448
Quiet to keep the mood.

583
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,077
- Quiet.
- (whimpering stops)

584
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,330
- Yes?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

585
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:36,590
Come on.

586
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,596
Bob:
It's his first time...

587
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,642
so he's a little shy.

588
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,895
Yeah.

589
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,766
You remember
what we talked about?

590
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,896
If you can't do it, I will.

591
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,482
And you know how that
will turn out.

592
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,446
So you keep your head straight.

593
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,494
Have some fun.

594
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,103
(knife clatters)

595
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,456
(clock ticking)

596
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,802
(TV playing)

597
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,274
I'm Angie.

598
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,196
I'm 18.

599
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,786
What's your name?

600
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,168
I'm Rabbit.

601
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,547
Are you gonna hurt me, Rabbit?

602
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,635
I don't want to.

603
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,848
But he's expecting you to.

604
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,322
But you have a knife.

605
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:50,117
Can't we-- can't we just
get out of here?

606
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,786
We can't get out.

607
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,501
How long have you been here?

608
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:06,634
Since I was nine.

609
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,639
I'm sorry, Rabbit.

610
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,436
He hurts you, doesn't he?

611
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:22,399
When he feels like
he should, yes.

612
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:32,451
If you-- if you wanna have sex,
I'll have sex with you.

613
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,995
I'll do any-- anything you want.

614
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,705
I don't want anything.

615
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,918
This isn't about sex.

616
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,507
Then-- then what is it about?

617
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,846
I guess it is about sex
if sex involves killing.

618
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,517
Oh, shit.

619
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,979
But I haven't done either.

620
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:14,451
Have you ever touched a girl?

621
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,627
You can touch me, Rabbit.

622
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:27,506
You can touch me
however you want.

623
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,386
I can show you--

624
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,847
I can show you
how my body works.

625
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,393
I already know
how your body works.

626
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,035
You can have me.

627
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,830
We will do whatever you want.

628
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,724
Am I hurting you?

629
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,230
Are you okay?

630
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,784
Shh, shh.
Shh.

631
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,501
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Shh.

632
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,629
Shh, shh.

633
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,965
(muffled speech)

634
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,676
Rabbit.

635
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,596
- Rabbit!
- Please.

636
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:00,432
Rabbit!

637
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,017
(knife pierces)

638
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:16,740
Go away!

639
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,703
(clock ticking)

640
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,337
(door opens)

641
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,476
(door slams)

642
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,774
I want to hunt.

643
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,906
God damn.

644
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,949
Look who's all grown up.

645
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:19,047
(footsteps approach)

646
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,513
Look at you.
Turn around.

647
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,731
Good.

648
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,400
What do you think?

649
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,485
- About what?
- The chair.

650
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:47,367
- Mine?
- Graduation present.

651
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,813
- It's good.
- Good.

652
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,932
Front passenger side
of the vehicle.

653
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,709
Mom's voice:
Hey, hon. It's us.

654
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,919
We are in a cab
and we're on our way home.

655
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,337
Love you.

656
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,381
Young Rabbit's voice:
Leave her alone! No!

657
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:27,592
- Mom!
- Mom's voice: No! Stay in the car!

658
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,638
(overlapping shouting)

659
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,808
Bob: Let's go.
Let's go.

660
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,978
Let's go. Let's go.

661
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:46,570
Um, so you have to tuck down

662
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,739
until we get into town.

663
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,786
There we go.
That's good.

664
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,175
Bob:
I feel energized.

665
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,762
At night is the best time to hunt.

666
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,599
My vision is clear.

667
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,811
I'm good

668
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,106
being here with you now.

669
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,983
This is good.

670
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,323
You're a good kid.

671
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:38,872
The first thing that
you have to be clear about

672
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,334
is your type.

673
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,588
If you're into prostitution,

674
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,007
maybe get a few of them
under your belt,

675
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:52,135
and then move
onto something else.

676
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,934
If you come across
one like that--

677
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,812
look at her,

678
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:06,608
all buttoned up like she's never
sucked on a cock before.

679
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,111
Well, you can bet that she has.

680
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,866
No.

681
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,493
Okay.

682
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,916
Rabbit:
Where next?

683
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,835
Going to a college campus.

684
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,170
Girls your age.

685
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,842
- Like Angie?
- Yes, like Angie.

686
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,720
l-l don't know.

687
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:45,522
Maybe this is too much too soon.

688
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,277
We'll go back home.

689
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,614
We could watch the movie
of your first time.

690
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,079
You made a movie
of me and Angie?

691
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,248
Yes, I did.
I haven't watched it yet.

692
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,083
That-- that's my private thing.

693
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,003
I-- I don't want you to see
what I did.

694
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:12,507
I told you, I will watch it,
and you will watch it with me.

695
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,010
It's important.

696
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,678
You won't like it.

697
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,972
I-- I don't do it--

698
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,058
I'm not good at it like you are.
You'll be mad.

699
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,604
You can't do it wrong, Rabbit.

700
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:32,152
I'll drive by the college campus,
then we'll go home.

701
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,199
(police radio chatter)

702
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,284
Bob:
Get down.

703
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,303
Okay.

704
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,567
Bob:
What did you do?

705
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,402
No, nothing.
I did everything you wanted.

706
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,529
- Shut up!
- (punches)

707
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,391
Have some fun.

708
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,020
- Am I hurting you?
- If you can't do it, I will.

709
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,526
Go away!

710
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,241
- Angie. No, shh!
- (gasping)

711
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:02,826
- (whimpering)
- Shh, shh.

712
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:07,163
Okay, okay.
Shh. Shh.

713
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,750
I know-- I know
I hurt you real bad,

714
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,253
but you just gotta
stay quiet, okay?

715
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,713
You stabbed me.

716
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,214
I know.

717
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,426
I had to or he would have.

718
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:28,601
I tried to miss the vital organs.

719
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,354
I think I did okay.

720
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,482
How do you know?
Look at me. Look at me.

721
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,152
I told you.
I told you.

722
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,362
I know how your body works.

723
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,449
I've been studying.
You'll be okay.

724
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,410
You'll be okay
for about two days,

725
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:48,288
and then you're gonna get
really sick.

726
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:50,999
Two days?

727
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:58,173
- (cries out)
- Shh!

728
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,842
Shh.
Okay, shh.

729
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,095
I have to hide you.

730
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,182
I have to-- I have to make him
think that you're dead.

731
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,100
(crying)
Oh, God. No.

732
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,811
Okay, you have to trust me.

733
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,022
Okay?

734
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:18,318
You have to trust me.
Okay?

735
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,863
Go limp.
Just go limp.

736
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,324
And don't you make any noise.

737
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,743
Don't make any noise.

738
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,287
Dead girls don't make any noise.

739
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,419
I've seen a lot of dead girls.

740
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,178
Take this.
It's sharp.

741
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:08,618
Please. Please.

742
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,498
(crying)

743
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,464
(garage door opens)

744
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:29,347
(garage door closes)

745
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,437
You need to fix this, Rabbit.

746
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,483
I'm really disappointed.

747
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,362
You need to make it right.

748
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:52,871
And don't further insult me

749
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:56,458
by pretending
like you don't hear me!

750
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,297
You fuck her?

751
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,759
Probably not.

752
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,097
I mean, you could have
at least fucked her.

753
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:17,187
You didn't have to lie to me.
I would have done the rest.

754
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,397
I gotta do it now anyway.

755
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,927
I don't like that
you fuckin' lied to me!

756
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,743
Angie!

757
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:28,591
Angie.

758
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,804
I got a surprising little secret.

759
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:58,788
How are you doing, young lady?

760
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,417
Angie!

761
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,919
- Angie!
- How're you doing, Ange?

762
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,521
Rabbit:
Angie! Don't hurt her!

763
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,608
Bob:
Angie!

764
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,735
Ah, fuck!

765
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,615
(screaming)

766
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,908
Rabbit:
Angie!

767
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:40,496
Angie. Angie!

768
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:42,957
Come here, you fucking whore!

769
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,838
Rabbit: No!
(yelling)

770
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,096
- Get off of me!
- What did you do?!

771
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,071
(groaning)

772
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,531
Fuck.

773
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,830
I knew that you were thinking it.

774
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,375
Shut up.

775
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,835
Rabbit,

776
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,629
you can't do this.

777
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,729
Rabbit.

778
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,951
(dog barking)

779
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,167
(doorbell rings)

780
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,794
Marie, the dog should be out back.

781
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,757
What you selling?

782
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:58,468
You don't recognize me?

783
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,178
No, I don't.
Should I?

784
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,556
I always wanted a puppy.

785
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,516
Yeah, well, I'm about ready
to give you ours.

786
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,852
- Come on, Marie.
- You said we couldn't afford it.

787
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,856
I said what?

788
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,696
- Tim?
- I'm so sorry.

789
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:24,994
- Tim, is that you?
- Tim?

790
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:27,663
Your son Tim?

791
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:30,666
My, God, Tim, you're alive.

792
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,008
Take the puppy out back.
Go on.

793
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,427
Take the puppy.
Go, go, go.

794
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:43,513
Come in, then.
Come in.

795
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,057
Marie: Come in, hon.
Please, come.

796
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:51,604
Come in, son.
Come in.

797
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,523
(door closes)

798
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,400
How-- how did you find me?

799
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,738
Where have you been?

800
01:26:04,535 --> 01:26:06,869
Where have you been, Tim?

801
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,750
He-- he killed Mom.

802
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,921
I'm so sorry.

803
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,590
You're safe now, honey.

804
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,134
I just wanna know why, Dad.

805
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:29,600
- You gave this to your brother.
- Oh, no.

806
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:32,061
Honey, he doesn't have a brother.
You're confused.

807
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,689
He doesn't-- you--
you don't have a brother.

808
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,482
- No, I don't have a brother.
- Like old hand-me-down clothes,

809
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:40,152
you just-- you just gave us away.

810
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,904
Tim, I don't know
what you're talking about.

811
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,782
You told me to look after Mom.

812
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,747
I was just a kid
and I couldn't save her,

813
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,958
and you knew I couldn't save her.

814
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:55,626
- You knew.
- Boy: Mom, Dad,

815
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,795
is everything all right?

816
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,756
I have a brother.

817
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,968
Hey, Marie, take Colin upstairs.

818
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,095
Tim and I need to have a little talk.

819
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:09,140
Go on.
Go up the stairs.

820
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,144
In one ear and out the window.

821
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,315
Get up the stairs, Marie.

822
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,818
Now! Get up the fucking stairs!

823
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,449
I found your letter.

824
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,538
I know where you came from
and I know everything.

825
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:36,500
Robert Fittler,
your older brother--

826
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:39,962
you paid him
to make us go away.

827
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,508
And I'm gonna tell.

828
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,764
You're gonna tell on me?

829
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,935
Hmm?

830
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,565
Go on, get out of here.

831
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,609
You should never have come
to my house.

832
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:02,944
Go on.

833
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,488
I don't even wanna look at you.

834
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,531
Brad, Brad!

835
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,699
- Please! Please!
- Rabbit: I'm gonna tell.

836
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,869
- Goddamn, disgusting piece of shit.
- Marie: Stop! No more!

837
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,663
Stop!

838
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,756
Marie: Okay, okay.
Okay, baby.

839
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,883
Baby, baby.

840
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,927
- (panting)
- Quiet.

841
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:30,638
It's-- it's--

842
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,056
it's okay.

843
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,641
It's o-- ah!

844
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:37,186
- (muffled screaming)
- Be quiet.

845
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,942
- Don't hurt her!
- (gasps)

846
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,747
(gurgling)

847
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:05,506
Okay, okay.

848
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,327
Colin:
Mom? Mom?

849
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,080
Stay in your room, Colin!

850
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,845
(clatters)

851
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,560
(crying)
You need to go.

852
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,438
Go now, okay?

853
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:07,068
Go.

854
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,198
Go!

855
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,659
Go! Go!

856
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,912
(door opens, closes)

857
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,956
Colin:
Mom, what's happening?

858
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,542
- Mom?
- Don't you dare come down here.

859
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,961
Stay in your room, Colin.

860
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,717
Some man broke into my house.

861
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,595
I-- I think they killed my husband.

862
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:37,598
Colin:
No! Daddy!

863
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,193
