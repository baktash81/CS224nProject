1
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,737
<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>
<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>

2
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,526
<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>

3
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:38,613
<i>What?</i>
<i>Drunk in a rain like this?</i>

4
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,398
<i>By the way, let's have a drink.</i>

5
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:41,807
<i>- But...</i>
<i>- Hey, hey...</i>

6
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,696
I thought of a short story
to write tomorrow.

7
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,387
Got a happy ending?
0therwise, I won't publish it.

8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,583
It'll be an epic, it starts
long ago, let's say, in 1980.

9
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,018
Be prepared for a shitty ending
with old fogey people!

10
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,162
- What?
- Well...

11
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,016
- Have I said it's raining?
- We're getting soaked wet!

12
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:58,155
Shut up, Antonio!

13
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:00,365
Let me tell you how it starts:

14
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:15,883
Recent news! Extra! Extra!

15
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:18,134
Recent news! Extra!

16
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,624
<i>That's how I first met her.</i>
<i>Where did you want me to start?</i>

17
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:25,015
<i>It is not an original start, but</i>
<i>it's classic and has substance.</i>

18
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,552
<i>Let geniuses play around with</i>
<i>story form, not me.</i>

19
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:34,063
<i>I'm just Jorge Pellegrini, granted</i>
<i>Best New Writer Award in 1974...</i>

20
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:36,175
<i>and America Award in 1975...</i>

21
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,581
<i>which I spent on a trip</i>
<i>to Europe in 1976.</i>

22
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:41,844
<i>3 months later, Europe was riding</i>
<i>high, Argentina was in deep water...</i>

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,831
<i>and I was in Argentina.</i>

24
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,474
<i>What was I to do? So many ideas,</i>
<i>so much talent, so little reward?</i>

25
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:51,443
Jorgito! If I weren't dying to take
a piss, I'd hug you!

26
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,359
<i>Keep on writing, wherever.</i>
<i>This magazine's called "Things".</i>

27
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,212
<i>Affectionately nicknamed</i>
<i>"Little Thingy".</i>

28
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,233
<i>I trust you won't show up</i>
<i>at closing day.</i>

29
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,314
Longer than 4 pages I can't publish.

30
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>Well, don't ever show up.</i>

31
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,497
- I'll get this call, Pepa.
- Five pages, but they're superb.

32
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,837
Five superb won't do.
Three "average" will.

33
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,718
"Average" is just perfect for this
magazine. We like average.

34
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,573
We must squeeze to fit
one page less this week.

35
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:14,106
You probably cut out the dream
about the roller coaster...

36
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,569
...and her friends, dead and alive.
- It didn't make sense, Jorge!

37
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,007
Beautiful, but didn't make sense.

38
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:20,592
It's the only sign of her desire.

39
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:23,479
With no such dream, what would she
want? Who would she look for?

40
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,585
- Who would be interested?
- Come here, Micky.

41
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:29,016
Do me a favor, will you?
Bring me two pounds of coffee.

42
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,283
- I'm working late tonight.
- Sure, Mr. Márquez.

43
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:35,193
- Anything else?
- Hey, Micky! Micky, come here!

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,115
You're in a tight spot, huh?

45
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:42,483
Who will you please first?

46
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:46,001
Your mentor, your colleague,
your role model, your friend...

47
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,343
or the director?

48
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,158
Hard choice, isn't it?

49
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,063
Go ahead and see what she wants,
don't be silly.

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,951
I'll bring your coffee on my
way back, Mr. Márquez.

51
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,579
<i>- Mr. Roberto?</i>
- Yes, what is it?

52
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,729
<i>Mr. Mastronardi is here.</i>

53
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,907
Holly shit! Haven't I told you
I'm busy and can't see Mastronardi?

54
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,898
- Mastronardi!
- What's up, Jorgito, how are you?

55
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:10,996
- How are you?
- What's up, Márquez?

56
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:15,802
So, how are things?
Got a placement yet?

57
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:17,404
Roberto, can I have a word with you?

58
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,091
Sure.

59
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,809
Will you stay here?
Long time no see, how are you?

60
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,021
Should we go upstairs to talk?

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,589
- We can be more at ease there.
- All right.

62
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:30,295
Uncle grandpa Márquez looks sad.
Let's see what's up with him.

63
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:37,461
This crossword is so difficult.
I can't get it right.

64
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,758
River that runs in Northern Italy.
Two-letter word.

65
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,380
- Do you know what it is?
- You really don't know?

66
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,365
- If I knew I wouldn't be asking...
- River Po, you dummy!

67
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:49,047
Po! Holly cow! 0f course!

68
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:54,491
- What do you want? Money?
- No, I've still got some.

69
00:04:54,847 --> 00:05:00,117
The point is I'm going mad.
I'm a journalist, you see?

70
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,212
Don't tell me there's no job for me.
I'll take the counseling column.

71
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,586
But I'm just a John Doe here,
Mastronardi.

72
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,376
No way, sir.

73
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,088
You're the secretary
of this magazine.

74
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,717
Just give me the lowliest job.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,538
Give you the lowliest job?
Are you nuts?

76
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:19,157
I will never agree to this.

77
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,360
You see? You should've
stayed in Spain.

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,862
You were getting along just fine,
why did you come back?

79
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:28,122
If you can't understand the
journalist, let alone the homesick.

80
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,167
You're the one to blame,
pulling a tough guy attitude.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,782
What were you thinking?
Writing against censorship?

82
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:36,351
In this magazine, censorship or not,
we're always talking nonsense.

83
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,879
Thank God you left in time.

84
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:42,106
Now's different. There's some ground
for action, that's why I came back.

85
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:46,778
Dear friend, you never change.
"Ground for action"?

86
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:49,399
The black lists keep
on going, man.

87
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,642
There's no way I can give you a job,
Mastronardi, no way.

88
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,122
Fuck, man, you're making
me feel like shit.

89
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,224
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
You have no idea how I like you.

90
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:09,149
After all, who brought
you to the magazine?

91
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,556
Who taught you everything you know?

92
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:11,998
Who gave you your first assignment?

93
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:16,220
The last thing I want is to make
you feel like shit, buddy.

94
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:19,163
Let's go, Sebi. Bye, everyone!
See you around, okay?

95
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,751
- Mastronardi?
- What?

96
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:24,220
Are you all right?

97
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,393
When can you come and dine with us?

98
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,345
- Sonia's always asking about you.
- 0K, but this time it's on me.

99
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,441
Let's be fair. Ten thousand
dinners on you, one on me.

100
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,912
Are you sure everything is fine?

101
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,647
- You know the director, don't you?
- Yes.

102
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:42,975
If you, please,
could talk to her...

103
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:47,808
I know her,
but I'm not that close.

104
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,272
But I'll see what I can do.

105
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:51,415
- Hi, Jorge.
- Hi, Leti.

106
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,173
Leti, can you hold on?
I have to talk to her.

107
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,726
I'll call you so we can schedule
something, 0K? Great.

108
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:59,451
Give Sonia a kiss from me,
but not too hot.

109
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,797
- Bye, Sebi.
- Bye.

110
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:02,785
Leti...

111
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,333
Leti!

112
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,953
- Leti, are you busy tonight?
- Not at all.

113
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:11,425
So, how about going out
for movie and dinner?

114
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,889
0kay. What are we watching?

A FILM BY MANLl0 CALD0SINI

130
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,831
Well, thank you so much for coming.

131
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,960
Your presence is very important.

132
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:12,478
My work speaks for itself.
Let's hear what you have to say.

133
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:16,030
Let's get into what
I'd call a debate.

134
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:21,512
Sorry, man, but what did
you mean with this film?

135
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,776
Really, man...

136
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,359
your attitude is so gross...

137
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:30,977
you make me feel like a victim
of low pressure with such comment.

138
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:34,855
I have to come out and state the
obvious: Art can't be explained.

139
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,439
You can't explain art. If you can
understand, fine; if you can't, fine.

140
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,650
If you liked, fine;
if you didn't, fine.

141
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,237
If you can feel it, fine;
If you can't, fine.

142
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,829
End of debate!

143
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:51,498
Well, to wrap it up,
I want to thank the person who...

144
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,374
is the real brain
behind all this, 0K?

145
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:59,208
I'm talking about Jorge Pellegrini,
author of the original short story.

146
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:02,185
Let's hear it for Jorge.

147
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:08,291
Jorge, I think this was
a good mix between...

148
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,425
your flight and my...
my "nothing".

149
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,694
You took off and I just
tagged along.

150
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:18,722
Thank you. Well, my
short story is one thing...

151
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,509
and this...

152
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,450
This is yours, from head to toe.

153
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:27,466
From head to toe.

154
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:32,548
I swear it's yours even risking
to be stabbed to death in my back.

155
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,536
Excuse me.

156
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,354
Excuse me...

157
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:39,077
Why did you emphasize
the "repressive"?

158
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,412
- "Repressive"?
- I'm sorry, really sorry.

159
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,020
- Did I hurt you?
- No, I'm fine.

160
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:45,155
- I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
- That's okay.

161
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:48,772
- Say, want a cigarette?
- No, I've quit smoking.

162
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,388
- I loved your performance.
- 0kay, just one.

163
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,386
- Did you study or is just instinct?
- Are you an expert?

164
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,204
Sorry, please, how should I know
you'd be there, spying on us?

165
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,310
Sorry.

166
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,708
Did you enjoy the movie?

167
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,522
- I like how he deals with symbols.
- I thought it was awful.

168
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,856
Me too, but the way
he uses symbols is nice.

169
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,120
It's exactly the way he uses
symbols that I found awful!

170
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,587
Yeah, me too.

171
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:19,881
But you can't laugh, you're the
short story's author.

172
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,690
What short story? He ruined it!
There was nothing left.

173
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,609
The only thing I really liked...

174
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:31,884
was the scene when you let
rain fall on your face.

175
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,021
- Seriously, you liked that?
- I loved it.

176
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:37,223
It was my idea. I fought
with everyone for it.

177
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,310
- When I set my mind to something...
- Unbelievable!

178
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,096
That's the kind of thing I do.

179
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:43,750
I love driving with
the window down...

180
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,128
to feel the rain on my face.

181
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:46,985
I like it so much
that I want to use in a story.

182
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:50,182
A pack of Parissiennes, please?

183
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:54,089
It's $ 1.800.

184
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,255
Thanks.

185
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:02,798
- Do you believe in fate?
- Either you do or you get done.

186
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:07,941
When Manlio showed me your
story I said "finally!"

187
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,794
I've been reading your work since
it came out in "Golden Scarab".

188
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,901
- Really?
- Yes.

189
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,111
I loved your short stories.

190
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:20,233
They were stronger...
more political...

191
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:24,905
- Now they are more...
- Humane?

192
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:28,454
That's it. Right.

193
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:32,333
Such good story made into something
that serves nothing but his ego!

194
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,765
"To serve or not to serve,
that's the question"?

195
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:39,656
It might be a "professional
malformation", since I serve...

196
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,924
in a restaurant. I'm a waitress.

197
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:45,194
Have one of my cards.

198
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:46,888
"Alfonsina del Mar"?

199
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,254
You don't say! Considering your age,
I thought of a name as "Graciela"...

200
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,352
- Monica...
- No, my name is Laura.

201
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:56,554
"Alfonsina del Mar" is where I work.

202
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,601
Jorge... Pellegrini.

203
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,823
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

204
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,246
I loved your short story.
You have something of Cortázar.

205
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,330
Yes, a poster.

206
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:15,917
I'm serious, something like "paths
that never cross each other".

207
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:21,937
0n a second reading, you realize
that the character needs to do...

208
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,651
something remarkable...

209
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,712
that, when people
listen to it or read it...

210
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,468
it'll somehow make
a change in their lives.

211
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,344
It touched my heart.

212
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,306
"0n a second reading"?

213
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,562
Wanna go somewhere for a drink?

214
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,690
- There you are! You ran away!
- Marita.

215
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,779
Laurita,
I didn't understand a thing!

216
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,630
This is Jorge Pellegrini,
the short story writer.

217
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,769
- Marita, my friend.
- How do you do?

218
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:57,419
It was an interesting idea,
you looked beautiful, Laura...

219
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:00,883
...but I didn't understand a thing.
- Let's have something to drink?

220
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:03,345
- We gotta go to work.
- All right.

221
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,770
- Yes.
- Let's go.

222
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:09,041
- Bye.
- Bye.

223
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:11,441
- Bye.
- Bye.

224
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:20,243
- So let's have dinner?
- You know what?

225
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:24,049
I can't find the meal tickets.
I think I've lost them.

226
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:27,507
- That's 0K, let's go somewhere else.
- You know what, Leti?

227
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,490
I gotta wake up early,
too many things to do.

228
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:30,929
I'll tell you what:

229
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:33,809
Let's have some coffee and
I'll take you home afterwards.

230
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,657
I don't know what's got into me,
I'm up to my neck in work!

231
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:40,687
<i>Who was the first</i>
<i>to touch the sky?</i>

232
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,089
<i>Who created the "set phrases"?</i>

233
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,456
<i>Who said the first sayings?</i>

234
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:48,914
- Who pooped this shit?
- Come on, it is not that bad.

235
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:50,736
It sounds too obvious.

236
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:54,547
"When he first met her, he felt
feelings he'd never felt before".

237
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:57,492
What's with you? Drank a whole
bottle of "wordanax"?

238
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:02,640
I know the magazine portrays simple
themes, but you were always good.

239
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,035
- You're right, you're always right.
- What's this, a new story?

240
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,467
I hope it's good,
the other one stinks.

241
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:11,565
- Why? Who said so?
- I said so.

242
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,517
- But why? What's the problem?
- What's the problem?

243
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:19,155
You bad-mouthed the church.
You say there's no heaven.

244
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,839
I won't publish that,
they could send you to hell.

245
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,145
- And believe me, there is a hell.
- Hold on.

246
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:26,132
I wrote this story for the magazine
and I want it published!

247
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,669
Roberto, Sonia Mastronardi
is on the phone.

248
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:30,285
When will you listen to me?

249
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,244
Haven't I told you
I'm not here for Mastronardi?

250
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,349
I'll get it.

251
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,343
Hello, Sonia, it's Jorge. Sorry
I haven't called, I totally forgot.

252
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:46,741
Let me talk to Alfredo,
he probably wants to kill me...

253
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,373
What? Yes...

254
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,345
Yes, I'm still here.

255
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:09,743
How was it?
How did it happen?

256
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,566
Yes.

257
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,953
Where?
Where will you?

258
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,976
Yes, yes.

259
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,710
No, we're heading
down there this minute.

260
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,927
Yes, darling. Bye...

261
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,179
We're going to there right away.

262
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:47,638
It was... a stroke, I guess.

263
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,569
Sonia found him...

264
00:16:55,771 --> 00:17:00,147
over the typewriter. I don't
know what he was writing.

265
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:04,184
I should've met him last week.

266
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm such an asshole!

267
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,778
I'm an asshole.

268
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,979
An asshole...

269
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,301
WHEN THE LAST MINUTE

270
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,842
0F HIS LIFE STARTED

271
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,616
MASTR0NARDI

272
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,986
WR0TE:

273
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,829
"ALF0NSINA DEL MAR"

274
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:25,178
I love working for the wealthy.
See this fat bill all torn?

275
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,244
Do you like
that guy at table 5?

276
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,781
So distinguished.
I'm fucking him tonight.

277
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,949
He looks like those
"Ford Fairlane" ads.

278
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,637
He also looks like he's married.

279
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,846
Deadly war, casualties don't count.

280
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,120
Who cares if he's married?

281
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,677
Want to learn how to do it?
Look.

282
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:53,918
- So you came!
- So I did.

283
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,875
We've just met and already
have nothing to talk about?

284
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:07,097
May I?

285
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,046
- Thank you.
- You could be more careful!

286
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,824
Shit! "Beer, come
this way, please"!

287
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,261
Let it go,
I'm getting my bonus tomorrow.

288
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:19,612
No way. Do you want
peanuts crumbs?

289
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,605
No, thanks. I'll ask the
waiter to wrap it up to go.

290
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,808
You didn't finish the
thing about Accountancy.

291
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,471
How do you know?

292
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,620
You were shoved when you were...

293
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,759
0h, I didn't finish telling you.

294
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,554
- I didn't finish college either.
- Really?

295
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:37,307
I dropped out
when I met my boyfriend.

296
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:39,327
Your boyfriend? I see...

297
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,005
- Excuse me?
- Sure.

298
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:46,300
Do you have a boyfriend?

299
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,181
You have peanuts on your...

300
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:50,938
0h, my.

301
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,259
No, I'm kidding.

302
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:01,152
So you have a boyfriend.

303
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,598
He made you quit college,
I don't get it.

304
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:07,223
No, I decided to quit.

305
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:09,728
There are more accountants than
companies in this country.

306
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,231
And no guts to do anything.

307
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,843
When I met Esteban and saw his
paintings, I felt like painting.

308
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,233
- Truly.
- Are you taking art lessons now?

309
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:21,375
- I'm not sure that's what I want.
- Really?

310
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,710
- A tight spot.
- The thing is...

311
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:28,097
I look at other painters' work such
as Van Gogh's, Renoir's, Esteban's...

312
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,350
Shit, what a threesome!
Resembles a military junta!

313
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,238
I'm serious!

314
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:38,080
Esteban's paintings are so striking.
You must see them.

315
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,836
When he gets back,
I'll introduce you two.

316
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,338
- Back form where?
- Montevideo.

317
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,729
He was invited to take part
in an exhibit of young artists.

318
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:49,754
Great! And why didn't
you go with him?

319
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,710
I saw no reason to.

320
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,243
What would I do there?
I'm going to prepare...

321
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:58,299
an exhibit for him here. He's very
talented, he'll do just fine.

322
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,315
And when I set
my mind to something...

323
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,366
Very well, gentlemen!
Good evening!

324
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:09,858
Just keep yourselves calm
and show me some ID!

325
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,776
- Cardoso, take the other side.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:13,566
- Your ID, miss!
- I haven't got it.

327
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:14,910
Quiet, come on!

328
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,071
Come on! Hurry up!
Come on, get inside!

329
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,862
You, put that cigarette out!

330
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:25,666
0ne by one.
Come on! Get inside, hurry.

331
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,004
Go on, I said. Come on, hurry.

332
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,889
Come on.

333
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,435
Excuse me, officer,
I was in there.

334
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,867
You asked for my ID,
I showed it to you.

335
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,429
The girl I was with
didn't bring her ID...

336
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:43,167
I know she has it, she just didn't
bring it. She paints walls...

337
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,181
I mean, she paints interiors,
not outdoor stuff...

338
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,651
She left her ID at home.

339
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:48,794
She didn't do anything.

340
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:50,340
She's with me,
I'm responsible for her.

341
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:53,023
- And who the hell are you?
- What?

342
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:00,583
- Man, you got a cigarette?
- No.

343
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,543
Are you worried?

344
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,250
Did they make you "play the piano"?

345
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,948
- Sure. Why?
- Don't worry.

346
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,966
It's bad if they don't take your
fingerprints, then you're a goner.

347
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,998
Laura.

348
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,683
Laura...

349
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,985
- Laura...
- I'm here, I'm right here.

350
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:28,289
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

351
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,522
- Let me hold your hand.
- What?

352
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,476
Your hand.

353
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:46,079
- What is going to happen now?
- Nothing.

354
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,369
- Don't be scared.
- No...

355
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,921
I'm fine.

356
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,782
How was dinner?
He's a good catch! Ask him...

357
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,399
...if he's got any friends.
- He went to jail...

358
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:04,488
...just to stay with me.
- Sucker, he should've...

359
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,950
followed you, called your parents
and gotten you out.

360
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,804
That would've been smart.

361
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,522
- That's what Esteban would've done.
- That's a smart guy.

362
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,795
He got lost in Montevideo,
but he's smart.

363
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,450
This guy is a screw-up.
What does he do? He screws up.

364
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,228
I'm not criticizing him. Any sucker
would've done the same.

365
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:21,831
And you loved it, huh?

366
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,619
- I've just gotten to know him.
- Good heavens!

367
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,989
But I know you,
and I know you like him.

368
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,041
And why? Because
you're a sucker too.

369
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:30,406
- Enough!
- Tell me if I'm lying.

370
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:32,742
You quit accountancy
to be an artist in Argentina...

371
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:35,427
which is the same as being
an innkeeper in the South Pole.

372
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,277
You gave up your life for an idiot
who never calls you...

373
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:41,290
- He must be busy.
- In Montevideo? You're sucker, see?

374
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:44,353
He should've returned a week ago.
Never called to say he's sorry.

375
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,857
I've changed my mind: He's not an
idiot, he's a sucker just like you.

376
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,960
Twin souls:
Pelopincho y Cachirula.

377
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,105
- That's old!
- Why should you stand...

378
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:54,951
a guy who never calls when you can
choose among so many suckers?

379
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:58,279
Jorge is a great writer.
He's not a sucker.

380
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:01,345
Who mentioned Jorge?
I was talking of Esteban.

381
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:04,844
You're a bit messed-up,
aren't you?

382
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,970
No, I've been dating Esteban
for a year and a half now.

383
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:10,211
That's very clear to me.

384
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:15,655
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

385
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,222
- I can only stay 5 minutes.
- Yeah, I know.

386
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,330
Sorry about the mess.

387
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:27,013
The maid comes every 0ctober, but she
didn't show up precisely in this one.

388
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,482
- You know I haven't got much time?
- I do.

389
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,612
I just want to give you a present.

390
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:34,985
I should've given it already,
but I just forgot.

391
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,259
Well...

392
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,323
I feel I know you a bit, and
I think you're gonna like it.

393
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:46,278
- No!
- Yes!

394
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,431
I love this book!

395
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:57,058
- Don't you like this book?
- I like you.

396
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,964
This guy's great.
What's his name?

397
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,141
Jorge.

398
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,619
Are you nervous?

399
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,611
Well...

400
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,333
If you don't mind
I have a boyfriend...

401
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,390
- No...
- Yes. Sure, yes...

402
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:25,227
If you want us
to get laid, all right.

403
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,943
- Why would that matter?
- Why do you say you got a boyfriend?

404
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:31,853
- He hasn't called you in 2 months.
- That's my problem, all right?

405
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,482
- You're nervous.
- I don't want to get laid with you!

406
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,589
- I thought so.
- Well, I do, but...

407
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,385
- What else do you want?
- Do you want me to tell you...

408
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:44,432
that I want you, I adore you, I love
you? 0kay! I want you, I love you.

409
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,925
But it sounds corny
if it's out of context. Look:

410
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,684
I want you, I adore you, I love you!
Is it corny or not?

411
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,655
- Well, it didn't sound very nice.
- You see?

412
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,226
I tell you what.

413
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,715
I'll call you.

414
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,376
So...

415
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:15,405
if I can finally come up with
a context, I'll call you.

416
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,232
I'm such an idiot.

417
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:40,009
Such an idiot!

418
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,935
<i>I, Jorge Pellegrini, overwhelmed by</i>
<i>the passion that got a hold of me...</i>

419
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,724
<i>have decided to write a journal...</i>

420
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:53,226
<i>like my illustrious predecessors:</i>
<i>Anne Frank, Mafalda and Little Lulu.</i>

421
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,026
<i>Let's start:</i>

422
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,964
<i>October 14,</i> 1980.

423
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,199
<i>She didn't call me today.</i>

424
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:06,024
<i>Neither today.</i>

425
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:14,576
<i>10 days and she hasn't called me.</i>

426
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,771
- It's personal.
- Go to hell.

427
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,355
<i>November, 2nd.</i>

428
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:29,197
<i>A month has passed since I began a
<i>journal to clear up my feelings.</i>

429
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:32,014
<i>Since Laura didn't have the nerve</i>
<i>to call me, I want her...</i>

430
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:36,434
<i>my feelings and this journal</i>
<i>to go to hell!</i>

431
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,427
<i>Look, mister! Mister!</i>
<i>Look, Mr. Kid.</i>

432
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,523
<i>I know you don't take alms.</i>
<i>This is an invitation.</i>

433
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:50,186
<i>We can split it, if you want.</i>

434
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:52,428
- Alrighty, then.
- Let's split.

435
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:04,081
<i>That was no split.</i>
<i>It was the cube root.</i>

436
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,258
<i>There are 3 prophecies</i>
<i>and 3 warrants.</i>

437
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,364
<i>- 3 prophecies and 3 warrants?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

438
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:12,144
<i>The first prophecy says</i>
<i>someone will come after you.</i>

439
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:14,000
Hello?

440
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:17,743
Laura? Laura who?

441
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:20,080
Laura, of course. I'm sorry.

442
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,507
No, I was a bit absent-minded.

443
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,411
Are you okay?
I was... working.

444
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,907
<i>- 1st one to get will have bad luck.</i>
- When?

445
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:31,825
<i>The second prophecy says:</i>

446
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,772
<i>- A beautiful woman will come by.</i>
- I don't know...

447
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:37,683
No, that's okay.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

448
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,228
Great.

449
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:11,445
Sorry I was late.

450
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:15,534
That's 0K. You said 30 minutes,
it's been only 20.

451
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:19,183
- Not so bad. Want a coffee?
- Yes... Jorge!

452
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,653
Sorry I didn't call you before.

453
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:26,933
When? Don't worry.
I was awfully busy.

454
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,689
Look...

455
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:33,648
I'm not able to date
two guys at the same time.

456
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,823
- I see.
- I'm not like that, you know?

457
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,454
Yes, I know.

458
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:39,479
So before starting
anything with you...

459
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:42,161
I wanted to make sure I didn't
want to wait for him anymore.

460
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,190
Don't worry. Thank you for being
sincere and telling me that.

461
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,832
- What?
- I will not wait for him anymore.

462
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:03,122
Can I ask you one thing?
Can I count on you?

463
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:06,453
- Yes, you can ask whatever you want.
- That's it.

464
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,130
- If I can count on you.
- Sure.

465
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,495
If you never let me down,
I'll never let you down.

466
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,316
You know that when I set
my mind to something...

467
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:47,124
Look at me.

468
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,911
Look into my eyes...

469
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,712
0h, my love!

470
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:11,958
My love. My love...

471
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:41,529
Enough!

472
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,266
Shut up, please.

473
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:59,098
"And started crying like before,
for Natalio's love had taught her...

474
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:03,036
that, to show what she wanted,
she should look into her heart."

475
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:11,926
Sounds corny.

476
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:15,509
- Why?
- Well... it sounds like...

477
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,620
It is not serious, is it?

478
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,996
Why isn't it serious?

479
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,934
I don't get it why you have
to speak of love in terms of...

480
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,532
pain and suffering.

481
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,996
There are other things
to portray a couple.

482
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:31,285
If you sound too... too...

483
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,727
yawpy...

484
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:38,036
- "Yawpy"? What is "yawpy"?
- Yawpy. Yawpy.

485
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:40,121
Fluffy. Yawpy.

486
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,768
- Fluffy? This is fluffy?
- Yes, it is fluffy.

487
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:47,351
- No, not fluffy!
- Yes, it is fluffy.

488
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:51,196
- No good? Isn't it beautiful?
- No, you're beautiful. This is blah.

489
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:54,169
- No, you're a bad girl...
- No...

490
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:56,702
- You're a mean little witch.
- No, I'm good.

491
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:59,198
- A bad witch.
- No, I'm good.

492
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,821
- You're mean, not good.
- I'm a good girl.

493
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,065
You're beautiful and I'm good.

494
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:06,461
Yes, no! No, no, no, no!

495
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,754
Aunt Pelusa's staying home...

496
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:11,863
some days to recover from surgery.

497
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:16,637
I don't mind, a woman doesn't get
her ovaries taken out every day.

498
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:20,095
The point is, I finally convinced
Gerardo to come upstairs.

499
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,136
He's kind of slow, and we were
in such a heat making out...

500
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:27,519
I was totally horny,
when out comes...

501
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:29,655
aunt Pelusa in a nightgown,
her ovaries in a jar.

502
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:33,154
I was... What's that? Don't
get into artistry, I'll show you.

503
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:37,819
There, there and there. She wanted
to change the jar water.

504
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,841
It was kind of dark.
It was like a horror movie!

505
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,977
Gerardo apologized,
got up and left...

506
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:45,561
I thought he was going to the
bathroom, but he left for never more.

507
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,453
What a darn sucker!

508
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,215
You're really crazy.

509
00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:55,040
I'm leaving, Marita,
I'm quitting.

510
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,991
Quitting? 0ut of the blue?

511
00:33:57,186 --> 00:34:00,221
Things can't be hurried like that.
Don't be a sucker.

512
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:14,363
- Good evening, Mr. Pellegrini.
- A romantic dinner?

513
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,090
No, they cut the power off...

514
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,587
I'm using the occasion to celebrate
three very important events.

515
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:22,168
- So tell me.
- The first one...

516
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:25,187
is that I'm so horny tonight...

517
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:33,474
- I raise my glass...
- Second...

518
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:38,524
...it's our anniversary.
- What do you mean?

519
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,855
Well, I'm one month ahead of time, but
power can be restored and... bye-bye.

520
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:49,659
- Even the spoon tastes good.
- True.

521
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:51,322
So?

522
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,266
What's the third event?

523
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,314
I'm pregnant.

524
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:10,526
No need to be afraid, buddy!
0f course I'm not pregnant.

525
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:12,515
- No.
- Don't worry.

526
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,304
- No, it's okay.
- It was a joke.

527
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:16,957
- It's a surprise a bit...
- Sorry, listen:

528
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,321
- I left my job.
- Why? What happened?

529
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:24,479
Nothing, that's why.
I got sick of it and quit.

530
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,533
You dove headfirst, just like that?

531
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:31,199
I got another job. I quit at 11 a.m.
And by 6 p.m. I had another job.

532
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,492
Now I'm a producer for a radio
program about visual arts.

533
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:40,190
A friend from college. I called him,
told him I wanted to work and done!

534
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:41,985
I'll start tomorrow.

535
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,282
The guys have no clues,
I have to prepare the agenda.

536
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,105
I'll begin by calling some people.

537
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,020
Cool. What station is it?

538
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,598
I don't know, a radio station.

539
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,508
But production?

540
00:35:57,703 --> 00:36:01,794
I mean, are you going
to stop painting?

541
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:05,189
No! No! Why should I?

542
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:09,061
No, okay. As long as they pay you
well. Are they paying you well?

543
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,623
- Want some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

544
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:17,693
What's the matter?
Don't tell me they won't pay you.

545
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,343
No, they won't pay me.

546
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,114
If the program takes off, they will.

547
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,945
I'm so happy.

548
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:35,874
- Well... I was happy.
- I'm so sorry. Sorry, you're right.

549
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:40,132
It caught me by surprise,
I'm very happy. Very happy.

550
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,796
No short stories this week. I have
to publish Vilas' work. Can't miss.

551
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:47,902
Vilas again?
Another of his novels?

552
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,960
What novels? Poetry.

553
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,482
You're kidding.

554
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:56,289
I didn't say "Decorative Art",
I said "Art Déco".

555
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:59,305
They're not the same! 0ne is
architecture, the other, decoration.

556
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:02,181
Another is you,
for I can't label you.

557
00:37:03,402 --> 00:37:05,257
Wait a minute.
Are you okay, love?

558
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,457
Well, I have a little problem.

559
00:37:07,786 --> 00:37:11,169
0ne second. Hello?
Are you going to stay there?

560
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:16,355
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Well, they won't...

561
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:18,890
...publish my story this week.
- Why not?

562
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,432
They want to cut part of it. I said
either publish everything or nothing.

563
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:24,904
- Very good.
- There's nothing in this house?

564
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,724
- What do you want?
- Coffee.

565
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:31,650
- They'll publish some shit of theirs.
- Let them go to hell!

566
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,370
It's easy for you to say that.
I don't have the option...

567
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:37,768
of working for free.
I'm going out for coffee.

568
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:45,219
<i>The imports fever came back.</i>

569
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,427
<i>This time, English fabrics...</i>

570
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,701
<i>gained the streets</i>
<i>in a first rate army.</i>

571
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:53,196
- Are you making a toast?
<i>- Argentina nation rises up...</i>

572
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:57,824
- Now it is good!
- Colors! That's it!

573
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:02,340
<i>The government, drunk with pride</i>
<i>due to the country's success...</i>

574
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,501
<i>decided to extend its horizons</i>
<i>and our capacity to feel awe.</i>

575
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,185
<i>To the great Argentine people!</i>
<i>Cheers!</i>

576
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,110
I'm going to the Foreign Ministry.
Can't miss this glorious journey.

577
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,335
English arrogance kneeled
before native alcoholism...

578
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,435
Silvia, it's not my fault
if the check bounced.

579
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:25,834
"Whose fault is it"? Economics'!
Don't you read the papers?

580
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,977
The sum I spent on Marianna's
dance classes...

581
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,923
and Camilo's karate classes
could feed the entire continent!

582
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:34,536
Come at 5:00 p.m.
And get another check.

583
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:39,396
Not at 4:30! I'm working at this time.
Something you could do too.

584
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:42,697
I said at 5:00, Silvia!
Can't you understand? Fuck!

585
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:45,033
At five, I said!
Five, five!

586
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,543
I'm sure she'll get here
at 4:30, dammit!

587
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:52,295
Man, if it weren't for the kids,
I assure you...

588
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:54,693
Read this, my story can
amuse you a bit.

589
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:57,993
It's about a woman split
between two passions.

590
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:01,453
Sorry, but with
all this mess of war...

591
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:06,187
Why don't you set the story
around the English invasion?

592
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,620
Sorry, Roberto.
Is the coffee bad?

593
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:15,685
It's awful. Bring me some milk,
I feel a heart-burn.

594
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,992
Diego, what's happening
with the coffee?

595
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,006
I spoke to NY, got Zicarelli on line.
What should I tell him?

596
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,615
- To never come back.
- 0K, you silly, the lines are bad!

597
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:28,809
Roberto, if I can rewrite it
by tomorrow, will you publish?

598
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:31,528
Do that, but with all this mess...

599
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,353
I can't promise you anything,
Jorgito.

600
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,421
Pellegrini, what's up,
are you sad?

601
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,846
No, not sad.
A bit worried.

602
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:42,958
I have a bad feeling
about all this.

603
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:46,250
- How is Laura?
- That's the least of my problems.

604
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:49,548
"The least"?
What's the matter?

605
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,597
We've been together
for a year and a half now.

606
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:53,997
A couple has its bad moments,
but everything is fine.

607
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:55,241
That means it's a shit.

608
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:58,474
No, no, she's
focused on her things now.

609
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:03,085
I think you just need
some fresh air.

610
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,645
It wouldn't do the
couple any harm.

611
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,750
It can be good.

612
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:11,019
Talk to someone who is not so
worried about her own career.

613
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,294
Someone who appreciates
you better, Jorge.

614
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,305
- That sounds a little selfish.
- Yes, it's a bit complicated.

615
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:18,797
Let's have some coffee later?

616
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,699
You might be right.

617
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:25,416
That can make me feel better.

618
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:40,335
- Take care not to drop it again.
- Yeah, I know.

619
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,320
<i>Carola was a rich</i>
<i>and complex human being...</i>

620
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:52,523
<i>with dreams, goals,</i>
<i>frustrations and sorrows...</i>

621
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:56,236
<i>but in respect of the whole,</i>
<i>that's beside the point.</i>

622
00:40:56,435 --> 00:41:00,658
<i>To me, she meant a sort of escape,</i>
<i>fresh air, a pinch of salt...</i>

623
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,437
<i>to season the salad</i>
<i>I had in my mind.</i>

624
00:41:03,636 --> 00:41:06,385
<i>As long as she saw me as an innocent</i>
<i>fantasy, what harm could I do?</i>

625
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,213
- How are you?
- Hi, my love.

626
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:14,511
I'm compiling your short stories
that were never published.

627
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:18,602
You can come out with a book or two.
A very good one, for sure!

628
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,071
Laura, I don't like the idea
of my desk being cleaned.

629
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:24,879
Not your desk, your life.
You have excellent ideas.

630
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:27,280
Just drop the corny ideas
they make you write about.

631
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:28,972
Nobody makes me write about anything!

632
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:31,922
By choosing someone else to publish
they get you to write something else.

633
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,466
This one here, for instance, about
the dead journalist, what's his name?

634
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:37,229
- Mastronardi.
- Give me that!

635
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:40,015
It has more substance than the love
stories you write to the magazine.

636
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:42,765
Don't mess around with my stuff!
That's nothing!

637
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:45,420
It can't be nothing, you tried
to start it 4 times already.

638
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,337
- If you're stuck, I can help!
- What do you know about this?

639
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:50,475
- Nobody has interest in that!
- I don't agree!

640
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:52,655
This magazine is making you
waste your time...

641
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:55,439
...you're stuck!
- I'm not stuck.

642
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,809
I make my living from what I write.
That's far more than many people do.

643
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:00,427
I don't mind if you don't make
money, I want you to be a writer.

644
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:02,931
Since when are you a critic?
What do you know of that?

645
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:05,101
I don't know about that,
but I know of you.

646
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:07,244
And they don't publish
your best at there!

647
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:09,421
Give me a break, will you?
Who is going after the editors?

648
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,404
Who's willing to knock at all doors
and get negative answers?

649
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:16,308
I am. Why don't you go back to writing
the old themes? They were stronger!

650
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,802
No one can write about
that anymore, Laura.

651
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,519
Don't tell me you're afraid?

652
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:24,942
What are you talking about?
What do you know of fear?

653
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,598
Why don't you write them
yourself if you know so much?

654
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:33,807
Because I have no talent,
but you do.

655
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,690
You can be a great writer
just need a push.

656
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,123
I might be good at that, let me try.

657
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:42,480
I don't want to see you rotting
over the same old shit.

658
00:42:44,984 --> 00:42:47,570
Now I know why that other guy
never called you.

659
00:43:01,656 --> 00:43:03,729
What are you doing?
Be careful, fuck!

660
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:05,717
Don't make me nervous,
or I'll screw up!

661
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:09,141
- You screwed up, scratched the car!
- You make me nervous, that's why!

662
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,817
All the time complaining of Laura!
Get out there, can't come out here.

663
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:16,246
You say your girlfriend is a pain,
but want to introduce her friend to me!

664
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:19,670
- Look where you parked the car!
- How can't I be nervous?

665
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:23,607
Who's put this column here?
Wait a minute.

666
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,964
- Say, do I have bad breath?
- No...

667
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:30,674
- What did you say the girl does?
- I don't know, ask her.

668
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:33,175
She might be one of those
intellectuals I hate.

669
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,257
No, she's a common girl!

670
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,879
What if she's some corny girl?

671
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,668
"What if", "What if",
get a grip, speak up!

672
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:44,372
- You animal! A corny girl?
- No, don't get nervous!

673
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,577
What did you eat today, Roberto?

674
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:51,158
Hey, boys!

675
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:56,435
I think I want to back off.

676
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,545
They saw you, silly.
No way out.

677
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:01,846
Come on, hurry up.
Hi, girls, are you 0K?

678
00:44:02,587 --> 00:44:04,049
- Hi, waited too long?
- Not at all.

679
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,553
- 52 minutes.
- But we're at war.

680
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:09,594
- Journalism stuff.
- Roberto, this is Marita.

681
00:44:09,786 --> 00:44:13,463
- Roberto! Pretty name! I liked it!
- Well...

682
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:15,825
Well, I liked it.

683
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:18,263
- You guys work very hard.
- I'll say...

684
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,077
When they say journalism is an
apostolate, they are right.

685
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,316
We lie more than Saint Peter.

686
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:26,483
- Don't you agree, Jorge?
- Yes, it's a tight spot.

687
00:44:26,684 --> 00:44:28,724
It is a fascinating job.

688
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:30,899
Can one get into cinema,
theater and all that?

689
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:33,368
- 0f course.
- That's sweet.

690
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,820
Think of it, Roberto,
my mom was all alone...

691
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:40,273
There should be someone to care for
her, would I send her to hospital?

692
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:43,792
My father had left us 10 years
before, never returned, useless.

693
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:45,883
So I was beside her
until she passed away.

694
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:49,076
- Family comes first, of course.
- I think so too.

695
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,842
- Don't you, Jorge?
- I never got along with my father.

696
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,758
But that's something else, huh?

697
00:44:56,957 --> 00:45:00,056
That talking deserves
some especial occasion.

698
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:04,660
You said you found your artistic vein
through handicrafts?

699
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:07,769
That's beautiful.

700
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:09,623
Why did you get divorced?

701
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:13,848
Things get tiresome after a while.

702
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:16,700
Well, we didn't have fun anymore.

703
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:18,901
We just complained, see?

704
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:22,811
In the last six years, I'd say.

705
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:24,794
- You never thought of getting back?
- No.

706
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,196
- Are you sure?
- 0f course I am.

707
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:27,445
- Really?
- Yes.

708
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:30,100
But you're still in love with her?

709
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:32,404
- No.
- Are you sure?

710
00:45:33,886 --> 00:45:36,853
So you have to stick your hand
in it to shape it up, see?

711
00:45:37,053 --> 00:45:40,350
Hands are very important,
even if they don't seem to be.

712
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:43,798
Do not underestimate yourself.
Did you read Dalí's memoirs?

713
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:46,868
- "The Unspeakable Confessions".
- No. No...

714
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:48,794
I started, but didn't finish.

715
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:52,444
You knew Dalí started like that?

716
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,348
In his book he says
he started with handicrafts.

717
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:59,513
- Are you affectionate?
- When I want, I want.

718
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:04,281
I'm very intense. I suffer intensely
and have intense pleasure.

719
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,313
- Are you intense?
- So much.

720
00:46:10,655 --> 00:46:12,630
Well, I had a lot of fun, in fact.

721
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:13,944
That's a great place.

722
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,387
- Expensive.
- Beautiful.

723
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:18,453
- Are you working tomorrow?
- Why? Let's go somewhere else?

724
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:21,722
Yes! You guys really
don't want to go?

725
00:46:21,919 --> 00:46:24,789
- Let's go just the two of us.
- All right, let's go.

726
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,341
- See you, guys.
- See you.

727
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:31,159
Where can we get some coffee?

728
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,451
I know of a great place where
they have an excellent chocolate.

729
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:36,859
It sounds delicious!

730
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,520
It worked all right.

731
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,766
Great Jorgito, my hero!
Thanks for coming, my dear.

732
00:47:00,962 --> 00:47:01,977
What happened?
Where is everybody?

733
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:04,545
Last night was closing,
everyone gets in later today.

734
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:08,480
I don't know how to thank you, man,
what a wonderful woman!

735
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:11,129
I had fun 48 hours non-stop!

736
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,671
Since we left the restaurant!

737
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:15,964
I took her home just now.
She was wasted, man!

738
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:18,170
You called me here just to say that?

739
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,632
I had to share it with you!
You have no idea how I feel good!

740
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:25,656
Jorge, nobody can stop me!
I'm a new man! A champion!

741
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,608
The English disembarked
at Malvinas!

742
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:32,322
I can't stand this place's bad mood!

743
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:35,297
That's why I wanted to come so early.
Delivery starts early...

744
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,200
at 9 a.m. And don't stop until
the last hour, at night.

745
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:41,434
What a woman, man.

746
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:44,733
- You know how many times we did?
- No.

747
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,816
- Two?
- This girl has something especial.

748
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:53,243
What about you, man? You put on
a long face all night...

749
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:56,313
- Something wrong with Laura?
- No, no, I don't know, I was...

750
00:47:56,515 --> 00:47:58,850
...a bit tense, in fact...
- Marita is right.

751
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,215
- You're a sucker.
- Marita?

752
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,833
The girl I introduced you to
said I'm a sucker?

753
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:06,937
See? It might not look like,
but she's smart, huh?

754
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:09,980
Do something, Jorgito. Get together
with Laura, face to face...

755
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,181
and have a good talk.
She'll thank you.

756
00:48:21,988 --> 00:48:24,377
- Should I start?
- Please.

757
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:27,106
Well, I thought a lot
about the two of us...

758
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:29,537
and I think we have
to make changes.

759
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:31,968
We can't keep on going like this.

760
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:35,747
We're going through a moment...

761
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:37,695
that...

762
00:48:39,557 --> 00:48:42,459
I had planned what to say
so carefully and now...

763
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:45,182
- Well...
- That's okay.

764
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,716
It's not usual for the
woman to mention this...

765
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:52,132
but I need to have some duties in
the relationship and I think that...

766
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:57,761
to push, to make you enter areas
you wouldn't enter by yourself...

767
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,617
Laura.

768
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,916
0kay.

769
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,868
Well, I think
we should try to continue.

770
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:12,029
You know that when
I set my mind to something...

771
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:17,795
So, I'll do like in the movies.
Will you marry me?

772
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,696
- So.
- The point is...

773
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:34,693
I agree that we're going
through a rough moment.

774
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:43,268
But what you just suggested
shouldn't be dealt with so lightly.

775
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:46,081
- We've been together for a year.
- Precisely.

776
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,918
It's a big decision.

777
00:49:54,888 --> 00:50:01,118
And things are so out of context...
But you're going to think, aren't you?

778
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:06,558
<i>Of course I would think.</i>
<i>On one hand she was a beautiful...</i>

779
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,924
<i>honest and affectionate woman</i>
<i>willing to use each second...</i>

780
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,543
<i>of her life to make me</i>
<i>a superior man.</i>

781
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:19,041
<i>On the other hand, a cold home,</i>
<i>empty relationships, all the same.</i>

782
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:22,338
<i>How could I not think about it?</i>

783
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:27,076
<i>But I really didn't.</i>

784
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:38,341
Yes? Who is it?
Just a minute.

785
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,395
For you.

786
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:47,168
- Who is it?
- A friend.

787
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:20,643
Wait, I'm coming right way.

788
00:51:31,085 --> 00:51:35,973
If she's the other, you can stay.

789
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:40,715
If I'm the other, you have to go.

790
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:43,751
"S"

791
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:44,963
Let me speak!

792
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:45,895
"U"

793
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:46,954
Listen to me!

794
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:47,847
"C"

795
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,124
Calm down!

796
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:50,055
"K"

797
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:51,201
Laura! Let me...

798
00:51:51,404 --> 00:51:52,352
"E"

799
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,827
Hand me the bag! Hand me the bag!

800
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,952
"R"

801
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:09,381
What's on your mind,
Pellegrini?

802
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:11,461
What? You look gorgeous.

803
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:16,517
<i>Giddy up, Radicals!</i>
<i>Giddy up non-stop!</i>

804
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,034
0pen way! Just won and
are already arrogant!

805
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:23,337
- A bright future stands ahead of us.
- You're so bitter.

806
00:52:23,535 --> 00:52:26,950
I brought you a present,
let's smoke the peace pipe!

807
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,605
Stop pulling my leg!

808
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:32,486
For you.

809
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:37,221
You better put it on yourself,
I might poke your eye with my finger!

810
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:40,423
- So pretty!
- What's that?

811
00:52:40,622 --> 00:52:45,063
Napkins so you can distribute it
among the party people.

812
00:52:48,015 --> 00:52:50,186
Enjoy the moment, after people see
the stupid things they're gonna do...

813
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:51,812
next election is ours.

814
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:55,277
If you ever come back to power,
I'll eat a chicken. Alive.

815
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,314
- What are you doing?
- I brought you a short story.

816
00:53:06,128 --> 00:53:07,983
<i>And so democracy was back again.</i>

817
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:11,438
<i>A young democracy, a beautiful</i>
<i>and virginal democracy...</i>

818
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:15,654
<i>and if it's young, beautiful and</i>
<i>virgin, it better beware of us.</i>

819
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:19,119
<i>It was a time of passion and joy.</i>

820
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:21,581
<i>I disappeared for two years,</i>
<i>just working...</i>

821
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:23,205
<i>and accomplished an old target.</i>

822
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,126
<i>In June of 1985,</i>
<i>I had outdone Dostoievski...</i>

823
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:28,397
<i>in number of written pages.</i>

824
00:53:29,169 --> 00:53:31,656
<i>But there was a short story</i>
<i>I couldn't write...</i>

825
00:53:31,856 --> 00:53:35,435
<i>There was something missing,</i>
<i>a thread, an image...</i>

826
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,194
Very good.

827
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:40,524
Very good, Sebi, really.
You could get yourself into that.

828
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,030
You can get a job here, for sure.

829
00:53:42,225 --> 00:53:45,192
He was embarrassed to think
you'd be seeing them.

830
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:48,328
You think so?
These are just scribbles, I can...

831
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,212
But if you're good,
they can ruin your style.

832
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,514
- I know what I'm saying.
- High spirits!

833
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:56,942
- Jorge, why don't you help me?
- Yes, sure.

834
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:00,554
To Alfredo Mastronardi...

835
00:54:00,755 --> 00:54:05,065
a great fighter in the dark times.
From colleagues and friends.

836
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:17,929
I was very small when
my dad died, I didn't know much.

837
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:26,252
But mom told me how you
loved him and supported him...

838
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,971
You did everything you could...

839
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,527
to make sure he was fine.

840
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:38,152
I think that's a lot,
my father would've not accepted it.

841
00:54:40,116 --> 00:54:42,254
He would've wanted
to share it with you.

842
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,681
So this is for you too.

843
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:48,490
Right, dad?

844
00:54:57,076 --> 00:55:00,459
People are being sacked.
The magazine is not selling.

845
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,614
It became a symbol of dictatorship.
The tribute was to clarify that.

846
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:07,980
They don't know what to do to
be set apart from the dictators.

847
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:12,461
That's why they need room
for the young generation...

848
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,221
to the young people, you see?

849
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:17,520
Rock and stuff. Things the
young people like, you know?

850
00:55:18,293 --> 00:55:23,661
And who is in charge now? Micky!
24 years old, look at that boy!

851
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:27,860
- What about you?
- Can I have a cigarette?

852
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:35,185
- They made me editor-in-chief.
- No kidding!

853
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:39,151
That's great!
No wonder you were so happy!

854
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,033
I hope you'll be happy too
with what I have to say.

855
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,750
Guess who is the new movies
and theater reviewer?

856
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,692
- Who?
- Jorge Pellegrini.

857
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:51,886
- Why?
- I can't do that anymore...

858
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:56,690
and you're going to do it better
than me, creativity is your turf.

859
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,567
Roberto, I'm not a reviewer.

860
00:56:00,854 --> 00:56:02,994
Furthermore,
I like writing my own stuff.

861
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:06,093
But we'll be paying you
a great salary, every month.

862
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,224
What do you mean, "we'll be paying"?

863
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,536
Were you promoted
or you became an associate?

864
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:17,877
Look...

865
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,708
Well, I thought that...

866
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,268
by receiving some money
every month you could...

867
00:56:25,975 --> 00:56:28,397
you would have time to...

868
00:56:29,176 --> 00:56:32,525
write other things...
a novel... I don't know, man!

869
00:56:36,536 --> 00:56:38,870
Did anything happen?

870
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:43,757
They won't publish the
short stories any longer.

871
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,702
I swear I fought for you, Jorge.
But it didn't work.

872
00:56:51,896 --> 00:56:55,988
It's a new way of looking at things,
see? Nothing personal...

873
00:56:57,305 --> 00:56:59,443
They want more current affairs
and less...

874
00:56:59,865 --> 00:57:02,102
less short stories.
It sounds like a joke.

875
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,798
And they picked you
to tell me that.

876
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,535
No...

877
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,801
No, I asked them...

878
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,302
to tell you because...

879
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:20,020
In fact you make me feel...

880
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:25,683
I don't know, man. I got you a job
as reviewer, what else can I do?

881
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:29,489
Pay the bill.

882
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:31,856
What? Wait, wait...

883
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:36,047
I'll be right back.
Don't be a sucker, Jorge!

884
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,160
Me, a sucker?
People who can't even read...

885
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:40,599
get to be chiefs and are incapable
of having their own opinion.

886
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:43,665
It's the new reengineering.
People want to se something else.

887
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,722
After they raised your salary,
you even know what people want.

888
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,118
- You're just like them, Roberto.
- Everything's changed...

889
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:51,184
and your short stories are all the
same: A girl with 2 boyfriends.

890
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:52,597
Who cares? Not even you.

891
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:55,512
- Let me go!
- I offered you a good job...

892
00:57:55,707 --> 00:57:59,220
Think about it, man. Do something
else, look for a new theme.

893
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:02,288
All right, I'm the reviewer.
Now I accept, now I resign!

894
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:05,786
And you, this work, and the
magazine can all go to hell.

895
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,602
Son of a gun!

896
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,315
<i>Laura was right, after all. In that</i>
<i>shitty magazine, they just...</i>

897
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:19,803
<i>drained me out. Mastronardi's story</i>
<i>then simply came out...</i>

898
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,418
<i>through the power</i>
<i>of hatred and anger.</i>

899
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,686
<i>A journalist who died of sadness</i>
<i>because of his friends' betrayal...</i>

900
00:58:25,884 --> 00:58:27,793
<i>comes back from death</i>
<i>to settle a score with them.</i>

901
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:31,926
<i>I couldn't stop writing.</i>
<i>My fingers jumped.</i>

902
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:36,155
<i>After years crossing pages out,</i>
<i>I began reading what I'd written...</i>

903
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:38,618
<i>as it was in the beginning,</i>
<i>when I enjoyed that.</i>

904
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:41,780
<i>As it's today, for I had</i>
<i>something to say.</i>

905
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:47,097
<i>If nobody wants to read me...</i>

906
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,197
<i>they'll end up listening to me.</i>

907
00:58:57,566 --> 00:58:59,573
- A bit forward.
- All right.

908
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,660
That cloud is awful, see if
there's anything you can do.

909
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:11,098
Sorry, Julio,
I have a problem.

910
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:16,282
I know you're the director and as
author, I don't like meddling in.

911
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:20,023
- Very good.
- But as producer...

912
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:23,261
I don't like the way you're
dealing with the dream sequence.

913
00:59:23,455 --> 00:59:25,146
Why? Is it too expensive?

914
00:59:25,343 --> 00:59:27,514
No, because you've been
using a naturalist code...

915
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:32,348
and I think the ghostly specter
shouldn't be so grand.

916
00:59:32,543 --> 00:59:36,667
- Ghosts don't speak that way.
- Yeah? And how does a ghost speak?

917
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:39,100
Like when he was alive.

918
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,934
I don't mean to compare,
but do you know Hamlet?

919
00:59:45,503 --> 00:59:49,017
- I didn't have the pleasure.
- 0kay.

920
00:59:49,216 --> 00:59:51,834
Let me see what I can do with that.

921
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:53,752
Come here!

922
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:55,959
<i>Shakespeare! Shakespeare!</i>

923
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,007
<i>How many sins have been</i>
<i>committed in your name!</i>

924
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,470
<i>Well, it was not Hamlet...</i>

925
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:05,210
<i>but "Up In Heaven" was the</i>
<i>best thing I'd written in life.</i>

926
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,240
<i>I gave up everything to do it...</i>

927
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,342
<i>even one of the things</i>
<i>I cherished most...</i>

928
01:00:12,993 --> 01:00:16,059
<i>the friendship I had with Javier,</i>
<i>the guy who bought my car.</i>

929
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:20,795
<i>After 6 months of hard work,</i>
<i>discussions, sleepless nights...</i>

930
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,487
<i>there came the moment of reward.</i>

931
01:00:22,689 --> 01:00:24,282
R00M 3 - "UP IN HEAVEN"
BY J0RGE PELLEGRINI

932
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:25,818
- Did you like it or not?
- Congratulations. It's awesome!

933
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:31,385
- See you tomorrow.
- 0K, I don't want to be obliging.

934
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:35,163
There's something you didn't like,
there are so many known characters...

935
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:39,897
- The famous "paint your village".
- Didn't need to paint it with shit.

936
01:00:40,258 --> 01:00:43,007
- Márquez...
- Let's have dinner, Antonio...

937
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:47,804
- Don't be silly...
- Enjoy the premiere.

938
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:56,765
- Look, there comes one.
- He went away.

939
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:02,522
- Let's walk to the corner...
- So, how was it?

940
01:01:04,738 --> 01:01:06,811
I don't know,
I got a bit confused.

941
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:10,873
- I have to watch it again.
- 0f course.

942
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:12,962
Well...

943
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:17,018
- Go buy me a pack of cigarettes.
- And the money?

944
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:32,734
Say something, please.

945
01:01:32,995 --> 01:01:35,712
I don't know, I have to
think about it a while.

946
01:01:36,132 --> 01:01:37,954
- I did it for "Mastro".
- No, you didn't.

947
01:01:38,276 --> 01:01:39,836
You did it for you.

948
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,042
I want to thank you for thinking
of Alfredo, but he wasn't like that.

949
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:52,639
He was sad, he was angry,
but he was not resentful.

950
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:22,845
Who gives a damn about who goes to
heaven? Ibsen would've been better.

951
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:25,697
- Who gives a damn about Norway?
- Who gives a damn about anything?

952
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:28,381
- Nine people, let's do it?
- Sorry, we had agreed on ten.

953
01:02:28,581 --> 01:02:30,076
- What's the difference?
- 0ne more, what's the difference?

954
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:32,645
We said 9, there are 8,
why not 7?

955
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:37,377
- We've reduced too much already.
- Enough! Enough.

956
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:41,796
- I'm out!
- They're the ones who take the body.

957
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,779
What if we say we
have technical problems?

958
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:47,291
We have no technical problems,
but nine people who want to see it.

959
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:52,350
Jorge, this play is too dense,
and we haven't seen a nickel.

960
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,311
I'll talk to them.

961
01:03:19,368 --> 01:03:21,091
There's no one else in there?

962
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:47,268
Jorge, let's go out to eat?

963
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:12,105
<i>In our trip into outer space...</i>

964
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:15,527
<i>we see the Constellation</i>
<i>of Orion, the Hunter.</i>

965
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:19,399
<i>His belt, popularly known</i>
<i>as the Three Marys...</i>

966
01:04:19,593 --> 01:04:24,134
<i>is the most famous star formation</i>
<i>in our continent.</i>

967
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:26,564
<i>The beauty of our firmament...</i>

968
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,031
<i>can only be appreciated</i>
<i>in this planetarium...</i>

969
01:04:29,226 --> 01:04:33,863
<i>since the city artificial lights</i>
<i>eclipse this natural spectacle.</i>

970
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:38,089
What about that bright star?
Nicolás?

971
01:04:38,282 --> 01:04:40,257
- What?
- Are you playing anything?

972
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:45,576
<i>Just a second, sorry, this star</i>
<i>is not in our catalogue.</i>

973
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:48,106
<i>I'll consult with our director.</i>

974
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,140
Come on, they don't know my star?

975
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,154
Such a mess,
this country never changes.

976
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:57,863
How are you?

977
01:04:58,156 --> 01:05:00,839
Here I am. And you?

978
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:04,358
- Here I am.
- Is it true the play was a failure?

979
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:06,443
No, that's not true.

980
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:08,740
Well, yes, it was a failure.
Who told you that?

981
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,079
The guy who bought your car.
The wheel broke down...

982
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,415
in a trip to Mar del Plata.
He's still cursing you.

983
01:05:13,612 --> 01:05:16,362
- You're kidding me.
- 0f course!

984
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:20,390
- I saw the play.
- And?

985
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:24,517
I loved it. It was very good.
Thank you.

986
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,284
Where can I find you, "Mastro"?

987
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,745
Why? Do you want to join me?

988
01:05:37,678 --> 01:05:39,107
Stay where you are.

989
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:41,316
There are other things for you
to worry about...

990
01:05:41,582 --> 01:05:43,469
like what you're going to do
with your life.

991
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:45,603
Now I'm broke,
I must find a job.

992
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:47,753
A piece of advice?
Do whatever pleases you.

993
01:05:48,142 --> 01:05:50,509
- You're telling me this shit?
- What did you expect?

994
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,228
Get a cheap ticket, fall asleep...

995
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,186
and solve your life with a dream?

996
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:56,170
Don't smoke, don't run
and do whatever you like.

997
01:05:56,461 --> 01:05:58,469
You'll live longer and better.
Listen to a dead man.

998
01:05:58,669 --> 01:06:00,938
Well, I expected a bit more.

999
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:04,294
I also expected a bit more, Jorge.

1000
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,824
But I'm not here
to give you advice.

1001
01:06:07,022 --> 01:06:09,706
- I wanted to ask you a favor.
- Anything you want.

1002
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:15,086
Keep an eye on Sebastián,
take care of him.

1003
01:06:24,558 --> 01:06:28,618
<i>And that's the end of our trip.</i>

1004
01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:32,615
I'm hungry, let's eat.

1005
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:40,330
Why is Shakespeare a genius?
His words.

1006
01:06:40,879 --> 01:06:43,432
Why do I have to accept
a bunch of swindlers...

1007
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,573
who put a mute play on Shakespeare?

1008
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,896
Seriously. They spit, hit, jump...

1009
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:51,534
0f course I want to yell at them.

1010
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:54,150
At least they're doing
something different.

1011
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,134
What can you say?
You left in the first act!

1012
01:06:57,328 --> 01:06:59,532
0f course, it's insane!
The audience does half the work.

1013
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:01,070
- They should charge half too.
- Yes.

1014
01:07:01,265 --> 01:07:03,982
Jorge, you don't like anything.
You criticize everybody.

1015
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,248
You're too young,
haven't seen much.

1016
01:07:06,448 --> 01:07:09,547
I'm not to blame if 85% of
the things I see is trash.

1017
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:11,632
- My job is to tell the truth.
- Your theater reviews...

1018
01:07:11,825 --> 01:07:13,767
made a lot of people read books.

1019
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:16,014
- Sausage?
- Yes.

1020
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:19,657
Excuse me. I need some room,
I hope you like it.

1021
01:07:19,858 --> 01:07:23,240
The pasta is my grandma's recipe,
the stuffing is my mother's...

1022
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:25,132
but burning it in the oven
is a recipe of my own.

1023
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:26,856
Don't worry, my love, I want you.

1024
01:07:27,057 --> 01:07:28,584
- Enough of promises. Do it!
- My love!

1025
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:30,891
- Cutie, cutie!
- My handsome!

1026
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:35,017
How two goofies like you can
get along so fine?

1027
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,836
- You're faking.
- We get along very well.

1028
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:43,404
I'll be sudden so you won't get
shocked. We're getting married.

1029
01:07:44,403 --> 01:07:47,119
No way! Congratulations!

1030
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:50,863
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1031
01:07:51,058 --> 01:07:52,847
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

1032
01:07:53,043 --> 01:07:54,668
That's lovely.

1033
01:07:56,018 --> 01:07:57,611
You heard I'm getting married?

1034
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:59,533
Yes.

1035
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:03,022
- Have you thought it over?
- No, dummy. That's why I will.

1036
01:08:03,474 --> 01:08:05,929
- Let me go get more meat.
- It's wonderful. Really.

1037
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:11,499
- What about you, guys?
- We? No.

1038
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,812
We? We don't want to hurry...

1039
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:17,746
I still have many subjects to take
at college, and that's something...

1040
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,998
you got to think hard, right?
You can't let your emotions rule!

1041
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:23,885
Sure.

1042
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:27,247
If you're spending your life with
someone, you can't rely on emotion.

1043
01:08:27,443 --> 01:08:30,672
Come on, everybody is
getting married, even Laura.

1044
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:38,607
Girl, you're grounded.
5 minutes of shame.

1045
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:42,862
Why? You didn't get
the invitation?

1046
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:46,256
No. Against who is she marrying?

1047
01:08:46,676 --> 01:08:49,905
Someone she used to date.
Esteban, remember?

1048
01:08:51,572 --> 01:08:55,281
Yes. It seems he finally called.

1049
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,650
People repeat stories.
Such suckers, huh?

1050
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:04,172
- Who is Laura?
- A friend...

1051
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:07,245
It's been a while since we last
saw her, I don't think we'll go.

1052
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,357
If you're not going tell me in
advance so I can find a escort.

1053
01:09:14,102 --> 01:09:18,292
Marita? Should we get the
ice cream out of the freezer?

1054
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:21,202
- What for?
- So it will soften a little.

1055
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:33,868
- You'd rather have known from Laura?
- No, no, no...

1056
01:09:34,134 --> 01:09:35,923
I was thinking of you.

1057
01:09:37,046 --> 01:09:41,618
Hope has triumphed over experience.

1058
01:09:44,854 --> 01:09:46,545
Let me tell you something.

1059
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,771
I don't know what comes upon
me with this woman.

1060
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:59,221
I can't explain.

1061
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:03,952
She laughs at the same jokes.
We like the same things.

1062
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:08,557
Sometimes I have my doubts,
I feel insecure...

1063
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:10,483
especially when I look at you.

1064
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:16,785
I envy you! 0n a good way,
of course, you're my best friend.

1065
01:10:17,976 --> 01:10:21,391
I don't know, you have
this teenage thing...

1066
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:25,870
always after something new.
And that makes me feel...

1067
01:10:26,584 --> 01:10:32,116
uncertain, unsettled, but then
I look into myself...

1068
01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:34,552
and see someone else.

1069
01:10:34,745 --> 01:10:39,535
I'm more of a family man,
I like being at home...

1070
01:10:41,177 --> 01:10:43,446
Well, so here I go.

1071
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:49,368
J0URNALIST KILLS HIS EX-L0VER

1072
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,506
Laura!

1073
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:06,746
Laura!

1074
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:09,779
I can't believe it!

1075
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:12,570
Jorge...

1076
01:12:12,764 --> 01:12:15,666
- I really can't believe it!
- What a surprise!

1077
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:19,131
What a coincidence!

1078
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:23,225
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sure, why?

1079
01:12:23,421 --> 01:12:25,461
- You're sweating.
- It's the heat...

1080
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:28,279
I owe you an apology for that
one time at the theater...

1081
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,103
I don't know,
I wasn't feeling well...

1082
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:32,757
Don't worry, really.
We're here now.

1083
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:38,554
It's true. I can't believe it!
How are you?

1084
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,670
- I'm getting married, did you know?
- 0f course...

1085
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,877
I'm the only one
you didn't invite.

1086
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,333
<i>Sometimes I think that</i>
<i>the unimportant talks...</i>

1087
01:12:50,526 --> 01:12:51,606
<i>at unimportant places...</i>

1088
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:54,457
<i>were the most important</i>
<i>moments of my life.</i>

1089
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:58,077
<i>Since not much had been happening</i>
<i>in my life, I could...</i>

1090
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,157
<i>put her up to date</i>
<i>between two stations.</i>

1091
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:04,180
You know I still keep your short
stories? All of them corrected.

1092
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:08,026
- I tell you, it could be a book.
- Let's not get into that again.

1093
01:13:08,223 --> 01:13:09,816
Let's talk about you, okay?

1094
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:11,764
Imagine my surprise.

1095
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:15,066
I get out of the radio one day and
Esteban's there at the front desk.

1096
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,402
- And what did he say?
- "Hello, Laura".

1097
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:20,534
- No, really, what did he say?
- Nothing.

1098
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:26,201
Nothing? Was he in a hospital?
Coma, amnesia, said nothing at all?

1099
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:27,773
Well, yes.

1100
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:32,507
He went from Montevideo to Paris
in search of his destiny...

1101
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,734
And that's it.
Watch out for the poop...

1102
01:13:36,928 --> 01:13:38,815
He came back in 1985.

1103
01:13:39,008 --> 01:13:41,496
So the guy disappears for 5 years...

1104
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:43,420
comes back, sees you
and says "Hello, Laura"...

1105
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,275
No, it wasn't so simple.

1106
01:13:45,472 --> 01:13:47,382
He was down on his knees
for one year.

1107
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:51,293
Unbelievable. That's destiny.
After all...

1108
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:53,398
- See?
- Yeah...

1109
01:13:53,632 --> 01:13:57,047
And I went on experimenting.
I experimented, experimented...

1110
01:13:57,248 --> 01:13:59,486
- Really? You experimented a lot?
- That's me.

1111
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:01,850
Your boyfriend teaches here?

1112
01:14:02,049 --> 01:14:04,056
No, I'm taking a course on graphic
design. He doesn't paint anymore.

1113
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:06,646
What?
Has Picasso abandoned his brush?

1114
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:08,954
That deserves a toast.

1115
01:14:09,185 --> 01:14:11,258
Why did he stop painting?
Didn't he do so well in Paris?

1116
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:17,916
The problem is that the
paintings' circle is a mafia.

1117
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:21,020
- Horrible.
- The paintings too?

1118
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:23,127
There are no good circles left.

1119
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:26,145
But he still uses the same
strength on other things.

1120
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:31,833
- Like what?
- Imports and exports.

1121
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:41,401
Look, it's not the kind of
relationship we had together...

1122
01:14:42,306 --> 01:14:44,346
In fact...

1123
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,034
things with Esteban
are so much calmer.

1124
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:51,130
He respects my job,
respects my life, I respect him...

1125
01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:56,831
Well, I don't know.

1126
01:14:57,571 --> 01:15:01,532
I used to think that our thing,
our fire, was love.

1127
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:09,146
But now I see it wasn't,
that it was just fire...

1128
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,517
it gets you burnt and nothing else.

1129
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:15,647
Now I see love
is something else...

1130
01:15:15,972 --> 01:15:20,674
that has to do with affection,
commitment, with sharing things...

1131
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:24,225
with feeling safe and trust.

1132
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,209
With trust.

1133
01:15:29,764 --> 01:15:30,909
That is love.

1134
01:15:31,108 --> 01:15:34,369
Not that teenage thing
of Romeo and Juliet...

1135
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,290
I don't fall for that anymore,
a short story or a portrait.

1136
01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:47,771
And you know that when
I set my mind to something...

1137
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,928
Laura...

1138
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:53,410
Laura!

1139
01:16:57,384 --> 01:16:58,911
Laura! Laura!

1140
01:16:59,112 --> 01:17:01,119
- Jorge, are you crazy?
- What do you mean, crazy?

1141
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,847
- Where are you going?
- We can't, it's wrong!

1142
01:17:03,048 --> 01:17:04,477
What's wrong?

1143
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:07,046
You're naked, go home,
don't make a fuss!

1144
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,320
No, I won't go home without you.

1145
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:11,007
- Are you mad? I'm getting married!
- What about today?

1146
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:13,346
- That was nothing, a stupid mistake!
- No, you know I love you.

1147
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:16,773
No, I don't know, I don't care.
I haven't seen you in 5 years...

1148
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:19,748
I'm involved with someone else...
I'm so stupid.

1149
01:17:19,944 --> 01:17:22,181
- You're not in love, Laura.
- I'm fine!

1150
01:17:22,377 --> 01:17:24,766
I'm at ease, I feel safe,
today was plain stupid. Taxi!

1151
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:27,390
- No, no! Taxi, no!
- It was beautiful, but stupid.

1152
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:28,575
- Laura... you're not...
- I'm so foolish...

1153
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:30,915
You're not in love!

1154
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:33,349
I'm not in love with you either!

1155
01:17:36,872 --> 01:17:38,782
And I trust him.

1156
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,997
Get inside, you'll catch a cold.

1157
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:58,050
Stag party?

1158
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:05,576
Yes.

1159
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:18,628
<i>I don't really think...</i>

1160
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:22,724
<i>that the agribusiness producers...</i>

1161
01:18:22,923 --> 01:18:26,403
<i>are behaving like that!</i>

1162
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:30,406
<i>- It's those who, scared to death...</i>
- Yes, sir!

1163
01:18:30,603 --> 01:18:34,346
<i>... have kept quiet when they came!</i>
- Go to hell!

1164
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,416
<i>- Those who stand for dictatorship!</i>
- Just bitter...

1165
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:39,619
<i>Long live our nation!</i>

1166
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:42,369
<i>Long live Dr. Carlos Saul Menem!</i>

1167
01:18:42,828 --> 01:18:45,195
- Márquez...
- What?

1168
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:48,098
Eat this.

1169
01:18:49,227 --> 01:18:50,634
- Eat, eat!
- No way!

1170
01:18:50,828 --> 01:18:52,006
Eat, Márquez!

1171
01:18:52,203 --> 01:18:55,618
- You promised! Come on!
- Stop pissing me off!

1172
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,445
Eat!

1173
01:18:57,997 --> 01:19:01,477
THE 90s

1174
01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:26,604
Jorgito!

1175
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:29,195
How are you?

1176
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:33,510
- How are you, Manlio?
- Fine.

1177
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:39,241
Long time no see. I'm so glad to see
you. You look the same, the same!

1178
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:42,504
I called you, did they tell you?
Many times, at your office.

1179
01:19:43,374 --> 01:19:45,708
You have no idea how happy I was...

1180
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:48,772
when I found out you were
the reviewer of "Things".

1181
01:19:48,975 --> 01:19:51,790
I looked for you at the exit,
but didn't see you...

1182
01:19:51,982 --> 01:19:53,957
It was a great time for you,
I didn't want to spoil.

1183
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,875
You have no idea how nervous I was.
I put 4 years of my life in that!

1184
01:19:57,071 --> 01:20:00,267
To deal with multimedia is like...

1185
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:04,488
I don't know, like a kind of
exacerbated "big-bang".

1186
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:09,223
A huge mess, you bother everybody,
your friends, your family...

1187
01:20:09,422 --> 01:20:12,422
They lend you even what they don't
have to help you. What can I say?

1188
01:20:12,624 --> 01:20:15,919
Tell me about you. You. How did
you like the play? Tell me.

1189
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:22,438
You know that your opinion
is very important to me. I mean it.

1190
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:25,960
That's why I wanted
to see you in private.

1191
01:20:27,855 --> 01:20:33,289
I won't publish the review.
I didn't like the play. Nothing.

1192
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,066
Well, you are entitled
to your opinion, definitely.

1193
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:45,902
But you could be more specific,
I don't know...

1194
01:20:46,544 --> 01:20:49,326
It's too childish.

1195
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:53,837
All that fuss you
put up to speak of...

1196
01:20:54,032 --> 01:21:00,426
"speak", to yell,
I found very pretentious.

1197
01:21:01,552 --> 01:21:04,848
And all that huge mess with
videos, pictures, actors...

1198
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,797
It was impossible to understand.

1199
01:21:09,809 --> 01:21:12,330
I'm sorry for being so rough, but...

1200
01:21:12,529 --> 01:21:15,628
I rather offer you some
constructive criticism than lie.

1201
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:20,681
Sure, I appreciate that, I really
thank you for your honesty...

1202
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:23,980
but when can I see some
"constructive criticism"?

1203
01:21:24,882 --> 01:21:27,020
No.

1204
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:32,945
I appreciate the effort you've put
on something with so little...

1205
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:35,307
commercial appeal.

1206
01:21:35,506 --> 01:21:38,189
I like that, it's refreshing.

1207
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:42,537
I'm also aware that I can help you
with my review in the magazine.

1208
01:21:42,994 --> 01:21:47,501
We've put even what we
don't have in this project.

1209
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:49,803
Sure.

1210
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:53,842
- How much did you spend?
- US$ 8 thousand.

1211
01:21:54,036 --> 01:21:55,858
A fortune.

1212
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:58,764
A fortune.

1213
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:03,368
So I think you won't feel
bad about putting US$ 500 more...

1214
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:06,288
I mean, it's not a delusion.

1215
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,889
Think about it.

1216
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:16,305
With 50 tickets that a good review
helps to bring in, and you're even.

1217
01:22:18,805 --> 01:22:21,707
It's also important to get a head
start with a favorable review...

1218
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:25,486
it's always luring, always.

1219
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,646
Well, let me...

1220
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:50,353
talk to my associates,
it's a group project.

1221
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,095
0f course, of course.
But make use of discretion.

1222
01:22:54,293 --> 01:22:58,254
0therwise, if the thing is aired,
the review will have no effect.

1223
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:00,755
- Want to drink something? 0n me.
- No...

1224
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:05,073
Thank you.
I have to get back to rehearsals...

1225
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:10,642
Good, very good. The better
the play, the better the review.

1226
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:18,769
Well, I'll call you at your office.

1227
01:23:18,966 --> 01:23:21,552
No, call me...

1228
01:23:23,127 --> 01:23:25,036
Call me... on my cell phone.

1229
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:29,395
- Here. It's best on the cell phone.
- Cell phone?

1230
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:34,229
You got a cell phone?
Well, I'll call you.

1231
01:23:35,256 --> 01:23:37,296
- Thank you...
- Not at all.

1232
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:39,699
- Thanks.
- Bye.

1233
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:43,958
Bye.

1234
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,072
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine!

1235
01:24:06,264 --> 01:24:08,752
Good luck! Good luck!

1236
01:24:08,953 --> 01:24:11,320
I got it! I got it!

1237
01:24:14,904 --> 01:24:18,385
Let it be, she'll never find
another sucker like you.

1238
01:24:18,905 --> 01:24:23,313
I'll get drunk tonight.
Long live the newlywed!

1239
01:24:23,513 --> 01:24:25,488
- Thank you, Roberto!
- He's a pain in the ass!

1240
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:27,282
Long live the grooms!

1241
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:29,586
And the brides too!

1242
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:34,040
You must think I'm an idiot,
but I'm overwhelmed!

1243
01:24:34,233 --> 01:24:37,200
- No, why?
- You look so beautiful.

1244
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:38,350
Thank you.

1245
01:24:38,553 --> 01:24:41,041
Come and get your wife,
or I'll steal her from you!

1246
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:44,851
You're far from being
the kind of guy she likes.

1247
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:48,498
- Who would say so?
- How are you, Mr. Suárez?

1248
01:24:48,827 --> 01:24:53,235
Come on, I came to congratulate them
and you embarrass me! Come on.

1249
01:24:53,434 --> 01:24:56,151
I've always treated the
assistant director as "mister".

1250
01:24:58,042 --> 01:24:59,952
- Congratulations, Márquez.
- Thank you, boy.

1251
01:25:00,154 --> 01:25:03,634
- A drink? They let you drink, right?
- Well, I want some.

1252
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:07,030
Sorry, I'll be right back.

1253
01:25:07,226 --> 01:25:09,462
Go ahead, go ahead.

1254
01:25:11,034 --> 01:25:13,207
Jorge, are you bored?

1255
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:18,968
No, just a little tired, that's all.
Plus I had a few drinks too.

1256
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:23,186
- Where's your girlfriend?
- No girlfriend. That's much better.

1257
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,423
You know why you like me so?

1258
01:25:26,972 --> 01:25:30,038
And why I like you even more?

1259
01:25:30,235 --> 01:25:35,603
Because we never felt any sexual
attraction for each other. Zero.

1260
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:41,589
Quiet, please! Quiet!

1261
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,657
As best man, I'd like
to say a few words...

1262
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,648
Hello? Manlio?

1263
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:56,217
I'd like to congratulate
Leti and Antonio on this...

1264
01:25:56,412 --> 01:26:01,715
and tell them the second wedding
is even better, right, my love?

1265
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:07,538
That stupid phone made me forget
what I was to say! Music, maestro!

1266
01:26:27,357 --> 01:26:31,668
Don't call me at the office,
Don't call me at the office!

1267
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,845
I'll go by the theater. See you.

1268
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:20,890
What? What is it?

1269
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:25,311
What about this foot?
This tiny little foot?

1270
01:27:32,224 --> 01:27:34,843
- What a surprise!
- So you came!

1271
01:27:35,456 --> 01:27:38,391
I can't believe it!

1272
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:43,094
I can't believe it! I told Manlio
I'd meet him here. Remember him?

1273
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:45,785
The director of short
films shot on Super-8?

1274
01:27:46,434 --> 01:27:50,492
We set to meet here and look!
Such a coincidence, I can't believe!

1275
01:27:57,857 --> 01:28:00,191
You look gorgeous! Gorgeous!

1276
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:05,311
It's the good life.

1277
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:11,073
Very well, very well.

1278
01:28:13,442 --> 01:28:16,159
- We have to talk.
- Sure...

1279
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:18,721
Want to have a coffee?

1280
01:28:19,138 --> 01:28:20,894
No...

1281
01:28:23,074 --> 01:28:24,983
I'm one of the producers
for Manlio's play.

1282
01:28:25,187 --> 01:28:29,377
Well, "producers"...
I put some money in it.

1283
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:33,019
Manlio told me what
you wanted from him.

1284
01:28:33,219 --> 01:28:36,154
I called him a liar.

1285
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:52,536
What is it, my love?

1286
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:57,979
Here, get your pacifier. Here.

1287
01:29:12,548 --> 01:29:15,996
Here's what you asked for.
Count it, if you want.

1288
01:29:19,684 --> 01:29:21,473
No.

1289
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,658
No, I don't want it.
I'll help him anyway.

1290
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:07,551
Hello, my dear, come to daddy.

1291
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:11,907
Hello, my daughter, hello, hello.

1292
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:16,446
- Isn't she my spitting image?
- No, she looks like her father.

1293
01:30:16,903 --> 01:30:20,482
- This child is so beautiful!
- A toast! A toast!

1294
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:22,752
To Violeta Márquez...

1295
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,821
so that she can learn to forgive us
for the world we left for her.

1296
01:30:26,023 --> 01:30:29,285
So she can try to change it
if she's got the time; and so that...

1297
01:30:29,607 --> 01:30:33,535
she learns nothing,
absolutely nothing from us.

1298
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:35,966
- You made us cry.
- What is it, Márquez?

1299
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:38,273
- Are you babysitting now?
- Yes...

1300
01:30:38,472 --> 01:30:43,044
...the salary can't pay a thing!
- Is she your granddaughter?

1301
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,443
No, no, she's my daughter.

1302
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,902
Violeta Márquez, Micky. Micky,
Violeta Márquez. Give him a glass.

1303
01:30:49,095 --> 01:30:52,095
Here's your article about the
protest against the economic plan.

1304
01:30:52,296 --> 01:30:55,612
It won't be published, ok? I need
the space for Perales...

1305
01:30:55,815 --> 01:30:58,182
...and that dancer. What's her name?
- Wait, Micky, wait.

1306
01:30:58,376 --> 01:31:02,817
I'm a political journalist
and this is gossip...

1307
01:31:03,017 --> 01:31:05,700
dishing the dirt,
chitchat, celebrities...

1308
01:31:05,897 --> 01:31:09,377
As far as I know, Perales is senator.
Senator is politics, not gossip.

1309
01:31:09,577 --> 01:31:14,595
He's a celebrity.
Three pages and hurry.

1310
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:22,563
Listen, boy!

1311
01:31:23,113 --> 01:31:25,055
- Hold her a minute, please.
- Sure.

1312
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:28,999
Why don't you write it?

1313
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:31,263
I'm sorry?

1314
01:31:31,466 --> 01:31:34,183
Write it yourself. Certainly you'll
do much better than me, of course.

1315
01:31:35,306 --> 01:31:38,241
You know what? This is your job,
not mine, Antonito.

1316
01:31:39,466 --> 01:31:43,241
"Antonito" like hell!
"Antonito", as you said...

1317
01:31:43,434 --> 01:31:45,125
is a political journalist...

1318
01:31:45,322 --> 01:31:48,421
"Antonito", you should know,
covered the Fall of Saigon...

1319
01:31:48,617 --> 01:31:52,065
covered a genocide, covered war
against two major powers.

1320
01:31:52,266 --> 01:31:53,957
A war against two
major world powers...

1321
01:31:54,155 --> 01:31:56,424
he was there when
dictatorship ended...

1322
01:31:56,619 --> 01:32:00,197
he was there when democracy arrived,
saw military mutinies, 400 ministers.

1323
01:32:00,459 --> 01:32:04,288
And now you want "Antonito"
to write silly things...

1324
01:32:04,491 --> 01:32:06,596
about an old man and a courtesan.

1325
01:32:06,891 --> 01:32:08,931
- That's 0K, Micky, I'll do it...
- No, no. Not you!

1326
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,945
- You're also a journalist!
- Are you drunk, Márquez?

1327
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:14,146
Who gives a damn about what
a senator does in Congress?

1328
01:32:14,347 --> 01:32:16,289
- Had a sudden attack of dignity?
- No!

1329
01:32:16,491 --> 01:32:19,591
Dignity doesn't come in attacks,
either you have it or don't, sucker!

1330
01:32:19,788 --> 01:32:21,730
- Don't call me sucker!
- Sucker! Sucker!

1331
01:32:21,932 --> 01:32:25,543
Let me explain something:
It's my duty to tell the truth.

1332
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:28,326
Listen to Márquez!
He owns the truth, poor idealist...

1333
01:32:28,556 --> 01:32:30,530
Tell me: When in hell
you said the truth?

1334
01:32:30,732 --> 01:32:33,099
- Always!
- You're a liar, a stupid...

1335
01:32:33,292 --> 01:32:36,139
...and always kept your mouth shut!
- Antonio Márquez...

1336
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:39,976
does not lie!
He lies to no one!

1337
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:43,531
To no one!

1338
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:47,467
This trash, the battle for
"Pimpolho", I won't write ever more.

1339
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:50,755
Let it be written by a sucker
like you, not me!

1340
01:32:52,269 --> 01:32:55,051
I'll tell what, Márquez:
You're fired.

1341
01:32:55,245 --> 01:32:57,514
Let's see how you're going to
feed your daughter Violeta...

1342
01:32:57,709 --> 01:33:01,484
Poop! That's what I'm going to eat!
I'll start right away, look...

1343
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,811
Antonio, stop that, stop...

1344
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:07,498
A bit oily, but tasty,
have some...

1345
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:10,567
- Stop, stop that, enough...
- Try some, try it...

1346
01:33:10,766 --> 01:33:13,930
- Stop, stop, enough, man!
- Stop this old man! He is crazy!

1347
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:18,114
It makes your bowels work well!
Eat! Eat!

1348
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:23,373
It's for the bowels! Itll make
you grow up! Eat, you son of a gun!

1349
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:25,092
Let me go!

1350
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:28,043
You stupid son of a bitch!

1351
01:33:40,175 --> 01:33:43,819
- Are you taking this?
- No.

1352
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:50,508
Don't you feel ashamed?

1353
01:33:51,599 --> 01:33:54,447
Don't you feel ashamed?

1354
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:11,656
Márquez!

1355

"S0LITARY R0SE"
BY J0RGE PELLEGRINI

1356
01:34:43,793 --> 01:34:47,142
Your mother called me.
She's very worried.

1357
01:34:48,657 --> 01:34:51,789
You're burning your drawings.

1358
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:56,358
And my short stories too.

1359
01:34:56,562 --> 01:34:58,896
You did nothing for my father.

1360
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:03,047
Did you?

1361
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:20,716
No.

1362
01:35:30,802 --> 01:35:33,585
It was a very tough time, Seba.
There was no way out...

1363
01:35:33,778 --> 01:35:38,700
Quit that "tough time" bullshit.
I'm talking about my dad.

1364
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,129
Why didn't you do anything?

1365
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:52,715
It seems the living suffer more
than the dead, after all.

1366
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:03,537
No.

1367
01:36:07,573 --> 01:36:10,573
Not your drawings.

1368
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:42,924
No. I shouldn't do this.

1369
01:36:44,246 --> 01:36:46,963
I shouldn't do it...

1370
01:36:52,758 --> 01:36:54,863
I've done it.

1371
01:37:06,358 --> 01:37:09,839
Hello? Roberto?

1372
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:14,291
You won't screw me anymore.
No, nothing.

1373
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,635
Is it closing? For me too!

1374
01:37:23,352 --> 01:37:28,174
Let me have the central page,
you're going to love it.

1375
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:36,661
Good luck with Marito, you idiot.

1376
01:37:37,111 --> 01:37:40,111
<i>Bad luck! They'll give me money but</i>
<i>I can't use because it's damned?</i>

1377
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,394
<i>Yes! Itll bring bad luck</i>
<i>to the first man who touches it!</i>

1378
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:49,106
<i>Second prophecy says:</i>
<i>There'll come a beautiful woman.</i>

1379
01:37:49,304 --> 01:37:51,344
<i>She'll come looking for you and will</i>
<i>ask you to stroll on the sidewalk.</i>

1380
01:37:51,545 --> 01:37:55,571
<i>- Just follow her!</i>
<i>- No, don't touch her!</i>

1381
01:38:32,891 --> 01:38:36,207
Why? No!

1382
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,826
No, Jorge, no!

1383
01:38:40,026 --> 01:38:43,190
Hold her! Hold her!

1384
01:38:43,387 --> 01:38:45,808
No, Jorge!

1385
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:48,564
Jorge! Jorge!

1386
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,999
<i>I have to admit my imagination</i>
<i>is "too Italian"...</i>

1387
01:38:51,194 --> 01:38:53,333
<i>I can't deny.</i>

1388
01:38:53,691 --> 01:38:56,593
- 0pen it!
<i>- It was a narrow escape.</i>

1389
01:38:56,794 --> 01:39:00,854
<i>Roberto, worried with my phone call,</i>
<i>the same killjoy as ever...</i>

1390
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:05,688
<i>came up to my house, put the door</i>
<i>down and rescued me in time.</i>

1391
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:08,273
<i>Just like a prince.</i>

1392
01:39:08,604 --> 01:39:10,676
<i>Of course, he paid for the door.</i>

1393
01:39:10,876 --> 01:39:12,469
Throw up!

1394
01:39:15,643 --> 01:39:19,221
- How are you, Antonio?
- Is Jorge feeling better?

1395
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:22,552
- What is it now?
- You'll know in a minute.

1396
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:26,327
- Tell me, how is the search coming?
- Difficult.

1397
01:39:26,524 --> 01:39:30,518
If I keep like this, I'll have to
apologize before that stupid penguin.

1398
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:32,374
Shit!

1399
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:36,118
I'm glad you came, come in,
hurry! Go, go!

1400
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:39,641
Surprise!

1401
01:39:42,621 --> 01:39:45,654
What a bunch of patsies!

1402
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,640
Dear Márquez...

1403
01:39:47,837 --> 01:39:51,383
the 12 remaining clerks
of the magazine "Things"...

1404
01:39:51,581 --> 01:39:56,535
like apostles, puzzled...
wait a minute...

1405
01:39:56,733 --> 01:39:59,155
before the crucified Christ...

1406
01:39:59,357 --> 01:40:04,027
have decided to join in some savings!

1407
01:40:08,861 --> 01:40:15,256
A 12th part of our miserable
salary until you find a job!

1408
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:23,005
- From the bottom of our hearts...
- We hope you can get a job soon.

1409
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:26,678
Don't get lazy!

1410
01:40:28,543 --> 01:40:30,747
Come on, let's drink,
the magazine is paying...

1411
01:40:31,071 --> 01:40:34,202
You gave such a joy not showing
your face everyday anymore.

1412
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:37,596
- Nice, huh?
- Márquez, getting out...

1413
01:40:39,968 --> 01:40:42,423
Jorge, look who's here.

1414
01:40:42,623 --> 01:40:45,623
I invited her because
she wanted to see you.

1415
01:40:46,432 --> 01:40:50,839
Well, feel at home.
I need to go to the bathroom.

1416
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,244
We've known each other for so long,
still have nothing to talk about?

1417
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:06,297
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

1418
01:41:06,497 --> 01:41:08,406
How can you not think of nothing?

1419
01:41:08,609 --> 01:41:10,234
Just practice.

1420
01:41:10,433 --> 01:41:14,295
- You're drunk!
- No, not drunk...

1421
01:41:14,496 --> 01:41:16,023
A bit high.

1422
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,776
You should take care of yourself,
after what you've been through.

1423
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:23,294
You know about it?

1424
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,569
These guys.

1425
01:41:30,081 --> 01:41:32,831
- But you're fine now.
- Sure, yes, I'm good.

1426
01:41:33,345 --> 01:41:35,679
It was just a common and
stupid suicide attempt...

1427
01:41:35,873 --> 01:41:38,873
nothing so serious as
to slice my wrists off.

1428
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,304
- What about you?
- What?

1429
01:41:43,201 --> 01:41:46,430
How is everything?
What's it like...

1430
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:48,512
to be mother and wife?

1431
01:41:48,705 --> 01:41:51,258
Well, I'm a mother, alright.
But we broke apart.

1432
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:55,106
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- That's 0K.

1433
01:41:56,194 --> 01:42:00,286
Things had already gotten bad
before the baby was born, so...

1434
01:42:00,994 --> 01:42:03,994
That's how we learn.

1435
01:42:04,195 --> 01:42:06,977
No, we don't really learn anything.

1436
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:13,499
I saw your son so briefly but I found
him beautiful. What's his name?

1437
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:16,284
- Jorge!
- No!

1438
01:42:17,442 --> 01:42:20,410
Don't be silly,
how could I name him Jorge?

1439
01:42:22,019 --> 01:42:24,769
His name's Gonzalo.

1440
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:31,967
Laura, the last time
I saw you, I got so...

1441
01:42:32,163 --> 01:42:35,840
I'd rather not talk
about that last time.

1442
01:42:39,907 --> 01:42:43,454
Marita told me this surprise
to Márquez was your idea.

1443
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:48,540
That's really good.

1444
01:42:52,612 --> 01:42:55,579
- We better get out of here.
- Yes.

1445
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:59,675
Why? You don't like the rain
on your face anymore?

1446
01:43:01,797 --> 01:43:05,212
True. I had forgotten.

1447
01:43:07,492 --> 01:43:10,144
It's not going to rain.

1448
01:43:18,565 --> 01:43:21,413
- Are you afraid?
- No.

1449
01:43:21,606 --> 01:43:25,250
- I'm a grown-up now.
- Me too. That's why.

1450
01:43:25,446 --> 01:43:27,715
I said I didn't want to do
anything foolish, didn't I?

1451
01:43:27,909 --> 01:43:31,684
You also said you were not
in love and that was not important.

1452
01:43:31,877 --> 01:43:35,293
That the most important was affection
and respect. That love had burnt you.

1453
01:43:36,454 --> 01:43:38,910
I changed my mind.

1454
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:43,169
Now I want something that
at least scorch me a little.

1455
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:48,130
- You don't?
- Me?

1456
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,878
I don't know.

1457
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:55,460
- I know nothing of that.
- What do you mean?

1458
01:43:56,198 --> 01:43:58,403
What about the wonderful
stories you used to write?

1459
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,860
They were trash, Laura, you were
the only one who liked them.

1460
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:05,919
Love, heroism, passion...

1461
01:44:06,984 --> 01:44:11,140
Who said I could write
about things I don't know?

1462
01:44:12,263 --> 01:44:15,492
I should write about fear.

1463
01:44:19,783 --> 01:44:22,052
Fear...

1464
01:44:25,352 --> 01:44:28,069
I'm an expert on that.

1465
01:44:33,513 --> 01:44:36,295
I lost you out of fear.

1466
01:44:40,936 --> 01:44:44,198
0ut of fear I have a job I hate.

1467
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,591
I let Mastronardi down,
I let his son down.

1468
01:44:58,025 --> 01:45:01,570
Sorry, I'm a bit sensitive today.

1469
01:45:05,225 --> 01:45:09,284
I always thought that everything
I'd touch would turn into gold.

1470
01:45:11,369 --> 01:45:13,541
Now look.

1471
01:45:20,906 --> 01:45:24,387
Everything I touch turns into shit.

1472
01:45:43,339 --> 01:45:45,249
Well...

1473
01:45:46,795 --> 01:45:49,664
That's not bad for a start.

1474
01:45:50,507 --> 01:45:52,809
What?

1475
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,235
- Write down my number.
- Sure.

1476
01:46:20,428 --> 01:46:21,890
Wait.

1477
01:46:22,092 --> 01:46:23,554
- Get in the car, come on.
- Let's have some coffee.

1478
01:46:23,756 --> 01:46:25,065
You're getting soaked wet.
Get in the car...

1479
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:26,951
- I want you to call me.
- I know.

1480
01:46:27,148 --> 01:46:29,637
"When you set your mind
to something..." Get in!

1481
01:46:32,045 --> 01:46:33,987
Laura!

1482
01:46:35,629 --> 01:46:37,833
I won't sleep tonight.

1483
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:40,844
Me neither.

1484
01:46:47,245 --> 01:46:50,245
He's got a girlfriend!
He's got a girlfriend!

1485
01:46:50,669 --> 01:46:52,262
He's got a girlfriend!

1486
01:46:52,461 --> 01:46:54,666
What?
Drunk in a rain like this?

1487
01:46:54,862 --> 01:46:56,717
By the way, let's have a drink.

1488
01:46:56,910 --> 01:47:00,456
No, no, no. I have to look
for a job tomorrow...

1489
01:47:00,654 --> 01:47:02,759
which is much harder
than work hard.

1490
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,584
I thought of a short story
to write tomorrow.

1491
01:47:04,782 --> 01:47:06,375
Got a happy ending?
0therwise, I won't publish it.

1492
01:47:06,574 --> 01:47:10,502
It'll be an epic, it starts
long ago, let's say, in 1980.

1493
01:47:10,702 --> 01:47:16,005
Be prepared for a shitty ending
with old fogey people!

1494
01:47:16,206 --> 01:47:18,444
We're getting soaked wet!

1495
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:31,279
"THE SAME LOVE, THE SAME RAIN"
