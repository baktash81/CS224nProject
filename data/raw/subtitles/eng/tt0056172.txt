1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,900
Come on!

2
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,900
Lawrence!

3
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,000
Farraj!

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
Farraj, don`t! Don`t!

5
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Don`t!

6
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
Why do you walk?

7
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,900
But why, lord?

8
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,500
But why, lord?

9
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,200
There is room for both.
lt serves no purpose.

10
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Lawrence, look!

11
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
lt`s all right, Farraj.

12
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,100
lt`s all right.

13
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,000
Who are you?

14
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,800
Who are you?

15
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,800
-Daud!
-We`re here, sir.

16
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
You taking him in there?

17
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

18
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,900
Here!

19
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,200
Here. You!

20
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,200
And where the hell do you think
you`re going to, Mustapha?

21
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
We are thirsty.

22
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,800
-Mr. Lawrence, is it?
-Yes.

23
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,300
-Are you going to the officers` bar?
-Yes.

24
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,900
You can`t take him in there, sir.

25
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,100
What do you think you look like?

26
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
No, no. You must go.

27
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

28
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

29
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,700
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

30
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,800
-This is a bar for British officers.
-We are not particular.

31
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,000
-Are you off your head?
-No. Oddly enough l`m not.

32
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,900
-Just clear out of here, will you?
-Get that boy out of here.

33
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,900
Corporal, we`ll have
this one out anyway.

34
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,100
-Get that wog out of here.
-Clear off.

35
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,000
What`s going on?

36
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,800
-lt`s Lawrence, sir.
-Lemonade with ice.

37
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Explain yourself.

38
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,200
We`ve taken Aqaba.

39
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
-Taken Aqaba? Who has?
-We have.

40
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,200
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

41
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,300
We have.

42
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,900
He likes your lemonade.

43
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,200
You mean the Turks have gone?

44
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,400
No, they`re still there
but they`ve no boots.

45
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,100
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

46
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
That`s not true. We killed some.

47
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,900
Too many, really.
l`ll manage it better next time.

48
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,200
There`s been a lot of killing
one way or another.

49
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,800
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it`s all perfectly true.

50
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
-lt isn`t possible.
-Yes, it is.

51
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
l did it.

52
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,900
You`d better talk to Allenby.

53
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,900
-General Allenby?
-He`s in command. Murray`s gone.

54
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
That`s a step in the right direction.

55
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,900
First l want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

56
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,900
-Yes, of course.
-lt`s for him.

57
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,600
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don`t you?

58
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
See Allenby first, though.

59
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
Will he see me?

60
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,400
l think so.

61
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,700
Do that, then.

62
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,200
-l`d better shave.
-Yes, you had.

63
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,000
You`d better get into
some trousers too.

64
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,100
``Undisciplined.

65
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Unpunctual.

66
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Untidy.

67
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,900
Several languages.

68
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Knowledge of music...

69
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
...literature.

70
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Knowledge of....

71
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,000
Knowledge of....``

72
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,200
You`re an interesting man,
there`s no doubt about it.

73
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,000
-Who told you to take Aqaba?
-Nobody.

74
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,900
-Sir.
-Sir.

75
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Then why did you?

76
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
-Aqaba`s important.
-Why is it important?

77
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
-lt`s the Turkish route to the canal.
-Not anymore.

78
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,400
-They`re coming through Beersheba.
-l know, but we`ve gone to Gaza.

79
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,200
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

80
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
True.

81
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,600
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

82
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,900
Am l going for Jerusalem?

83
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Yes.

84
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Very well.

85
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Aqaba behind my right.

86
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
lt threatened El` ArÃ®sh and Gaza.

87
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
Anything else?

88
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

89
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,700
Aqaba`s linked with Medina.

90
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

91
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,100
No. l think you should
leave them there.

92
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
You acted without orders, you know.

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Shouldn`t officers use
their initiative at all times?

94
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,800
Not really. lt`s awfully dangerous.

95
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Yes, l know.

96
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
Already?

97
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes.

98
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
l`m promoting you major.

99
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,300
l don`t think that`s a very good idea.

100
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,600
l didn`t ask you.
l want you to go back...

101
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,500
...and carry on the good work.

102
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,800
No. Thank you, sir.

103
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,300
-Why not?
-Well, l, it`s....

104
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,800
Let me see now....

105
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,300
l killed two people.
l mean, two Arabs.

106
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,700
One was a boy.

107
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,400
That was...

108
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
...yesterday.

109
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
l led him into a quicksand.

110
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
The other was a man.

111
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
That was...

112
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
...before Aqaba, anyway.

113
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,300
l had to execute him with my pistol.

114
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,900
There was something about it
l didn`t like.

115
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,200
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

116
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,900
That`s all right.
Let it be a warning.

117
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
No. Something else.

118
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
What, then?

119
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,700
l enjoyed it.

120
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,700
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You`re tired.

121
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,100
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

122
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes. Entirely.

123
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,400
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

124
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Fascinating gear they wear.

125
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,200
How would l look in this, Harry?

126
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,900
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

127
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,000
What l`m trying to say
is l don`t think l`m fit for it.

128
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,100
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

129
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,700
Before he did it, sir, l`d have said
it couldn`t be done.

130
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
-Brighton?
-l know what he thinks.

131
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,500
l think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

132
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,800
l don`t think it matters
what his motives were.

133
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,100
lt was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

134
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
-Mr. Perkins!
-Sir!

135
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Let`s have a drink, gentlemen.

136
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,800
-You`ve heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
-Yes, sir.

137
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,300
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

138
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,600
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

139
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,900
Come on, then.

140
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
You`re a clever man, sir.

141
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,200
No, but l know a good thing
when l see one.

142
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,200
That`s fair, surely?

143
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,800
lf l need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
l must concentrate, not dissipate.

144
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,300
-Bravo.
-You know better?

145
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
l fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

146
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn`t we?

147
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,400
Easy, gentlemen, please.

148
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,800
-Give us something to drink.
-Of course, sir.

149
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,900
l`m here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

150
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,800
Tracy.

151
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Shall we go outside?

152
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,000
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

153
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Yes.

154
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,600
With 1 000 Arabs?

155
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
With 1 000 Arabs?

156
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,100
1 000 Arabs means 1 000 knives.

157
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

158
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,500
lt means 1 000 camels.

159
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,100
That means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles.

160
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,400
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

161
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
l`ll smash his railways.

162
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,600
While he mends,
l`ll smash them somewhere else.

163
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,700
ln 1 3 weeks l can have
Arabia in chaos.

164
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
You are going back, then?

165
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes.

166
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,100
Of course l`m going back.

167
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

168
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,400
lf he finds he`s using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

169
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
...he`ll withdraw.

170
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,700
He daren`t withdraw.
Arabia`s part of his empire.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
lf he gets out now,
he`ll never get back again.

172
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,200
-l wonder who will.
-No one will.

173
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,100
Arabia`s for the Arabs now.

174
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,400
That`s what l`ve told them anyway.

175
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
That`s what they think.

176
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,400
-That`s why they`re fighting.
-Oh, surely.

177
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,700
They`ve only one suspicion.

178
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,500
That we`ll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

179
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,200
l`ve told them that that`s false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

180
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Have we?

181
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
l`m not a politician, thank God.

182
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,500
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

183
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
Difficult question, sir.

184
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,600
l want to know, sir,
if l can tell them in your name...

185
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,200
...that we`ve no ambitions in Arabia.

186
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
Certainly.

187
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,700
2000 small arms, not enough.
l need five.

188
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,100
Right.

189
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Money. lt`ll have to be sovereigns.
They don`t like paper.

190
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,100
-lnstructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

191
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
More money.

192
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
-How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

193
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,300
-Dryden?
-lt can be done, sir.

194
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
A couple of armoured cars.

195
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Right.

196
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,300
Field artillery.

197
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
Right.

198
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
l`ll give you every
blessed thing l can...

199
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,100
...because l know you`ll use it.
Congratulations.

200
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,100
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

201
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
Congratulations!

202
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

203
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
l was wondering that, sir.

204
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Might be difficult to get it back.

205
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,300
Give them artillery and you`ve made
them independent.

206
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,400
Then l can`t give it to them, can l?

207
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
-For you to say.
-No, it`s not.

208
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,600
l`ve got orders to obey, thank God.

209
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Not like that poor devil.

210
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,800
He`s riding the whirlwind.

211
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,300
Let`s hope we`re not.

212
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,300
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

213
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,000
To Prince Feisal.

214
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,100
-You`re not Prince Feisal?
-No.

215
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,700
You know him though?

216
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,300
He is my master. l am his servant.

217
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,800
Can you read?

218
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,000
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

219
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,800
l understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

220
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Now....

221
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,300
-Where can l find Major Lawrence?
-ls that what you have come for?

222
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,700
Not altogether, sir, no.

223
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,300
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

224
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,600
That`s what l meant, sir.
Where can l find your army?

225
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,000
l don`t know.

226
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,400
-Last week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

227
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,500
Yes, l fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

228
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,000
-l`ve never tried.
-Take a mule.

229
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,700
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

230
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,700
ln Mellaha now? They move fast.

231
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,200
They do.

232
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,600
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

233
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,400
Myself...

234
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,900
...l am going to Cairo.

235
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
-As you know.
-Yes.

236
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,900
There`s work for me there
of a different kind.

237
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600
Yes.

238
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
l understand you`ve
been given no artillery.

239
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,600
-That is so.
-You`re handicapped?

240
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,900
lt restricts us to small things.

241
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,400
lt`s intended to.

242
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,700
Do you know General Allenby?

243
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,100
Watch out for Allenby.
He`s a slim customer.

244
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,100
-Excuse me?
-A clever man.

245
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,300
Slim customer. lt`s very good.

246
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,100
l`ll certainly watch out for him.
You`re being very sympathetic.

247
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,900
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

248
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,500
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

249
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
...who struggle for their freedom.

250
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
Very gratifying.

251
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,500
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

252
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,000
l badly want a story to tell.

253
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,000
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

254
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,500
l will give you a guide and a letter.

255
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
And before l leave here...

256
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,300
...which must be presently...

257
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,000
...l will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

258
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,100
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

259
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,400
l do, sir.

260
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

261
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,300
My army is made up of tribes.

262
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

263
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,900
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

264
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

265
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,100
ln this country, Mr. Bentley...

266
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,300
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

267
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,200
...beyond every other man.

268
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,000
One figure l can give you
from my head...

269
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,900
...because it never leaves my head.

270
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,500
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

271
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,800
...3 7 wounded...

272
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,700
...1 56 dead.

273
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,100
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

274
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,600
Yeah.

275
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,300
Four times as many.

276
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,200
That`s because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

277
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,000
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

278
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,100
-You mean...?
-We leave no wounded for the Turks.

279
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,000
ln their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

280
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,700
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

281
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,800
...and are treated harshly.

282
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,600
How harshly?

283
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,800
More harshly than l hope
you can imagine.

284
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,600
l see.

285
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,000
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

286
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,100
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

287
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,300
-l should like you to notice that.
-Yes, sir.

288
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,000
ls that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

289
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
Why should you suppose?

290
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
lt`s just that l heard
in Cairo that...

291
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,100
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

292
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
That is exactly so.

293
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,700
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

294
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,900
With me, it is merely good manners.

295
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,300
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

296
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,300
-And now, perhaps....
-Oh, sure, sure.

297
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Thank you, sir.

298
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,100
Can you manage the letter--?

299
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,200
l`ll do everything l have said...

300
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,900
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

301
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,600
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

302
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,600
lt`s very simple, sir.
l`m looking for a hero.

303
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,300
lndeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

304
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,700
Oh, no.

305
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,700
But influential men back home believe
it`s time for America...

306
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,700
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

307
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
And Turkey.

308
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,500
l`ve been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is....

309
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
-Enjoyable?
-Hardly that, sir.

310
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,700
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

311
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,500
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

312
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,900
All right. Yes.

313
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,200
Lawrence is your man.

314
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,100
Stop!

315
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,100
Stop it!

316
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,300
Stop it!

317
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,000
Come on, men!

318
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,500
Lawrence!

319
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Good God! God!

320
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

321
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,900
Why don`t you take a picture?

322
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,500
Wish l had.

323
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,000
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

324
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Am l in this?

325
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,000
Did you take his picture?

326
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,500
Yeah.

327
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,000
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

328
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Charming company you keep.

329
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,100
Auda?

330
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,900
He`s a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

331
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,400
He thinks you`re a kind of thief.

332
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,700
lt`s all right to take your picture?

333
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,800
-All right.
-Okay.

334
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Just walk.

335
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Major Lawrence!

336
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,200
Yes, sir, that`s my baby.

337
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
This looting has got to stop!

338
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
lt is customary.

339
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,200
lt`s theft. And theft makes thieves.

340
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,700
l would not say that to Auda.

341
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,000
-lt is their payment, colonel.
-Payment.

342
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,000
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

343
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,200
-They don`t go home when being paid.
-They are not free to.

344
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,100
Well, there`s another lot you`ve
seen the last of.

345
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
They`ll come back.

346
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
He says they`ll come back.
Will they?

347
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Not this year, Lawrence.

348
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,400
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you`ll have left? 200?

349
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,400
-Less.
-Well, then?

350
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,100
l said, they`ll come back.

351
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
You badly hurt?

352
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,300
Not hurt at all.

353
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,700
Didn`t you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

354
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,300
lt is for children.
l have set myself to learn again.

355
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,300
-What are you learning from this?
-Politics.

356
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,400
You`ll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

357
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,400
l will tell you that
when l have a country.

358
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,000
Did l answer well?

359
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,500
You answered without
saying anything. That`s politics.

360
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,500
You learn quickly.

361
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,000
l have a good teacher.

362
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah.

363
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,600
-How`s your hurt?
-Fine.

364
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Before l return to the fleshpots,
which l shall be very glad to do...

365
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,900
...may l put two questions to you,
straight?

366
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,500
l`d be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

367
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,900
One.

368
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,300
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

369
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,000
They hope to gain their freedom.

370
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Freedom.

371
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,500
``They hope to gain their freedom.``

372
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,400
-There`s one born every minute.
-They`re going to get it.

373
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,300
l`m going to give it to them.

374
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,800
-The second question?
-Well, l was going to ask...

375
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,300
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

376
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,400
lt`s clean.

377
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,700
Well, now...

378
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,700
...that`s a very illuminating answer.

379
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,700
May l...

380
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,900
...take one farewell picture?

381
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,800
l gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

382
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
One clock for two lamps.

383
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,700
A fair bargain.

384
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,600
Fair? l robbed him.

385
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Trash.

386
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,100
l must find something honorable.

387
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
Honorable?

388
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,300
The year is running out, Brighton.

389
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,700
l must find something honorable.

390
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,400
Now you may blow up my train.

391
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,400
And what will you do now?

392
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,200
Now l go home.
They will carry my toys.

393
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
They will carry my toys too, see?

394
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

395
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,100
But you got what you wanted,
so you`re going home, is that it?

396
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,900
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

397
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,700
When you`ve got what you want,
you will go home.

398
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,600
No, l shan`t, Auda.

399
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,800
Then you are a fool.

400
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,400
Maybe. But l am not a deserter.

401
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

402
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,100
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool`s face.

403
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
You are an impudent rascal.

404
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,300
l must go, Lawrence, before l
soil myself with a fool`s blood.

405
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,400
Like talking to a brick wall.

406
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,800
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

407
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,100
l`ll go north.

408
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,300
That`s what Allenby wants.

409
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,600
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

410
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,100
Then that`s where l`ll take it.

411
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,000
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we`ll be
in Deraa before he`s in Jerusalem.

412
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,400
Won`t we?

413
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,000
Train, Farraj.

414
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,500
Yeah, Lawrence.

415
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,600
Hide yourself, my friend.

416
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,200
Detonator.

417
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,400
All right, fetch another.

418
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,400
-Pardon, Lawrence. l put--
-Plenty of time. Fetch another.

419
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,300
Farraj?

420
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,600
-What happened?
-Detonator. A detonator!

421
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,600
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

422
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,000
lf they take him alive,
you know what they`ll do to him.

423
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,800
Daud will be angry with you.

424
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,700
Salute him for me.

425
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,200
What will you do now?

426
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,100
Go north.

427
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,800
With twenty?

428
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,100
What would
you recommend me to do?

429
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900
What would you recommend?

430
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,200
He hasn`t 1 /1 0 so many men, sir.

431
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,200
He`s lied, in fact.

432
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,300
Yes and no. He doesn`t claim to have
done anything he hasn`t done.

433
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,200
Then there is an Arab north army.

434
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,200
-No, sir, he has lied about that.
-Any idea why?

435
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,600
-lt`s his army, l suppose.
-lt`s Prince Feisal`s army.

436
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,600
Do you think he`s gone native, Harry?

437
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,500
No.

438
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,300
He would if he could, l think.

439
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,500
-Not my line of country.
-lt doesn`t matter. Just curious.

440
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,500
What matters is l believed it.

441
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,400
The Turks believe it.

442
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,100
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

443
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,800
Good heavens.

444
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,000
-Shouldn`t say he had long to live.
-Whatever else, he`s a brave man--

445
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,600
Surely, surely. lf he`s still going north
with 50 men, he doesn`t lack guts.

446
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,500
l wonder if they`d offer that much
for me.

447
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,400
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

448
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
l wouldn`t be surprised.

449
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,400
-They think he`s a kind of prophet.
-They do or he does?

450
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,600
-Now may l speak?
-Yes.

451
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,400
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

452
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,300
-l do not include myself.
-l do not include the others.

453
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,800
So say they love you.

454
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,700
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

455
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,100
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

456
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,500
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

457
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,900
That`s right. That`s right.

458
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,000
Who are you to know
what can be done?

459
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,100
lf we`d done what you thought could
be done, we`d be in Yenbo now.

460
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,200
Whatever l ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don`t.

461
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,200
Do you think l`m just anybody?

462
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,100
Do you?

463
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,700
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

464
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,500
-Who will come with me into Deraa?
-Deraa is garrisoned.

465
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,800
Will you take 20 against 2000?

466
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,800
-l`ll go by myself if l have to.
-Why?

467
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,900
Because l told the English generals...

468
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,800
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they`d be in Jerusalem.

469
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,300
Or perhaps you are here...

470
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
...for the English generals.

471
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,600
Who says this?

472
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,200
Rumour.

473
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,000
That is not an argument.

474
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,500
Oh, argument.

475
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,100
This afternoon l will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

476
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,700
...while the Arabs argue.

477
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,800
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

478
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,900
Yes. lf one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

479
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,400
lt`s madness.

480
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,700
What are you looking for?

481
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,400
Some way to announce myself.

482
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,600
Be patient with him, God.

483
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,200
-Do you not see how they look at you?
-Peace, Ali, l am invisible.

484
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,700
Halt!

485
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,200
Walk on.

486
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,300
-Halt!
-Walk on.

487
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,600
You and you.

488
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
You.

489
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
You have blue eyes.

490
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,500
-l say you have blue eyes.
-Yes, effendi.

491
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,000
-Are you Circassian?
-Yes, effendi.

492
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,500
How old are you?

493
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,700
Twenty-seven, effendi.

494
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,900
l think.

495
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,600
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

496
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,000
lt`s an interesting face.

497
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,100
l am surrounded by cattle.

498
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,400
He wouldn`t know an interesting face
from a sow`s belly.

499
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,400
l have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

500
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,100
lf they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, l could not be more...

501
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,100
...isolated.

502
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,600
You haven`t the least idea
what l`m talking about.

503
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,600
No, effendi.

504
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,600
Have you?

505
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,100
No.

506
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,600
That would be too...

507
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,400
...lucky.

508
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,700
Where did you get that?

509
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,800
-lt`s old, effendi.
-No, this is recent.

510
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,100
-You are a deserter.
-No, effendi.

511
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,200
Yes, you are a deserter.

512
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,600
But from which army?

513
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,400
Not that it matters at all.

514
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,000
A man cannot be always in uniform.

515
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Your skin is very fair.

516
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,700
Beat him.

517
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,600
To me!

518
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,600
Sleep.

519
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,000
Sleep.

520
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,100
Eat.

521
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,200
Eat.

522
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,900
You have a body, like other men.

523
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Good.

524
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,400
Then sleep.

525
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,200
Better?

526
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,500
Much better. You were right.

527
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,000
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

528
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, l`ve learned all right.

529
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,500
l`m going, Ali.

530
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,600
-Why?
-Why?

531
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,200
Heavens.

532
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,800
Why?

533
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,900
l`ve come to the end of myself,
l suppose.

534
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,200
And the end of the Arab revolt?

535
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,600
l`m not the Arab revolt, Ali.
l`m not even Arab.

536
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,900
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

537
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,100
l`m sorry. l thought it was true.

538
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,300
You proved it.

539
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,700
Look, Ali. Look.

540
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,700
That`s me. What colour is it?
That`s me.

541
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,800
And there`s nothing l can do about it.

542
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,700
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

543
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,000
He can...

544
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,100
...but he can`t want what he wants.

545
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,200
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

546
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,800
You may as well know.
l would`ve told them anything.

547
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,000
l would`ve told them who l am.
l would`ve told them where you were.

548
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,000
-l tried to.
-So would any man.

549
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,700
Well, any man is what l am.

550
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,700
And l`m going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

551
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
...that any man can do.

552
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,300
Allenby`s in Jerusalem.

553
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,200
-l`ll make easy stages.
-You?

554
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,300
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

555
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,600
Look, Ali, l think l see
a way of being just...

556
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,400
...ordinarily...

557
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,500
...happy.

558
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,900
Can l take this?

559
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,500
lt is not clean.

560
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,700
No, but it`s warm.

561
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,400
And these...

562
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,600
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

563
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:28,300
You lead them. They`re yours.
Trust your own people.

564
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,700
And let me go back to mine.

565
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,000
-l say, don`t forget those form fives.
-All right.

566
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,700
Mind if l join you?

567
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,200
Honoured, sir.

568
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,800
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

569
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,900
-What`s doing out there?
-Where?

570
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,500
-Arabia?
-Well, yes, sir.

571
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,000
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What`s doing here?

572
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,700
We`re settling in.
We built a squash court.

573
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,400
Jolly good.

574
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,200
Well, l have to go up there.

575
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,600
lt`s borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

576
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,600
Bloody wogs.

577
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,900
Yes, probably.

578
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,000
Jolly good about the squash court.

579
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,200
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn`t he?

580
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,800
Morning.

581
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,700
-Good morning, sir.
-Good to be back.

582
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,100
-l`ll believe you, sir.
-No, really it is.

583
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,700
Hello.

584
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,400
Morning. You`re to go right in.

585
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,900
Lawrence.

586
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,200
Or is it Major Lawrence?

587
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,300
Sir.

588
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,900
Well, general, l will leave you.

589
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,100
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

590
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,200
...about my people
and their weakness...

591
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,200
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

592
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,300
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

593
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
l told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

594
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,200
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

595
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,500
l know this treaty does exist.

596
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,600
Treaty, sir?

597
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,800
He does it better than you, general.

598
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,300
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

599
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,200
You really don`t know?

600
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
Then what the devil`s this?

601
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,400
lt`s my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

602
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,000
For what reason?

603
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,500
You sure you haven`t heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

604
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,000
No.

605
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,000
-l can guess.
-Don`t guess. Tell him.

606
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,200
Well, now....

607
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

608
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,000
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

609
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,400
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

610
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,000
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

611
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,000
lncluding Arabia.

612
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,400
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

613
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,700
An agreement to that effect.

614
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,900
There may be honour among thieves,
but there`s none in politicians.

615
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,900
And let`s have
no displays of indignation.

616
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,300
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

617
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,200
lf we`ve told lies,
you`ve told half-lies.

618
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,800
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

619
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:55,800
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

620
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,700
The truth is l`m an ordinary man.

621
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,600
You might have told me that, Dryden.

622
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And l want an ordinary job, sir.

623
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,600
That`s my reason for resigning.

624
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,500
lt`s personal.

625
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,900
-Personal?
-Yes, sir.

626
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,300
Personal?
You`re a serving officer in the field.

627
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,900
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

628
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,400
No, and if you don`t mind,
l`d rather not go mad.

629
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,700
That`s my reason too.

630
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,900
Look, l`m making my big push
on Damascus the 1 6th of next month...

631
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,100
...and you are part of it.

632
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,200
Can you understand that? You`re
an important part of the big push!

633
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,400
l don`t want to be part
of your big push!

634
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,100
What about your Arab friends?

635
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,200
l have no Arab friends!
l don`t want Arab friends!

636
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,600
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

637
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:57,000
l`ve told you, l just want
my ration of common humanity.

638
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,100
-Lawrence.
-Yes?

639
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,600
Nothing. Sorry l interrupted, sir.

640
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,000
That`s all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

641
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,900
Thank you, sir.

642
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,200
Why don`t we...?

643
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,600
There`s blood on your back.

644
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,000
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

645
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,400
Tell me what happened.

646
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,500
Say, what goes on in there?

647
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,200
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

648
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,800
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-ls the man in trouble?

649
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
l expect so. We all have troubles.
Life`s a vale of troubles.

650
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,100
Let me know if the man`s in trouble.
l`ve got a claim in that man.

651
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,800
-What claim?
-l`ve made that boy a hero.

652
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,800
When the war`s over,
he can be anything he wants.

653
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,300
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

654
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,700
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

655
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,700
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

656
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,700
Always walking away, aren`t you?

657
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,500
Well, l`ll tell you.

658
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,700
lt`s a clash of temperament
that`s going on in there.

659
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,800
lnevitably, one of them`s half-mad...

660
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,800
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

661
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,700
l believe your name will
be a household word...

662
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,900
...when you`d have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

663
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,700
You`re the most extraordinary man
l ever met.

664
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,700
Leave me alone.

665
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,600
-Leave me alone.
-That`s a feeble thing to say.

666
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,400
-l know l`m not ordinary.
-That`s not what l`m saying.

667
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,400
All right, l`m extraordinary.

668
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,500
What of it?

669
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,500
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

670
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,900
lt`s a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

671
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,200
Are you speaking from experience?

672
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,900
No.

673
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,900
You`re guessing, then.

674
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,400
Suppose you`re wrong.

675
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,700
Why suppose that?
We both know l`m right.

676
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,500
-Yes. l said, yes.
-After all--

677
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,100
-The 1 6th?
-Can you do it?

678
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,400
l`ll give you a lot of money.

679
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,500
-Artillery?
-l can`t.

680
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,700
They won`t be coming for money,
not the best of them.

681
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,200
They`ll be coming for Damascus.

682
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,300
Which l`m going to give them.

683
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,800
That`s all l want.

684
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,800
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

685
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,300
But l`m going to give them Damascus.
We`ll get there before you do.

686
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,700
And when we`ve got it, we`ll keep it.

687
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,300
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

688
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,900
Fair enough.

689
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,300
Fair? What`s fair got to do with it?

690
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,900
lt`s going to happen.

691
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,700
l shall want quite a lot of money.

692
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,100
All there is.

693
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,200
Not that much.

694
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,300
The best of them
won`t come for money.

695
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,600
They`ll come for me.

696
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,300
No pictures!

697
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,900
lt`s not for you, it`s for Major Lawrence.

698
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,300
He doesn`t mind having his picture
taken. He doesn`t mind at all.

699
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,800
Well, there`s only one Lawrence.

700
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,900
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he`s come back?

701
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,500
Yes.

702
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,000
-Changed, hasn`t he?
-No.

703
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,100
Oh, l`d say he had.
Different man, l`d say.

704
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:59,500
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

705
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:05,000
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

706
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,200
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

707
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,200
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

708
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,400
-l did.
-What did he say?

709
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,200
He laughed.

710
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,300
He told me to gather the Harith here.

711
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,400
He offered me money.

712
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,300
Did you take it?

713
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,700
No. But many did.

714
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,500
-What is this?
-This is my bodyguard.

715
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,800
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

716
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,700
-There`s a price on my head too.
-But these are murderers.

717
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,900
The sheiks will hang these men.

718
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,900
These men are mine.

719
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,800
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

720
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,600
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
-Sherif?

721
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,800
-Where do we ride?
-Damascus, sherif.

722
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,900
Aye, but for what?

723
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,300
Sherif, for Lawrence.

724
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,700
-You have bought these things.
-l bought half the men here, Ali.

725
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,700
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

726
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,900
l don`t want ordinary men. Hut!

727
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,800
Damascus!

728
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,100
Damascus! Damascus!

729
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,400
Damascus! Damascus!

730
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,900
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry`s
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

731
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,800
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

732
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,600
lf the enemy`s retreating in
any order, which we`ll assume--

733
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
Certainly.

734
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,800
He can`t be far from Mallud...

735
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,700
...in which case l can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

736
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Splendid. Philip.

737
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,000
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

738
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,800
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

739
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,000
That`ll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

740
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,400
Any questions?

741
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,000
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what`s it consist of?

742
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,700
lrregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

743
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,800
Where are they now?

744
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,400
-Can only know by being with them.
-Then get with them. l want to know.

745
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,000
Pound them, Charley.

746
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,000
Pound them.

747
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,400
God help the men who lie under that.

748
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,300
They`re Turks.

749
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,100
God help them.

750
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,600
Well, he`s got the bit
between his teeth all right.

751
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,200
Cocky?

752
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,100
More than cocky, sir.

753
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,700
He`s got the bit
between his teeth all right.

754
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,400
l tell you, sir, l think
he`ll get to Damascus before we do.

755
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,000
-Unless....
-Unless?

756
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,000
Well, there`s a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

757
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,300
-What do the Turks have in Mazril?
-A brigade, sir.

758
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,500
l wonder where they are now.

759
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,700
No prisoners.

760
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,300
Damascus, Lawrence.

761
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,100
Lawrence, not this.

762
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

763
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,100
No prisoners.

764
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,800
This was Talaal`s village.

765
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,100
Talaal!

766
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,300
Talaal!

767
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
No prisoners!

768
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,900
No prisoners!

769
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,100
God.

770
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,200
God.

771
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,500
God!

772
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,000
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

773
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,600
Major!

774
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,900
Major Lawrence!

775
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,200
Jesus wept.

776
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,100
Jesus wept.

777
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

778
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,400
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

779
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,500
Barbarous and cruel.

780
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,200
Who but they?

781
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,900
Who but they?

782
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,600
Oh, you rotten man.

783
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:57,100
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

784
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,300
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

785
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,300
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

786
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,400
Damascus!

787
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,500
Take them to Sherif Ali.

788
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,100
Tell him.

789
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,800
Remind him.

790
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,800
-ls Allenby in Damascus?
-Near.

791
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,900
Tell Sherif Ali that.

792
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,000
They are not ripe.

793
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
General salute!

794
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,500
Present arms!

795
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,700
Port arms!

796
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,400
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

797
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,500
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

798
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,600
-When?
-A day and a night, sir.

799
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,700
They`ve been here a day and a night.

800
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,400
They`ve occupied the town.
They`ve done it.

801
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:41,600
He`s set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

802
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,300
What else beside the town hall?

803
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,400
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

804
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,100
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

805
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:53,200
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

806
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,100
...and they`re in the town hall.

807
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,200
Well, they`re your pigeon, Harry.

808
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,400
What should we do about it?

809
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,000
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

810
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,800
How about that, Dryden?

811
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,300
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

812
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,100
-What, then?
-When will Feisal be in Damascus?

813
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
By special train in two days` time.

814
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,900
Two days.

815
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,500
Two days is what you asked for.
l can`t keep him out any longer.

816
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,800
-lsn`t it enough?
-Yes.

817
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,400
-Ample, l should think.
-We can`t just do nothing.

818
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,300
Why not? lt`s usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

819
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,800
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

820
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,800
Does that apply to technical units?

821
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,200
Technical units particularly.

822
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,800
Yes, sir.

823
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,800
Medicals too, sir?

824
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,200
l`m afraid so, Harry.

825
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,300
Medicals too.

826
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,200
We here...

827
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,300
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

828
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,700
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

829
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,500
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

830
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,700
He insulted me.

831
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:49,000
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

832
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,000
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

833
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,200
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

834
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,000
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

835
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,800
lf you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

836
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,200
You speak to me of bloodshed?

837
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:15,900
l ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

838
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,700
Humbly?

839
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,200
Humbly, Harith?

840
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
Yes, humbly.

841
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,000
This is a new trick.

842
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,700
Why is there no electricity?

843
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,400
l have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

844
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,500
There are three large machines.

845
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,100
He means generators!

846
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,800
So.

847
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,900
One of them is burning.

848
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,300
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

849
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,300
lt is so of all machines.

850
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,500
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

851
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,400
-The need is absolute.
-Then we need English engineers.

852
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,300
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

853
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,700
Take--

854
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,100
Fire has broken out.

855
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,900
-Where?
-The Jinsibi district.

856
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,000
-lt is not a district that matters.
-lt will spread!

857
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,000
Then use the fire brigade!

858
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,100
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

859
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,800
Then you must carry it.

860
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:23,400
-The Ruala do not carry water.
-What else are they good for?

861
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,300
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

862
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,900
This afternoon!

863
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,600
-l`ll take this up after the war.
-Surely we should do something, sir.

864
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,800
-lt`s an old man`s sport.
-Are you an old man, sir?

865
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,900
All l can say is, sir,
it`s a heavy responsibility.

866
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,700
Sorry, sir.

867
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,600
Maybe it`s the bulb.

868
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,400
No, sir.

869
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,500
lt`s the power.

870
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,100
They`re leaving.

871
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,500
That`s it, then.

872
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,100
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren`t they?

873
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:19,200
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

874
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,400
-Come where?
-Back.

875
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:28,100
l know your heart.

876
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,200
What is it?

877
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,900
ls it this?

878
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,700
l tell you, this is nothing.

879
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,600
ls it the blood?

880
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,500
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

881
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,400
l pray that l may never
see the desert again.

882
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,700
Hear me, God.

883
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:19,300
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

884
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,400
What about you?

885
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,000
No, l shall stay here
and learn politics.

886
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,900
A very low occupation.

887
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,500
l had not thought of it
when l met you.

888
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,400
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

889
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,500
lt`s what l came for.

890
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,200
And then...

891
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,000
...it would be something.

892
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,500
Yes.

893
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,300
Much.

894
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,800
-He is your friend?
-Take your hand away.

895
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,300
-You love him.
-l fear him.

896
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,400
Then why do you weep?

897
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:42,900
lf l fear him, who love him...

898
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:46,000
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

899
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,500
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

900
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,200
So you are not yet entirely politician.

901
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,500
Not yet.

902
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:01,000
Well, these are new tricks,
and l am an old dog.

903
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,500
And Allah be thanked.

904
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,400
l`ll tell thee what...

905
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:09,000
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

906
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,800
ln all my years,
l`ve never seen anything like it.

907
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:36,900
lt comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

908
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,500
Under the circumstances, l think
l must take over. lmmediately.

909
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,800
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

910
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,600
No, sir, l will not.

911
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,200
Control yourself.

912
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,800
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

913
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,000
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

914
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,100
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

915
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,900
lt has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

916
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,200
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

917
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,400
What`s it like?

918
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,300
This is outrageous!

919
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,300
Outrageous!

920
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,200
Outrageous!

921
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,500
You filthy little wog!

922
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:02,200
My friend Lawrence,
if l may call him that.

923
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,900
``My friend Lawrence.``

924
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:09,700
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

925
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:12,600
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

926
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,900
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

927
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,800
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

928
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:25,500
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

929
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,200
That`s me you`re describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

930
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,400
You`re promoted colonel.

931
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,100
Yes. What for?

932
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:38,500
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

933
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:42,800
As a colonel, you`ll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

934
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,700
Then, thank you.

935
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,100
Well, then...

936
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,800
...Godspeed.

937
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,200
There`s nothing further here
for a warrior.

938
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:01,600
We drive bargains. Old men`s work.

939
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,200
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

940
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:06,200
...are the virtues of young men.

941
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:09,900
Courage and hope for the future.

942
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,800
Then old men make the peace.

943
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,800
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

944
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,500
Mistrust and caution.

945
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,300
lt must be so.

946
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:43,300
What l owe you is beyond evaluation.

947
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,700
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these l concede.

948
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,700
The pumping plant l must retain.

949
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,500
lf you retain it,
there will be no water.

950
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:05,400
-l shall be glad of assistance.
-Then you must bring down your flag.

951
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:09,600
l shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

952
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,500
-Have you men?
-Enough of that.

953
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:14,100
lt`s a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

954
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,300
l`m sure your government...

955
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,400
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

956
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:24,200
l say!

957
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,500
lt`s Lawrence, isn`t it?

958
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,100
May l shake your hand, sir?

959
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,800
Just want to be able
to say l`d done it, sir.

960
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,700
Haven`t we met before?

961
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,500
Don`t think so, sir.

962
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:46,500
No, no, sir, l should remember that.

963
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,900
lt is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

964
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,100
They have no power. lt`s illusory.

965
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,800
lllusions can be very powerful.

966
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,700
Particularly...

967
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,300
...when they take this form.

968
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,400
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

969
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,600
...liberated by the Arab army.

970
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:17,200
Led, may l remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

971
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:22,800
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

972
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,100
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

973
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,900
l thought l was a hard man, sir.

974
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,100
You are merely a general.

975
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,100
l must be a king.

976
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,000
Excuse me, sir.

977
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,900
Well?

978
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,200
Well...

979
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,500
...it seems we`re to have
a British waterworks...

980
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,000
...with an Arab flag on it.

981
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,100
Do you think it was worth it?

982
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:13,000
Not my business.
Thank God l`m a soldier.

983
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,500
Yes, sir.

984
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,400
So you keep saying.

985
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,200
You, l suspect...

986
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:22,600
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

987
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,200
-What do you think?
-Me, Your Highness?

988
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:31,100
On the whole, l wish
l`d stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

989
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:12,200
Well, sir. Going home.

990
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,200
Home, sir.

991
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:26,900
Goodbye, Do//y, I must /eave you

992
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,300
Though it breaks my heart to go
