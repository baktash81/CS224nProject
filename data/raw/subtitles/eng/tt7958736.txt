Honey, quit picking at it.

21
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,019
Are you nervous or what?

22
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:11,822
Yeah, a little.
It's a pretty big school.

23
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,957
Well, first days
are always a little goofy,

24
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,660
but you and I
are gonna be fine.

25
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:19,029
We are modern babes
in a modern world.

26
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:21,932
Oh, my God, how am I
related to you?

27
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,236
Hey. Do you need some help?

28
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:02,906
Um, yeah. Maybe.

29
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,108
It didn't charge right
last night,

30
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,009
- so it's low on juice.
- Here. Hold up.

31
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,047
- Let me get you.
- Oh.

32
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:13,150
So, which way are you headed?

33
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,686
All I needed was a push.
It should be enough.

34
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,123
Oh. Okay.

35
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,257
Thanks for being so nice.

36
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,927
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah. You, too.

37
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,631
"You, too"?

38
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:33,103
You are Erica. I am Stu.

39
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,938
We are now coworkers.

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,241
Nice to meet you, Stu.

41
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,076
How's your first day
on the floor going?

42
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,912
Is it everything you ever
dreamed of and so much more?

43
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,781
Sure beats having a desk job.

44
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,329
Okay...

45
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,767
Okay.

46
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,846
You do have a nice ass.

47
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,915
I noticed it this morning.
I'm very perceptive.

48
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,149
I'm not, like...

49
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,151
a lesbian or anything.

50
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:23,754
You're new, on a Friday,

51
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,989
in February,
which is very weird.

52
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,224
Military brat?

53
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,926
Uh, no.

54
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,961
Uh, yeah, I'm Maggie.

55
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,229
Today's my first day.

56
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,264
- I transferred.
- That sucks.

57
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,367
- I was new last year, so I get it.
- Mm.

58
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,336
Um...

59
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:40,338
Stephanie, are you still
having people over

60
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,372
for a party tomorrow?

61
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:42,773
- Yeah.
- Cool.

62
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,977
You can come with us
if you want.

63
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,912
- Haley.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,181
Thanks. I'm going to
the music festival with my mom.

65
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,550
So...

66
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:54,151
Okay.

67
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,187
Damn, a lot of people
would kill to be so popular.

68
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:59,089
- Okay.
- Have fun with your mom

69
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,258
and all those
fucking old people.

70
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,771
Shit.

71
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,941
Shit, shit.

72
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,347
Shit.

73
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,180
Hey, what's wrong?

74
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:25,583
Well, nothing. I'm just...

75
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:28,285
I have to cover
for somebody now at work.

76
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,255
What about the music festival?

77
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,991
Well, there's not much
I can do about it, honey.

78
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:37,428
I'm the new kid,
and we got to make money, so...

79
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,297
I made you some pancakes.

80
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,601
All right, I'll text you
a little later, okay?

81
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:45,235

Maggie came to party.

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,439
Maggie came to party.

90
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,440
Get in. Go.

91
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,141
Faster, faster. Boys...

92
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,242
Maggie.

93
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:26,444
- Yo, what's up?
- Maggie, boys.

94
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,111
How you doing, Maggie?

95
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,080
Oh, you-you might know me.
I'm Darrell.

96
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,349
- Okay.
- That's Andy.

97
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,283
- Hi.
- And this gay dude is Chaz.

98
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,218
- Yeah, I'm-I'm very straight.
- Super gay.

99
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
- I love pussy. Babe, tell 'em.
- Super gay.

100
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,357
- Tell 'em I love pussy, babe.
- So, the party's canceled.

101
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,924
Stephanie's mom's
a complete bitch.

102
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,225
And I think
we're just gonna, like,

103
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,328
drive around and get drunk.

104
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,495
- Okay.
- Is that cool?

105
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:45,929
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Very cool.

106
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,264
- Are you sure?
- Super cool.

107
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,466
- Great.
- All right, let's do it.

108
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,101
Let's get drunk!

109
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,043
Hey, hey, mister, uh,
can you, uh...

110
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,112
Yup. Nah.

111
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,016
Literally looks like
he's gonna throw up.

112
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,920
Dude always looks like that.

113
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,189
Want a drag?

114
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,990
It's cotton candy.

115
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,226
- No, I'm good.
- What, you don't vape?

116
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,495
- No.
- Come on, you're in high school.

117
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,397
You can smoke
as much as you want

118
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,065
until you're 25 and then quit,
and nothing bad will happen.

119
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,103
Here we go.

120
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,205
- Hey, sir, can you, uh...
- Piss off, boy.

121
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:32,377
He's too desperate about it.

122
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,145
Hey, yo, man,
this shit racist out here.

123
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,414
- Your turn.
- Nope. Not me.

124
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,316
The guy that works here
knows my stepdad.

125
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:39,717
I vote Maggie.

126
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:42,052
She's new,
and no one knows who she is.

127
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,955
And truthfully, you could be
a narc, and that scares me.

128
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,492
Look, if the cops come,
just cry. They'll let you off.

129
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,259
What? They never let me off.

130
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,362
Yeah, 'cause they know
you nasty.

131
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:54,164
Darrell.

132
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,501
Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:56,503 --> 00:08:00,137
- Hi. Excuse me. Could...
- Get lost.

134
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,039
Hey.

135
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,274
Be more confident.

136
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,276
Hey, what you got for me?

137
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,545
- Hey, come on.
- Uh-uh.

138
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,146
Not today. Not today.

139
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,316
Come on, sweetie.

140
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,084
Come on.

141
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,988
Got to do one more lap.

142
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,557
- Um...
- Come on.

143
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,992
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Yeah?

144
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:24,462
Um, would you mind buying this
for my friends and I?

145
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,196
I have money for it.

146
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,198
Not interested, kid.

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,569
- Come on.
- I know it's... I know it's weird, but please?

148
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,404
You want to spend the night
in jail?

149
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,506
Does that sound fun to you?

150
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,140
The fuck?

151
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,343
- Andy, can we just go?
- Yeah, let's roll. Yeah.

152
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,946
Sorry.

153
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh.

154
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:46,486
Okay.

155
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,153
Now I see what's going on.

156
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,357
A man sending a girl
to do his dirty work.

157
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,091
Guys, I used to do

158
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,494
the same thing
when I was your age.

159
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,128
We're sorry.

160
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,163
Could you hook us up, though?

161
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,468
Mm. I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

162
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,202
if you got into an accident.

163
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,571
Oh, well, I'm driving,
and I don't drink.

164
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:08,473
We were just gonna go to
the rock pile for a little bit.

165
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,474
I promise. Just...

166
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:11,041
Mm.

167
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:12,610
I know where that is.

168
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:14,512
Shoot.

169
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:18,183
We used to hang out there
all the time when I was a kid.

170
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,294
Hell. Hold this dog.

171
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,364
Yes!

172
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,632
And don't tell.

173
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,536
No.

174
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:41,341
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Sue Ann.

175
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:46,844
Hey, y'all know dogs kill
more people than sharks, right?

176
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:49,380
That's great, Darrell.
Thank you.

177
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,281
What?

178
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,551
Whoo! There's my girl.

179
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,654
Okay. They didn't have
whatever Fireball is,

180
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:58,556
so I got After Shock.

181
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,123
- Yeah.
- Man said it's the same thing.

182
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,559
This never happened, okay?

183
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,293
- Whoop.
- Thanks again for doing this, ma'am.

184
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,630
For doing what, darling?

185
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,532
Come on, baby.

186
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,569
Come on, sweetie.

187
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,671
Yo, that old chick wants
to sit on your face, dude.

188
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:16,474
- What, you think so?
- Like, your entire face.

189
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,112
- Smash her back.
- Dude, I don't know.

190
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,315
- Oh, come on. Guys.
- That's not really...

191
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,585
All right,
I would... I would smash.

192
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,353
- Hey. - Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

193
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:31,689
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

194
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:34,525
Your change.
I'm not some thug.

195
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,894
No, of course not. Thanks.

196
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,632
- Thanks again.
- Drive safe.

197
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,414
Sue Ann!

198
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,418
Go clean out the kennels!

199
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:05,623
Bingo.

200
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,492
Oh, hey, could you
get me some lunch first?

201
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,768
All right, someone start
the fire, assholes. Let's go.

202
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,269
Let's all get shit-faced.

203
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,174
Seems pretty secluded.

204
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,576
Yeah, sadly,
this is pretty much

205
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,411
the best drinking spot in town.

206
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,647
So, when did you get here?
From where?

207
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,716
From San Diego,
like a week ago.

208
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,317
Oh, yeah. That's, uh...

209
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,518
that's enough time to realize

210
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,554
there's nothing to do
in this town.

211
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,188
It sucks.

212
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,323
- Sorry. I'll stop.
- Thanks.

213
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,791
You live here now.

214
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,760
It's not the worst.

215
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:46,731
Kind of just like
anywhere else.

216
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,469
Not anymore.

217
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,670
Guys, what are you doing?

218
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,507
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on, man.

219
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,528
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

220
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,464
Yes, hello? This is Ben.

221
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,367
Um, Ben Hawkins?

222
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:25,336
Hawkins Security?

223
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:27,605
Yes. Who is this?

224
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:31,008
A young man you know
just might be drinking booze

225
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,444
with his friends
out at the rock piles.

226
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:36,013
And who might I know?

227
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,015
Andy.

228
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,317
Okay. Who am I speaking to?

229
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,653
A little birdie.

230
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,622
Sue Ann?

231
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:47,290
- Why isn't this dog prepped?
- Oh, I-I just...

232
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,492
You know what? I don't want
to see you anymore today.

233
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:50,494
Go. You go home,
and I'll prep this dog.

234
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,329
Do it myself.

235
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,598
And stay off your damn phone.

236
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:58,337
Sit.

237
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,643
No, no, no, no.
No. No, no.

238
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,845
Ow.

239
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,614
Shit.

240
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,051
Don't dab.

241
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,586
I don't think
you should dab anymore.

242
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:16,654
Yeah.

243
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,288
Maggie.

244
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,790
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

245
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,593
- You got to try this. It's my favorite.
- Okay. Okay.

246
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,828
Oh, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

247
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,529
- No, no, I want to.
- No, she has to.

248
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,664
- Okay.
- I have to.

249
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,333
Take a sip. Take a sip.

250
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,836
Oh, my God.

251
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,738
- Hell yeah. It's very strong.
- It's fucking strong.

252
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,373
- Fuck.
- Oh, fuck, that's a cop.

253
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,240
- Andy, where's the weed?
- What? Okay, wait.

254
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,410
- I got the weed. Okay.
- Put it away.

255
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,911
- Let's go, let's go.
- Do I hide? - Shh, shh.

256
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:41,846
No! Maggie! Come here.

257
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,080
- No? I don't hide?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

258
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:45,616
- Okay.
- You're-you're a girl. He's not gonna do anything.

259
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,351
- You're fine. Shh.
- My mom's gonna fucking kill me

260
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:48,786
- if I go to prison.
- Act cute. Act cute. Act...

261
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,654
Come on out.

262
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,623
- Oh, oh, okay, sir.
- I said get out here!

263
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,358
- I-I'm sorry.
- Come on! Right now!

264
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,659
- Okay.
- You, too, bud.

265
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,564
Come on. Get out here.

266
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,466
I just got a phone call
from somebody,

267
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:03,768
telling me that there were
some teenagers

268
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,772
drinking out at the rock piles.

269
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,706
You seen anybody out here,
young lady?

270
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,909
- Sir, we don't have any...
- Wrong young lady.

271
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,778
Put your arms out.
Put 'em out!

272
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,549
- Wide. Back up. Move back.
- Mm.

273
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,726
Your daddy sent me out here
to arrest you.

274
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:35,533
I played football with your dad
in high school.

275
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,934
And he's a dick.

276
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,537
So...

277
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,739
I'm gonna come back
in ten minutes,

278
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,608
and all your shit out here
is gonna be gone. You got it?

279
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,676
- Yep. - Yeah, I-I got it.
- Do you?

280
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:46,844
- Yeah, I think... - Yes.
- All right, get your shit,

281
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:47,845
and let's get out of here.

282
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,582
- Okay.
- Right now.

283
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,917
So, I want to go home.

284
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,018
How is that funny?

285
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,853
- Dude! How did...
- We would have been

286
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,657
shot the fuck up.

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,827
Shit.

288
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,531
- Hey.
- Hey.

289
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,970
You smell like pot.

290
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:15,606
I didn't smoke anything.

291
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,474
Who were you with?

292
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,743
Just some kids from school.
I-I left you a note.

293
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,612
Yeah, you leave a note
when you're up to something.

294
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:22,947
Why didn't you just text me?

295
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,882
Uh, I don't know.
My phone died.

296
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,717
We just drove around.

297
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,620
- And you got high. Maggie.
- I didn't smoke anything.

298
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,622
And they asked me just
to go out, so I said okay.

299
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:32,756
It's really not
that big a deal.

300
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,991
I'm not gonna be
some fucking loser

301
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:35,726
and tell them not to smoke
'cause I don't.

302
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,494
Do not talk to me like that.

303
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,930
- Come back here.
- Why should I wait around for you

304
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,466
while you're at work all day?
How is that fair?

305
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:45,603
I'm glad you're fitting in.
I really am.

306
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,639
I want you to make
smarter decisions than that.

307
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:51,544
Like all the amazing decisions
you've made.

308
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,483
Hi.

309
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,987
I'm Erica. Uh, I'm dropping
this boy off for shots.

310
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,488
This is Louie.

311
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,490
Well, you're right
on time, Erica.

312
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,492
Actually, I'm running late
for work.

313
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,527
Can I just fill this out later?

314
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:12,732
Oh, yeah, just-just sign the
bottom, and I'll do the rest.

315
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,034
- Thank you.
- Mm.

316
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,845
Sue Ann.

317
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:30,481
Sue Ann!

318
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:32,816
Answer the fucking...

319
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:34,685
Brooks Veterinary.

320
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:38,489
Yeah, hold on, Mrs. Macy.
We'll get your file.

321
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,826
Why aren't you
answering the phones?

322
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,529
Sorry.
I'm fighting a migraine.

323
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,697
Well, go get
some horse tranquilizer.

324
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:47,965
I don't care. Do your job.

325
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,538
Come on, boy. Come on.

326
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:00,044
I'm marathoning
John Hughes movies,

327
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:01,278
if you want to hang.

328
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Have you seen <i>Pretty in Pink?</i>

329
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,516
Well, no, I'm hanging out
with Haley, remember?

330
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:06,719
Oh, yeah.

331
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,621
You look like
you're going to see a boy.

332
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:12,523
Are you going to meet a boy?

333
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:14,091
- No.
- No?

334
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,293
We're-we're just friends.

335
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,596
Okay, well, be smart,
and call me

336
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,932
if you need me to come get you.
I won't be mad.

337
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,701
- Promise?
- Promise.

338
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,102
- Okay.
- Okay, I love you.

339
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,573
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

340
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:38,716
Yo, why the fuck is she
putting it in her truck?

341
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,318
Oh, I bet it smell
like ass in there, too.

342
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,785
Guys.

343
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,854
Oh, here she comes,
here she comes.

344
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,157
Okay. I got two bottles
of Parrot Bay,

345
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,926
uh, 18-pack of Bud Light,

346
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:51,562
- and they had the Fireball this time.
- Ah, sweet.

347
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:54,064
- Thank you.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

348
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:57,668
Why don't you just, uh,
follow me down the street,

349
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,803
and you can pay me
and get the stuff.

350
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,106
I got eyes on me.
I don't want to lose my job.

351
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,674
Cool. Yeah, I'll follow you.

352
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:05,175
Secret hand-offs?

353
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:08,581
Are you freaking kidding me
right now? Fuck yes!

354
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,986
Okay.

355
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,689
I feel like she really
doesn't want to get caught.

356
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,660
It wouldn't be so bad
if she didn't drive so slow.

357
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,379
- This place is creepy.
- All right.

358
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,149
- This is fucking sketchy.
- No, it's good.

359
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,889
No, I think she wants to
bang him for real.

360
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,690
Oh, shut up.

361
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,758
What, are you jealous, Maggie?
You jealous?

362
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,627
Shh, shh, shh.
Wait, he's talking to her.

363
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:57,997
He's... Shh.

364
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:00,798
Did you give her the money?

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,732
Uh, well, kind of.

366
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,167
She said we could hang out
in her basement

367
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,902
if we didn't want
to drive around all night.

368
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:07,971
I didn't know what to say.

369
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:10,074
I mean, I'm down.
I got to pee really bad.

370
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,842
No. No, no, no, no.

371
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:13,710
We don't, we don't know
this chick, so...

372
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:14,978
- No.
- No cops, though.

373
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,749
What do you think?

374
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,883
Okay.

375
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,852
- Whoa! - Aah!
- Yes!

376
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,754
- Okay...
- All right, let's go!

377
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:25,923
- Are y'all serious?
- Yes! Get out.

378
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:28,258
- I got to pee!
- Whoo! Fuck yeah.

379
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,993
You guys come on in.

380
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,261
Come on in.

381
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:34,064
It calms me down so much
to know

382
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,667
that you guys aren't out there
drinking and driving.

383
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,869
I mean, to be honest,
I would rather you be safe.

384
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,003
If you're gonna do it
somewhere,

385
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,171
might as well be here, right?

386
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,973
Do you have a bathroom
I can use?

387
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,075
It ain't much,
but it's all you.

388
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,111
- Thanks.
- Okay.

389
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,213
The bar is open.

390
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:51,982
Wow. Nobody's been
down here a minute.

391
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,251
- Ugh.
- Weird, though.

392
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:56,787
Oh, that's nasty.

393
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,960
Is it just me,
or is it cold in here?

394
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,194
Yo, this place smells like

395
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:06,132
my great-grandmother's house.

396
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,134
Jesus Christ.

397
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,136
Okay, everybody,
listen up real quick.

398
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,171
My only house rules are:

399
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,007
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- Sorry.

400
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,209
And don't spit
on my floors, please.

401
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:21,312
Oh, and you...
I'm gonna need your keys.

402
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:24,114
You got to check in with me
before walking out that door,

403
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,883
'cause I got to know
you're safe to drive.

404
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,084
Cool. Yeah. Fine.

405
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,986
Okay, oh,
and nobody go upstairs.

406
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:31,822
That's my world,
and right now it's a mess.

407
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:33,324
So, uh, you guys are free to do

408
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,759
whatever you want to do
down here, but, you know...

409
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:36,927
Hell yeah...

410
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,729
Heck yeah.

411
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:39,830
Thanks, lady.

412
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,332
I'll get you some cups and ice.

413
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,200
Uh, excuse me.

414
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,035
What's your name?

415
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,104
Sue Ann.
What's yours?

416
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:51,241
Darrell. That's, uh, Andy,
Chaz, Haley and Maggie.

417
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:53,844
You got any Pizza Rolls, Ma?

418
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,146
"Ma"?

419
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:58,349
Boy, you are too much.

420
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,050
I'll get you some snacks.

421
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,019
Go ahead and, uh,
make yourselves at home.

422
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,921
Guys, this is so sick.

423
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,824
Oh, my God.

424
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,210
Mmm.

425
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,380
- Oh, if it's personal...
- Oh, that's gangster, bro.

426
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:30,315
No, no, it's fine.

427
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,282
Um, my dad left my mom
for someone else,

428
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:35,118
and I don't think she really
had anywhere else to go.

429
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,887
Oh, you guys are cute.

430
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,124
Eee. It's nice.

431
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:46,364
- Okay.
- Oh, that's a lot.

432
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:49,800
- Here we go. Oh.
- Bro, you are not good at those tricks, dawg.

433
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,002
I had Pizza Rolls, Darrell.

434
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:54,372
This place could be incredible.

435
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:57,241
You know what you need?
Okay, hear me out.

436
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:59,209
Couch there.

437
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:00,411
Snack wall, bam.

438
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,045
Maybe, like,
a projector situation

439
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,915
going on over here,
hang weird lights.

440
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,017
Speakers over there,
rugs all on here,

441
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:09,820
and then just, like, a real
table for flip cup, beer pong.

442
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,288
You get it.

443
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,924
I'll get right on that
as soon as I win the lottery.

444
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:16,159
Then I can turn this place
into the Taj Mahal.

445
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,830
I mean, unless you hate
being cool.

446
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,267
If you don't want to be cool,
that's on you.

447
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:24,903
Just saying.

448
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,905
You want to see something cool?

449
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:29,908
Sure.

450
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,948
Pretty cool, huh?

451
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,118
Oh, shit.

452
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,787
Strip.

453
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,056
Get naked, boy.

454
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,041
Oh, my God.

455
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,128
You are under arrest
for being so dang cute.

456
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,432
Put that thing away.

457
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,233
- And I'll put this thing away.
- Oh, my God.

458
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,002
That-that was insane.

459
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:33,371
This thing doesn't even work.

460
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:35,138
I found it
when I was moving in.

461
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,239
What, y'all think I'm Madea?

462
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,342
- Here, take it.
- Uh-uh. - No.

463
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,976
- Toss it in a pond, for all I care.
- No, it's okay.

464
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,178
Pretty cool, huh?

465
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:45,215
Ma, you fucking got me.

466
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,684
Are we cool?

467
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,386
We'll see.

468
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:52,523
You fucking scared
the shit out of me.

469
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:54,325
- I-I think I got to puke.
- She did.

470
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,193
We need to get
this one outside.

471
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:58,396
Ma, all I...
I just need some pizza.

472
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:00,230
And you need a breath mint.

473
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,868
You got him?

474
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,004
Thanks for having us over,
Sue Ann.

475
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:10,075
Oh, look at me.

476
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,044
Okay, follow my fingers.

477
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,979
Don't mess it up.

478
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,417
You're married?

479
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:22,219
Uh, he left years ago.

480
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,155
My finger's too fat
to get it off, so...

481
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:26,291
Thanks.

482
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:29,494
It was nice to meet you.

483
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,429
And hey, thanks
for letting us hang out.

484
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:33,431
Oh, please.
I haven't had this much fun

485
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,299
in God knows how long.

486
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,468
Get home safe.

487
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,472
That's all I care about.

488
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:43,039
A large sausage pizza.

489
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,375
A large sausage pizza?

490
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:47,445
Now you know
where the party is.

491
00:24:57,022 --> 00:24:59,055
We're headed back
to the rock piles tonight,

492
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,458
if you want to come.

493
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,192
Oh.

494
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:03,461
We'll just drink a few beers,
whatever.

495
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:05,430
Well, that sounds cool.

496
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,063
- Thanks.
- Yeah?

497
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:09,134
- See y'all tonight.
- Mm.

498
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:13,272
It'll be fun.

499
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,476
Yeah.

500
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,387
Oh, you're good, honey.

501
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,022
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, it was cool.

502
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,526
It was no big deal.

503
00:26:35,555 --> 00:26:38,422
So, you just balance it out.
You find your center.

504
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,391
- Okay.
- And then you go.

505
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,292
That's how... One more...

506
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:44,629
No, I'm not giving 'em
back to you.

507
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:46,263
That is bullshit.

508
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,432
- Yes.
- Oh, wait. Excuse me.

509
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,401
- Those aren't for you.
- Take those.

510
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:52,269
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

511
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:54,672
Erica fucking Thompson?

512
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:57,274
Mercedes, hi.

513
00:26:57,276 --> 00:26:58,409
What are you doing here?

514
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,444
Uh, didn't you, like,
go to California or something,

515
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,347
and, like, you were gonna,
like, make it?

516
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,582
Well, I did.

517
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:07,318
I got married,
I moved to California,

518
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,620
and my marriage didn't make it.

519
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:12,188
I understand
yours didn't, either.

520
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,190
Fuck no, right? No, thank God.

521
00:27:14,192 --> 00:27:15,393
I'm so happy.

522
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,260
- Look who's here. Hey.
- Oh.

523
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,162
- It's Erica Thompson.
- Hi, Ben.

524
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:21,299
- It's fucking Erica Thompson.
- Oh, hey.

525
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,233
- You look nice.
- You, too.

526
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:25,405
You're not working here,
are you?

527
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:29,205
No, I just want
to wear this every day

528
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,342
and-and, um, help the bar out.

529
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,611
Can I please have
the two glasses back?

530
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:34,745
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

531
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:37,515
You, like, left, and then
you had to come back here?

532
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,549
That is so sad.

533
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,183
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God, no...

534
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:41,519
Um, I'm gonna need you
to leave, please.

535
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:42,920
Hey, don't you fucking
touch me, Mario.

536
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,922
- No.
- If you don't get her out, I will. Come on.

537
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:45,990
- No, I'll take that.
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

538
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:47,592
- All right. Okay. Hey, Mercedes.
- Oh, oh, okay.

539
00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:49,225
- Hey, hey, let go of me.
- Mercedes, come on.

540
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:50,226
You're not drinking anymore.

541
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:51,294
- I'm gonna have that.
- Come on, let's just...

542
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,930
- Mercedes, come on.
- Yeah, you left

543
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,533
- my fucking bag on the table.
- Come on.

544
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:56,634
- Come on, Mercedes.
- Thanks for taking my drink.

545
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,234
- Come on. Come on. Come on, please go.
- Fuck off.

546
00:27:58,236 --> 00:27:59,269
Come on, guys.

547
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,705
Nice seeing you, Erica.

548
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:02,272
I'll see you.

549
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,387
I think I got
everything I need.

550
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:17,622
Oh, hi, Stu.

551
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:19,523
- Hi. Oh, hi.
- Meet Maggie.

552
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,325
- Hi. Hi.
- Stu is who I work with,

553
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,760
- and we're doing the seminar.
- So nice to meet you.

554
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,762
- You, too.
- Hello.

555
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:26,497
Oh, Mom, you look great.

556
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,666
Oh, thanks.
I never know how dressy to get

557
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,534
with this training crap.

558
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:31,669
Well, you have a skirt,
though, right?

559
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,671
- I think so.
- Okay.

560
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,239
Honey, so I left you $80 here

561
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:39,209
- and a couple delivery takeout menus.
- Okay.

562
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,746
On the fridge is
the number for my hotel.

563
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:42,747
- Okay.
- Hey.

564
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:45,650
No one is coming over
while I'm gone, okay?

565
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,785
- I know. I won't.
- Seriously.

566
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,285
I'm trusting you.

567
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:50,554
You are gonna be fine.

568
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:52,757
- Thank you, honey.
- Love you.

569
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,577
I don't know.
I don't think I can.

570
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,579
Dude, your mom is, like,
ten states away.

571
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,815
You're not gonna invite
your new best friends over?

572
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,817
That's fine. That's fine.
I'm not offended.

573
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,585
- It's okay.
- I totally would, seriously,

574
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,320
but we're not even
unpacked yet.

575
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:24,755
There's, like, nothing to do,
like, at all.

576
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:27,290
- Yo, what the fuck?
- What is it?

577
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:28,726
- I am... I'm not touching it.
- Yo.

578
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:30,461
What if that's a bomb, bro?

579
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,398
- That would suck so hard.
- Fucking suck.

580
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,733
"Love, Ma"?

581
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:38,636
What?

582
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,541
Hey. I was just thinking,
why wait for the weekend?

583
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:46,343
It's 5:00 somewhere.

584
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,481
- How did she get our numbers?
- Oh, my God.

585
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,883
Probably Haley. She gives it to
everyone when she's fucked up.

586
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,552
Eh, I can't argue with that.

587
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:56,353
Yes, yes! Aah!

588
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,457
- Let's rage.
- Whoo!

589
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,758
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

590
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,393
To Ma's house we go.

591
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,894
Oh, get in. Get in.

592
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,771
This is... better.

593
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:15,506
This is way better.

594
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,510
Maggie, Andy, hey!

595
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,778
- Can I get you something?
- Oh, uh...

596
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,513
Got you some wings.

597
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:23,914
Oh, no, thanks, Sue Ann.
I'm good.

598
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:27,618
Sue Ann? Oh, uh-uh.
Around here, you call me Ma.

599
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,353
- Ooh.
- Oh.

600
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,424
Okay.

601
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,696
Mmm.

602
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:41,665
Oh, look at this place.

603
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:45,369
Girl, look at you,
getting all fancy and shit.

604
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:46,370
Let's get filthy.

605
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,405
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah?

606
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,907
Hey. Hey.

607
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,543
- Hey!
- Welcome to Ma's.

608
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:56,747
How you guys doing?
Looking good, handsome. Mmm.

609
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,783
<i>Hey, do you think
we should, like, wake her?</i>

610
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:01,452
You know, she's been like that
since we got here.

611
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:04,455
No. That's Ashley,
and she's faking it.

612
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,891
Her dad's a pastor,
so she comes to parties,

613
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:08,826
pretends to be passed out
so she doesn't have to drink,

614
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:10,828
and then she won't get
in trouble when she goes home.

615
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,563
That might be the dumbest thing

616
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,431
I've ever heard
in my whole entire life.

617
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,966
Yeah, no, no, no.
It's dumb as shit.

618
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,869

00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:44,822
- Yeah. Catch up.
- Come on, now. Come on, now.

638
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:46,457
Party doesn't start without me.

639
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,759
Watch this.

640
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,461
Hey, Sue Ann.

641
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:51,662
Hi.

642
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:52,796
Oh. Thank you.

643
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:54,231
Why are you sitting down?

644
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,866
Why aren't you up
dancing with everyone?

645
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:59,036
Um... well, I guess
I was waiting on you.

646
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:00,871
Oh, okay.
So you're not...

647
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:03,007
you don't go
to a lot of parties?

648
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:05,676
Oh. No, no, no,
I-I go to a lot of them.

649
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:07,578
Oh, no, it's...
no, it's-it's fine.

650
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,716
There's a first time
for everything. Absolutely.

651
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,620
I like your hair.

652
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,956
Thanks.
I like yours.

653
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,860
Really? Thank you.

654
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,837
Here you go.
Come on, Ashley.

655
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,673
One's not gonna kill you.

656
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:39,779
Ow. Can you help me?

657
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:44,450
Milk did that body good.

658
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,284
Darrell.

659
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,723
I-I don't even want this.

660
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:55,726
Those earrings
are beautiful, Maggie.

661
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:57,061
Oh. Thanks.

662
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,829
My mom gave them to me.

663
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:00,965
I mean, well,
my dad gave them to my mom

664
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,533
when they first started
going out,

665
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,001
and then she gave them to me.

666
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:06,605
I mean, they're broken up now,
but, you know.

667
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,109
- You got a sweet mama, huh?
- Yeah.

668
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,044
Yo, turn the music down.
Listen up!

669
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,646
Cheers!

670
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,748
<i>¡En fuego!</i>

671
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,016
Ma, come here.
We're toasting you.

672
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,884
- Do a shot.
- Ooh, I-I don't drink.

673
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,753
I mean, the last time I did,

674
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,722
you really don't want to know.

675
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:26,824
Boo...!

676
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:28,625
Ma.

677
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:29,960
Ma! Ma!

678
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:32,663
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

679
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:35,933
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

680
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,736
Yeah!

681
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:42,039
- Come on, Ma.
- What was that?

682
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,775
That old-ass ice machine.

683
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:46,577
Uh, crank up the music, honey.

684
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,012
Who wants shots? Pour me another one.

685
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:49,680
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah!

686
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,798
I have to pee,
like, really bad.

687
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,134
- Like, right now.
- Okay.

688
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:12,069
Oh. Hi, Ashley.

689
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:14,972
- I see you've slept it off.
- Very funny, Haley.

690
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,708
I think Kinsey and Dustin
are fucking in there.

691
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:21,812
Let's go find another bathroom.

692
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:23,113
- What?
- Come on.

693
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:25,383
- No, we can't go up there.
- Shh!

694
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,817
We'll ask nicely.

695

a birthday party
at her house this weekend?

I heard she lets you do
basically anything.

733

I'm sure she'd be down.
You just, like,

give her a list of stuff,

00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,798
Yeah.

744
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,300
- Okay, that's great. Great.
- Yeah.

I was so nervous.

746
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,036
I-I was gonna text you first,
but then I was like,

747
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:35,138
"Oh, I should ask
old-school," and...

748
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,574

00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,282
Okay.

752
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:48,885

so long to ask me out?

753
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:50,854
I so obviously like you.

754
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,122
Yeah, 'cause I was actually
talking to this other girl.

755
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,123
- Oh, really? This other girl?
- And so I was deciding, like,

756
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:55,092
- who do I... who do I...
- What's up, lovebirds?

757
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:57,127
- I love you guys!
- Aah! Oh, my God.

758
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:58,596

or you're holding her

759
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,197
- against her will.
- Shut up, dude.

760
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,367
Ah, I love love, bro.
Don't you love love?

761
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:04,302

00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:05,370
Hey, guys, guys,
if you get pregnant,

763
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:07,104
- can you name it Chaz? Please?
- Oh, no.

764
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:09,273
Oh, my God!
Are we going for pizza or what?

765
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:11,376
Hell yeah!

00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:13,245
Hey, guys.

767
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:18,115
Hi. Uh, what-what
are you doing here?

768
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:21,885
I got us a beer pong table,
and a keg of Bud Light

769
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,187

770
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,457

782
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:58,323
Yeah, I guess
I should work a double

783
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:00,223

don't have time for me.

784
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:03,093
Girl, you need a man.

785
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:05,998

Oh.

878
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:40,533
What the...?

879
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,304
Oh.

880
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,272
I remember...

881
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:52,610
going to the party,
and then I woke up.

882
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:55,245
Don't remember
getting h... home.

883
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:56,547
Oh, God, what did I do?

884
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,483
You got really sloppy,
like, really quick.

885
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:01,452
You were falling
all over the place.

886
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,787
Flashed Chaz your tits.

887
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,588
No. No!

888
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,256
Oh, I'm sorry.

889
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:07,725
No, it's okay.
I got you out of there

890
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:10,327
before anyone really noticed,
so it's not a big deal.

891
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,731
Oh, my God, no.

892
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:14,665
Oh, my God.
I'm fucking with you.

893
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:15,599
Seriously, you're fine. You...

894
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:18,438
Oh, you're such an asshole.

895
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:24,742
What's wrong?

896
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,844
I don't want to hang out
at Ma's anymore.

897
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,879
And I don't want
you there, either.

898
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:32,318
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

899
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,554
Why?

900
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:38,491
Okay, I won't.

901
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,594
But now you have to go
get egg rolls with me.

902
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:46,363
- Okay.
- I'm gonna put ketchup on them.

903
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:47,767
Okay.

904
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:16,794
Oh, shit.

905
00:47:16,796 --> 00:47:18,796
- What?
- She's home. She's home.

906
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,565
All right.
Um, uh, get in the chair.

907
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:23,569
Just... sit down.
I don't know.

908
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:33,344
Hey!

909
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,847
Hey, Mags.

910
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:40,818
There's a boy in my house.

911
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,486
Do you know him?

912
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:43,954
Shit.

913
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:46,759
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.
I'm... Andy. Nice to meet you.

914
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:49,794
Nice to finally meet you, Andy.

915
00:47:49,796 --> 00:47:51,731
How was work?

916
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:55,666
It was busy.

917
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,470
Mm-hmm.

918
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:02,308
You two thirsty?

919
00:48:05,878 --> 00:48:08,546
You cooking?

920
00:48:08,548 --> 00:48:10,714
Cheesesteaks.

921
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:14,151
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm good.

922
00:48:14,153 --> 00:48:16,921
Have a seat, Andy.

923
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:18,923
My mom passed away
five years ago.

924
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:20,858
And my dad owns
an armored vehicle company,

925
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,460
so they transport stuff
for, like,

926
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:25,162
museums and banks
and that kind of thing.

927
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:26,997
Is your dad Ben Hawkins?

928
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,800
- Yeah.
- We went to high school together.

929
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:34,672
I didn't know about your mom.
I'm so sorry.

930
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:35,873
That's okay.

931
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,475
Dad's got a new fuck buddy now.

932
00:48:38,477 --> 00:48:39,710
Uh, sorry.

933
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:41,445
- Mercedes?
- Yeah.

934
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:42,746
Yeah.

935
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:44,650
How do we like her?

936
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:47,718
Let's just say
I'm more of a...

937
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,986
Porsche kind of guy.

938
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:50,688
Mm.

939
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,790
- Yeah, she's a bitch.
- All right.

940
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:55,826
- Sorry.
- Do you want some more to drink, guys?

941
00:48:55,828 --> 00:48:57,895
I'm okay, thanks.

942
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,768
You're really
blowing up there, kid.

943
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,637
Mom.

944
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,975
- You got a lot of girlfriends, Andy?
- Stop.

945
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,750
- Oh, just block her.
- Jesus Christ.

946
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:20,851
I did.

947
00:49:20,853 --> 00:49:22,853
Yeah, Andy had to as well.

948
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:24,755
I feel bad.

949
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:26,857
Don't. Who cares?

950
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:29,560
You know what? I'm gonna
tell everyone else, too.

951
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:36,867
All right, listen up, bitches.

952
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,736
Everybody block Ma for good.

953
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:41,805
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

954
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,641
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

955
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:45,476
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

956
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:46,946
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

957
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:50,547
Do you mind?

958
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:52,917
How about you mind
your own damn business!

959
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,852
You're making
your business my business.

960
00:49:54,854 --> 00:49:56,754
Not today, old lady!
Not today!

961
00:49:56,756 --> 00:49:58,524
You bitch.

962
00:49:59,725 --> 00:50:01,494
Here, Donna.

963
00:50:02,828 --> 00:50:04,563
Shit.

964
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:08,567
Move!

965
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:11,835
Listen up, bitches.

966
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:14,838
Everybody block Ma for good.

967
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,841
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

968
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:20,544
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

969
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:22,112
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

970
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:24,982
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

971
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:27,651
Sue Ann!

972
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,987
Have you fed the animals?

973
00:50:48,908 --> 00:50:50,977
Hello?

974
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:55,514
Over here. Close the door.

975
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,804
Hey, this is Ma.

976
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:23,107
I got a new number!

977
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:25,576
Just picking up a few things.

978
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:27,878
Don't make me drink alone.
And I don't want to hear

979
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,880
any of this
"I have homework" crap.

980
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:31,148
Don't make me drink alone.

981
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,983
♪ Don't make me
drink alone ♪

982
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:36,186
♪ Don't make me drink alone. ♪

983
00:51:36,188 --> 00:51:38,756
Are you guys mad at me
for something?

984
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:43,627
I mean, I, uh, risked my job
so that you could have fun,

985
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:45,996
and we definitely did.

986
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:49,633
The least you could do is,
you know, say thank you.

987
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:52,605
Hey, guys. It's Sue Ann.

988
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:56,874
Look, I really need you
to meet me...

989
00:51:56,876 --> 00:52:00,010
at the rock piles
after school tomorrow.

990
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:02,079
It's an emergency.

991
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:03,983
Please come.

992
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:20,966
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

993
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:25,235
Hey.

994
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:26,970
Oh.

995
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:29,973
You guys are so sweet
to meet me out here.

996
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:32,042
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's...

997
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:33,877
Sorry-sorry for the dramatics.

998
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:35,848
It's just that, uh...

999
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:41,852
I'm sick.

1000
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,887
What's wrong?

1001
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,156
It's cancer.

1002
00:52:46,158 --> 00:52:47,958
Pancreatic.

1003
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,861
And I've been taking
a lot of medicine lately.

1004
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:54,098
The doctors don't really know
how to treat it yet.

1005
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,167
And it's scary,
because the meds make me...

1006
00:52:57,169 --> 00:53:01,772
less fun and-and not myself,
so I'm sorry.

1007
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,974
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

1008
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,709
- Sorry.
- We had no idea.

1009
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,044
I know, honey, I know.

1010
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:09,113
I just... I try
to live my life privately.

1011
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:10,681
But I'm gonna beat this.

1012
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,182
- Yeah.
- I could sure use

1013
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,885
some friends, though.

1014
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,854
I'm gonna beat this, right?

1015
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:20,092
Okay.

1016
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:22,761
Oh, sweetie.

1017
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,096
I got to go back to work.

1018
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:29,867
I just wanted to...
let you guys know.

1019
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:31,235
You can beat it, Ma.

1020
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:34,771
My granddad did,
and he's a fucking pussy, so...

1021
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:36,874
Yeah, Ma.

1022
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:38,476
- Stay strong.
- Thanks.

1023
00:53:38,478 --> 00:53:41,312
And, uh, if you have time

1024
00:53:41,314 --> 00:53:44,781
or you want to come over
on Saturday...

1025
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:46,783
No pressure, though.

1026
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:48,687
No pressure.

1027
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:54,758
Well, fuck me in the butt.

1028
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:07,905
Come with me.

1029
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:10,007
Come on. Goddamn, Rosco,
bring your ass...

1030
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:11,875
Oh, shit!

1031
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:14,111
Come on.

1032
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:15,746
She was wearing
Stephanie's bracelet.

1033
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:16,980
You didn't notice?

1034
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:18,316
- Really?
- Yeah.

1035
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,118
Get your ass
in this motherfucking trailer.

1036
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
I've been missing
my grandma's ring,

1037
00:54:23,122 --> 00:54:26,089
and my mom is gonna fucking
kill me if I don't find it.

1038
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:27,325
And I bet she has it.

1039
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:31,163
You know, I'm missing
the earrings my mom gave me.

1040
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:34,831
We're going
to that bitch's house.

1041
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:38,101
Hey. Hey!
What if somebody sees us?

1042
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:41,240
We're in bum-fuck, dumbass.
Nobody's gonna see us.

1043
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:44,775
- Oh, shit.
- Haley? Haley?

1044
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:46,109
Let's go, okay?
I'm serious.

1045
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:48,080
No. I know she has
my grandma's ring.

1046
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:51,081
Don't be such a pussy.
Let's go.

1047
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,855
Wow, this is...
really graceful.

1048
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:08,131
Maggie.

1049
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,902
Ugh.

1050
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:20,944
What the hell?

1051
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:23,148
What?

1052
00:55:45,037 --> 00:55:47,305
Yeah.

1053
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:52,175
Whoa.

1054
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:55,045
Cool it with the pics, Ma.

1055
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,232
This is so creepy.

1056
00:56:19,038 --> 00:56:20,037
Sue Ann?

1057
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,172
Ben.

1058
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:24,207
I didn't know you worked here.

1059
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:26,344
How are you? How you been?

1060
00:56:26,346 --> 00:56:28,145
I'm-I'm good.

1061
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:29,946
Yeah, I'm-I'm good.

1062
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:32,115
Well, uh,
this old guy needs his shots.

1063
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:34,452
Our vet moved to Florida
in December,

1064
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:36,953
so we're looking
for a new spot.

1065
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:38,356
Well...

1066
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:40,993
we can certainly do that.

1067
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:45,162
Well, it's good to see you.
You look great.

1068
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:47,365
How long has it been, huh?

1069
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:48,399
15 years?

1070
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:50,233
- 20?
- Something like that.

1071
00:56:50,235 --> 00:56:52,235
That makes me feel old.

1072
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:53,504
I don't like it.

1073
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:55,373
Me, neither.
I feel it every day.

1074
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,974
Oh, just-just sign it.
I'll do the rest.

1075
00:56:57,976 --> 00:56:59,209
Sure.

1076
00:57:02,948 --> 00:57:04,981
Well, it's good to see you.

1077
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:07,050
We should catch up sometime.

1078
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,386
Really?

1079
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:11,088
I-I...

1080
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,490
I'd like that.

1081
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:19,062
- You know Magill's Pub?
- Yeah.

1082
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,297
I'll come back after work,
pick him up,

1083
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,164
and we can go right there.

1084
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:24,000
I-I wouldn't want to go
in my scrubs.

1085
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:26,337
How about I meet you there
at 6:00?

1086
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,138
All right.

1087
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,307
Hello?

1088
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:58,302
Uh, Maggie?

1089
00:57:58,304 --> 00:57:59,537
What?

1090
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:02,139
You might want to,
um, take a...

1091
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:03,974
Oh, my God!

1092
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:10,417
What are you guys
doing in here?

1093
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:16,387
It's okay. I don't mind.

1094
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:19,089
Uh, what are you doing here?

1095
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,991
I live here.
This is my house.

1096
00:58:20,993 --> 00:58:23,193
Uh, you can walk?

1097
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,463
- I mean, I thought that...
- I'm not supposed to.

1098
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:28,098
- I'm sick.
- Uh, sorry.

1099
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,436
What's happening?

1100
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:32,202
Uh, do you know Haley?

1101
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:33,471
Haley, this is...

1102
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:35,373
Genie. Genie, right?

1103
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,775
Yeah, we were here,
uh, last week,

1104
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:39,410
and I left my school I.D.

1105
00:58:39,412 --> 00:58:41,412
I need it for the PSATs.

1106
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:43,280
Hi, Genie.

1107
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:45,383
Hi.

1108
00:58:45,385 --> 00:58:47,387
You have pretty teeth.

1109
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:51,221
Uh, that's-that's
very sweet of you.

1110
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:53,156
I haven't seen you

1111
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,358
at school in, like, forever.

1112
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,594
Yeah, my mom, sh...

1113
00:58:56,596 --> 00:58:59,330
I get sick a lot, and my mom
thought it would be better

1114
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:00,565
if I stay home for a while.

1115
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:02,567
- Oh.
- My mom says that the doctors say

1116
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:04,537
it's my spine
and it's getting worse.

1117
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:08,406
My mind is, like...
blown.

1118
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:10,508
Um...

1119
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,176
Ma is your m-mom?

1120
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:17,149
- I'm sorry, uh, Sue Ann is your-your mom?
- Yeah.

1121
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:29,527
I hear you guys downstairs
in the basement a lot.

1122
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,829
Is it fun?

1123
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:35,299
Uh... it can be.

1124
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,303
You should come.

1125
00:59:43,108 --> 00:59:45,409
Y-You guys should leave.

1126
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:48,546
My mom doesn't like
when anybody's in her room.

1127
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:51,114
It's better
not to get her upset.

1128
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:52,517
I won't tell her
you were here if you don't.

1129
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,285
Oh, no, we're not saying shit.

1130
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,421
Maybe I'll see you at school?

1131
00:59:57,423 --> 00:59:59,122
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

1132
00:59:59,124 --> 01:00:00,225
- Go ahead.
- Maybe.

1133
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,028
Bye.

1134
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:18,376
- Shit.
- Go, go!

1135
01:00:18,378 --> 01:00:19,377
Get out of here!

1136
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:21,379
Okay.

1137
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:28,519
Genie!

1138
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:30,388
Yes, Mama?

1139
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,390
You been down here
messing with these kitties?

1140
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:33,591
No, ma'am.

1141
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:36,596
Well, they've been moved!

1142
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:02,689
Go.

1143
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,256
You look pretty.

1144
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:07,625
I'm going out.

1145
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,225
It's time for your medicine.

1146
01:01:09,227 --> 01:01:11,596
I was wondering
if I can go back to school.

1147
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:15,231
I'm feeling better,
and I miss my classes.

1148
01:01:15,233 --> 01:01:16,266
You're too sick.

1149
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:19,503
And these doctors,
they don't quite see it yet.

1150
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:20,705
I know.

1151
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:22,373
But maybe half a day
would work.

1152
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,641
That way,
my teachers can grade

1153
01:01:23,643 --> 01:01:26,377
my homework
and you don't have to.

1154
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:28,512
I can ride the bus.

1155
01:01:28,514 --> 01:01:31,283
You don't look well, baby.

1156
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,621
And your hair is way too long.

1157
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:38,623
So maybe we should just

1158
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:42,426
cut it all off
before it all falls out.

1159
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:45,195
The other kids
will make fun of you.

1160
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:47,431
That's what they do.

1161
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:49,634
That's why you have
to stay here with me,

1162
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:51,638
where it's safe.

1163
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:56,274
Mommy loves you.

1164
01:02:12,325 --> 01:02:16,327
♪ I want to walk this world
beside you... ♪

1165
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:18,562
<i>It's your first time, isn't it?</i>

1166
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:20,263
<i>Do you even know
what you're doing?</i>

1167
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:21,799
No.

1168
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:25,302
You're gonna get on your knees.

1169
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:27,239
Put it in your mouth.

1170
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:34,244
Move your head
backwards, forwards.

1171
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:37,415
Believe me,
it won't take long.

1172
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:39,450
You look hot.

1173
01:02:39,452 --> 01:02:41,721
- Thanks, Mercedes.
- Mm-hmm.

1174
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,391
Pow, girl.

1175
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:53,564
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1176
01:02:53,566 --> 01:02:56,434
Oh.
Don't even worry about it.

1177
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:59,804
I got caught up at the office.

1178
01:02:59,806 --> 01:03:02,540
Well, you look lovely.

1179
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,709
Oh, hey. How are you?

1180
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,410
I'll have a Maker's, neat.

1181
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:07,578
And Sue Ann?

1182
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,347
Uh, uh, Diet Coke, please.

1183
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:11,816
Are you really gonna
make me drink alone?

1184
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:15,720
Oh, I am content to sit here
and watch you do your thing.

1185
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:19,457
Hmm. Fair enough.

1186
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:23,293
So, uh, you keep in touch
with anyone from school?

1187
01:03:23,295 --> 01:03:24,729
No, no.

1188
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:27,631
I mean, I run into people
every now and then, but, uh,

1189
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:30,835
I don't do reunions
or anything like that.

1190
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:32,837
I went to the ten-year reunion.

1191
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:35,539
After that, forget it.

1192
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,075
My wife hated
the entire experience.

1193
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:40,077
I heard she passed away.

1194
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,645
I'm sorry to hear that.

1195
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:44,648
Yeah. Cancer got her.

1196
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,083
What are you gonna do.

1197
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:49,787
Yeah. I was, uh,
married years ago.

1198
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:52,523
But... it didn't work out.

1199
01:03:52,525 --> 01:03:55,559
Sometimes you want something
so badly,

1200
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:58,529
and then suddenly you just...

1201
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:00,533
don't.

1202
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:12,510
Do you know what this is?

1203
01:04:12,512 --> 01:04:14,411
What is that, a Taser?

1204
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:17,848
You gonna tase me for drinking
a Diet Coke, Ben?

1205
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,417
It's a personal
tracking device.

1206
01:04:20,419 --> 01:04:21,552
Okay.

1207
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:22,787
I have these devices

1208
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:25,422
on my entire fleet
of trucks and vans,

1209
01:04:25,424 --> 01:04:28,125
including my son Andrew's van.

1210
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:34,333
Why the fuck is my son
spending time at your house?

1211
01:04:35,368 --> 01:04:37,368
You need to talk to him.

1212
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,439
Well, I'm talking to you,
right now.

1213
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:44,775
I don't know what you want me
to say, Ben.

1214
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:48,679
C-Could we please
not do this here?

1215
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:52,550
Well, here's what I think.

1216
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,885
I think you're trying
to get back at me.

1217
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,720
Come on.

1218
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:58,956
We both know
you had a thing for me,

1219
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:02,726
and I barely gave you
the time of day.

1220
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:04,728
You're a loser, Sue Ann.

1221
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,833
You always have been,
and it's pathetic.

1222
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:12,636
Some people
just don't change, do they?

1223
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:15,873
No. They don't.

1224
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:19,443
This is your one warning,
Sue Ann.

1225
01:05:19,445 --> 01:05:23,180
And if I hear that my son
has ended up anywhere near you

1226
01:05:23,182 --> 01:05:26,984
or your damn house,
I won't be calling the police.

1227
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:29,520
I'll handle it myself.

1228
01:05:29,522 --> 01:05:32,491
You understand me?

1229
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:53,210
Sue Ann,
put down the damn phone.

1230
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,680
Get the clippers
and shave this fella.

1231
01:06:10,563 --> 01:06:13,931
Genie is Ma's daughter,
and she never told us.

1232
01:06:13,933 --> 01:06:15,633
Okay? She can walk.

1233
01:06:15,635 --> 01:06:17,034
And she's been in that house

1234
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:18,736
the whole time
we've been there.

1235
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:20,738
Ma went to high school
with our parents.

1236
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,007
Like, she tore out pages
from her yearbook

1237
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:25,876
and pasted herself
in pictures with your dad

1238
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:28,045
and my mom and Mercedes.

1239
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:29,580
- I mean, it's so creepy!
- Who cares?

1240
01:06:29,582 --> 01:06:31,081
Pancreatic cancer's
some fucked-up shit.

1241
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:34,084
All that medicine
makes you do some weird stuff.

1242
01:06:34,086 --> 01:06:36,587
You can't be serious.

1243
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:39,657
My mom acted weird, too,
before she died.

1244
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:41,694
Oh.

1245
01:06:44,597 --> 01:06:46,632
I'm sorry about your mom.

1246
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:52,503
But I don't... I don't think
Sue Ann has cancer.

1247
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:54,838
I think she used to be
in love with your dad,

1248
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,008
and I think she's, like,
in love with you now.

1249
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,010
Well, duh.

1250
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:02,046
Oh, my God.

1251
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:04,048
- I'm kidding.
- You're totally into it.

1252
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,050
I'm sort of kidding, yeah.

1253
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:08,052
Leaving,
that was the easy part.

1254
01:07:08,054 --> 01:07:10,754
I didn't worry about that.
The move was hard.

1255
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:13,991
Oh, I hear you
loud and clear with that one.

1256
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,760
Right? And I just never realized

1257
01:07:16,762 --> 01:07:20,831
how much stuff I had
until I saw it all in boxes.

1258
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,667
- Oh. Mm, mm, mm.
- So...

1259
01:07:23,669 --> 01:07:25,002
It was diffi...

1260
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:26,570
Hi, honey!

1261
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:27,871
I want you to meet someone.

1262
01:07:27,873 --> 01:07:29,640
This is Sue Ann.

1263
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:31,608
Mags?

1264
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,544
Maggie.

1265
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:35,145
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

1266
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:36,947
Nice to meet you, too.

1267
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:40,150
She works at the vet
where we take Lou.

1268
01:07:40,152 --> 01:07:41,885
And then
she was just stopping in

1269
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:43,887
to check on how he was doing.

1270
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:45,789
Oh, just a friendly follow-up
to make sure

1271
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,725
there wasn't a reaction
to the shots.

1272
01:07:47,727 --> 01:07:50,961
Here. Come. Sit down.

1273
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:52,763
And guess what.

1274
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:55,866
We went to high school
together,

1275
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:58,902
- with Ben and Mercedes.
- Huh.

1276
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:02,106
Mm. So, uh, where do you go
to school, Maggie?

1277
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:04,041
I go to Franklin.

1278
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:07,578
I know how hard it can be
to make friends.

1279
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,747
Well, she's doing good.
She's made some great friends.

1280
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:12,783
Really nice kids.
I'm proud of her.

1281
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:14,918
- Oh, shoot. Look at me.
- Oh.

1282
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Always running behind.

1283
01:08:16,922 --> 01:08:19,823
Sorry to just drop by
unannounced.

1284
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:22,693
I just get so attached
to these animals so quickly.

1285
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:24,028
- Oh.
- There's probably something wrong with me.

1286
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:25,029
Oh, please.

1287
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:26,930
Thank you so much.

1288
01:08:26,932 --> 01:08:29,367
Come by anytime.
You're welcome.

1289
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,936
It was so good to see you.

1290
01:08:32,938 --> 01:08:34,940
You, too.

1291
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:38,776
And, Maggie,

1292
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:40,813
you look after that dog
for me, now.

1293
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:51,955
<i>Don't stop.</i>

1294
01:08:51,957 --> 01:08:54,191
<i>Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't.</i>

1295
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:02,232
Was I... good?

1296
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:05,169
Yeah.

1297
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:08,906
Um, Ben, are you gonna talk
to me tomorrow?

1298
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:11,975
Let's get out of here.

1299
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:13,979
Okay.

1300
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:24,822
Ben?

1301
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:27,059
Surprise.

1302
01:09:30,096 --> 01:09:32,896
Oh, God.
That took forever.

1303
01:09:32,898 --> 01:09:34,131
So, how was she?

1304
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:36,700
- Was she good?
- It was fucking awesome.

1305
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:03,026
Fucking cunt.

Louie?!

1311
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:35,194
Louie!

1312
01:10:39,798 --> 01:10:42,065
Oh, my God. You're bleeding!

1313
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:55,014
Hello?

1314
01:11:20,973 --> 01:11:24,074
His breathing's slow.

1315
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,909
I don't think
we should move him.

1316
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,345
I'm gonna call Sue Ann,
and she...

1317
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:29,046
Don't.

1318
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,081
Don't call her.

1319
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,918
Why?

1320
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,222
What's the matter?

1321
01:11:38,123 --> 01:11:40,025
I know her.

1322
01:11:41,994 --> 01:11:43,996
I've been to her house.

1323
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,570
Well, look who it is.

1324
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:54,071
Enough!

1325
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:55,138
I don't have time
for this shit.

1326
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,240
Where's my son?

1327
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:58,242
Nobody's here
but you and me, Ben.

1328
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:00,944
I know he's here.
Andrew, come out here!

1329
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:04,047
Do you know what this is?

1330
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:05,350
What?

1331
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:08,919
Jesus Christ! You...

1332
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:23,301
I am so disappointed in you.
What were you thinking?

1333
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:24,901
Everyone kept going over there,

1334
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:26,337
and I thought,
if I didn't want to,

1335
01:12:26,339 --> 01:12:28,406
they wouldn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

1336
01:12:28,408 --> 01:12:31,074
You are 16 years old.
Do you realize...

1337
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:33,444
Sneaking booze
at prom is one thing.

1338
01:12:33,446 --> 01:12:36,046
But hanging around
in this fucking bitch's house

1339
01:12:36,048 --> 01:12:38,181
while she's feeding
everyone alcohol,

1340
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:40,451
that is unacceptable!

1341
01:12:40,453 --> 01:12:42,320
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Andy's father,

1342
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:44,021
- and he...
- No! Stop!

1343
01:12:44,023 --> 01:12:46,123
Please don't call him.
He had nothing to do with this.

1344
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,991
He's the most innocent one
of all of us.

1345
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,159
Please don't call him.

1346
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:52,195
Go in your room.
Go to your room.

1347
01:12:52,197 --> 01:12:55,198
Your ass is staying in
this house till summer break!

1348
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,100
Period!
And you are never

1349
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:58,336
stepping foot
in that woman's house!

1350
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,070
You're not going in Andy's van!

1351
01:13:00,072 --> 01:13:01,938
You're not going
wherever the fuck you think

1352
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,410
you want to be going!

1353
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:11,882
Surprise.

1354
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:14,084
Oh, don't worry.

1355
01:13:14,086 --> 01:13:16,019
I'll let Andy know
you'll be out late.

1356
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:22,427
Ben, Ben, Ben.

1357
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:30,167
You know...

1358
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:33,103
...I didn't know
what to do with you at first.

1359
01:13:33,105 --> 01:13:34,905
Sue Ann, please.

1360
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:40,110
What do we have here?

1361
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:42,347
Is this what you were gonna
show me in that closet?

1362
01:13:44,249 --> 01:13:46,317
Maybe I should cut it off.

1363
01:13:50,923 --> 01:13:51,988
Maybe not.

1364
01:13:56,496 --> 01:13:58,997
What you did to me...

1365
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:03,235
...the humiliation...

1366
01:14:05,003 --> 01:14:07,037
...it never goes away.

1367
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:09,272
Please, Sue Ann.

1368
01:14:09,274 --> 01:14:12,175
But then it hit me.

1369
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:14,077
"Sue Ann,

1370
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,179
you're thinking about this
the wrong way."

1371
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:20,083
You see,
you treated me like a dog,

1372
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:22,154
because that's what you are.

1373
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:28,024
You...

1374
01:14:28,026 --> 01:14:30,528
you're no man, Ben Hawkins.

1375
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,295
What the fuck is that?

1376
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:40,170
Please, Sue Ann.

1377
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:41,439
I was just a kid.

1378
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:43,441
So was I, motherfucker.

1379
01:14:43,443 --> 01:14:44,442
No. No!

1380
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:47,478
No, no, no.

1381
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:05,430
Tomorrow's my day off.

1382
01:15:05,432 --> 01:15:08,468
You're getting up and
coming with me to run errands.

1383
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,238
And your butt's in my car
at 8:00 a.m.

1384
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,140
Bitch.

1385
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:23,079
Hey, Erica.

1386
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:26,016
You ever come near my house
or my daughter again,

1387
01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:28,118
I'm calling the police.

1388
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,521
What on earth
are you talking about?

1389
01:15:30,523 --> 01:15:33,558
What kind of mother
parties with high schoolers?

1390
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,092
I think you've had
a little too much coffee.

1391
01:15:36,094 --> 01:15:37,227
Excuse me.

1392
01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:39,095
I'm not joking here.

1393
01:15:39,097 --> 01:15:40,465
Back the fuck off.

1394
01:15:40,467 --> 01:15:42,232
Oh, I know how to deal
with your type.

1395
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:44,134
Pretty, athletic, popular.

1396
01:15:44,136 --> 01:15:47,371
But then you did move home to
sling cocktails at casinos...

1397
01:15:47,373 --> 01:15:48,506
They're children!

1398
01:15:48,508 --> 01:15:50,273
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1399
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:53,109
How does it feel to be
on the outside looking in?

1400
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:55,546
Hurts, huh?

1401
01:15:55,548 --> 01:15:58,048
Well, I can assure you

1402
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:01,419
that the view from the center
is amazing.

1403
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:03,153
You need help.

1404
01:16:03,155 --> 01:16:05,556
Sounds like someone's
a little jealous.

1405
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:08,258
A little jealous of Sue Ann!

1406
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,595
Think I thought we had
some kind of a connection,

1407
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:12,330
but you just threw it all away.

1408
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:13,464
You threw it all away!

1409
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:16,066
Ungrateful bitch.

1410
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:18,036
To think I took care
of Mercedes for you.

1411
01:16:33,285 --> 01:16:35,285
Maggie,

1412
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:37,220
you're missing out.

1413
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,122
And look.

1414
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:42,560
- Oh, look who I found.
- Are you fucking kidding?

1415
01:16:42,562 --> 01:16:44,430
He's mine now.

1416
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:48,366
Thanks for these earrings.

1417
01:16:48,368 --> 01:16:49,634
No.

1418
01:17:16,462 --> 01:17:18,329
I don't know what Ma's deal is.

1419
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:19,766
Yeah, she's weird, man.

1420
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:27,738
Fuck it, birthday.

1421
01:17:30,343 --> 01:17:32,410
You fucking liar.

1422
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:34,210
You said you weren't gonna
hang out here anymore.

1423
01:17:34,212 --> 01:17:35,613
It's Chaz's birthday.
What the fuck?

1424
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,614
- So?
- I didn't have a choice!

1425
01:17:36,616 --> 01:17:38,482
And if I told you,
you would've been pissed.

1426
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:39,584
- Thought you don't drink.
- Ma's getting everyone

1427
01:17:39,586 --> 01:17:40,685
out of here, okay?
She just wants

1428
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:42,486
- to hang out with the original crew, okay?
- Right.

1429
01:17:42,488 --> 01:17:44,488
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, my God! Maggie!

1430
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,222
- God.
- I'm so happy you're here!

1431
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,492

01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:07,892
Maggie, you are something else.

1472
01:21:07,894 --> 01:21:09,794

<i>Mags, come on!</i>

1475
01:21:15,535 --> 01:21:18,569
It's my day off.
We're doing this.

1476
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:19,705
You know...

1477
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:24,508
...some people
just fit right in.

1478
01:21:27,613 --> 01:21:31,549
It comes effortlessly.

1479
01:21:31,551 --> 01:21:33,484
Those perfect little touches.

1480
01:21:33,486 --> 01:21:35,721
Perfect skin.

1481
01:21:37,456 --> 01:21:40,827
Oh, that perfect skin.

1482
01:21:41,861 --> 01:21:43,863
Perfect belly.

1483
01:21:46,766 --> 01:21:49,767
Must be nice, Most Handsome.

1484
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:53,871
Oh!

1485
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,344
Where you going?

1486
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:03,516
Girl, you're pissing me off!

1487
01:22:12,491 --> 01:22:15,893
And then Haley, Haley.

1488
01:22:15,895 --> 01:22:20,366
Most Popular,
born with the gift of gab.

1489
01:22:22,034 --> 01:22:24,635
I need a man, huh?

1490
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:26,606
This ought to shut you up
for once.

1491
01:22:35,882 --> 01:22:37,783
What the...?

1492
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:45,923
Stu, Maggie's gone.

1493
01:22:45,925 --> 01:22:49,727
Can you ju... can you come over?

1494
01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:51,597
Thank you. Okay.

1495
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:08,679
You know how hard it is

1496
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:11,015
to know that everybody's
having fun without you,

1497
01:23:11,017 --> 01:23:14,987
without even considering
that you might want to join in?

1498
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:20,557
And the hard part...

1499
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:24,830
is when they can't even see you
standing right beside them.

1500
01:23:26,732 --> 01:23:28,766
I'm sorry, Darrell.

1501
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:31,003
They've only got room
for one of us.

1502
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,707
What the...?

1503
01:23:51,724 --> 01:23:53,023
Ma?

1504
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,295
Darling.

1505
01:23:58,297 --> 01:23:59,830
Ma, are you mad at us?

1506
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:02,032
Oh.

1507
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:04,001
Come here.

1508
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:06,070
Come on, up, up.

1509
01:24:06,072 --> 01:24:09,073
Oh, you're a big boy.

1510
01:24:10,142 --> 01:24:13,077
Mmm, you smell good.

1511
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:14,812
Just like your daddy.

1512
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:17,616
This feels nice.

1513
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:20,753
Yeah.

1514
01:24:22,555 --> 01:24:24,655
Like we're the only two people
in the world.

1515
01:24:27,927 --> 01:24:29,762
You know who we are?

1516
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:32,863
The Cutest Couple.

1517
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:34,633
We are.

1518
01:24:36,102 --> 01:24:38,838
You're Most Charming, too.

1519
01:24:40,106 --> 01:24:42,773
And...

1520
01:24:42,775 --> 01:24:44,510
I love you.

1521
01:25:04,663 --> 01:25:06,663
Stop!

1522
01:25:06,665 --> 01:25:08,065
Liar.

1523
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:09,099
Please!

1524
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:11,735
Why are you doing this?

1525
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:14,738
You need help.
You need help.

1526
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:18,809
Not one fucking sound.

1527
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:22,012
Not one fucking sound
or I will slit your throat.

1528
01:25:22,014 --> 01:25:23,015
You hear me?

1529
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:30,954
Sue Ann, how you doing today?

1530
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:32,222
I'm good.

1531
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:37,895
There are quite a few cups and
bottles in your yard right now

1532
01:25:37,897 --> 01:25:39,830
and, uh, couple cars
on the street

1533
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:41,698
parked near your driveway.

1534
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,001
Is there anything
you need to share with me?

1535
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,969
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1536
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:51,108
Well... must be some sort of
a sorority prank or something.

1537
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:54,244
I guess I'll have to spend the
whole day picking all that up.

1538
01:25:59,085 --> 01:26:01,720
Who's in this house with you,
Sue Ann?

1539
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:07,658
Mom, is everything okay?

1540
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:10,727
My daughter is very sick,

1541
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:12,696
and right now
you're preventing us

1542
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:15,065
from getting her
to a doctor's appointment.

1543
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:17,734
I see.

1544
01:26:17,736 --> 01:26:19,736
My apologies, young lady.

1545
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:21,107
I hope you feel better.

1546
01:26:22,908 --> 01:26:25,611
Help! Somebody, please!

1547
01:26:29,949 --> 01:26:32,116
I told you to stay in bed.

1548
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:34,885
You just made me kill this man.

1549
01:26:34,887 --> 01:26:36,086
I did not!

1550
01:26:36,088 --> 01:26:38,755
Now get your ass
out of that chair

1551
01:26:38,757 --> 01:26:40,257
and help me drag him inside.

1552
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:51,001
Erica, what's going on?
Where are we going?

1553
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:52,836
I think she's off Highway 18.

1554
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:55,172
Okay. We'll find her.

1555
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:57,176
I hope so.

1556
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:03,847
Bad girl, Maggie.

1557
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:06,049
I told you not to make a sound.

1558
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:08,053
Get up.

1559
01:27:09,889 --> 01:27:12,892
Over here.
We have to set the picture.

1560
01:27:19,064 --> 01:27:20,998
Okay.

1561
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,236
Now go get Chaz
and put him against the couch.

1562
01:27:25,905 --> 01:27:28,105
And if you try
to leave this basement,

1563
01:27:28,107 --> 01:27:29,806
I'll kill all of you.

1564
01:27:34,347 --> 01:27:35,946
Where do you want me?

1565
01:27:35,948 --> 01:27:37,748
Oh, you're not gonna be
in the picture.

1566
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,018
You're gonna take it.

1567
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,288
The button on the front.

1568
01:27:52,998 --> 01:27:54,031
One more.

1569
01:27:56,835 --> 01:27:59,838
Oh, are you smiling?

1570
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:08,147
Good girl.

1571
01:28:11,384 --> 01:28:13,784
No, no, no, no, no!

1572
01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:20,123
Ma!

1573

1592
01:29:45,277 --> 01:29:46,411
- Help me!
- No!

1593
01:29:46,413 --> 01:29:48,111

- Help me!

1594
01:29:48,113 --> 01:29:49,212
She's not gonna help you.

1595
01:29:49,214 --> 01:29:50,947
- No!
- Genie!

1596
01:29:50,949 --> 01:29:52,317

1598
01:29:53,353 --> 01:29:55,653
Tell her how weak you were.

1599
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:58,423
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay, Sue Ann?

1600
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:01,992
What happened to you
should have never happened.

1601
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:04,161
And I-I should have
stopped it, okay?!

1602
01:30:04,163 --> 01:30:06,096
- I should have stopped it!
- But you didn't!

1603
01:30:06,098 --> 01:30:07,833
You didn't!

1604
01:30:10,102 --> 01:30:12,002
You didn't.

1605
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:14,405

- Help me, Maggie! No!

1606
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:17,140

Sue Ann!

1608
01:30:18,478 --> 01:30:20,977
Time to go to sleep.
Mommy loves you.

1609
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:25,115
You didn't deserve it, okay?!

1610
01:30:25,117 --> 01:30:27,918
- No. No, no, no.
- Mommy loves you.

1611
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,188
Maggie, no!

1612
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:33,460
Maggie!

1613
01:30:35,395 --> 01:30:38,997
I am not weak
and I'm not my mother.

1614
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:49,172
Genie!

1615
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:51,007
Maggie, come on!

1616
01:30:52,445 --> 01:30:54,314

1618
01:30:59,952 --> 01:31:01,184
Oh.
