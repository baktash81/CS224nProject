1
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,195
Looking at a horse
when he's standing still looks magical,

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,489
but when he's running,
you know, it's like,

3
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,908
they should have wings.

4
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,596
There's a lot of horses
I've been given, um, on this ranch

5
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,225
that, uh, were problem horses
that other people couldn't handle.

6
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
Line up, boys!

7
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,729
<i>Once you start working them</i>

8
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>and you find their niche,</i>

9
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>what they're gonna be
and what they can do...</i>

10
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,777
Good girl.

11
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,238
...you know, they fit in quite well.

12
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,790
No one can classify
themselves as a horse master.

13
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,918
My father can classify himself
as a horse trainer,

14
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,130
'cause he's trained horses
to do incredible feats.

15
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,179
It's not just someone doing a trick.

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,807
It's like they become really good friends.

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,475
Smile, guys. Smile.

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,602
Yay! Good!

19
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,272
But you lose the Robin
that I married for a little while.

20
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,026
But it's... it's worth it to see what
the result is, the magic that he creates.

21
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,223
<i>When you get a new horse
and you don't know</i>

22
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,767
<i>what his history was...</i>

23
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,522
<i>sometimes it takes a little bit to get</i>

24
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>across that edge.</i>

25
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,533
<i>Some of the... the wildest horses
that you come across,</i>

26
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,412
<i>and you get them, and you see
that spark in their eye, and they're wild.</i>

27
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,375
<i>You know deep down,
you can see it in their eye,</i>

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,669
<i>there's a better side to this horse.</i>

29
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>Hang on, cowboy! Yeah!</i>

30
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,475
<i>I grew up
with horses always around me.</i>

31
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>I was raised in a little country town
in Australia.</i>

32
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,321
<i>I wasn't small, but I would be called
the runt of the litter.</i>

33
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,826
<i>I didn't speak that well. I couldn't read.</i>

34
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>I was a loner.</i>

35
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>I was happy with a horse.</i>

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,169
<i>When you can't communicate
with other people,</i>

37
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>you're ostracized a little bit.</i>

38
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,135
<i>That's why I was pushed
to my grandparents,</i>

39
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,598
<i>to try to change my life,
which it changed my life.</i>

40
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,231
<i>I looked up to my granddad,
and he had a stern voice.</i>

41
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,360
<i>And, you know,
he was a highly decorated war hero,</i>

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>and he'd been in the Light Horse Brigade
in Australia, you know.</i>

43
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,573
<i>And that's such a... a huge honor</i>

44
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
<i>to fight for your country on horseback.</i>

45
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>But... I've never seen</i>

46
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>love in my... granddad's eyes.</i>

47
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,172
<i>We always ate at the table together.</i>

48
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>And then he'd look straight down
at his food,</i>

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>and then he'd look up again
and just look straight through you.</i>

50
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,471
<i>That stare.</i>

51
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,350
<i>Just before he passed away in hospital,</i>

52
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,519
<i>and... and he'd still give me that look.</i>

53
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,107
<i>What did you think
of his efforts tonight?</i>

54
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,151
That's always been
at the back of my mind,

55
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,737
you know, what my granddad
had said to me, you know?

56
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,697
"You'll amount to nothing."

57
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>My grandma was very soft-spoken.</i>

58
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,915
<i>When I was young, I would look at a book.</i>

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,668
<i>Instead of opening up
and going from the top,</i>

60
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>I would start from the bottom,
and she said,</i>

61
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,089
<i>"Now start from this side here</i>

62
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,677
<i>and then follow it down
again and again and again."</i>

63
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>And I think that's what's helped me
pass this on to my training.</i>

64
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,811
<i>You know,
it was that repetition of doing it.</i>

65
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>She said, "Believe in what you are."</i>

66
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>"And if you want to do it
through the horses, do it."</i>

67
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,241
<i>Just be very gentle with them,</i>

68
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,578
<i>and they will give back
a lot more love to you.</i>

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,088
<i>You know, I... I like a man
who watches things going around.</i>

70
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,465
<i>It means he'll make his mark someday.</i>

71
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,678
I would say I was about 10 or 11.

72
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:33,810
I went into this movie theater,
and... I was mesmerized.

73
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,022
You know, it was so large, the screen.
It's just wide,

74
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,650
and... the animals running towards you.

75
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,444
And the whole attire,

76
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,531
I mean, the hat, the boots, and the scarf.

77
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,325
Especially their mannerism
and how they got on a horse, you know?

78
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,577
It's just like, "Oh, wow."

79
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,081
I went back the next day.

80
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,380
Every time I watched a western
with a horse doing something unusual,

81
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,342
you know, I'm gonna copy that
and just see if I can do it better.

82
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,056
<i>My first trick was the lay-down position,</i>

83
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,643
<i>because I wasn't that big
to... to get on the horse.</i>

84
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,913
<i>So I had to teach him to lay down
so I could get on him.</i>

85
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,605
Good boy. Whoa.

86
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
<i>I wanted to get into the picture business,
because I wanted to train horses.</i>

87
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>But all the lots in Hollywood
got rid of all the horses,</i>

88
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,408
<i>because it was just after </i>Star Wars.

89
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,909
<i>Westerns were done.</i>

90
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,380
<i>Moving 10,000 miles across the world...
...to America,</i>

91
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>it felt like you just had a brick dropped
right on the back of your neck.</i>

92
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

93
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,636
<i>It's over.</i>

94
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,310
<i>There was still a desire to stay here</i>

95
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,729
<i>and work it out.</i>

96
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,403
<i>Once I got to Wyoming,</i>

97
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,324
<i>I knew this was home.</i>

98
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,957
<i>Getting up early in the morning,
and I... I think it was the first morning</i>

99
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,794
<i>after pulling the chuck wagon in
on this little lot.</i>

100
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>And... seeing the horses
right there with me,</i>

101
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,553
<i>there was no going back.</i>

102
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,931
<i>It was my dream to train.</i>

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,271
<i>My, uh, third horse</i>

104
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,902
<i>was Juniper,
and which... changed my life completely.</i>

105
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,491
<i>When I looked in Juniper's eyes,
there was a little bit of a sadness there.</i>

106
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>Even though it might
have been in his past,</i>

107
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,371
<i>I'd seen something bigger.</i>

108
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,458
<i>That horse was so smart.</i>

109
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,126
<i>He had that gift.</i>

110
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>Juniper had this wonderful rear.</i>

111
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,260
<i>He had great balance. Unbelievable.</i>

112
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,679
<i>A horse like that,</i>

113
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,723
<i>it only comes once in a lifetime.</i>

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,183
You like Robin?

115
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,061
Hey, do you like me?

116
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,063
Of course you do.

117
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,738
<i>When I got here,
even though the westerns had finished,</i>

118
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,408
<i>but these old cowboys still were alive,</i>

119
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,870
<i>it was about two years later,
I run into Darrell Winfield.</i>

120
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,332
<i>Wow, that's the Marlboro Man.
He was the real deal.</i>

121
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,505
<i>Darrell said, "Robin, I've heard
you've got a horse that can rear."</i>

122
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,215
<i>"Can you put a rider on him,</i>

123
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>and can you cue him
behind camera to rear?"</i>

124
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>I said, "Well, I've got,
uh, Juniper over here."</i>

125
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>It was definitely my first audition.</i>

126
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,642
<i>I got the part.</i>

127
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,645
<i>I got a job.</i>

128
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,612
<i>When you get storyboards,
you look at them, you go,</i>

129
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>"Wow, okay,
I think I can do better than that."</i>

130
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,785
Ready, Robin?

131
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,664
And action!

132
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,747
Hup!

133
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,083
Good.

134
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,086
Good boy.

135
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,590
<i>I know, especially my horses,
and... they all enjoy working.</i>

136
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,300
<i>You know, they find their niche.</i>

137
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>I think</i>,<i> when you get on set, you know,</i>

138
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,517
<i>you know where you started from
with the horse.</i>

139
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,603
<i>The building blocks that went into it.</i>

140
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,066
<i>And that's when the orchestra comes out.</i>

141
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>He's performing in front of you,</i>

142
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,031
<i>and he's performing
in front of that camera.</i>

143
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>He's showing off his art.</i>

144
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,868
Good boy!

145
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,537
Good!

146
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,789
Kick! Good boy!

147
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,375
First lesson's pretty good.

148
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,793
Smart horse.

149
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,760
Come on, young lady.

150
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,512
Come around.

151
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,598
<i>One second on camera,
when you look into it...</i>

152
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,309
<i>...it's weeks and hours of training.</i>

153
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,644
Come on. Come on. Come on.

154
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,021
Good, kids!

155
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,274
I use a... a whip or pointer,

156
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,694
and it's not there
to, um, touch the horse.

157
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:22,116
I'd use a pointer, or I would use
a lunge whip as a sound.

158
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,951
All right, here we go, guys!

159
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,747
It's just to guide him
to go away from you...

160
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,664
Good, kids!

161
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,999
...or come to you.

162
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,709
Come to me.

163
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,671
<i>Eye contact is very important
with everything.</i>

164
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,924
<i>It's just like a human.
You know when you first meet a person?</i>

165
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,680
Good. Good.
Okay, you found your mark. Pirouette.

166
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,891
Come.

167
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,685
<i>You might be right-handed.
I'm left-handed.</i>

168
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,356
<i>And that is exactly the same
with a horse on each side of his eye.</i>

169
00:12:55,566 --> 00:13:00,237
<i>You got to train with one side first
and then go to the other side.</i>

170
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,238
Good!

171
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,032
<i>Once you got both eyes,</i>

172
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,826
<i>then you can cue them
from anywhere around the camera.</i>

173
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,286
Pirouette.

174
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,413
And... good gal!

175
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,956
Bravo! Bravo!

176
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,750
That was beautiful, Em.

177
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,627
A pirouette is so graceful,

178
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,422
and they can hold their front feet,
where she'll pivot all the way around.

179
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,258
And it's just...
it's like going out into a waltz.

180
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,232
<i>And when you've got
both eyes in sync,</i>

181
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,150
<i>it's just like playing the piano,</i>

182
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,445
<i>'cause they're playing their music
in front of you.</i>

183
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,494
<i>Imagine the power you'd feel</i>

184
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,456
<i>if you had 50 horses
charging towards you.</i>

185
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,629
Whoa! You're a big girl.

186
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,591
I seen this, uh,
in a circus book when I was a kid.

187
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,971
A Clydesdale standing
on top of a... a teeter-totter.

188
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,098
And I always wanted to recreate it.

189
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,310
I just want to get her to balance it now
and just hold the weight.

190
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,687
Steady. Nope.

191
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,564
Steady.

192
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,233
<i>You have to gradually let them</i>

193
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,317
<i>feel,</i>

194
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>smell you...</i>

195
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,950
<i>and then you've got that touch with them.</i>

196
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,927
<i>I'll look back
on some of the magical stuff</i>

197
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,804
<i>that I put together with horses.</i>

198
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,808
<i>You know, if it's not on film,
it's like it never happened.</i>

199
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,936
Oh, that's...

200
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,188
Look at that balance! That's balance!

201
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,272
Yes!

202
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,006
<i>A paragon pioneer</i>

203
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,762
<i>is a person that's living in the present
but... believes in the past as well.</i>

204
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,017
<i>Sometimes you feel like
you've been there before.</i>

205
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,028
Welcome! Welcome!

206
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,947
Little bit of history here, guys.

207
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,410
Robin is very passionate
about recreating the old Wild West.

208
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,414
And we're all proud of it,
because we all participate in some way.

209
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,966
The cowboy dream is dying off,

210
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,718
but for my father, no,
he's definitely a full-blown cowboy.

211
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,265
It makes me feel like
when I first got to America.

212
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,518
Just want to keep it alive.

213
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,981
Welcome, boys! Welcome!

214
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,361
<i>♪ Paint your wagon
Come along ♪</i>

215
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,572
<i>♪ Gotta dream, boy
Gotta song ♪</i>

216
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,741
We're going home, baby!

217
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,632
<i>My horses,
when I... talk about them...</i>

218
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>I say, "The kids are out together,"
because they are kids.</i>

219
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,101
<i>They're my children,
even though I've got Patrick.</i>

220
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,119
<i>When I first got Juniper,</i>

221
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>that horse taught me so much</i>

222
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:25,753
<i>of being patient and being humble
and excited.</i>

223
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,296
We'll camp here.

224
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,883
<i>He would do better than I had ever thought
an animal could ever do.</i>

225
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,678
<i>And you'd only have to show him once,
and bang, he got it.</i>

226
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,516
Good boy, Jun.

227
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,563
<i>He built me, and he built this ranch.</i>

228
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>Juniper was getting old.
He was in his thirties.</i>

229
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,781
<i>The young man that I had here
signaled to me.</i>

230
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,368
<i>He said, "You know, you'd better come in.
I think Juniper is really, really sick."</i>

231
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,288
<i>And he must have hung on till I got home.</i>

232
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:05,793
And I got there and put him in my arms
and just... knelt down there with him,

233
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,212
and, you know,
he gave that last little whinny

234
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,380
and then was gone.

235
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,946
<i>How'd you know
when he was gonna draw?</i>

236
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,657
<i>By watching his eyes.</i>

237
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,492
<i>- Remember that.
- I will.</i>

238
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,457
Come on, guys. Line up.
Come on. School time.

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,752
Mrs. Parker loves to give smiles.

240
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,213
Mrs. Parker.

241
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,297
Good girl.

242
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,341
Good girl.

243
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,388
<i>Once the horse gets the spark,</i>

244
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,473
<i>I'm the flint.</i>

245
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,350
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

246
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>the animal just comes alive,
and he's got it.</i>

247
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>As much love
as you can put into them,</i>

248
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,380
<i>they're gonna give it back to you.</i>

249
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,592
<i>But if you can stand there and hold that,</i>

250
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,386
<i>like...</i>

251
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,346
<i>...it's a world.</i>
