<i>Paul Stewart is one of</i>
<i>the main directors of</i>
<i>photography on this film.</i>

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,520
The clever thing is to get
something that stands up here,

69
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
and that stays
standing vertical.

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240

73

<i>Paul's knowledge of birds,</i>
<i>especially rare ones</i>
<i>hardly filmed</i>

74

<i>And at first I thought</i>
<i>that would be great,</i>

83

of this place is deceptive.

84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,440
It's flat but it's marshy,

<i>Even if they find one,</i>
<i>it won't be easy to get close.</i>

92

<i>That's because the crew</i>
<i>are being watched.</i>

93

<i>These birds have</i>
<i>astonishing eyesight.</i>

PAUL:<i> If you put</i>
<i>a group of cranes together,</i>
<i>you've got a united front</i>

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,120
that's almost impossible
to creep up on.

96
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,080
NARRATOR: <i>The team will</i>
<i>have to outsmart the birds.</i>

97
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,200
PAUL: <i>When we wanted to get</i>
<i>very close and very intimate</i>

98

<i>with birds and their chicks,</i>

99
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,360
<i>what we needed to find</i>
<i>was somewhere where birds</i>
<i>would allow that approach</i>

100
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
because the last thing
you want to do

101
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
with a rare species like this
is disturb it at the nest.

102
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,960
NARRATOR: <i>Then,</i>
<i>amongst the reeds,</i>

103
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,360
<i>two eggs.</i>

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,360
<i>A tiny movement suggests</i>
<i>they are ready to hatch.</i>

105
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,520
<i>Paul spends every</i>
<i>daylight hour,</i>

106

<i>eyes and camera,</i>
<i>focused on the nest.</i>

107

<i>Paul and the team</i>

110
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
We felt actually very lucky

111

<i>to find that there were</i>
<i>two tiny chicks that had</i>
<i>just hatched,</i>

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,560
<i>and realized that</i>
<i>we were at the right time</i>

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,360
<i>to film something</i>
<i>that really hasn't</i>
<i>been seen before.</i>

114
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,960
NARRATOR: <i>Very little footage</i>
<i>of wild red-crowned</i>
<i>crane chicks exists.</i>

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>Partly because of their rarity,</i>

116
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,000
<i>but also because they</i>
<i>don't stay on the nest</i>
<i>very long.</i>

117
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
<i>We knew that as well as</i>
<i>having to get close,</i>

118
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,280
<i>we didn't have</i>
<i>a huge amount of time,</i>

119
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
<i>just a few days.</i>

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,440
The chicks are very quickly
ready to leave the nest
once they've hatched.

121
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,720
<i>The very first glimpse</i>
<i>we saw of a crane chick,</i>

122
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,360
<i>I was amazed at</i>
<i>how small they are.</i>

123
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
<i>The adult bird</i>
<i>is really imposing</i>

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,520
<i>and in contrast to that,</i>
<i>the chicks are absolutely tiny,</i>

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,480
<i>and just seeing</i>
<i>the adults on the nest</i>
<i>with their huge feet</i>

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,480
<i>walking around</i>
<i>their chicks you couldn't help</i>
<i>but be worried for the chicks.</i>

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
NARRATOR: <i>Paul and the team</i>
<i>are so much closer to the nest</i>
<i>than they dared to hope.</i>

129
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,240
<i>By moving very slowly</i>
<i>and very quietly towards</i>
<i>the birds,</i>

130
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,520
<i>they're able to film</i>
<i>without causing them</i>
<i>any disturbance.</i>

131
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Despite their rather
elegant beauty,

132
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
they're actually
quite aggressive,

133
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,040
<i>and so if they're</i>
<i>not happy with you,</i>
<i>they make it very clear.</i>

134
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,520
<i>But we've been delighted that</i>
<i>actually the red-crowned cranes</i>

135

<i>have very much</i>
<i>accepted our presence,</i>

136
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
<i>and allowed us a real</i>
<i>privileged glimpse</i>
<i>of the life of the chicks.</i>

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
NARRATOR: <i>The chicks</i>
<i>have an amazing ability.</i>

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,360
<i>Shortly after being born,</i>
<i>they are able to walk,</i>
<i>run, and even swim.</i>

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,600
<i>These tiny little chicks,</i>
<i>small little balls of fluff,</i>

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,720
<i>are able to follow</i>
<i>their parents</i>

141
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,320
<i>through the marshes</i>
<i>as they look for food.</i>

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>As Paul films the birds,</i>

143
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,080
<i>he notices the crane's</i>
<i>doing something</i>
<i>he's never seen before.</i>

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
When the chicks
were firstborn,

145
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,800
<i>the adults were trying</i>
<i>to feed them bits of fish,</i>

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,760
<i>and that was clearly too much</i>
<i>for the chicks to swallow,</i>

147
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,400
but something seemed to have
clicked in the adult's mind,

148
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,200
perhaps these were relatively
inexperienced birds we were
dealing with,

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,960
<i>and so very shortly,</i>
<i>they were going off</i>
<i>into the reeds</i>

150
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
and picking the tiniest
little insects,

151
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
<i>insects that clearly</i>
<i>the adults themselves</i>
<i>wouldn't eat,</i>

152
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,760
<i>they don't represent a meal.</i>

153
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,480
<i>But they'd bring those back</i>
<i>one at a time to the chicks,</i>

154
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,920
<i>and that was something that</i>
<i>the chicks could swallow.</i>

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,400
<i>So I was quite impressed</i>
<i>how the adults adapted to</i>
<i>their choosy-eating chicks.</i>

156
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
NARRATOR: <i>For the team,</i>
<i>it's amazing to film</i>
<i>the next generation</i>

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
<i>of such a rare bird</i>
<i>growing up in the wild.</i>

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,280
<i>Much work has gone</i>
<i>into studying the birds'</i>
<i>breeding biology,</i>

159
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,560
<i>and the preservation</i>
<i>of their habitats</i>

160
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,320
<i>that the birds need</i>
<i>to survive in greater numbers.</i>

161
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,320
<i>The expedition is seeing</i>
<i>this work directly contributing</i>

162
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,040
<i>to the survival of the birds.</i>

163
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,400
PAUL: <i>This is a special place</i>
<i>for the red-crowned cranes</i>

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,520
because it's one of
their breeding sites

165
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,480
and more importantly,
probably it's one of
their breeding sites

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,000
that's being conserved
and actively managed
for their benefit.

167
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
So it's a place where
the red-crowned cranes
can feel safe

168
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
and where they can
bring up chicks

169
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,080
with a really good
chance of success.

170
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
NARRATOR: <i>Paul and the team</i>
<i>have filmed a cultural icon</i>

171
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,400
<i>and are left with</i>
<i>precious memories.</i>

172
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,160
<i>The chicks are growing well,</i>

173
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,360

<i>1,600 miles to the southwest.</i>

178
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,880
<i>They're also</i>
<i>in search of babies,</i>

179
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
<i>but of a different nature.</i>

180
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,080
<i>Thanks to conservation efforts</i>
<i>within China,</i>

181
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,200
<i>these mountain forests harbor</i>
<i>a colorful endangered</i>

(MONKEYS CHITTERING)

183
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,120
<i>These are golden</i>
<i>snub-nosed monkeys.</i>

184
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,800
<i>Amongst the rarest of primates</i>

185
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
<i>and only found</i>
<i>in central China.</i>

186
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,200
<i>The crew hope to get</i>
<i>a privileged look into</i>
<i>the life of a wild monkey</i>

187
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,920
<i>that lives at an elevation</i>
<i>almost as high as</i>
<i>any primate on Earth.</i>

188
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>The challenge for this team</i>
<i>is to keep up with these agile,</i>

189
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>tree-swinging monkeys</i>
<i>living on wild steep-sided</i>
<i>slopes.</i>

<i>principally filming</i>

191
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
<i>the golden snub-nosed</i>
<i>monkeys has been</i>

192
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,560
in the highest mountains
in central China.

193
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,880
They are very dramatic
steep mountains,

194
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,040
forested,
and incredibly beautiful.

195
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
NARRATOR:
<i>China has set aside</i>

196
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,440
<i>a number of wild forest areas</i>
<i>to protect the monkeys.</i>

197
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,400
<i>The filming location</i>
<i>is over 1,200 square miles</i>
<i>in size,</i>

198
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
<i>as large as the state of</i>
<i>Rhode Island.</i>

199
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,920
<i>Justin Maguire has filmed</i>
<i>on all seven continents.</i>

200
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,960
<i>He's a multi-award winning</i>
<i>cameraman</i>

201
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
<i>with many years</i>
<i>of experience in the field.</i>

202
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,640
In order to film the monkeys
in a way that we didn't
disturb them,

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,560
we tried to film
with as few people
as possible,

204
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,920
<i>which involved my crew</i>
<i>carrying a very large tripod,</i>

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,120
<i>and me having to</i>
<i>carry the camera.</i>

206
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
<i>The ground is incredibly steep,</i>

207
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
<i>there's lots of branches</i>
<i>and brambles and thorns.</i>

208
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,960
It can be cold and wet
and miserable,

209
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,560
<i>and those were our</i>
<i>biggest physical challenges</i>

210
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,520
on the location, it's just
carrying all this heavy gear
up and down,

211
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,080
<i>and keeping up with</i>
<i>the monkeys who move</i>
<i>much faster than us with ease,</i>

212
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,600
<i>and we are sort of</i>
<i>flopping around just</i>
<i>trying to stay steady.</i>

213
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,800
<i>NARRATOR: Jess Tombs</i>
<i>is a primatologist</i>

214
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,440
<i>who's spent many years</i>
<i>working with primates,</i>

215
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,680
<i>but none as cute as this.</i>

216
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,600
JESS: <i>Golden snub-nosed</i>
<i>monkeys were chosen</i>

217
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,200
because they are
the only character in the film
that is a social animal

218
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,840
<i>so you've got lots of</i>
<i>interactions between</i>
<i>individuals going on.</i>

219
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,120
<i>They're beautiful,</i>
<i>they're amazing,</i>

220
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
<i>they're charming,</i>
<i>they're funny.</i>

221
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
<i>They're very entertaining.</i>

222
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,680
NARRATOR: <i>Jacky Poon</i>
<i>is a Chinese Emmy-nominated</i>
<i>wildlife cameraman.</i>

223
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,400
<i>He's filmed all over China,</i>
<i>specializing in primates.</i>

224
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,720
<i>What is very amazing</i>
<i>and fascinating is</i>
<i>that we frequently</i>

225
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,440
see that the father
would carry a young baby
and try to keep him warm

226
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
<i>by huddling together</i>
<i>and grooming each other,</i>

227
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,760
<i>and that's something</i>
<i>that a lot of males don't do</i>

228
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,440
<i>to their younger juveniles</i>
<i>in other primate societies.</i>

229
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,960
JUSTIN: <i>What people</i>
<i>really relate to with these</i>
<i>monkeys is that they'll see</i>

230
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
themselves in the monkeys.

231
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,880
<i>They'll see the monkeys</i>
<i>being cold and miserable,</i>

232
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,440
<i>and they'll see them happy</i>
<i>with the first sign of spring</i>

233
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,200
<i>and be pleased when</i>
<i>they're groomed by</i>
<i>a family member,</i>

234
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,960
<i>and ecstatic when they</i>
<i>get to play with their friends,</i>

235
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,320
<i>and I think we all</i>
<i>relate to that.</i>

236
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,720
They entertain
themselves all the time,

237
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,920
particularly the youngsters,

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and that's what they
spend a huge portion
of their day doing,

239
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,200
<i>is having fun.</i>

240
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,440
<i>Swinging, chasing each other,</i>

241
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
<i>you know,</i>
<i>just doing silly things.</i>

242
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,760
NARRATOR:<i> The crew quickly</i>
<i>become attached to the monkeys,</i>

243
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,960
<i>and are now in the right place</i>
<i>at the right time</i>

244
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>to capture a special event.</i>

245
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,080
<i>It's baby time.</i>

246
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,720
<i>Only once every</i>
<i>two years in the spring,</i>

247
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,880
<i>there's a flurry</i>
<i>of newborns.</i>

248
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>Most arrive between</i>
<i>April and June.</i>

249
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
<i>A time when the forest explodes</i>
<i>with color and new life.</i>

250
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,800
<i>At this time of year,</i>
<i>there are babies everywhere.</i>

251
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,840
<i>The newborns won't leave</i>
<i>their mom's side for</i>
<i>least east three months.</i>

252
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,960
<i>But it's not a time of</i>
<i>celebration for everyone.</i>

253
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,240
<i>This is Tao Tao,</i>

254
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,680
<i>a two-year-old male</i>
<i>whose mum has just given birth.</i>

255
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,800
<i>At first, he welcomes</i>
<i>the arrival of a baby.</i>

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>But this little one</i>
<i>takes up mom's entire time.</i>

257
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
<i>Tao Tao feels left out.</i>

258
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,400
<i>JESS: He's the center of</i>
<i>his family's attention</i>

259
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,800
<i>until his mum has</i>
<i>a little baby sister.</i>

260
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,440
His world is about to
change forever and he's
gonna have to grow up,

261
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,280
and we follow him
on this journey.

262
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,440
NARRATOR: <i>Tao Tao finds himself</i>
<i>no longer the apple</i>
<i>of his parents' eye.</i>

263
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
<i>It's a tough lesson</i>
<i>at such a young age,</i>

264
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
<i>and while Tao Tao's sister</i>
<i>is being nursed,</i>

265
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,080
<i>there's little room for him</i>
<i>within the family.</i>

266
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,040
<i>But there's a safety net.</i>

267
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,160
<i>The all-male troop.</i>

268
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,960
<i>A gang of Lost Boys,</i>

269
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,560
<i>the perfect place for Tao Tao</i>
<i>and other young males</i>
<i>to hang out as they grow up.</i>

270
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,920
<i>It's a boisterous,</i>
<i>adventurous, and fun crew.</i>

271
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,280
<i>With the emphasis on fun.</i>

272
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>And Tao Tao is getting</i>
<i>into the swing of things!</i>

273
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,480
<i>By making these adorable</i>
<i>golden snub-nosed monkeys</i>

274
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,200
<i>a conservation priority,</i>

275
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,440
<i>it's the Chinese themselves</i>
<i>who are discovering</i>
<i>the amazing wildlife</i>

276
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,320
<i>their country has to offer.</i>

277
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,440
Ultimately, the understanding
and appreciation and enjoyment,

278
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,080
of the natural world
and wild animals

279
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,080
is one thing that will
hopefully lead to

280
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,880
the preservation
and protection.

281
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
NARRATOR: <i>As the seasons</i>
<i>change across China,</i>

282
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
<i>the freshness of spring</i>
<i>turns to summer,</i>

283
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,240
<i>and with it comes</i>
<i>a unique filming opportunity...</i>

284
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,640
<i>to film the birth</i>

<i>of the country to find</i>
<i>this antelope.</i>

290
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,280

<i>in the 1980s and '90s</i>

292

<i>for its warm fur</i>
<i>to make luxurious shawls</i>
<i>known as "Shahtoosh,"</i>

<i>the chiru are now recovering</i>
<i>from the brink of extinction</i>

294
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,520
<i>thanks to its protection</i>

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,200
<i>and the establishment</i>
<i>of a vast wild area.</i>

296
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,480
<i>Weeks ago, the pregnant females</i>
<i>left the males behind</i>

297

<i>The challenge is to be</i>

<i>to film a chiru birth.</i>

300
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,400
STEVEN: <i>Because of</i>
<i>the remoteness of it,</i>

301
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,320
<i>we couldn't access</i>
<i>any local facilities.</i>

302
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
We had to take
all our stores with us.

303
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,720
From fuel to food to bedding.
You name it, we took with us.

<i>every 1,600 feet they climb.</i>

312
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,440
<i>Already at Camp 1,</i>

313
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,320
<i>the team are nearly</i>
<i>10,000 feet above sea level.</i>

314
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,480
<i>The thin air making</i>
<i>the crucial and simple task</i>
<i>of breathing difficult.</i>

315
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
<i>Any physical work</i>
<i>on top of that,</i>

316
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,920
<i>even setting up a tent,</i>
<i>is really tough.</i>

317
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,960
<i>The crew must stay here</i>
<i>for 24 hours</i>

318
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,440
<i>to allow their bodies</i>
<i>to get used to the thin air.</i>

319
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,760
<i>The chef insists on</i>
<i>wearing his best whites.</i>

320
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,480
<i>He knows how important he is</i>
<i>to the welfare of the team.</i>

321
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,400
<i>A high-calorie diet is crucial</i>
<i>at these altitudes.</i>

322
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,360
<i>The food is a huge hit.</i>

323
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,560
<i>They journey on.</i>

324
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
<i>Beyond the last gas station,</i>

325
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,040
<i>the team have to</i>
<i>fill the trucks by hand.</i>

326
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,280
<i>Rolf Steinmann is</i>
<i>the director of photography</i>
<i>for the chiru expedition,</i>

327
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,680
<i>specializing in filming</i>
<i>skittish, endangered animals</i>

328
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,560
<i>in remote corners of the world.</i>

329
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>He's used to cold conditions,</i>

330
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,160
<i>but sub-zero temperatures</i>
<i>inside the car</i>

331
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,920
<i>is something else.</i>

332
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,440
I just wanted to drink
a little bit of water and...

333
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,240
this happened.

334
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,800
So... it's getting
pretty cold.

335
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,600
NARRATOR: <i>Camp 2</i>
<i>at over 12,000 feet</i>
<i>is even more remote.</i>

336
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,240
<i>The crew will be here for</i>
<i>48 hours to get fit enough</i>
<i>for the final stage.</i>

337
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>It's a chance for Rolf</i>
<i>to brush up on</i>
<i>his wildlife knowledge</i>

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
<i>as he waits for dinner.</i>

339
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
(WHISTLING)

340
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

341
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
<i>All are eager for</i>
<i>essential calories.</i>

342
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,280
<i>The last day of the journey.</i>

343
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>Today the team will push</i>
<i>inland to where they hope</i>
<i>to find the chiru.</i>

344
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,480
Once we actually got
to the entrance of the reserve,

345
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,960
of which there is
no actual entrance,

346
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,960
it's just like this
huge open plateau,

347
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,760
<i>you then turn off</i>
<i>the tarmac road</i>

348
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,720
<i>and enter the plateau region.</i>

349
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,080
NARRATOR: <i>From here,</i>
<i>it's another 120 miles</i>
<i>off-road driving</i>

350
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,200
<i>across the highest plateau</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

351
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
<i>This is Kekexili.</i>

352
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,800
<i>A place where few Westerners</i>
<i>have traveled</i>

353
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
<i>and one of the most</i>
<i>sparsely populated regions</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

354
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,400
The overwhelming sense of space

355
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,240
was the first impression
that really struck me

356
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
and always stayed with me.

357
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,920
There's no trees,
there was literally
no mountains

358
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,880
<i>except way off</i>
<i>in the distance.</i>

359
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,200
<i>I come from a city,</i>
<i>so to suddenly have</i>

360
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,440
acres of land

361
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,440
with these massive
beautiful vistas was just
breathtakingly beautiful.

362
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,560
NARRATOR: <i>This area is over</i>
<i>17,000 square miles in size,</i>

363
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,360
<i>larger than</i>
<i>the state of Maryland.</i>

364
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,840
<i>Over 15,000 feet</i>
<i>above sea level,</i>

365
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,080
<i>higher than the Rockies</i>

366
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
<i>with only a few</i>
<i>human inhabitants,</i>

367
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,920
<i>it protects the unique plants</i>
<i>and animals that live here.</i>

368
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,400
<i>The team are heading to a camp</i>
<i>on the shores of Zhuonai Lake.</i>

369
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,360
<i>A beautiful remote</i>
<i>60 square mile</i>
<i>body of water.</i>

370
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,320
<i>Just 15 years ago,</i>

371
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,080
<i>this area was discovered</i>
<i>to be the key birthing</i>
<i>ground of the chiru.</i>

372
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,960
<i>So difficult to access,</i>
<i>it remains seldom visited.</i>

373
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>After 48 hours</i>
<i>driving off-road,</i>

374
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,000
<i>this team are the first</i>
<i>international film crew</i>
<i>to reach the lake.</i>

375
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,480
<i>The heart of what was</i>
<i>the chiru poaching area.</i>

376
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,200
STEVEN: <i>We were able</i>
<i>to use a ranger station</i>

377
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,240
<i>which had been near enough</i>
<i>abandoned really.</i>

378
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,320
<i>It was surrounded by</i>
<i>a 14-foot steel fence.</i>

379
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,560
NARRATOR:
<i>As the crew unpacks,</i>

380
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,720
<i>an immediate reminder</i>
<i>of how wild this place is.</i>

381
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
<i>A bear.</i>

382
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,760
<i>The reason for the fence</i>
<i>is clear.</i>

383
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,280
<i>The Himalayan Blue Bear</i>
<i>is one of the rarest bear</i>
<i>sub-species in the world.</i>

384
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,560
<i>It is thought by some</i>
<i>to be the origin of</i>
<i>the legendary Yeti.</i>

385
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,080
<i>A creature rarely seen,</i>
<i>let alone filmed, in the wild.</i>

386
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,320
It's just very amazing
to see the bear

387
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
in this vast
beautiful landscape.

388
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,840
It's a very special moment.

389
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,840
NARRATOR: <i>An early sign</i>
<i>for the team of</i>
<i>the amazing and rare animals</i>

390
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,080
<i>who call this huge</i>
<i>wild reserve "home."</i>

391
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,560
<i>This area became a sanctuary</i>
<i>just over 20 years ago</i>

392
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,040
<i>at the peak of the chiru</i>
<i>being poached,</i>

393
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,440
<i>and when their population</i>
<i>had collapsed</i>

394
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,520
<i>from around 1 million</i>
<i>to less than 100,000.</i>

395
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
<i>Their numbers have</i>
<i>increased since then,</i>

396
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
<i>but the chiru are still</i>
<i>wary of humans.</i>

397
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
<i>Their shyness is a problem</i>
<i>for Rolf and the crew.</i>

398
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
It's pretty intimidating
because...

399
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,520
if you use binoculars,
you can see

400
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,760
these groups of chirus
all over the place, but...

401
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,600
the question will be
how to get close to them

402
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,320
because I have to be like
20, 40 meters close

403
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,680
to get good shots.

404
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,240
NARRATOR: <i>The team decide</i>
<i>their only option</i>

405
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,240
<i>is to position several hides</i>
<i>at strategic points</i>

406
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,040
<i>from which Rolf can film.</i>

407
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Okay.

408
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,520
NARRATOR: <i>Dug into</i>
<i>the hard ground</i>
<i>and designed to blend</i>

409
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
<i>into the landscape</i>
<i>as much as possible,</i>

410
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,080
<i>these will give the team</i>
<i>a fighting chance to get</i>
<i>a camera close to the chiru</i>

411
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
<i>without disturbing them.</i>

412
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,800
<i>But setting up</i>
<i>a number of hides</i>
<i>on the plateau,</i>

413
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,640
<i>doesn't go unnoticed</i>
<i>by curious bears.</i>

414
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,680
Well, we actually
just wanted to inspect

415
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
our hide here
on the calving grounds

416
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,280
or the potential
calving grounds,

417
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,840
and we recognize
the bear has visited our hide.

418
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,040
And yeah, bears are
powerful animals

419
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
so if he inspects
a hide like that,

420
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,080
he leaves his tracks

421
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,680
so...

422
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,080
But you know you always
have to consider

423
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,400
these bears out here,
they don't have TV,

424
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,920
<i>they don't have</i>
<i>computer games,</i>

425
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,760
so a hide like that
is something really interesting.

426
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,000
And that's why I have
no problems to forgive him

427
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,280
and we just have to repair
the little stuff here.

428
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
NARRATOR:<i> Alone</i>
<i>in a tiny hide in the middle</i>
<i>of bear territory,</i>

429
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,880
<i>it's a nerve-wracking time</i>
<i>for Rolf.</i>

430
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,840
<i>He's spending days on end</i>
<i>hoping the chiru will turn up.</i>

431
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
(COUGHS)

432
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,360
There is absolutely no sign
of life out there.

433
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,520
Not a chiru,
not a yak,
no nothing.

434
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,960
And the weird thing is
this is an open grassland.

435
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,240
I can see really far,
but there is absolutely nothing.

436
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,240
NARRATOR: <i>All this</i>
<i>at 15,000 feet</i>

437
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,720
<i>on the largest and highest</i>
<i>plateau in the world.</i>

438
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
<i>For most of us,</i>
<i>this would be punishing,</i>

439
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,320
<i>but Rolf's sense of humor</i>
<i>hasn't been dented yet.</i>

440
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,040
<i>He's come to appreciate</i>
<i>the simple things in life.</i>

441
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,960
Well, after...

442
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
12 hours...

443
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,680
in the hide...

444
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,640
at, yeah, kind of serious
sub-zero temperatures,

445
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,320
it's quite nice to be
back in the open

446
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
and heat up,

447
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,520
and have hot water.

448
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,240
Yeah, it's the...

449
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,920
little things which are
the biggest things out here.

450
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,320
<i>Even with changes of brutal</i>
<i>and unpredictable weather,</i>

451
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,520
<i>the team aren't giving up.</i>

452
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,520
ROLF: <i>If I was a mother,</i>
<i>I wouldn't give birth to</i>
<i>a baby in these conditions.</i>

453
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
There's no grass,
it's really cold,

454
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,560
it's snowy, it's not
a good start in life.

455
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,840
NARRATOR: <i>Then at last...</i>

456
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,520
<i>Rolf has something to film.</i>

457
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
<i>One by one,</i>

458
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,120
<i>thousands of female chiru</i>

459
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,960
<i>are arriving at the lake</i>
<i>after a journey of nearly</i>
<i>200 miles</i>

460
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
<i>over the last three weeks.</i>

461
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,000
<i>The highest mammal migration</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

462
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,040
<i>The lake is the perfect place</i>
<i>to have their young.</i>

463
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,000
<i>Temperatures</i>
<i>are pleasantly cool</i>

464
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,120
<i>and the grasses</i>
<i>and water abundant.</i>

465
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,600
<i>As more and more expectant</i>
<i>moms arrive,</i>

466
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,280
<i>and the numbers swell,</i>

467
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
<i>this is the moment</i>
<i>Rolf has been waiting for.</i>

468
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,040
<i>The birthing begins.</i>

469
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,080
<i>Hundreds are born</i>
<i>within days of each other.</i>

470
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,600
<i>It's a remarkable achievement</i>
<i>for the Chiru team</i>

471
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,920
<i>and one of</i>
<i>"the" defining moments</i>
<i>of the</i> Born In China <i>film.</i>

472
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
<i>An endangered skittish antelope</i>

473
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,520
<i>confident enough</i>
<i>to give birth</i>

474
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,560
<i>right in front of</i>
<i>the team's hide.</i>

475
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,000
To see new life
come into this world

476
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,200
was just breathtakingly
beautiful.

477
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,480
NARRATOR: <i>The babies</i>
<i>are extraordinary.</i>

478
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,560
<i>Within just 15 minutes</i>
<i>of being born,</i>

479
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,960
<i>they can already stand</i>

480
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,840
<i>and feed themselves</i>
<i>almost immediately.</i>

481
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
<i>Although clearly,</i>
<i>it takes a little practice.</i>

482
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,320
<i>But even the straddlers</i>
<i>are soon up and confident</i>
<i>on their feet.</i>

483
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,080
<i>All the young staying close</i>
<i>to their moms as they</i>
<i>learn their way around.</i>

484
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,880
<i>As soon as the birthing is over</i>

485
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,240
<i>and the females and young</i>
<i>are strong enough,</i>

486

<i>the herd begins the long</i>
<i>200-mile journey home</i>

488
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,960
<i>The film crew will meet them</i>
<i>there later in the year</i>

489
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,560
<i>as the 100,000 strong</i>
<i>chiru herds complete their</i>
<i>high-altitude migration.</i>

490
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640

<i>to find a very special</i>
<i>and famous animal.</i>

494
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,520
<i>The panda.</i>

495
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,640
<i>The task for this team,</i>
<i>is to film the intimate</i>

496
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,360
<i>between a mother panda</i>
<i>and her cub for the first time.</i>

497
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,920
<i>As a symbol of good luck,</i>

498
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,040
<i>friendship, peace,</i>

499
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,480
<i>and invincibility,</i>

500
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,640
<i>the panda holds</i>
<i>a special place</i>
<i>in Chinese culture.</i>

501
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,560
<i>One of the rarest creatures</i>
<i>on Earth,</i>

502
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,640
<i>largely due to habitat loss,</i>

503
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,440
<i>it lives in the forest,</i>

504
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,320
<i>surviving almost</i>
<i>exclusively on bamboo.</i>

505
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,920
<i>For over half a century,</i>
<i>the panda has been</i>
<i>a flagship for conservation,</i>

506
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,760
<i>a global ambassador for China,</i>

507
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,120
<i>and a bear that's had</i>
<i>millions of dollars spent on it</i>

508
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,000
<i>to restore its numbers</i>
<i>in the wild.</i>

509
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,760
<i>This is Ya Ya.</i>

510
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,280
<i>She's pregnant,</i>
<i>against all the odds.</i>

511
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,960
<i>Female pandas are fertile</i>
<i>for just three days a year,</i>

512
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,680
<i>and can only have one cub</i>
<i>every second year.</i>

513
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>Each birth is precious.</i>

514
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,280
<i>Ya Ya's now at the end</i>
<i>of her five-month gestation,</i>

515
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
<i>and is looking for a den</i>

516
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>in which she can</i>
<i>give birth safely.</i>

517
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,880
<i>But pandas don't do</i>
<i>anything in a hurry.</i>

518
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>One last drink,</i>

519
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,440
<i>a scratch,</i>

520
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560

522
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,400
<i>And in she goes.</i>

523
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
<i>A quiet, safe den,</i>

524
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,200

<i>as she seeks to find a place</i>
<i>to give birth to her young.</i>

528
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,560
<i>And then get</i>

<i>really when it's quite</i>
<i>recently born.</i>

530
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
They're born incredibly tiny

531
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,680
and then they are
kept in that den
for quite some time.

532
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,720
NARRATOR:<i> A tiny cub.</i>

533
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
(CUB SQUEALING)

534
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
<i>Just seven inches long.</i>

535
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,680
<i>A thousand times</i>
<i>smaller than her mum,</i>

536
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
<i>this is Mei Mei.</i>

537
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,080
<i>She can hardly move</i>

538
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,920
<i>and it's eight weeks</i>
<i>before her eyes open.</i>

539
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,640
<i>A baby panda that will,</i>
<i>hopefully in a few years' time,</i>

540
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,960
<i>boost the population of pandas</i>
<i>that remain in the wild.</i>

541
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
<i>For almost 80 years,</i>

542
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,920
<i>China's been working hard</i>
<i>to protect the panda,</i>

543
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,800
<i>and establish areas of habitat</i>
<i>where they can roam free.</i>

544
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,960
As an animal out there in
the wild, kind of on the edge,

545
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,920
physically and metaphorically
in terms of conservation,

546
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
it's not an animal
we want to disturb too much.

547
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,680
NARRATOR: <i>Pandas are found</i>
<i>in large wild mountain reserves</i>

548
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,160
<i>in the central southern</i>
<i>part of the country.</i>

549
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
<i>Access to these areas</i>
<i>is tightly managed.</i>

550
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,560
<i>Designed to be</i>
<i>as wild as possible,</i>

551
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,960
<i>there are some zones</i>
<i>where any human entering</i>

552
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,360
<i>has to permanently wear</i>
<i>a full panda costume.</i>

553
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,040
<i>This is how serious</i>
<i>the Chinese are about</i>
<i>panda conservation.</i>

554
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,520
It's a way for us to get
a little bit closer

555
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,240
without worrying that
we're disturbing an animal.

556
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
NARRATOR:<i> Paul and the team</i>
<i>will spend the next few months</i>
<i>dressed as pandas</i>

557
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,000
<i>hoping to get close</i>
<i>and intimate footage</i>
<i>of a very rare bear.</i>

558
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>It's a conservation program</i>
<i>that's working.</i>

559
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,560
<i>Logging was banned</i>
<i>in panda habitats</i>
<i>almost 20 years ago</i>

560
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,000
<i>and their numbers</i>
<i>are increasing.</i>

561
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,320
<i>But China's ambition</i>
<i>doesn't stop there.</i>

562
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,040
<i>There are plans for</i>
<i>a wild reserve</i>

563
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,760
<i>three times the size</i>
<i>of Yellowstone.</i>

564
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,960
<i>Linking almost</i>
<i>70 panda habitats,</i>

565
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,360
<i>it will allow more pandas</i>
<i>to mingle and mate</i>

566
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,200
<i>in the hope of boosting</i>
<i>the panda's population.</i>

567
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,800
<i>This is conservation</i>
<i>on a truly epic scale.</i>

568
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
<i>In the mountain range</i>
<i>above Paul,</i>

569
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,280
<i>a second filming unit</i>
<i>led by cameraman Jacky Poon</i>

570
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,560
<i>is about to experience</i>
<i>first-hand how large</i>
<i>these wild reserves are.</i>

571
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,520
People sort of nodded
when we said we were looking
for wild snow leopards.

572
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,960
They nodded "yeah sure"
with red-crowned cranes.

573
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,120
<i>The monkeys "no problem,"</i>

574
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,360
<i>but when we said</i>
<i>we wanted to film pandas,</i>

575
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,960
<i>everybody sort of had</i>
<i>a slight intake of breath,</i>

576
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,200
and wanted to assure us that
that was not going to be easy.

577
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,120
<i>Pandas live in the most remote,</i>

578
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,320
<i>thickest, densest, highest</i>
<i>sort of habitats you</i>
<i>could hope to find,</i>

579
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,800
<i>and to track down a panda</i>
<i>really takes a lot of</i>
<i>perseverance</i>

580
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,960
and a lot of luck.

581
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
NARRATOR: <i>At the last</i>
<i>official count,</i>

582
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,000
<i>there were nearly 2,000 pandas</i>
<i>living in the wild,</i>

583
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,640
<i>almost 20% more</i>
<i>than a decade ago.</i>

584
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,080
<i>Although locating them</i>
<i>remains extremely hard,</i>

585
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,640
<i>Jacky and the team</i>
<i>are determined to film</i>

586
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,760
<i>the country's</i>
<i>most iconic creature.</i>

587
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,560
PAUL: <i>Going to try</i>
<i>and find pandas is</i>
<i>physically very tough.</i>

588
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,760
They live on mountain sides
that are kind of vertical.

589
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,360
<i>And at the sort of altitudes</i>

590
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,320
<i>where oxygen</i>
<i>is noticeably thin,</i>

591
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,880
<i>so actually</i>
<i>getting your breath</i>
<i>is quite difficult.</i>

592
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,200
<i>Add to that, in the times</i>
<i>that you might meet them,</i>

593
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,760
<i>it can be very cold</i>
<i>in those habitats.</i>

594
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,240
Big snow storms,
freezing weather can
come in at any time,

595
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,200
and you're pretty exposed
on those mountains
and you're likely to be cut off.

596
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,960
JACKY: <i>The terrain</i>
<i>is extremely difficult.</i>

597
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,240
<i>What we have to do</i>
<i>is ascend from camp</i>

598
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,040
<i>every single day</i>
<i>to go into a hide,</i>

599
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,400
<i>waiting for a panda</i>
<i>to approach us.</i>

600
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,920
<i>And there's essentially</i>
<i>no path, no trails,</i>

601
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
<i>we have to make our own</i>
<i>trails to look for pandas.</i>

602
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,680
<i>It just makes</i>
<i>the whole operation</i>
<i>extremely hard.</i>

603
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,120
NARRATOR: <i>The only way</i>
<i>Jacky can haul himself up</i>

604
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,960
<i>is to grab the sharp bamboo.</i>

605
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,320
<i>So he has to wear gloves</i>
<i>to prevent his hands</i>
<i>from being cut open.</i>

606
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
<i>He climbs this route</i>
<i>every morning at first light</i>
<i>to reach a filming hide</i>

607
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,480
<i>placed in the only clearing</i>
<i>he can find.</i>

608
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,880
<i>It's over 10,000 feet</i>
<i>above sea level,</i>

609
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,760
<i>higher than the Appalachians.</i>

610
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,160
<i>Today on the way up,</i>

611
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,720
<i>he discovers a tunnel</i>
<i>in the bamboo.</i>

612
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,520
<i>These paths can only</i>
<i>be made by pandas.</i>

613
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,800
JACKY: These are
scratch marks by pandas.

614
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,600
And...

615
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,360
you can see here there's
also some fresh droppings.

616
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,080
NARRATOR:
<i>Moments later,</i>
<i>further signs.</i>

617
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,680
So we've got panda's poo
three to four days old.

618
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,960
NARRATOR:<i> Exciting news</i>
<i>for the team.</i>

619
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
<i>Pandas are definitely here.</i>

620
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,200
<i>But even with</i>
<i>promising signs</i>
<i>on the ground,</i>

621
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
<i>the ever-changing weather</i>
<i>is not helping filming.</i>

622
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,640
<i>Visibility is reduced</i>
<i>to less than 30 feet.</i>

623
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,600
JACKY: I've got here
five hours ago
this morning, early.

624
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,040
And I've been sitting
in a hide, looking,

625
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,680
to hopefully spot a panda
and be able to film it.

626
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,680
It's proving to be very
difficult though,

627
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,160
especially with the weather
condition now.

628
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,000
Filming pandas
in these conditions
is almost impossible.

629

Where are you?

641

Almost May.

642
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,080
It's meant to be like
20 degrees Celsius.

643
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Oh, gosh.

648
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,240
Still waiting.

649

NARRATOR: <i>A month passes</i>
<i>without a single sighting.</i>

650
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,480
Yeah, it's quite frustrating,
to be honest.

651
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,320
I guess this is wildlife
film-making.

652
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,480
You get lucky or you don't.

653

654
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Yeah.

<i>They relocate</i>
<i>as fast as possible.</i>

660
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,440
<i>And sure enough,</i>
<i>hidden amongst the greenery.</i>

661
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
(WHISPERING)
We are finally
able to film

662
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,600
a panda in a wild environment.

663
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,720
NARRATOR: <i>Amongst</i>
<i>the thick undergrowth,</i>
<i>a very special bear.</i>

664
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
<i>Still remarkably rare to see,</i>

665
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,120
<i>China is working tirelessly</i>
<i>to increase their numbers.</i>

666
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
<i>This panda, the next step</i>
<i>in that success story.</i>

667
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,920
PAUL: <i>A panda bear</i>
<i>is really special</i>

668
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,720
<i>in so far as they're</i>
<i>probably the most iconic</i>

669
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,160
endangered species that we have.

670
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,400
<i>If you preserve the panda,</i>

671
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,440
<i>you preserve these</i>
<i>amazing forests over</i>
<i>huge swathes of China.</i>

672
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,720
<i>And with the panda,</i>
<i>all the species that</i>
<i>are in those forests.</i>

673
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,360
<i>So it seems only right</i>
<i>that these wonderful,</i>

674
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,400
<i>remarkable, amazing animals</i>

675
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,840
<i>are guaranteed a place</i>
<i>by our conservation efforts.</i>

676
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,000
NARRATOR: <i>As summer</i>

<i>Ya Ya and Mei Mei venture out.</i>

678
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
<i>The main thrust of our story</i>

679
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,040
<i>is the first year</i>
<i>of that baby panda's life.</i>

680
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,880
And to witness the really
very special relationship

681
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,280
<i>that mother panda bears</i>
<i>have with their cubs.</i>

682
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,720
NARRATOR:
<i>As Mei Mei grows up,</i>

683
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,080
<i>the crew follow her adventures.</i>

684
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
Panda bear mothers
and cubs have a...

685
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,720
I think genuinely
unique relationship.

686
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,800
<i>I've never filmed an animal</i>
<i>where the bond seems as strong</i>

687
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,520
as between
a mother panda bear
and her cub.

688
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,560
<i>And it's a really fun bond.</i>

689
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,440
<i>Mum really seems to see her cub</i>
<i>as this fantastic play partner,</i>

690
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,960
<i>and sometimes,</i>
<i>I have to say,</i>

691
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,120
<i>almost seems to</i>
<i>treat it as this toy.</i>

692
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,400
The cubs for their part,
are incredibly boisterous,

693
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
<i>very roly-poly.</i>

694
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,640
<i>They get into</i>
<i>all sorts of trouble.</i>

695
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,720
<i>And the incredible thing</i>
<i>about a panda is</i>

696
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,120
<i>it seems to be able to</i>
<i>fall huge distances,</i>

697
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,120
<i>to roll into rocks,</i>
<i>to bounce off trees,</i>

698
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,160
<i>and it's almost like</i>
<i>they're made of rubber,</i>

699
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,680
<i>there's a little</i>
<i>moment of shock,</i>

700
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,040
<i>and then they're straight</i>
<i>back into the play.</i>

701
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,320
<i>I just think that's a...</i>
<i>that's a wonderful thing</i>
<i>about pandas.</i>

702
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,280
We've been filming panda cubs
since the beginning,

703
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,680
since they were really young,

704
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,320
<i>and follow their livelihood</i>
<i>until they are grown up.</i>

705
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,080
<i>So you know</i>
<i>every part we've seen,</i>

706
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,280
<i>every part we've filmed</i>

707
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,680
<i>is always ultimately</i>
<i>we get an "ahh" out of it.</i>

708
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,880
<i>They are pandas.</i>

709
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,240
<i>They are just beautiful,</i>
<i>cuddly and adorable.</i>

710
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,840
I think it's hard not to
look at a mother animal

711
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,200
<i>to see the sheer effort</i>

712
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,720
she puts in to
bringing up her young

713
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,520
and to not feel a little bit
of that care yourself.

714
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,880
<i>So if by showing these</i>
<i>species' first year</i>

715
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,120
<i>in their journey</i>
<i>towards adulthood,</i>

716
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,960
we make people care a little bit
about them as individuals

717
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,240
and hence care about
the species as a population,

718
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,880
<i>then it won't be a bad thing.</i>

<i>than a human's.</i>

732

<i>The goshawk is capable of</i>
<i>tucking in its wings</i>
<i>during flight</i>

740
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,760

<i>to preserving the wetlands</i>

Now that's important
for the cranes,

<i>Because having big cities</i>
<i>is important,</i>

952
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,000
Oh, you are like
the cutest thing.

953
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,160
That is just the sweetest thing
you could ever possibly see.

954
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,880
It happens so quickly,

955
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,400
and it's not necessarily
in the right setting,

956
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,960
so getting
all of the things right

957
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,520
to capture it is really hard.

958
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,080
You might, you know,
we're starting to see it now,

959
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,640
but actually
getting it on camera
is a whole different story.

960
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,400
Not a good angle and there's
lots of scruffy vegetation.

961
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,360
It needs to be more attractive
and a better camera angle
would be good.

962
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,200
It's not really working
because we are too close.

963
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,160
I wasn't fast enough.

964
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,000
NARRATOR: <i>Finally,</i>
<i>it all clicks into place</i>

965
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,920
<i>and the team capture</i>
<i>the monkeys walking</i>
<i>on two feet.</i>

966
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,240
It was definitely a moment,
the best bit is the mum
with the baby attached to her.

967
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,440
Running along.
There's another one.

968
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,240
That one in the back.

969
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,640
(HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING)

970
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,480
NARRATOR: <i>It's been</i>
<i>a very successful year</i>
<i>for the monkey team,</i>

971
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,600
<i>full of fond memories</i>
<i>thanks to these amazing</i>
<i>wild primates.</i>

972
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,840
A bit of warmth and the monkeys
are just so much more

973
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,960
relaxed and happy.

974
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,000
NARRATOR: <i>And just before</i>
<i>the crew up pack up,</i>

975
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,280
<i>a bonus.</i>

976
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,240
JUSTIN: <i>We had one</i>
<i>that particularly liked</i>
<i>doing back flips</i>

977
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,440
<i>I mean he doesn't need to do</i>
<i>back flips, but...</i>

978
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,440
obviously doing it for fun,
I can't think what other reason.

979
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,800
Oh, my goodness.

980
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,520
<i>JUSTIN: We were</i>
<i>very privileged</i>
<i>to be spending time</i>

981
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,120
with these animals
which are very habituated.

982
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,800
<i>They knew us,</i>
<i>each crew member</i>
<i>as individuals.</i>

983
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,480
<i>And they were cheeky at times.</i>

984
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,520
<i>They would jump</i>
<i>onto the camera,</i>

985
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,320
<i>and push bits or want to</i>
<i>interact with us,</i>

986
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,320
<i>and mostly we were</i>
<i>trying not to distract</i>
<i>them in any way,</i>

987
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,040
<i>you know we wanted to observe</i>
<i>purely natural behavior.</i>

988
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,960
But I loved the moments
when they were engaged with us

989
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,400
and wanted to be
engaged with us.

990
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,640
I'm not quite happy
with the position
of my camera flag.

991
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,040
JESS: <i>It's really hard to pick</i>
<i>a favorite moment with</i>
<i>the golden snub-nosed monkeys</i>

992
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,560
because there were so many.

993
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,040
<i>The thing I found</i>
<i>probably the most</i>
<i>entertaining about them</i>

994
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,160
<i>was the youngsters,</i>
<i>they just love to play so much</i>

995
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:32,440
<i>and they would often come</i>
<i>and play near us and jump</i>
<i>on the camera bags,</i>

996
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,320
<i>and the camera and us.</i>

997
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,560
<i>And I could just sit</i>
<i>and watch them for hours.</i>

998
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,360
<i>Those were my favorite times.</i>

999
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,560
(MONKEYS CHIRPING)

1000
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,080
NARRATOR:
<i>The filming of</i> Born In China
<i>is a remarkable achievement.</i>

1001
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,480
<i>Teams of experienced</i>
<i>international crews</i>

1002
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>often working in little</i>
<i>explored corners of</i>
<i>this amazing country,</i>

1003
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,840
<i>successfully filmed</i>
<i>rare endangered animals</i>
<i>and landscapes.</i>

1004
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,240
<i>Tao Tao survived</i>
<i>being pushed out,</i>

1005
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,160
<i>returning happily to grow up</i>
<i>with his sister and his family.</i>

1006
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,480
<i>The crane family completed</i>
<i>their journey south.</i>

1007
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,560
<i>Once again, the chiru herds</i>
<i>set off on the highest</i>
<i>mammal migration on Earth.</i>

1008
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,240
<i>And Mei Mei, finally,</i>
<i>grew strong enough</i>
<i>to branch out</i>

1009
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,640
<i>on her own.</i>

1010
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,000
<i>These expeditions</i>
<i>revealed a country</i>

1011
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,600
<i>working to preserve</i>
<i>its wildlife and habitats,</i>

1012
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,760
<i>and those striving</i>
<i>to make it happen.</i>

1013
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,760
The people we've met

1014
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,920
in the areas that we've been
filming have been really
wonderful and helpful.

1015
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,800
<i>Of course, we've needed</i>
<i>their help with bags,</i>

1016
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,320
<i>just the sheer amount of kit.</i>

1017
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,240
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>we've needed their expertise.</i>

1018
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,360
<i>They know those</i>
<i>animals so well.</i>

1019
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,080
<i>They can spot</i>
<i>an animal at distances</i>

1020
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,360
<i>that frankly I couldn't see</i>
<i>an animal through</i>
<i>binoculars at.</i>

1021
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,200
We were really lucky to find
some brilliant local crew.

1022
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,040
<i>They were absolutely</i>
<i>instrumental</i>

1023
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,640
to the footage that
we were able to capture.

1024
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,480
<i>Without them, we just</i>
<i>wouldn't have been able</i>
<i>to do what we've done.</i>

1025
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,440
We could not have
achieved what we've done
without the local support.

1026
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,280
In fact, we wouldn't
have achieved it.

1027
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,760
NARRATOR:
<i>During the filming of</i>
Born In China<i>,</i>

1028
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,320
<i>the team spent 1,000</i>
<i>filming days in the country.</i>

1029
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,720
<i>Alongside the biggest human</i>
<i>population on the planet,</i>

1030
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,440
<i>they filmed vast</i>
<i>remote habitats.</i>

1031
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,080
<i>Home to rare creatures</i>
<i>unfamiliar inside the country,</i>

1032
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,800
<i>let alone to</i>
<i>the rest of the world.</i>

1033
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,360
<i>The expeditions have opened</i>
<i>a window onto the rarely seen</i>

1034
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,200
<i>animals of China.</i>
