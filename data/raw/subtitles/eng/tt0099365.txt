1
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,820
'Cause he's an asshole!
Tell him no.

2
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,281
Tell him no, too.

3
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,117
Him, tell, "Fuck you."

4
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,786
No, I'll be here a minute.

5
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,164
Got some guy coming up who thinks he's
gonna muscle me out of my property.

6
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,917
What's it matter?
Just another tough guy, that's all.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,168
They're driving up.

8
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,087
Get their pieces.

9
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,422
All right, guys,
let's go.

10
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,512
We got a surprise
for these gentlemen.

11
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,369
<i>Robert Durant, you and your
girls are going to stand for a search.</i>

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,880
- All right, move it.
- There you go.

13
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,968
Oh, a bunch of
cuties, huh?

14
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,762
Just hold it there,
cueball.

15
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,810
Bum leg?

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,775
No leg.

17
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,569
I was engaged to a girl
once with a wooden leg.

18
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,154
Yeah?
What happened?

19
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,864
Had to break it off.

20
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,452
All right, cut the crap!

21
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,330
I got three things
to say to you, Durant.

22
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,041
One, I ain't selling
my property.

23
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:32,963
Two, nobody muscles Eddie Black,
especially a bunch of dinks.

24
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,886
And three, if y'alls don't like that,
which I can already see you don't,

25
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,597
we can cut your balls off.

26
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,101
Maybe that would be
more satisfactorys to you.

27
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,108
Die!

28
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,744
Take them down!

29
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:19,093
Take him down! Take that
one with the goddamn gun!

30
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:01,844
Now,

31
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,638
let's consider my points

32
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,933
one by one.

33
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,061
One,

34
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,734
I try not to let my anger
get the better of me.

35
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,738
Two,

36
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,115
I don't always succeed.

37
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,578
Three.

38
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,623
I've got seven more points.

39
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,516
<i>System ready to receive input.</i>

40
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,667
Just hold together,
you little...

41
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,002
Shit.

42
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,129
Fragmentation. Time?

43
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,007
Ninety-nine minutes.

44
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,425
Again.

45
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,011
Why?

46
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,889
Why, why, why?

47
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,726
<i>Synthetic
skin data analysis...</i>

48
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,648
What is destabilizing it?

49
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,442
Why won't
the liquid skin last?

50
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,491
The vivification process
was easy.

51
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,326
Tissue rejection?

52
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,664
We licked that.
I know we're close.

53
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,041
We're smart guys,
so what is it?

54
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,003
Why can't we
make these cells stable?

55
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,636
What now?

56
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,015
Now?

57
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,642
Well...

58
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,853
We think it out again.

59
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,564
Patiently. Objectively.

60
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,734
I don't care
how long it takes, Yakitito,

61
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,403
I know it's out there
waiting for us.

62
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,155
Ah, I can feel it.

63
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,615
God, I can almost taste it.

64
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,250
Here she is,
the girl of your dreams.

65
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,918
Oh! Oh, Peyton!

66
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,587
Ah, you were sweet.

67
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,547
How's the skin coming?

68
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,968
Still won't last
past 99.

69
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,098
It'll happen. It will
happen, you know.

70
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,808
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

71
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,686
Look at you.

72
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,521
Rebel without a clue.

73
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,523
Those were the days.

74
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,442
Hey...

75
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,902
What?

76
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,070
Come here.

77
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,031
What?
Come here.

78
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,699
Oh, I know
what's on your mind.

79
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,826
Let me
show you something.

80
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,290
God, you always wear things
that are so difficult to...

81
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,416
Ta-da!

82
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,793
Oh, yeah!

83
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,171
Come on, let's dance.

84
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,778
Herb Gorson, please.

85
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,657
Here you go, babe.
Peyton!

86
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,158
Oops. Sorry.

87
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,701
<i>Hello?</i>

88
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,495
Herb, hi.
It's Julie Hastings.

89
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,666
Listen, I found some memos when I was
researching the Von Hoffenstein deal

90
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,209
that I don't think
I was supposed to find.

91
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,293
<i>Yeah?
What are they?</i>

92
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:13,257
They're from Strack to a guy
named Claude Bellasarious.

93
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,261
And they're records of payments to
various people on the Zoning Commission.

94
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,138
Well, I think
they're payoffs.

95
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,807
<i>If it's an accusation,
you better be sure.</i>

96
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,059
Yeah, well, what I want to
do is talk to Strack first,

97
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,603
give him the benefit
of the doubt.

98
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,565
Yeah, okay.
<i>Call me.</i>

99
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,275
All right, I'll talk
to you later, Herb. Bye.

100
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,734
Bye, Herb.

101
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,154
Oh, I don't want to go.

102
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,239
Don't go.
Don't go.

103
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,824
I have to go.
Stay. Stay.

104
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,159
I have to go now! I have to go now.
I'm late.

105
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,286
Julie!

106
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,538
I'll call you... later.

107
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,712
Julie!
Julie, wait.

108
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,046
What is it?

109
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,549
I've been thinking.

110
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,303
We should get married.

111
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,180
Marriage?

112
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,765
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

113
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,893
I've just started getting
things going at the firm,

114
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,978
and I really like
having my own place.

115
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,564
But we're practically
living together now.

116
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,902
All marriage means is you answer
the phone in the morning,

117
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,738
and if it's my grandmother, you don't
pretend it's the wrong number.

118
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,907
The poor woman's beginning to
think she has Alzheimer's.

119
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,242
I can't talk
about it now.

120
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,660
Come here.

121
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,663
Jules, I'm asking you
to marry me.

122
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,415
Peyt, I love you...

123
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,791
I mean,
I realized...

124
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,127
...but I got to
think it over, okay?

125
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,935
Mr. Strack, I've been
going over some documents.

126
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,105
And I've come across
something that puzzles me.

127
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:56,151
It's a memo from your office
to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious.

128
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,321
It details
certain payments that...

129
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,406
Yes, yes.
I know the memo.

130
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,283
Well, it seems
like the payments were...

131
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,286
Were payoffs
to the Zoning Commission,

132
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,997
bribes,
to call a spade a spade.

133
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,916
Does that shock you?

134
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,793
No. I guessed as much.

135
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:17,089
You weren't supposed to know about it.
That file was not supposed to circulate.

136
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,217
However, I am asking you
to understand.

137
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,222
Take a look
at that model, Julie.

138
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,973
That's the dream.

139
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,976
Acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay.

140
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,938
Thousands of jobs created.

141
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:38,068
A building block, a very large
building block laid for the future.

142
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,738
Not such a bad dream,
as dreams go.

143
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:47,911
And if the price of realizing that dream
is the occasional distasteful chore,

144
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,749
well, I don't run away.
I say, "So be it."

145
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,377
So...

146
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,505
Want to book me?

147
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:03,844
The fact remains that I'm in possession
of evidence of the commission of a crime.

148
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:08,140
Well, let me suggest this. You
excuse yourself for a few minutes,

149
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,059
go to the ladies' room
leaving your briefcase here.

150
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,271
What happens to that memorandum
while it's in my custody

151
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,481
is my responsibility.

152
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:22,446
I wish it were that simple, but first
of all, I don't have the memo with me.

153
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,824
I'm trying to protect you.

154
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,788
Does the name Robert Durant
mean anything to you?

155
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,875
Drugs, racketeering...

156
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,543
And real estate.

157
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,255
Robert Durant is a competitor
for the riverfront.

158
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,091
He's a very dangerous
man, Julie.

159
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:47,512
And I fully believe he'd do anything
to get his hands on that document.

160
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,896
DNA content, acceptable.
Glucose, right on.

161
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,858
We've even checked the collagen congeners.
They're fine.

162
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,069
This is unbelievable. Every day,
it's a different combination...

163
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,695
Time, Yakitito.

164
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,655
Time?

165
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,574
Ninety-eight minutes.

166
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,622
Oh, the circuit again.
I'll fix it.

167
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,665
I knew we were pulling
too much juice on that line.

168
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,292
Yakitito, time?

169
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,128
Huh?
Time?

170
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,839
Ninety-nine.

171
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,674
One hundred minutes!

172
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,551
What? What?

173
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,554
The cells, they're holding.
They're stable!

174
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,681
But, Dr. Westlake,
why now?

175
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,393
The dark.

176
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,270
Oh, of course.

177
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,105
The dark.

178
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,109
I think the synthetic cells
are photosensitive.

179
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,069
This is unbelievable!

180
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,530
What is it about
the dark?

181
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,867
What secret does it hold?

182
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,788
They're still stable.

183
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,289
Time, Yakitito, time?

184
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,874
101 minutes.

185
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,003
Finally. We can replace
damaged skin tissue!

186
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,423
No, Yakitito, no. Not quite, my friend.
Not yet.

187
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,593
All we've got is a piece of the puzzle.
There's still the big question.

188
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,805
How to keep the cells stable
past 99 minutes in the light?

189
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,141
But at least now we know
it's all about light!

190
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,893
I'll get it.

191
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,891
No foolish heroics,
if you please.

192
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,228
We've come
only for documents.

193
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,397
Tell us where to find
the Bellasarious memorandum,

194
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,443
and we shall disappear, like a
nightmare before the breaking day.

195
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,363
I don't know
what you're talking about.

196
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,865
How unfortunate.

197
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,325
What memorandum?

198
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,036
No. Please.

199
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,345
We want the memorandum.

200
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,599
Should your houseboy's
predicament not jog your memory,

201
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,478
you may bid him Godspeed.

202
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,606
He's a lab assistant. For
God's sakes, let him breathe!

203
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,275
You heard the doctor.
Ventilate him.

204
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,736
No. No!

205
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,677
- Bingo.
- Goody!

206
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,022
Bring the Asian's fingers.

207
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,860
Gentlemen.

208
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,737
Rick, I'm proud of you.

209
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,531
Clean through the brain,
that's how I like it.

210
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,361
"Marry me?"

211
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,810
Didn't see you doing
much work out there.

212
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,646
That guy got blown to pieces.
All they found was an ear.

213
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,024
Tiny little piece. Didn't
take me long to bury that.

214
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:38,006
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

215
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,738
I'm gonna
need some sponges.

216
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,906
Okay.
You got them.

217
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,408
Great. We'll get ready
to move him?

218
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,202
Let's check
the eyes.

219
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,245
Get a gurney in here.

220
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,747
Right there.

221
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,874
Straight in.

222
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,337
<i>Next, we have a 30, 35-year-old
male, no ID, no medical history.</i>

223
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,839
He was found on the riverbank
just south of the city.

224
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,717
There's a sizeable population of
homeless and indigents there.

225
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,220
We get at least three
no-names like him every week.

226
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,638
Nobody does anything
about the homeless

227
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,891
until they become train wrecks
like Mr. John Doe here.

228
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,685
He's got burns covering
over 40% of his body.

229
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,021
The hands and face
are the most severe.

230
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,982
Ten years ago, pain from the burns
would have been intolerable.

231
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,611
This man would have spent the
rest of his life screaming.

232
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,948
Now we use
the Rangeberitz Technique.

233
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,119
Quite simply, we sever the nerves
within the spino-thalamic tract, there,

234
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,788
which, as you know,
transmits neural impulses

235
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,624
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain.

236
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,711
No longer receiving
impulses of pain,

237
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,798
you stick him with a pin...

238
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,343
Ouch!

239
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,428
And he can't even
feel it.

240
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,559
As in many
radical procedures,

241
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,604
there are serious side
effects to this operation.

242
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:22,568
When the body ceases to feel, when
so much sensory input is lost,

243
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,445
the mind grows hungry.

244
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:30,994
Starved of its regular diet of input, it
takes the only remaining stimulation it has,

245
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,664
the emotions,
and amplifies them,

246
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,208
giving rise to
alienation and loneliness.

247
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,294
Uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon.

248
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,422
Now surges of adrenaline flow
unchecked through the body and brain,

249
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,426
giving him augmented strength.
Hence, the restraints.

250
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,471
Naturally, we give them
every chance of recovery.

251
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,974
Remain optimistic,
inspire confidence,

252
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,060
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential.

253
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,903
Personally, I give him
a nine on the buzzard scale.

254
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,055
<i>Code blue, burn unit.</i>

255
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,558
Doctor?

256
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,063
I'm in charge here.
Damn it, let me through!

257
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,798
Julie.

258
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,226
Julie!

259
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,186
It's...

260
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,439
...me!

261
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,672
My lab.

262
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,386
All my work.

263
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,111
Oh, my God, no.

264
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,654
No! No!

265
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,323
No! No! No!

266
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,018
Hello, my friend.

267
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,324
Home.

268
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,264

00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,795
Yes.

281
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:23,048
Quadrants. Quadrants.

Yes, that's it.
Clever, clever.

285
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,832
I must perfect the skin.

286
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:14,517
Wrong!

287
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,684
Wrong!

288
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,778
My hands.

289
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,074
They took...
They took my hands.

290
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,632
They... They took...
They took my hands!

291
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,070
Thank you for coming.

292
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,200
Julie, with what you've been
going through lately,

293
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,952
I... I haven't wanted
to bother you.

294
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,164
But I have to know whether
you've come to a decision

295
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,833
regarding
the Bellasarious memorandum.

296
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,753
The decision's been made
for both of us.

297
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,464
The papers were destroyed
in the fire.

298
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:13,469
And I'd rather not talk about
it, if you don't mind.

299
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,808
Julie, I'm sorry
I mentioned that.

300
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:24,146
Believe me, I understand
how you feel. I really do.

301
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,942
Unfortunately, there's
no cure for grief.

302
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,986
But there is something
that eases the symptoms.

303
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,821
It's called dancing.

304
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,392
Would you like a martini?

305
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,852
Yes. I would love one.

306
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,368
<i>Ventilate him.</i>

307
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:57,448

told you where they make the pickup!

308
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,243
Oh, God! Don't!

309
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,704

I know you did.

you didn't!

312
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,193

is, and he is hot. I mean really hot.

Hey, Mr. Durant.
I must've overslept.

340
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,846
I'm sorry. I guess
I missed the pickup, huh?

341
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,182
Where's the money, Pauly?

342
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,935

Well, that explains
his disappearance.

347

Mr. Durant, I didn't make the pickup.

355
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,250
Oh, God. What have I become?
What have I become?

356
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,011
Please.

357
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,811
Hold. Please hold.

358
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,401
Oh, just this once.

359
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,762
What?

360
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,098
What am I?

361
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,019
What am I?

362
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:51,106
Some kind of a circus freak?
Is that it?

363
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,610
Is that it? Huh?
Some kind of freak?

364
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,822
Maybe I should wearing a funny
little hat. Do you like it?

365
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,282
Yeah? Yeah?

366
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,492
<i>See the dancing freak</i>

367
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,119
<i>Pay five bucks</i>

368
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,454
<i>To see the dancing freak</i>

369
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,123
<i>Only five bucks</i>

370
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,626
<i>To see the dancing freak</i>

371
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,628
<i>Just five bucks</i>

372
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,814
I'll give you a show!

373
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,692
I'll give you a goddamn show!

374
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,444
Yeah!

375
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,988
I'll show you
who's a freak!

376
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,838
Oh, God.

377
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:58,923
Oh, Jesus, God.

378
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,344
Oh, keep a lid on it!

379
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,431
I'm a scientist.
That's it.

380
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,184
Think objectively.

381
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,020
Analyze. Analyze.

382
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,856
Wait. Wait. That's it.

383
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,691
Control the rage.

384
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,819
Just... take it easy, Peyton.

385
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,322
Just take it easy, boy.

386
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,033
I'm a scientist.

387
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,452
I'm a scientist.

388
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,704
<i>Reconstruction program...</i>

389
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,377
<i>Reconstruction program
complete.</i>

390
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,687
Julie.

391
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,276
No.

392
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,655
It's all right, Julie.
It's me, sweetheart.

393
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,032
No.

394
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:51,035
Please, Julie, please. Don't be afraid.
Listen to me.

395
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,663
Who are you?

396
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,791
It's me. Peyton.

397
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,003
You are dead.

398
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,006
No, no, Jules. No.

399
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:07,927
I was in the hospital.
A coma. Dead to the world.

400
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,805
Jules, please.

401
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,394
Please. Please hold me.

402
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,190
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

403
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:23,193
I'm sorry. I didn't
know how to tell you.

404
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,404
I needed to see you.

405
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:29,073
I needed to know if things
could be the same.

406
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,075
Yes. But, Peyton,
I don't understand.

407
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,955
I know it's a shock. Well,
Julie, there's so much to it.

408
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,959
And I'll tell you everything.
I just need a little time.

409
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,962
Then just hold me, Peyton,
and don't let go.

410
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,673
I just... I just need
a little time.

411
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,266
All right, I understand why the doctors
said you shouldn't see me after the coma.

412
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,143
That's their opinion.

413
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,437
What's yours?

414
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:06,402
I've got to have time to work
this out, Julie, on my own.

415
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,197
But where does that
leave us, Peyton?

416
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,161
I don't want to be
without you again.

417
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,623
I need you, too, Jules.
That's why I'm here.

418
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,086
It's just that I've...

419
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,880
I feel like a rag doll all
pieced together, you know.

420
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,924
My insides
are on my outside.

421
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,968
If you could only see
how I feel inside.

422
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,178
I was ashamed. Afraid.

423
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,806
I was afraid that you
wouldn't want me anymore.

424
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,933
Of course I still want you.

425
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,937
Julie...

426
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,523
Julie, what if I was hurt?

427
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,650
Like...
Like horribly scarred.

428
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,068
That you couldn't bear
to look at me anymore,

429
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,697
you couldn't even bear to have me touch you.
What then, huh?

430
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,865
Huh?

431
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,367
I don't know.

432
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,287
Honestly,
I don't know, Peyt.

433
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:03,751
But why do you ask me that? I mean, look at you.
You're fine. And you're back.

434
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,174
Yes. I am back, aren't I?

435
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,426
Just like always.

436
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,273
<i>What the hell
do you want, buddy?</i>

437
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,651
The name isn't "buddy." It's
Durant, Robert G. Durant,

438
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,737
and I wish to speak
to Mr. Guzman.

439
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,363
<i>Okay.</i>
Thank you.

440
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,950
<i>Hey, Rudy, there's some
asshole on the phone for you.</i>

441
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:37,619
<i>Hey, Mr. Durant.</i>

442
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,913
Ah, Rudy.
Pay attention.

443
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:41,706
Don't speak. Listen.

444
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,043
The funds Pauly misappropriated
are beginning to nettle me.

445
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,795
He's caused a serious
cash flow problem.

446
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,506
Did you receive certain monies
from Chinatown today?

447
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,050
<i>No, not today.</i>

448
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,553
Unfortunate. Then we shall
have to call upon Hung Fat.

449
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:59,432
Either he provides
the revenues owed to us,

450
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,310
or he becomes
part of my collection.

451
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,479
It would make
a nice addition.

452
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,939
<i>That's right.</i>

453
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:10,193
<i>You want me to pick you up at your
place tomorrow morning around 8:30?</i>

454
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,488
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

455
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,828
That would be...

456
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:23,706
just fine.

457
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,924
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

458
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,597
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

459
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,978
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

460
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,357
<i>That would be...</i>

461
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,443
Just fine.

462
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:02,120
<i>Would you like a bag
for this, please, buddy?</i>

463
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,622
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

464
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:07,792
<i>Hey, hey,
take it easy, buddy.</i>

465
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,627
<i>My name isn't "buddy."</i>

466
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,713
<i>It's Durant.</i>

467
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,924
<i>Robert G. Durant.</i>

468
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,220
Yes, I'm Robert G. Durant.

469
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,187
Just fine.

470
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,157
Robert.

471
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:26,120
It's so good of you to favor me
with your venerated presence.

472
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,538
The money.

473
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,957
The money?
Yes, Robert.

474
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,211
How I tremble with shame.

475
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,254
I have no money.

476
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,592
How many times
do I have to tell you?

477
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,553
I was nowhere near any
convenience store, you nitwit!

478
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:46,224
Hey, I could barely get them to post bail.
They had the whole thing on video.

479
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,101
Just keep them
out of my hair!

480
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,561
I still need you to
sign those papers.

481
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,230
Hey, where are
you going?

482
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,565
Hong Kong restaurant,
and fast!

483
00:53:56,359 --> 00:54:00,321
White powder no longer flows
in its former volume.

484
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,825
All the members of Tong
languish in poverty.

485
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:08,830
Of all your unworthy servants,
Hung Fat is the most destitute.

486
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:13,751
Even my own miserable slaves
sometimes ignore my wishes

487
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,921
and upset those whom I
cherish most deeply.

488
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:21,592
So, until that shining day,
may it soon come,

489
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:26,472
when I shall once again
honor you with offerings.

490
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,308
Goodbye, Robert.

491
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:32,603
Robert, goodbye.

492
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:57,587
You will provide the revenues owed to
us by the time I finish this cigar.

493
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,132
But, Robert...

494
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,625
Okay, Bob, you win.

495
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,054
Damn! Drive!

496
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:50,723
Can't go no further.
Sorry. It's a parade.

497
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,807
I'll get there myself.

498
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,142
Hey, what about
the fare?

499
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:54,435
Eat it!

500
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,522
Move!

501
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,065
Move it!

502
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,613
Where is he?

503
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,573
Where's who?
Guzman!

504
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,034
I thought he was with you.

505
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,244
Shit!

506
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,672
<i>Dios mío! Qué pasa?</i>

507
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:25,258
There's two of those
son of bitches!

508
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,972
Shoot him!

509
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,515
Shoot him!

510
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:33,891
Which one is Durant?

511
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,309
Not me, him!

512
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:36,727
Shoot him!

513
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,354
Shoot him!

514
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,606
Goddamn it!

515
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,651
Whose little boy are you?

516
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,653
It doesn't matter.

517
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,072
You're dead!

518
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,200
No, no. This one.

519
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,744
Don't just stand there.

520
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,330
Do something!

521
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:05,464
Son of a bitch sets me up with the cops,
and you practically hand him the cash.

522
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,222
<i>Madre mía!</i>

523
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:21,897
Mr. Durant, I'm sorry.

524
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:58,184
<i>Step right up and
take a spin on the amazing...</i>

525
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,083
Come on! One more!

526
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,880
Oh, would you stop looking at that watch?
To hell with time!

527
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,049
Forget about going back
to the hospital, Peyton.

528
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,636
We're going to spend the whole day together.
The whole night.

529
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,681
I'd love to, honey. But you know I can't.
I've got my therapy, Jules.

530
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,433
Oh, Peyton, we need
more time together.

531
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:42,436
Tell me why you're
so uncomfortable with me?

532
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:47,900
All right, Jules.
Listen to me.

533
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:57,201
I got to tell you something
about me, how I've changed.

534
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,412
When I was
in the hospital, I...

535
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,705
See the mutant man,
ladies and gentlemen!

536
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,166
Half man, half beast!

537
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,879
Witness this cruel accident
of science with your own eyes.

538
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,638
Everybody gather around and look closely.
As you can see...

539
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,140
Peyt, what?

540
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,600
Peyton, what is it?

541
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,940
When I was
in the hospital,

542
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,942
was there someone else?

543
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,068
No.

544
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,238
Yes. There was a man
who comforted me,

545
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,115
and I respected him
for his kindness,

546
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,075
but he means
nothing to me.

547
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,037
Oh, Peyt, is that what it was?
Is that what it was, Peyt?

548
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:46,083
God, I love you,
darling!

549
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,419
Oh, it's good
to be back.

550
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,588
Come on,
Julie Hastings,

551
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:55,801
I'm going to win for you the biggest,
fuzziest, pinkest animal doll on that rack.

552
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:57,011
Yes.
And then I got to run.

553
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,095
Sir.

554
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:02,016
You always have to run. Why does it
always have to be so dramatic?

555
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,976
I have my
hospital sessions, Jules.

556
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,021
I'm not a 100% cured yet,
but I soon will be.

557
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,108
Where is this place exactly?

558
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,777
Peyt, I want to be
involved somehow.

559
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,987
Can I at least
take you back there?

560
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,740
No! No. Please, Julie,

561
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,783
I don't want you
to see me there.

562
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:25,331
I don't want you to think of me as
an invalid or some kind of a freak.

563
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,797
The pink
elephant, please.

564
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:37,718
I'm sorry, buddy. It don't count
unless you're behind the line.

565
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,887
I was behind the line.

566
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,388
Not hardly.

567
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,099
I was standing right here
with my girlfriend.

568
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:46,936
Now, the pink elephant,
if you please.

569
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:49,980
No way.

570
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,529
It doesn't matter, Peyton.

571
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:57,905
It matters.

572
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,786
I won a pink elephant
for my girlfriend.

573
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,624
Why don't you
just get lost, pal?

574
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,629
The elephant.

575
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,465
Quickly.

576
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,176
Didn't you hear me,

577
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:21,929
weirdo?

578
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,935
Scram.

579
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,290
Take it! Take it!
No.

580
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,584
Take the fucking elephant!

581
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,964
Please, no!
Forgive me.

582
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,137
Peyton, wait!

583
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,558
Half man and a freak.

584
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:12,229
He's a freak, ladies and
gentlemen, he's a freak.

585
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,814
A freak.

586
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:33,917
Peyt.

587
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,669
Peyton?

588
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:53,103
<i>Synthetic skin data analysis.</i>

589
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:59,943
<i>Amino acid content
equals 64%.</i>

590
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:06,992
<i>Membrane potential
equals 122 megavolts.</i>

591
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:15,876
<i>Destabilization
registering at 99.008.</i>

592
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,216
Why didn't you
tell me, Peyton?

593
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,885
You should
have told me.

594
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:29,056
You should have come to me, Peyt.
You didn't have to lie.

595
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,061
Peyt.

596
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,743
I would have tried
to help you.

597
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,289
I can help you now.

598
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,879
You don't have to hide
from me anymore, Peyt.

599
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,286
Julie.

600
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,580
Louis, we have to talk.

601
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,957
Excellent.
I love to talk.

602
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,375
Brandy?

603
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,543
No.

604
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,753
I'll have one.

605
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:44,423
Fair warning, it's Napoleon,
and it's quite good.

606
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,967
I can't see you anymore.

607
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,388
Honey, take it easy.

608
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,058
As you say, let's...
Let's talk.

609
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:58,896
Louis, you know about Peyton,
the man I was involved with?

610
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,482
Of course.
He's alive.

611
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:02,941
He's back.

612
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,113
I won't be a moment.

613
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,244
Yes?

614
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,874
Not now, Franz,
this is a bad time.

615
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,087
The closing price?

616
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:30,511
I think it's sufficiently
diversified.

617
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,972
Franz, it's immaterial to me
what the market is doing.

618
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,849
I want you to buy.

619
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,018
Ten thousand Krugerrands.

620
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:39,853
Fresh ones.

621
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,031
Yes.
The Bellasarious memorandum.

622
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,952
I'm sorry you had to
find that, Julie.

623
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:58,205
Our relationship didn't need
this further strain.

624
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,708
You burned Peyton's lab.

625
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:04,461
Not me personally.

626
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:09,967
I have an employee who does certain things
for me, unofficially, off the books.

627
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,762
Robert doesn't like
to pay taxes.

628
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:17,933
And now you'll kill me.

629
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,688
Hardly.

630
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,816
You have
nothing on me.

631
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:30,445
You'd find the extremely expensive
police department quite unsympathetic.

632
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:36,159
Julie, consider
the big picture.

633
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,584
Consider what
we're building here.

634
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,934
You and I, we're
building a city.

635
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:05,230
We can't let anything
get in the way of that.

636
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:10,944
Despite the way
things might appear,

637
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:14,823
you can't pretend that certain
moments haven't passed between us.

638
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,617
We still have that.

639
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,873
If you're not
going to kill me,

640
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,126
I have things to do.

641
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,723
I suppose
this is goodbye then.

642
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:55,572
Send Robert in.

643
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:56,698
<i>Yes, Mr. Strack.</i>

644
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:14,341
Robert, I have
good news and bad.

645
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:17,719
Custom dictates that you
render the bad news first.

646
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:22,307
We have a little problem
with Miss Hastings.

647
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:25,352
It appears she has
uncovered our alliance.

648
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:28,355
No problem at all.
And the good news?

649
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,191
Your wife died.

650
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,822
I'm joking, of course.

651
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:41,159
No. The good news is that I know who's
behind our little troubles of late.

652
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:45,872
When you retrieved my memorandum, you
failed to excise the good doctor.

653
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,833
Westlake?

654
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,669
He's extinct.
I saw to it myself.

655
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,797
He's alive.

656
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,217
I don't like
loose ends, Robert.

657
01:08:57,426 --> 01:08:58,760
Finish it.

658
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,303
Where is he?

659
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,389
I believe
we have a guide.

660
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,750
Julie!

661
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,001
Peyton!

662
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,019
Look out!

663
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,107
I think he's out here!

664
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,782
He just went
on the roof!

665
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,580
Julie!

666
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:26,032
Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

667
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:31,371
Hey, Smiley, he went
back into the warehouse, man!

668
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,664
He's in here.

669
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:34,082
This door!

670
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:18,710
<i>System ready

672
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,094
Smiley, is that you?

673
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:32,390
Smiley.

674
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:38,230
Where the hell are you?

675
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:40,732
Close.

676
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,754
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>
Smiley, is that you?

677
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,005
Don't shoot, Smiley!
It's Guzman!

678
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,435
Holy shit.

679
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:02,814
Good shooting.

680
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,117
Come here.

681
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,372
You have been a bad boy.

682
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,128
Set it down.

683
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,005
Set it down!

684
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,925
If I want anything done, I guess
I'll have to do it myself.

685
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,721
Okay, Durant.

686
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,642
I'm going down there
to take care of that...

687
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,063
Take it up! Take it up!

688
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,610
Take it up! Knock him off!

689
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,071
Get him off!

690
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,216
Oh, shit!

691
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:16,221

You're dead!

You're next, Durant!
I'm coming for you!

695
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,106
Shake him.

696
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,223
What the hell was that?
Go after him!

697
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,268
I got him!

698
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:48,688
I got him! I got him!
I got him!

699
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:58,031
Get away!

700
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:07,874
Get back!

701
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,668

703
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,138
Excuse me.

<i>Put down your craft!</i>

01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:47,997
Dip him.

708
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,710
Look out!

709
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,270
Watch it!

710
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:18,319
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

711
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,099
Damn!

712
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:50,894
Hold it steady.

713
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,658
What the hell's
he up to?

714
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:12,707
Kiss your ass goodbye!

715
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,127
No! No!

716
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,470
Burn in hell!

717
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,791
You look
like hell, Robert.

718
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,961
That son of a bitch Westlake
malfunctioned my helicopter.

719
01:19:58,044 --> 01:19:59,879
How terrible for you.

720
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,714
He's a cockroach.

721
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,885
You think you kill him, and
he pops up someplace else.

722
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:08,388
I expect
he'll pop up here soon.

723
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:12,892
See, I know how he thinks.

724
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:19,232
I don't think the world will
grieve over one less attorney.

725
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:31,661
It's the tragedy of my life
that I have to kill the ones I love.

726
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,998
My wife, late wife,
held certain deeds.

727
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:39,711
I sent her on a plane trip
over the Smokies.

728
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,007
Let's just say
I landed on my feet.

729
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,893
I'm glad you survived,
Robert.

730
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:59,772
I'd hate to see your kids
deprived of a role model.

731
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:03,026
They do look up to me.

732
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,112
When I was young,

733
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:08,823
my father made me
work high steel!

734
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,242
Just me and the Indians!

735
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:15,329
No one else crazy enough to run
around up here against the wind!

736
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,540
4.50 an hour!

737
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:22,128
Call me crazy,
sometimes I miss it!

738
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,297
Life on the edge!

739
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:29,802
Five inches wide,
650 feet down!

740
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,355
High steel!

741
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:46,944
Oh, by the way, you don't
have any kids, Robert.

742
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:56,746
You truly are
one ugly son of a bitch.

743
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:01,083
What do you think, Julie?
Who's the real monster here?

744
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,212
I destroy to build
something better.

745
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:11,177
Whereas you, you're a man
who destroys for revenge.

746
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,221
Look.

747
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,473
Look about you.

748
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,392
It's all mine.

749
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,563
Because I built it.

750
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,359
I built it all!

751
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,202
What have you got, besides a little
trouble with your complexion?

752
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:39,163
I'm joking, of course.

753
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,165
A troubled conscience?

754
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:46,587
A little blood on your hands
from what you consider justice?

755
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:47,797
Justice.

756
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,801
You and I know it's just
another word for what I do.

757
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:54,887
We should be
working together.

758
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,639
I could use
a man like you.

759
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:59,142
That's why
I brought you up here.

760
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:05,398
You can make a lot of
money working for me.

761
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:09,110
But if you still want her,
I'll throw in Julie. Sound good?

762
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:11,404
Oops.

763
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:34,927
Pey...

764
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,388
Bitch!

765
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:40,182
Peyton!

766
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,113
There you go!

767
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,994
Julie.

768
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,454
Peyton?

769
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,962
Come on.

770
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:38,157
You're going down,
burn head!

771
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,380
Oh, no!

772
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,423
Help me!

773
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:26,998
In your absence, I've gotten to
know Julie quite intimately.

774
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,834
Her tastes are varied,

775
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,753
but I can tell you this,

776
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:35,214
she doesn't date freaks.

777
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,227
Peyton!

778
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:49,770
Oh!

779
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:51,605
Oh!

780
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,524
Julie!

781
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:26,098
Go ahead. Do it.
Do it, Westlake.

782
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,434
But think of this.

783
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:33,731
You let me die, and you
become as bad as me. Worse.

784
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,068
You can't.

785
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:39,779
I know you too well.

786
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:45,451
Dropping me is not really
an option for you.

787
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,288
It's not something
you could live with.

788
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,550
I'm learning to live
with a lot of things.

789
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,730
Don't look at me.

790
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,357
I want to look.

791
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:35,376
You'll perfect the skin. You'll make
it work. It doesn't matter.

792
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,669
Julie.

793
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:42,842
Don't you think I told myself that,
night after sleepless night?

794
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:46,345
It's just a burn. Skin-deep.
It doesn't matter.

795
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:49,014
And if I covered it,

796
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:51,100
hid behind a mask,

797
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,853
you could love me
for who I was inside.

798
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,063
Without pity.

799
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,568
But a funny thing happened.

800
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,906
As I worked on the mask, I found
the man inside was changing.

801
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:08,325
He became wrong.

802
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:11,328
A monster.

803
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:16,208
I could live with it now,
but nobody else can.

804
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:35,102
I want our life back.

805
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,738
Peyton!

806
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,411
Peyton!

807
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,415
Peyton is gone.

808
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,564
Peyt?

809
01:29:24,944 --> 01:29:25,986
Hey!

810
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,197
<i>I'm everyone.</i>

811
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,241
<i>And no one.</i>

812
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,410
<i>Everywhere.</i>

813
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:35,454
<i>Nowhere.</i>

814
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,499
<i>Call me</i>

815
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,292
<i>Darkman.</i>
