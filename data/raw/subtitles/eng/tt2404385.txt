00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:24,682
(Slow instrumental music)

2
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,689
(Birds chirping)

3
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,721
(Clock ticking)

4
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,211
- Ready?

5
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,393
- Not really.

6
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:44,658
- [Dan] David?

7
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,830
(Slow instrumental music)

8
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,465
- Is that for mom?

9
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,675
(Smoke alarm beeping)

10
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,425
- Breakfast is ready!

11
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,826
Good morning, ladies!

12
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:47,173
Ready for a champion's breakfast?

13
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,506
- Dad, here, no.

14
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:51,552
- Do I have to eat it?

15
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:54,092
- What did this pan ever do to you?

16
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,051
- Ready for some bacon?

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,460
- I don't like bacon.

18
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,293
- What?

19
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,172
- I've never liked bacon.

20
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,475
- Okay we're gonna let
that soak for a minute.

21
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,280
Or maybe like a week (laughs).

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,320
- Come on, hon, it's protein.

23
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,255
- Oh I don't know.

24
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,397
I think you might have
burnt all the protein out.

25
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:12,100
How about a granola bar?

26
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
Yeah?

27
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:13,766
- Yeah.

28
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:16,305
Mr. Oliver loves it.

29
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:19,219
David!

30
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:21,594
Breakfast is ready!

31
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,427
Come on!

32
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,347
You better hurry up if you're gonna

33
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:26,430
drive yourself to school!

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,678
- Are you serious?

35
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:30,511
- Yeah.

36
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:34,718
I wanna know where you are at all times.

37
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:35,801
- Fine, yeah.

38
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,360
- You're responsible for gas.

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,949
- Okay.

40
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,271
- No texting and driving.

41
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,604
- Dad, I got it.

42
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:50,145
- And say thank you daddy
and come give me a big hug.

43
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,922
Fine, no car.

44
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:58,423
Now Hallie, I got something for you.

45
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,868
- Mom's phone?

46
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:02,701
- Mmm hmm.

47
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,350
Now that's just for emergencies.

48
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,783
- Thank you daddy, I love you!

49
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,200
- Oh I love you too, pumpkin.

50
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:13,949
- Father Christmas, do
you have anything for me?

51
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,861
- Well you still marrying that Colton guy?

52
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,464
- Maybe.

53
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,617
- Well, I guess it's time
that you order that dress

54
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,394
you keep babblin' about.

55
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,227
- Really?

56
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,714
Really?

57
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,214
Thank you so much!

58
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:30,681
- You're welcome.

59
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:35,366
Look, I know things have been tough lately

60
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,265
but we can do this.

61
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:41,219
And I promise I'm gonna
take care of everything.

62
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,886
So anybody have anything to say?

63
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,614
- Thank you, daddy.

64
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,135
I love you.

65
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:55,212
- Today's gonna be a good day!

66
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,879
- [Julie] Yes it is.

67
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,669
(Upbeat instrumental music)

68
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,664
(School bell ringing)

69
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:53,305
- She was really special.

70
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:58,332
I know I'm sure gonna miss her.

71
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,891
But I get to have you in my class

72
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,397
and you are just like her.

73
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,880
- Really?

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,713
- Yeah.

75
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,075
You ready?

76
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,499
(Slow instrumental music)

77
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,160
(Birds chirping)

78
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,124
- Alright miss Hallie,
I have you over here

79
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:45,791
next to miss Isabel.

80
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,237
Miss Isabel doesn't
speak very much English

81
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:51,135
and I thought since you
like to talk so much

82
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,052
you two could become great friends.

83
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,699
- I like your shirt.

84
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,449
Yellow's my favorite.

85
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,059
Okay?

86
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:16,976
- Rah!

87
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:19,810
- Hey!

88
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,761
Welcome back!

89
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:21,594
- I missed you.

90
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:22,427
- Yeah.

91
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,976
- So good to be back.

92
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,646
Ah, I cannot wait for 80s workout night.

93
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,007
I have been dying to
get my leg warmers on.

94
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,593
- Yeah.

95
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,345
- Oh, also, I bought my dress

96
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:37,120
so I was kind of hoping you could come

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,759
to the fitting on Saturday.

98
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,086
- Sure, yeah, of course, yeah.

99
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:41,919
- Awesome.

100
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:46,738
So how are you and mister Tony doing?

101
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:48,711
- Tony who?

102
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,752
- I'm really sorry.

103
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:57,517
- Not everyone can be
engaged to mister wonderful.

104
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,587
- I mean Tony is just an idiot, so.

105
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:01,420
- Yeah.

106
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:05,843
And I'm the idiot who fell for him.

107
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:06,676
Come on.

108
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,476
- You have an 8:15
waiting for you in room b.

109
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,426
A root canal at nine.

110
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,356
And Mr. Rinig has called three times

111
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,192
to confirm his appointment.

112
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:19,572
The fluorine is on back order.

113
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,955
Mrs. Black's crown is due in tomorrow.

114
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:25,171
But I rescheduled her for
Wednesday just to be sure.

115
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,504
Then, at 11:15--

116
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,899
- Janine, can I just ah...

117
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,132
- Ah, sign these.

118
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:32,965
- Ah.

119
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,613
- Okay then right here.

120
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:45,438
By the way, welcome back.

121
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:46,438
- Thank you.

122
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,054
- Hey.

123
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:03,872
He didn't cut the crusties off.

124
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,372
How am I supposed to eat this?

125
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,332
What'd you get?

126
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,368
What is that?

127
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,594
Don't you ever talk?

128
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,857
Well whatever it is, it smells weird.

129
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,768
- What's the matter?

130
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,018
You not hungry?

131
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,830
- It's all crusty.

132
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,149
- Oh.

133
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,934
I see, 'cause maybe
your dad doesn't make it

134
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,434
like someone else?

135
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,853
It's amazing how quickly
a poorly made sandwich

136
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:14,179
can ruin your day.

137
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,710
My husband made me a tuna sandwich

138
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,092
and forgot the pickles.

139
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:21,021
I cried and cried for weeks.

140
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,021
I was so mad I could punch a Turkey.

141
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:30,368
But one day, I actually tried it.

142
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,366
And it wasn't so bad.

143
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,340
I missed the pickles.

144
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:38,919
But it was okay.

145
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:45,313
- My dad just doesn't
know how I like stuff.

146
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,563
- I bet your mom did.

147
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:57,490
But she also knew that today was gonna be

148
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,490
really hard.

149
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:04,026
So she wanted me to give you this.

150
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:07,242
(Slow instrumental music)

151
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,659
It's a really special letter.

152
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,538
And it must be very important

153
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,371
because she made me
promise to give it to you.

154
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,124
I'll leave you alone so you can read it.

155
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:25,511
And Hallie, be patient with your dad.

156
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,033
He'll learn.

157
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,808
(Flowing orchestral music)

158
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,435
- Sorry I said your food smells.

159
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,602
You can have some of mine.

160
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,840
My sister put some candy in here

161
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,026
so it's not a total loss.

162
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:28,859
Here.

163
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:33,541
What's the matter, you don't like candy?

164
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,374
Go ahead.

165
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:36,659
Why not?

166
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:41,045
Your mouth hurt?

167
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:43,494
Let me see.

168
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,619
Nope, this doesn't look good at all.

169
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,802
You have a problem with
your lower bicuspid.

170
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,399
I know because my dad's a dentist.

171
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,566
Wait a minute!

172
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,783
- Okay we're about to get started.

173
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:02,728
You comfortable?

174
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:03,561
- Mmm hmm.

175
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,669
- Dr. Benson?

176
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,502
- Yes.

177
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:08,660
- You have a phone call on line two.

178
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,161
- Can you take a message?

179
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:10,994
- It's your daughter.

180
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:13,244
She said it's an emergency.

181
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,527
- I'm sorry.

182
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,027
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

183
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:26,941
- Hallie?

184
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:27,774
- Hey dad?

185
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,047
(Dial tone)

186
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:31,213
- Hallie!

187
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:34,273
(Hallie laughs)

188
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,899
Hallie!

189
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,399
(Phone slams)

190
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,640
- Mr. Benson?

191
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,473
- Hi.

192
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,795
Hallie, is everything okay sweetheart?

193
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,113
- Oh, I'm fine.

194
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,113
It's Isabel.

195
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,028
- Hallie, honey, why don't we walk out

196
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,028
in the hallway and talk?

197
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:00,857
- I'm sorry.

198
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,697
- Okay, let me get this straight.

199
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,548
You called me at work
and had me rush down here

200
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,173
because Isabel had a toothache?

201
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,006
- Yes.

202
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,576
- You said it was an emergency.

203
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:12,754
- Dad, she can't have candy.

204
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,087
This is serious.

205
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,320
- I'll be in my office.

206
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,987
- (Sighs) Okay.

207
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,697
Hallie, what were you thinking?

208
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:27,530
- You're a dentist.

209
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,179
You can help her.

210
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,152
- It doesn't work that way.

211
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:31,985
- Why not?

212
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:36,379
- Because it doesn't, okay?

213
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,568
- What's an immigrant?

214
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,285
- An alien.

215
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,402
- She's an alien?

216
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,735
- No, nevermind.

217
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:48,824
Look, I'm already behind at work as it is.

218
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,142
I can't help her.

219
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:52,975
Okay?

220
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,893
Now I'm gonna have to take your phone.

221
00:14:58,893 --> 00:14:59,726
- What?

222
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:01,685
- Apparently you're too young

223
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:04,021
to know how to use it.

224
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:07,521
(Slow instrumental music)

225
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,331
Thank you.

226
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:21,021
Now go back to class.

227
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,529
(Hallie sighs)

228
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,260
(Man singing indistinctly)

229
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,159
- Alright, Mr. Durham,
they're almost ready for you.

230
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,246
(Mr. Durham laughs)

231
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,325
Looks like that medicine's
working out real good.

232
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,694
(Mr. Durham mumbles)

233
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,609
- Hey we need to talk.

234
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,961
- Yeah.

235
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:54,794
What's up?

236
00:15:58,581 --> 00:15:59,831
- I'm pregnant.

237
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,669
- Oh wow.

238
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:05,014
That's--

239
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,764
- I just thought you should know.

240
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,066
- I'm so sorry.

241
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,059
Umm.

242
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,081
- I gotta go.

243
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:28,455
(Slow instrumental music)

244
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:33,579
(Smoke alarm beeping)

245
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,295
- Hey, sausage is ready!

246
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,690
- No thanks.

247
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,496
- You don't like sausage?

248
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,435
- I love sausage.

249
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:46,435
- Okay then.

250
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,188
- Hey, have you seen my calculator?

251
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:52,021
- [Dan] Nope.

252
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,854
- Mom!

253
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:00,630
- Sausage?

254
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,162
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,079
I gotta go.

256
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:07,878
- I need you here when
Hallie gets off the bus.

257
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,255
I have to work late.

258
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:10,138
- [David] Okay!

259
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,108
- Dad I need help.

260
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,626
My hair's freaking out.

261
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:16,126
- Oh, no baby, it looks great.

262
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,746
Alright, um, want pigtails?

263
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,071
Ponytail?

264
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,224
It's all I got, baby.

265
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:28,336
- It's okay.

266
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,086
I'll just wear a hat.

267
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,400
- Okay.

268
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:43,830
- Morning.

269
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,359
- Morning.

270
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,655
- By the way, that crown I
finished for you yesterday,

271
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:49,980
I noticed a filling was coming loose

272
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,970
so I went ahead and fixed that as well.

273
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,995
- Yeah, great.

274
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:55,510
Good job.

275
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,187
You already told me that, Rick.

276
00:17:57,187 --> 00:17:58,020
- I did?

277
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,853
- Yeah.

278
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:02,103
- Hmm, well, guess we're both slipping.

279
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:08,339
(Dan sighs)

280
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,730
- Hey I'm gonna get lunch.

281
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,506
- Oh, hey would you mind
checking room 26 before you go?

282
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,677
- Yeah.

283
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,510
- Thanks.

284
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,786
- Miss charmer, ima charmer.

285
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:26,914
- Oh dearie, could you
take my blood pressure?

286
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,855
(Laughs)

287
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,343
- No.

288
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,176
- Okay then.

289
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,509
How about lunch?

290
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,649
- I'm sorry but I'm not
allowed to date my patients.

291
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,149
- Ooh, I don't wanna date you.

292
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,913
I wanna marry you.

293
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:47,766
- Well in that case.

294
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,975
- Okay.

295
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,029
- This is pathetic.

296
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,111
- I know.

297
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:54,933
If you only had a more thoughtful fiance.

298
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,781
(Julie laughs)

299
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,781
- Thank you.

300
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,248
- You're welcome.

301
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:06,470
Let's eat.

302
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,303
- Alright.

303
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:10,888
This looks amazing.

304
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,570
- How was the talk last night?

305
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:21,339
- Ah, she yelled a lot.

306
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,236
Then stormed out.

307
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:28,995
I don't know what to tell her.

308
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,662
My mom woulda known.

309
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:36,531
- So what's she gonna do?

310
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,284
- She doesn't know.

311
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,474
You know what's really sad?

312
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,793
Kids are supposed to be this
amazing blessing, you know?

313
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:48,543
Not some consequence.

314
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,243
- Hey, come here.

315
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,717
We're gonna make great parents

316
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:59,550
whenever we have kids.

317
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,184
- Cheers?

318
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:05,017
- Cheers.

319
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:11,149
- Isabel, I've gotta ask you something.

320
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,899
And you can trust me.

321
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,120
Are you really an alien?

322
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,780
(Isabel speaking in a foreign language)

323
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
- I knew it!

324
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,616
Well don't worry.

325
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,249
I'm gonna get your teeth fixed

326
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:29,532
and get you back to your planet.

327
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,449
But first, we gotta stick together.

328
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,464
I know a guy.

329
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:39,194
But it's gonna cost US.

330
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,277
Come with me.

331
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:45,660
(Upbeat instrumental music)

332
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,494
- Step forward.

333
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:51,639
You wanted to see me?

334
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,849
- We hear you're the
guy who can get things.

335
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:54,682
- Yep.

336
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:55,599
What of it?

337
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,572
- We need a cell phone.

338
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,736
- You mean like one of these?

339
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,794
- That's right.

340
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,813
- It's gonna cost you.

341
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:10,220
- We've got string cheese, an apple,

342
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,803
some juice, and a pudding pack.

343
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:17,802
- And?

344
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,633
- We don't have anything else.

345
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,417
- We'll take your shoelaces.

346
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:37,467
(Phone rings)

347
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,523
- Family first dentistry, this is Janine.

348
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,690
- Yes, this is Mrs. Westinghouserston.

349
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:48,615
I have a question about dentistry.

350
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:50,013
- Alright.

351
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:53,652
- Now how much does it
cost to fix a tooth?

352
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:56,587
- Well that depends on the problem.

353
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:59,355
- How much you just yank it out?

354
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,000
- An extraction?

355
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,538
- Yeah.

356
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,986
- Well that really
depends on your coverage.

357
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:06,603
Do you have a plan?

358
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,353
- Oh I've got a plan.

359
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,864
- Then you'll probably just
have to meet your copay.

360
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,579
Do you know what it is?

361
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,354
- No, what is it?

362
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:16,288
- Well hold on.

363
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:17,765
I'll have to look it up.

364
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:20,127
Okay who are you with?

365
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:20,960
- Isabel.

366
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,448
- Ah, I'm sorry, we don't take Isabel.

367
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,438
- But you've got to.

368
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,140
- I'm sorry we don't.

369
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,742
You can pay out of pocket.

370
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:36,992
- Can't I just bring you some money

371
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,569
and you'll fix her teeth?

372
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,130
- That's what I just said.

373
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,047
- Oh, okay.

374
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:44,807
So how much is it?

375
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:48,472
- A simple extraction is 92 dollars.

376
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,889
- Thank you that is all I needed to know.

377
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,883
Wow.

378
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,620
The tooth fairy will
give you money for teeth.

379
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,552
The dentist charges you for them.

380
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,052
That's just wrong.

381
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,505
(Door closes)

382
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:07,988
- Hey dad.

383
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,930
- Well hey, pumpkin.

384
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,180
- How was work?

385
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:16,040
- Exhausting.

386
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,296
They're trying to Bury me in paperwork.

387
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,296
- Same here.

388
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:24,062
- Man, second grade just doesn't let up.

389
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:25,277
- I know, it's only our second day

390
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:27,195
and I had homework.

391
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:29,028
- What's up with that?

392
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:31,256
Did you get it all done?

393
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,089
- Yep.

394
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,051
- Good girl.

395
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:40,335
Well, I got a lot of
homework of my own to do.

396
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,140
- Hey, Dave.

397
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,648
(Computer closes)

398
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,479
- What are you doing in my room?

399
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,312
- I--

400
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,078
- what'd you want?

401
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,332
- Can you use diet soda for cookies?

402
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,165
- What?

403
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:00,712
- We don't have any regular.

404
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:02,038
Will diet work?

405
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:03,859
- Do you even know what you're doing?

406
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,828
- I know how to mix stuff.

407
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:08,284
Mom used to cook with US all the time.

408
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:09,913
- Get outta my room.

409
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,727
- Fine, I won't tell you
about the alien I met.

410
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:13,560
- What?

411
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:16,060
- Her name is Isabel and she's in my class

412
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,894
and I know it's true because dad said so.

413
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:22,375
- Alien means she's from
another country, Einstein.

414
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,659
- You mean she's not from outer space?

415
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:25,635
- No.

416
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,473
She's probably from Mexico or something.

417
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,306
Now get outta my room.

418
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,666
(Door closes)

419
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,833
(Swinging jazz music)

420
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,153
(Hair dryer blowing)

421
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,806
- Dad I'm going out to start my business!

422
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:05,889
- [Dan] Okay!

423
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:08,128
Wait, what?

424
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:15,404
- Well hey there buddy.

425
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:16,780
You want a cookie?

426
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,745
They're for sale.

427
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,556
But I could give you one if you want.

428
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,723
It's good for advertising.

429
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,386
- What are you doing?

430
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:36,502
Did you just give him a cookie?

431
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,192
- He asked for one.

432
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:40,017
- Are those chocolate chip cookies?

433
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:41,380
- Yeah.

434
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,951
- What are you trying to do, kill my dog?

435
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:47,898
Don't you know that
chocolate is poison to dogs?

436
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:48,731
- What?

437
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,383
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,027
- Go on.

439
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:58,128
Take your poison cookies with you.

440
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:58,961
Go on!

441
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,625
(Hallie crying)

442
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:11,812
(Slow instrumental music)

443
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:14,444
- Hey, kiddo.

444
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,041
What's wrong?

445
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,425
- I'm a murderer.

446
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,766
- A what?

447
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:24,900
- I killed a dog.

448
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,335
I'm a stupid murderer kid
and they should lock me up.

449
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:30,670
- Oh.

450
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,636
What happened?

451
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:35,337
- I fed him a poison cookie.

452
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,170
- A what?

453
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:40,503
- It had chocolate and
chocolate is poison to dogs.

454
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:42,170
Mr. Jenkins said so.

455
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:45,517
- Our neighbor Mr. Jenkins?

456
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:46,950
- Yeah.

457
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,783
- Oh.

458
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:49,496
Honey.

459
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,594
Don't worry about it.

460
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,221
He's just a cranky old man.

461
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,055
- What about his dog?

462
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,205
- He'll be fine.

463
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,136
One cookie is not gonna hurt him.

464
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,003
- Are you sure?

465
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:07,836
- Mmm hmm.

466
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,669
Positive.

467
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:14,552
Now, you wanna come help
me clean the kitchen?

468
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:15,385
- No.

469
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:19,805
- Well, you wanna help me anyway?

470
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,141
- Okay.

471
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:21,974
- Okay.

472
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:31,678
(Smoke alarm beeping)

473
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:38,497
- Daddy, I don't feel so good.

474
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,140
- Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

475
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,440
You haven't tried my pancakes yet.

476
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,173
- [David] Ah, dad, Mr.
Oliver threw up again.

477
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:46,022
(Dan sighs)

478
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,939
- It wasn't Mr. Oliver.

479
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:55,955
- Morning.

480
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,322
- Oh, hey Hallie.

481
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:00,700
What are you doing here?

482
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,257
- I threw up.

483
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:03,090
- Oh.

484
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,138
Lovely.

485
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,401
- And your dad brought you here?

486
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,914
- Well she's feeling much better now.

487
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:13,930
I'm just gonna put her in room b.

I love hanging out with the
coolest second grader in town.

- Yes.

542
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:38,455
- So have you eaten anything?

543
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:41,322
- No, can we make pizza?

544
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:44,851
- I was thinking that
we could have a feast

545
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:47,101
of ginger ale and crackers.

546
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:51,976
- Okay, but then can we
watch friends like you?

547
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,842
- Season two or season three?

548

- Making a salad.

554
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:28,631
- You do know that that's a potato, right?

555
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:29,464
- You know what?

556
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:31,315
It's my salad.

557
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,148
- Sorry.

558
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,774
I just really wanna help.

559
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:40,674
- After tomorrow, you won't have to.

560
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:43,636
- Rachel, what are you saying?

561
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,178
- You know what I'm saying.

562
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:47,885
- Rachel, no.

563
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,121
- Julie, it's my life and I'm the one

564
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:54,788
who's gonna have to
live with this decision.

565
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:06,622
- Oh, you didn't have to wait for me.

566
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:10,843
- Why doesn't Rachel wanna have a baby?

567
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,305
- It's a lot of work.

568
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:22,101
- So what is she gonna do?

569
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,351
- I don't know.

570
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,567
- She could give it to someone else.

571
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,051
- She doesn't trust anybody else.

572
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,468
- She trusts you.

573
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,647
You could do it.

574
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:39,257
- It doesn't work like that, sweetie.

575
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:40,090
- Why not?

576
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,133
- It's complicated.

577
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,471
- I think you could do it.

578
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,221
You'd be a great mom.

579
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:55,503
(Slow instrumental music)

580
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:57,219
- Hmm.

581
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:16,615
- So how's that conference, huh?

582
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:18,111
Everything you dreamed it would be?

583
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:19,590
- (Laughs) Gonna mock me?

584
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,153
You know dentists have feelings too.

585
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:24,054
Just sayin'.

586
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:25,564
- That's a good one.

587
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,147
(Julie laughs)

588
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,033
- She feeling any better?

589
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:32,866
- Yeah.

590
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:46,739
- You're so good with her.

591
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,327
- Do you think I'll make a good mom?

592
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:56,124
- You'll be the best.

593
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:03,723
- How did you and mom know you were ready?

594
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:05,556
- I'm still not ready.

595
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,931
Why do you ask?

596
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:12,341
- Rachel's pregnant.

597
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,699
She's gonna have an abortion.

598
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,866
Unless I, umm,

599
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:24,676
what if I took the baby?

600
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,008
- Julie.

601
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:31,688
- You know why can't I?

602
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,188
- Because, I mean,

603
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,135
we can pray that god changes her heart

604
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:41,635
but you're not ready for this.

605
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:47,189
- And what if I'm supposed
to do more than just pray?

606
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,856
- What about Colton?

607
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,699
What about Africa?

608
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:57,728
What's gonna happen to all
of your plans if you do this?

609
00:35:57,728 --> 00:36:01,561
- What's gonna happen
to this baby if I don't?

610
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,727
- I know you wanna do the right thing.

611
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:10,310
But you cannot save every baby.

612
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:13,557
- I can save this one.

613
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:26,172
- You're just like your mom.

614
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:29,324
(Julie laughs)

615
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:31,657
This is a lifelong decision.

616
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:35,342
- I know.

617
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,817
- Well you've got a lot to think about.

618
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:48,305
(Slow instrumental music)

619
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,138
Come here.

620
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,796
- Goodnight.

621
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:02,820
- [Dan] Goodnight sweetheart.

622
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,320
(Slow instrumental music)

623
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,833
- So what if I took it?

624
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,365
- What?

625
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:48,271
- What if I took the baby?

626
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:51,203
- You're serious?

627
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:54,330
- Why not?

628
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:58,495
- What would Colton think?

629
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,176
- I mean I'll talk to him.

630
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:04,676
What do you think?

631
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:10,447
- You'd really go through with it?

632
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,280
- Yeah.

633
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,037
(Knock on door)

634
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,891
- Cinnamon crunch bagel?

635
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:27,224
- No, thank you, I just ate.

636
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,122
Thank you for coming.

637
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:33,256
- Yeah.

638
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:34,339
So what's up?

639
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,780
- So we were talking
last night and well, I,

640
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,452
okay, Rachel was gonna have an abortion,

641
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,450
today unless I did something.

642
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:55,545
- What did you do?

643
00:38:57,013 --> 00:38:59,513
- I told her we could take it.

644
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,789
- Ah, we're not even married yet.

645
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,241
- I know.

646
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,636
I know, I know.

647
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:17,221
I just, I didn't know what else to do.

648
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,732
What was I supposed to do?

649
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:21,948
- Uh, talk to your fiance first?

650
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,698
When did this happen?

651
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,181
- Just last night.

652
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,060
- And you didn't call me?

653
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,062
- Well it was really late.

654
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:31,020
I mean i--

655
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,742
- oh, okay so you agreed to adopt a baby

656
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:37,675
without talking to me because
you didn't wanna wake me?

657
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,841
- I didn't sign anything.

658
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,597
We're talking about it right now.

659
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:45,264
- (Sighs) We can't do this.

660
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,988
- Okay, don't get mad

661
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:52,393
but I really have to go to work.

662
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,485
- Let's talk tonight.

663
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:55,985
- I have a double.

664
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,240
- Forget about tomorrow.

665
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,157
- Tomorrow?

666
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,835
- Premarital counseling?

667
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,979
Remember we talked about it.

668
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,234
- Sorry I wasn't here yesterday.

669
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,151
I was sick.

670
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:36,913
It was just one of those days.

671
00:40:39,742 --> 00:40:41,775
But the good news is I
got a brilliant new idea

672
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,275
to earn the money.

673
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:45,374
Wanna see?

674
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:49,041
(Upbeat instrumental music)

675
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:54,639
I got 'em all for free and
we can totally sell them.

676
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,722
Now I'll raise 92 dollars
and prevent gingivitis.

677
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,833
(Hallie exhales)

678
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:13,738
- Excuse me, sir.

679
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,757
Might I have a moment of your time?

680
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:17,590
- No.

681
00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:21,976
- Are you afraid of tooth decay?

682
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:25,393
Do you want your teeth to look like this?

683
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,118
No, of course you don't.

684
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:31,205
That's why you need a
toothbrush that can scrub

685
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,455
those hard to reach places.

686
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:35,860
- No.

687
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,693
- Please?

688
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:39,101
It's for a really good cause.

689
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,802
- Yeah, like what?

690
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:41,635
- I can't tell you.

691
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:42,588
It's a secret.

692
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:43,838
- Well then no.

693
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:49,798
- Are you getting rid of your flowers?

694
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,928
- Yep.

695
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,928
- But they're beautiful.

696
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,075
- Tell you what kid.

697
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:59,427
You wanna earn some money?

698
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:00,260
- Yeah.

699
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:05,863
- I'll give you a nickel for
every one of these you dig up.

700
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:07,200
- No way.

701
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,283
- Yes I will.

702
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:10,442
- Deal.

703
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:12,072
Can I keep 'em?

704
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,807
- I don't care.

705
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:16,553
- (Gasps) I'm gonna
plant 'em in my backyard

706
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,706
and surprise my dad.

707
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,628
- You do that.

708
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:23,523
Oh he'll be surprised all right.

709
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:24,856
Ah, get to work.

710
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,924
- You know what, Mr. Jenkins?

711
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:29,903
You might be a little grumpy

712
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:32,820
but I think you just need a friend.

713
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:37,570
- Hey dad, where you been?

714
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,385
- What happened to you?

715
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:42,031
- I was digging for Mr. Jenkins.

716
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:43,752
I'm a really good digger.

717
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:46,596
I made two dollars and 45 cents today.

718
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:47,577
- Hmm.

719
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:48,674
- I'm hungry.

720
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,174
What's for dinner?

721
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:53,641
- You haven't eaten?

722
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:55,063
David!

723
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:55,896
- [David] What?

724
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:56,896
- Come here!

725
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:00,194
This is ridiculous.

726
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,361
You're a mess.

727
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,702
Did you do your homework?

728
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:08,968
- No, I was working on my business.

729
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:09,801
- Hallie.

730
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:14,640
You know homework always comes first.

731
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,644
- Hey, I've been doin' my homework.

732
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,032
- You're supposed to be
watching your little sister.

733
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:19,929
Why haven't you fed her?

734
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:21,288
- I'm studying for my test.

735
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,807
- It's after seven.

736
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,680
- Look dad, there's nothing to eat.

737
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,092
- There's tons of stuff.

738
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:27,925
Here.

739
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:29,985
- What is it?

740
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:30,818
- I don't know.

741
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,194
Throw it in the microwave.

742
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,137
- Well if you can't identify it,

743
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,801
we shouldn't have to eat it.

744
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:36,620
- David, I don't have time for this.

745
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,152
- Dad, can we order a pizza?

746
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,716
- No.

747
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:41,141
Not tonight.

748
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,724
- But mom would have wanted it.

749
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:46,148
- Nice try.

750
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,300
No.

751
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,270
(Doorbell rings)

752
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,251
- (Gasps) Is that the pizza man?

753
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,121
- No.

754
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:57,288
Now you wash up and you find
something for her to eat.

755
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:01,603
- Hey Dan, good to see ya.

756
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:02,549
- Pastor, hey.

757
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,928
- I just wanted to drop
by, see how you're doin'.

758
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:06,259
Now here, Sherry made some extra chili.

759
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:08,498
- Aw, you didn't have to do that.

760
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:09,582
- Well we haven't seen you in awhile

761
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,682
and I know things can be a little tough.

762
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,285
- Yeah, sorry about that.

763
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:14,618
We've been busy.

764
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:17,270
- Hey pastor Kevin!

765
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,503
Is that food?

766
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,211
We're starving in here!

767
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:22,712
- (Laughs) Hey Hallie.

768
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:25,666
You know, the ladies on
the casserole committee

769
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:27,649
would love to add your name to the list.

770
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:28,482
- Yes.

771
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,797
- No, no, no, no, that's,
it's not necessary.

772
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,130
- Alright, well.

773
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:33,957
I'd better be going

774
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:35,211
but let's have lunch soon.

775
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:36,711
- That'd be great.

776
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:40,044
- I'll call you.

777
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,554
- Sounds good.

778
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,054
Thank you, pastor.

779
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,115
- [Hallie] David, we've been spared!

780
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:52,256
(Slow instrumental music)

781
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,843
- [Julie] You're so slow dad.

782
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:04,339
- [Dan] Come on here we go.

783
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:05,357
Hold on, hold on.

784
00:45:05,357 --> 00:45:06,772
Get the moment here before.

785
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:07,605
You guys ready?

786
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,653
See your baby sister?

787
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:09,586
- [Julie] Cheese.

788
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,175
Yes, we're so ready.

789
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,008
Okay.

790
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:12,869
- We're ready.

791
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:13,835
We're so ready.

792
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:15,073
- [Julie] We're so ready.

793
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:15,906
- [Dan] Alright, let's do this.

794
00:45:15,906 --> 00:45:16,739
- [Julie] Are you ready though?

795
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:17,822
- [Dan] Yeah.

796
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,689
- [Julie] Hi.

797
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:22,253
- Hey guys.

798
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,287
Come on in.

799
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,370
She's asleep.

800
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:32,285
- [Dan] There's Hallie.

801
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:33,851
- That's how big you were.

802
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:34,945
- [Dan] Six pounds, four ounces.

803
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,377
Two weeks early.

804
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:37,377
Ready to go.

805
00:45:39,706 --> 00:45:43,123
Julie, you think you can try to hold her?

806
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,790
- Oh, she went right to you.

807
00:45:57,892 --> 00:46:00,311
- [Julie] She's so pretty.

808
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:01,715
- [Dan] David, you wanna hold her?

809
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:03,339
No?

810
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:04,756
Okay, we'll wait.

811
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:08,271
Come in real close.

812
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:09,854
Come in real close.

813
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:13,389
There we are, the Benson family.

814
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:17,723
Say buh bye.

815
00:46:17,723 --> 00:46:18,556
Bye.

816
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,900
(Slow instrumental music)

817
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:25,063
(Dan crying)

818
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,485
(Crickets chirping)

819
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:49,806
- Dad, dad, dad do we
not have to go to school?

820
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,906
- Go, go, get ready!

821
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:55,489
David!

822
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:56,322
David!

823
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,232
- No, no, no, no, no.

824
00:48:01,232 --> 00:48:04,973
(Upbeat instrumental music)

825
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:07,306
- Dad, my bus just drove by!

826
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,154
- David, I need you to
take Hallie to school!

827
00:48:12,154 --> 00:48:13,702
- [David] Can't, I got a test.

828
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:16,307
- David, come on, wait.

829
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:17,140
Oh, man.

830
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,425
Hallie, my car quick!

831
00:48:18,425 --> 00:48:19,754
Let's go!

832
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:21,004
Go, go, go, go!

833
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:26,951
- Alright sweetheart, have a good day.

834
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,653
- Umm, dad?

835
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:29,486
- What?

836
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:33,278
- This isn't my school.

837
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:36,504
- No it's not.

838
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,545
- The pastor will be with you in a moment.

839
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,545
- Thank you.

840
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,834
- It was good of you to make it.

841
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:54,961
- So...

842
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:58,141
- What?

843
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:03,043
- Did you pray about it?

844
00:49:06,032 --> 00:49:06,916
- Does it even matter?

845
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:10,749
I didn't realize I
actually had a say in this.

846
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:20,981
- Why can't you just...

847
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:23,803
- What?

848
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:31,593
What are you thinking right now?

849
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,676
- I'm thinking I don't even know you.

850
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,832
I mean are you really the type of person

851
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,175
who is so stubborn that you
can't even pray about it?

852
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:42,978
- I'm sorry.

853
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:45,461
But I'm not gonna let
some emotional decision

854
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,132
keep US from following
the plans that you and I

855
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:50,672
have talked and prayed
about for two years.

856
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:51,731
- Well then you don't know me at all

857
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:53,953
because all I wanna do right now is just

858
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:57,239
save the life of this
innocent little baby.

859
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,822
And if you aren't
willing to do the same...

860
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,860
- Then what?

861
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:09,359
- I don't know.

862
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:13,388
I don't know.

863
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,160
(Door closes)

864
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:33,436
- [Hallie] Hello?

865
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:34,603
- I'm in here.

866
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:37,580
- Whatcha doin'?

867
00:50:38,723 --> 00:50:41,723
- I'm just looking at some pictures.

868
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:51,601
- Remember the watermelon
seed spitting contest?

869
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:53,251
- Yeah.

870
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:54,251
- Julie won.

871
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,467
- Well, it's only 'cause
she had better seeds.

872
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:02,462
- Mom made cupcakes with flags on 'em.

873
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:03,295
- Yeah.

874
00:51:05,381 --> 00:51:07,412
Hey, you hungry?

875
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:08,329
- Starving.

876
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,917
- Do you wanna order some pizza?

877
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:12,886
- Really?

878
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:13,719
- Yeah.

879
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,381
It's on me.

880
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:18,858
- I'll make cookies.

881
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:21,108
I'll go get the hair dryer.

882
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:34,071
(Slow instrumental music)

883
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,821
(Knocking on door)

884
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,770
- Oh, it's you.

885
00:52:07,518 --> 00:52:10,354
Well what are you panhandling now?

886
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:12,686
- I made you some cookies.

887
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:15,122
- Well I'm not buying.

888
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:16,705
- But they're free.

889
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,255
- Nothing is ever free
in this life, young lady.

890
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:21,464
- I even took out the chocolate chips

891
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:23,714
so your dog could have one.

892
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:26,903
Well, here you go.

893
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:34,469
- Wait.

894
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,695
Come back here little girl.

895
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:44,397
What's your name?

896
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:45,230
- Hallie.

897
00:52:46,874 --> 00:52:49,747
- Well Hallie, you should know better

898
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:54,445
than to give a diabetic
a full plate of cookies.

899
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:58,445
Unless of course, you
wanted to eat one with me?

900
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:01,702
Here.

901
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:03,460
Okay, come.

902
00:53:05,837 --> 00:53:06,754
Down, stay.

903
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,044
For me?

904
00:53:13,044 --> 00:53:13,949
Thank you.

905
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:16,282
- So what do you do all day?

906
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,529
- I'm retired.

907
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:22,236
- What are you retired of?

908
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,544
- Police work.

909
00:53:25,544 --> 00:53:27,711
- You're a policeman?

910
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:28,961
- I used to be.

911
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:32,864
- Was this your police dog?

912
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:33,697
- Him?

913
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,142
No, that's just old Reggie.

914
00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:39,899
- Hey, Reggie, I like that name.

915
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:41,112
- My daughter named him.

916
00:53:41,112 --> 00:53:42,796
- You have a daughter?

917
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:43,629
- Yeah.

918
00:53:45,115 --> 00:53:47,698
- Does she ever come and visit?

919
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,043
- No, she's serving time,

920
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:56,388
10 to 15 years in state pen.

921
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:58,954
- So she works at the zoo?

922
00:53:58,954 --> 00:53:59,811
- Zoo?

923
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:02,693
(Laughs)

924
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:04,934
Well you know, it is something like that.

925
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:06,328
Yeah.

926
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,078
- I bet you miss her.

927
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:13,591
I know what it's like to miss
somebody you really love.

928
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:16,674
At least you could still talk to her.

929
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:22,904
- Well we haven't talked
in a really long time.

930
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:23,737
- Why not?

931
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:28,704
- You know something,

932
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:30,537
I don't even remember.

933
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,976
- Well, you should call her.

934
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:39,643
'Cause I bet she misses you too.

935
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:44,302
- Maybe I will.

936
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:52,319
- You know, these
cookies are really gross.

937
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,242
(Both laughing)

938
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:57,323
- Yeah, they really are gross.

939
00:54:57,323 --> 00:54:58,873
- Maybe Reggie will eat 'em.

940
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:02,761
- (Laughing) Yeah, maybe so.

941
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,371
- [Hallie] Well I better go.

942
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,371
- Well okay.

943
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:09,994
Hallie.

944
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,559
Thanks for the cookies.

945
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:26,996
- Hey sleepy head.

946
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:29,766
Sorry I didn't cook breakfast.

947
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:31,500
Kinda outta stuff.

948
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,333
- Trust me.

949
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,166
That is not a problem.

950
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,850
- I think there's one last granola bar.

951
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,785
(Footsteps on stairs)

952
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:41,833
You promised to help me in the yard.

953
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:42,856
- Can't.

954
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:44,939
I gotta study for a test.

955
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,972
- Dad, I need to increase my cash flow.

956
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:50,238
- Why?

957
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:52,311
- It's a secret.

958
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,524
- Sorry, no can do.

959
00:55:54,524 --> 00:55:57,050
- Well can I do something
to earn some money?

960
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:57,954
- Honey, not today.

961
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,246
I'm swamped with work of my own.

962
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:01,329
- Can I help?

963
00:56:02,222 --> 00:56:04,371
- It's grown up work.

964
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:05,204
- Please?

965
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:07,171
- Trust me.

966
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:11,338
When you're old enough to
help, you won't want to.

967
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:14,549
Actually, you could take
the trash to the garage.

968
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:15,882
That'd be great.

969
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,462
- Will you give me a dollar?

970
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:20,395
- No, but I'll do your laundry

971
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:22,291
and let you live in the house.

972
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,124
- Fine.

973
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:25,805
- Put some shoes on.

974
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:29,972
I got a lot of junk in
there I've gotta get rid of.

975
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:33,811
Shoes.

976
00:56:35,673 --> 00:56:38,423
(Birds chirping)

977
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,029
- There is a lot of junk in here.

978
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,693
- David, what are you doing?

979
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:18,593
- [Julie] Hello, dad?

980
00:57:18,593 --> 00:57:19,470
Anyone here?

981
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,303
- Yeah, I'm up here.

982
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,386
I'll be down in a second.

983
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,927
- So what'd you want from Colton?

984
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:35,015
- I want him to hear the
same thing that I'm hearing.

985
00:57:35,015 --> 00:57:36,164
- But he's not.

986
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:37,497
- Yeah, exactly.

987
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,940
- So you want him to do things your way?

988
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:45,485
- Yeah.

989
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:48,715
No.

990
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:51,762
I don't know, dad.

991
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:53,291
I don't know stuff.

992
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,374
I feel stuff.

993
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:02,740
When I agreed to marry Colton,
I felt such peace about it.

994
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,122
And now I don't feel
peace about anything, dad.

995
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,243
I feel like I'm supposed to save this baby

996
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:12,052
but I also felt just as strongly

997
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:14,488
that I was supposed to marry Colton.

998
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:15,988
Dad, I don't know.

999
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:21,331
- Can I wash these two together?

1000
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,164
- Really?

1001
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:24,348
- I'm sorry.

1002
00:58:26,988 --> 00:58:27,821
I'm sorry.

1003
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:33,112
What do you want me to say?

1004
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:34,748
- I don't know.

1005
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:36,415
Mom used to help me.

1006
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:39,126
- Yeah.

1007
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:44,191
Well, mom used to do a lot of things.

1008
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,517
- Yeah.

1009
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:46,924
- I'm sorry, I wanna help you.

1010
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:48,763
- No, it's okay.

1011
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:49,596
It's fine.

1012
00:58:50,674 --> 00:58:51,757
You're right.

1013
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,287
I'll figure it out.

1014
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,701
- I love you.

1015
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:03,089
- I love you, too.

1016
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,500
- Uh, gotta go try on this dress.

1017
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:13,765
Hope they have a good return policy.

1018
00:59:14,938 --> 00:59:18,438
(Slow instrumental music)

1019
00:59:22,597 --> 00:59:25,514
(Knocking on door)

1020
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:28,503
- Hey.

1021
00:59:28,503 --> 00:59:29,362
- Hey.

1022
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:30,950
- You ready to study?

1023
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,033
- Absolutely.

1024
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,277
- What is that?

1025
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:43,525
Don't tell me you actually
thought we were gonna study.

1026
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:45,579
- Well I figured we'd do a little bit.

1027
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:49,706
That way I'm not
completely lying to my dad.

1028
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:50,873
- You're cute.

1029
00:59:54,771 --> 00:59:56,643
"But 1917 proved only to be the beginning

1030
00:59:56,643 --> 00:59:58,782
"of the bolshevik revolution."

1031
00:59:58,782 --> 00:59:59,740
Done.

1032
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,217
Whew.

1033
01:00:01,217 --> 01:00:02,884
That was exhausting.

1034
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:05,532
Do you want a drink?

1035
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:09,162
- Yeah, sure, I'll have some water.

1036
01:00:09,162 --> 01:00:11,047
So where is everyone?

1037
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:12,386
- [Girl] Oh, they're all out.

1038
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:13,469
It's just US.

1039
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:37,456
(Slow instrumental music)

1040
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,546
- [Woman] Come on, let's see it.

1041
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:01,796
- [Julie] Okay.

1042
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:07,774
- [Woman] Oh my goodness.

1043
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,230
- You look amazing.

1044
01:01:13,662 --> 01:01:14,662
- Thank you.

1045
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:19,079
- Colton's gonna pass out.

1046
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,420
(Julie laughs)

1047
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,587
- Let me go get your veil so
you can get the full effect.

1048
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,287
- [Rachel] What's wrong?

1049
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,167
- Nothing, it's perfect.

1050
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,270
- What is it then?

1051
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:38,212
- Nothing.

1052
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:40,804
Nothing.

1053
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,578
- It's Colton, isn't it?

1054
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:48,875
He doesn't want the baby, does he?

1055
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,375
- It's not Colton.

1056
01:01:51,685 --> 01:01:53,149
It's not the baby.

1057
01:01:53,149 --> 01:01:53,982
It's...

1058
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:01,173
I just feel like I can't
hear god's voice anymore.

1059
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:05,734
And it scares me.

1060
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:09,880
- Forget it.

1061
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,380
It's not worth it.

1062
01:02:12,786 --> 01:02:13,786
- Excuse me.

1063
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:17,075
Are you Julie Benson?

1064
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:17,908
- Yes.

1065
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:23,306
- I'm supposed to give you this.

1066
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,825
(Slow instrumental music)

1067
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:46,930
(Julie crying)

1068
01:03:35,387 --> 01:03:36,441
- Here you go.

1069
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:39,274
- Pleasure doing business with ya.

1070
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:41,828
Hey Mr. Jenkins!

1071
01:03:44,384 --> 01:03:47,342
- Well hey there miss Hallie.

1072
01:03:47,342 --> 01:03:50,542
Looks like business is booming.

1073
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:52,632
- I made 29 dollars.

1074
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:54,132
- 29 dollars, wow.

1075
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:56,944
That is a lot of money.

1076
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:08,135
You know you don't see too
many of these nowadays.

1077
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,632
How much you want for them?

1078
01:04:09,632 --> 01:04:11,037
- Two dollars.

1079
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:12,204
- Two dollars?

1080
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:16,734
I'll take 'em.

1081
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,631
For five.

1082
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:26,214
- Wow you drive a hard bargain.

1083
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:39,671
- You all set?

1084
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:40,504
- Yeah.

1085
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:46,589
- You know, I used to
think you were an old frump

1086
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:48,994
who didn't like to have any fun.

1087
01:04:48,994 --> 01:04:50,577
But you've changed.

1088
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,423
- Oh.

1089
01:04:53,984 --> 01:04:55,317
- Now I think you're the kind of guy

1090
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:57,150
who likes to have fun.

1091
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:00,514
- I can't do this.

1092
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:01,347
- What?

1093
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,232
- I'm sorry.

1094
01:05:04,413 --> 01:05:05,937
- Where are you going?

1095
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:07,104
- Tell my dad.

1096
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:09,769
Like I said I would.

1097
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:16,651
(Door closes)

1098
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:38,191
- Um, let me go see if
my dad has any change.

1099
01:05:41,987 --> 01:05:43,987
Hey, what are you doing?

1100
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:47,663
- I'm trying to get rid of
all these stupid dandelions.

1101
01:05:47,663 --> 01:05:49,046
- I planted those!

1102
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,557
- You planted these?

1103
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:51,615
Hallie, these are weeds.

1104
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,532
- They're not weeds, they're flowers!

1105
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,037
- Stop it.

1106
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:57,185
- The yellow ones turn white.

1107
01:05:57,185 --> 01:05:59,185
- No, I said no, Hallie.

1108
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:04,216
- They're beautiful flowers.

1109
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:06,049
And mom liked 'em too.

1110
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,453
- Hallie.

1111
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:12,125
Hallie!

1112
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:14,914
Hallie!

1113
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,044
What's going on?

1114
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:22,314
Are you getting rid of this stuff?

1115
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,525
- You said it was junk.

1116
01:06:24,525 --> 01:06:26,411
- Excuse me, ladies.

1117
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,744
I'm sorry this sale is over.

1118
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:33,854
I can't believe that you
would do this without tell...

1119
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:34,687
No.

1120
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:41,657
Where are the tapes?

1121
01:06:41,657 --> 01:06:42,490
- What tapes?

1122
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:43,489
- The vhs.

1123
01:06:43,489 --> 01:06:44,739
- What's a vhs?

1124
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,748
- The little black boxes
with the movies on 'em.

1125
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:52,596
That's the only footage we
have left of your mother.

1126
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:53,679
- I sold 'em.

1127
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:57,534
- Hallie.

1128
01:06:57,534 --> 01:06:58,534
- I'm sorry.

1129
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,545
- Go to your room.

1130
01:07:03,545 --> 01:07:04,378
- But--

1131
01:07:04,378 --> 01:07:05,211
- go.

1132
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:16,107
(Slow instrumental music)

1133
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:22,492
- What's going on?

1134
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:25,024
- Don't talk to me right now.

1135
01:07:25,024 --> 01:07:25,857
- What?

1136
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,957
- What happened to you?

1137
01:07:31,566 --> 01:07:33,339
Because I'm not around you
think you can just Chuck

1138
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:36,057
everything that your
mother and I taught you?

1139
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:37,669
- What are you talking about?

1140
01:07:37,669 --> 01:07:39,002
- Your computer.

1141
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:42,702
I saw everything.

1142
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:44,937
I'm disappointed.

1143
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:47,610
You know who else would be disappointed?

1144
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,443
Mom.

1145
01:07:52,266 --> 01:07:53,266
- I'm sorry.

1146
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:07,319
(Knocking on door)

1147
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,188
- Hallie, what is it?

1148
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:15,717
- Please let me buy back the vns tapes.

1149
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,250
- What?

1150
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:20,481
- They're black boxes with
movies of my mom on 'em.

1151
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,513
Here, you can have all the money.

1152
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,263
I just need 'em back.

1153
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:29,935
I'll never earn enough anyways.

1154
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:34,052
- Hallie, is this about your secret?

1155
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,295
Do you wanna talk about it?

1156
01:08:38,295 --> 01:08:42,462
- It doesn't matter now
that I've ruined everything.

1157
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,973
- I tell you what.

1158
01:08:45,973 --> 01:08:49,839
Why don't you and I go sit
down right there on that step

1159
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,710
and you can tell me about it
from the very beginning, okay?

1160
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,784
- Okay.

1161
01:08:53,784 --> 01:08:55,367
- Alright, come on.

1162
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,223
(Box slams)

1163
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:13,247
(Slow instrumental music)

1164
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:29,151
- And all I wanted to
do is earn enough money

1165
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:30,984
to fix Isabel's teeth.

1166
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:36,022
But I keep messing everything up.

1167
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:37,272
I'm too little.

1168
01:09:40,904 --> 01:09:43,939
I mean I know it doesn't
sound very important.

1169
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:44,772
- Oh no.

1170
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,708
It is important.

1171
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,519
It is very important.

1172
01:09:52,617 --> 01:09:55,367
Because it's important to Isabel.

1173
01:09:59,861 --> 01:10:01,968
You know Hallie,

1174
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:06,135
you just can't give up on
someone when they need you.

1175
01:10:07,184 --> 01:10:08,434
- You're right.

1176
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,580
I won't.

1177
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:15,989
- I know you won't.

1178
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:22,843
And that's why I'm gonna
give this money back to you.

1179
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:27,156
'Cause I know you're
gonna earn it somehow.

1180
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,489
Meantime, I'm gonna get this old body up

1181
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:35,013
and get those tapes for you, okay?

1182
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:35,846
Uh.

1183
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,243
- Okay.

1184
01:10:54,214 --> 01:10:55,047
- Hey!

1185
01:10:56,058 --> 01:10:58,700
Where do you think you're going?

1186
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,533
David!

1187
01:11:03,213 --> 01:11:04,046
(Car engine starting)

1188
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:06,372
- Bye Mr. Jenkins!

1189
01:11:06,372 --> 01:11:07,205
- David!

1190
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:09,678
Watch out!

1191
01:11:12,787 --> 01:11:13,620
Hallie!

1192
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:15,622
Hallie!

1193
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:16,458
Hallie!

1194
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,299
Hallie!

1195
01:11:17,299 --> 01:11:18,373
Give me some help!

1196
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:19,664
Help!

1197
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:20,774
- [Mr. Jenkins] Listen don't move her.

1198
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,024
Don't move her.

1199
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:29,883
- Hallie!

1200
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,204
- [Hallie] They're beautiful flowers.

1201
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:35,037
- Hallie!

1202
01:11:35,037 --> 01:11:37,619
- [Hallie] Mom liked 'em too.

1203
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:40,497
- I hear there are tons
of flowers in heaven.

1204
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,460
Look, a white one!

1205
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,315
I love the white ones.

1206
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:45,881
They were my favorite
when I was a little girl

1207
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:47,113
because you can blow them

1208
01:11:47,113 --> 01:11:49,194
and then it looks like it's snowing.

1209
01:11:49,194 --> 01:11:50,645
You want to?

1210
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:51,478
Go ahead.

1211
01:11:52,759 --> 01:11:56,259
(Slow instrumental music)

1212
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:09,117
- Wanna know a secret?

1213
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:11,760
The yellow ones

1214
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:13,971
and the white ones

1215
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:15,651
are the same flower.

1216
01:12:15,651 --> 01:12:18,253
Yellow ones turn white when they die

1217
01:12:18,253 --> 01:12:20,431
and then they get all these
little white fuzzy things

1218
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,168
which are actually seeds.

1219
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:24,812
And when you blow 'em they go all over.

1220
01:12:24,812 --> 01:12:26,868
They land in the ground

1221
01:12:26,868 --> 01:12:29,533
and they turn into a new dandelion.

1222
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:33,033
(Slow instrumental music)

1223
01:12:52,403 --> 01:12:54,033
- You know I think god made people

1224
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:56,359
a lot like dandelions.

1225
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:59,558
He wants US to spread his
love to the entire world.

1226
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:00,965
- How?

1227
01:13:00,965 --> 01:13:04,215
- Well we have to be willing to change.

1228
01:13:08,436 --> 01:13:13,093
You see, there's a Hallie
who only cares about herself

1229
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:15,200
and that Hallie needs to die

1230
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,360
and let god change her into a new Hallie

1231
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,211
who loves god and other people.

1232
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:23,292
- How do I change?

1233
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,940
- You start by asking god to show you

1234
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,075
what you're doing wrong
and to forgive you.

1235
01:13:29,075 --> 01:13:32,122
- Can we ask him right now?

1236
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:32,955
- Yeah.

1237
01:13:34,894 --> 01:13:38,394
(Slow instrumental music)

1238
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:27,388
- How is she?

1239
01:14:29,994 --> 01:14:31,827
- They don't know yet.

1240
01:14:42,017 --> 01:14:43,600
- She dropped this.

1241
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,660
- Thank you.

1242
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:57,853
- Mr. Benson, you already know this.

1243
01:15:03,705 --> 01:15:06,705
You have one incredible little girl.

1244
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:25,616
- We still don't know anything.

1245
01:15:25,616 --> 01:15:28,982
You can come back and see
her though if you'd like.

1246
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:29,815
- I would.

1247
01:16:08,785 --> 01:16:11,618
(Monitor beeping)

1248
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:33,544
(Slow instrumental music)

1249
01:17:02,157 --> 01:17:04,574
(Dan crying)

1250
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:27,372
- "Hallie.

1251
01:17:30,622 --> 01:17:33,872
"You've brought so much joy to my life.

1252
01:17:35,608 --> 01:17:37,108
"You make me smile

1253
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:43,673
"because I know you love
god with all of your heart.

1254
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:49,285
"Keep spreading that
love to those in need.

1255
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,117
"Remember you can do all
things through Christ.

1256
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:04,799
"Go change the world.

1257
01:18:07,742 --> 01:18:08,742
"Love, mom."

1258
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:34,068
I'm sorry.

1259
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:39,275
I thought I could do everything for them.

1260
01:18:40,288 --> 01:18:41,288
But I can't.

1261
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:49,593
I thought I could do it all by myself.

1262
01:18:51,553 --> 01:18:52,886
Lord I need you.

1263
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:58,384
Please don't take my baby.

1264
01:18:58,384 --> 01:18:59,217
Please.

1265
01:19:00,617 --> 01:19:01,450
Please.

1266
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,908
(Crying)

1267
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,693
- It was an accident.

1268
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:47,318
- I'm so sorry.

1269
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:50,968
- I know you are.

1270
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:55,024
I'm sorry too.

1271
01:19:58,638 --> 01:20:01,488
I said things I shouldn't have.

1272
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:02,321
- No, dad.

1273
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,790
You were right.

1274
01:20:08,325 --> 01:20:11,325
I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

1275
01:20:13,468 --> 01:20:15,968
- You're not a disappointment.

1276
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:18,972
Never have been.

1277
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:28,334
I haven't been the best father.

1278
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:37,203
- I don't know how I got into all this.

1279
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,048
I know I need to change.

1280
01:20:44,764 --> 01:20:46,525
- I'm gonna help.

1281
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:47,608
I wanna help.

1282
01:20:55,358 --> 01:20:57,775
I want you to know something.

1283
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:01,523
I'm very proud of you.

1284
01:21:04,637 --> 01:21:07,887
And your mom would be proud of you too.

1285
01:21:16,726 --> 01:21:18,559
It's gonna be alright.

1286
01:21:25,484 --> 01:21:28,984
(Slow instrumental music)

1287
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:47,533
- Thank you.

1288
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:22,752
- [Susan] Dan, I remember our wedding day.

1289
01:23:23,604 --> 01:23:25,308
You smiled at me

1290
01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:29,141
and I just knew we could
do anything together.

1291
01:23:30,284 --> 01:23:34,230
Today you're giving
our precious girl away.

1292
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:37,712
I wish I could see her
standing beside you.

1293
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:39,811
You may be giving her away

1294
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,061
but she'll always need you.

1295
01:23:43,787 --> 01:23:47,984
And David, he's more
like you than you think.

1296
01:23:47,984 --> 01:23:52,151
I know you'll mold him into
the man he needs to be.

1297
01:23:53,344 --> 01:23:57,756
And as for Hallie, she has
such a heart for the lord

1298
01:23:57,756 --> 01:24:01,095
and spreads joy everywhere she goes.

1299
01:24:01,095 --> 01:24:03,496
Keep encouraging her.

1300
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,480
She may be small but god loves

1301
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,147
to work through unlikely people.

1302
01:24:09,937 --> 01:24:11,888
I know you're probably wondering

1303
01:24:11,888 --> 01:24:15,334
how you're gonna get through
all of this without me.

1304
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:18,501
But I promise god is more than enough.

1305
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:22,682
He'll get you through this.

1306
01:24:24,855 --> 01:24:26,772
I love you all so much.

1307
01:24:27,861 --> 01:24:31,748
And I can't wait to be with you again.

1308
01:24:31,748 --> 01:24:33,248
I'll see you soon.

1309
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:35,417
Susan.

1310
01:24:45,473 --> 01:24:49,306
(Triumphant orchestral music)

1311
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,770
♫ the time went fast

1312
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:06,569
♫ but I'm thankful for each day

1313
01:26:06,569 --> 01:26:09,410
