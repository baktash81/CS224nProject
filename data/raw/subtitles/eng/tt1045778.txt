2
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Did you see it? I think I got it.

3
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,100
That little piggy was fast.

4
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,800
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill.
We all take credit.

5
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,600
- I got a side ache.
- You hit Enmebaragesi.

6
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,900
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
That's not my spear.

8
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,100
My spear has feathers...
Okay, that one's got a feather.

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Okay, that is my spear.
I'm sorry, man.

10
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Great. Two spears.
Twice the killing power.

11
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,800
Thanks a lot.
Next time don't block my shot.

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,200
What? I didn't say...
Come on, not my fault.

13
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt?

14
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
Hey, there you are.

15
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,700
I don't think you wanna be gathered.
You wanna be eaten.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,300
Hi, Marlak.

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose.

18
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Hey, Oh. How's it going?

19
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Hunters think they're so cool.
You know, they...

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,300
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging.

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,900
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,300
...and put it in the basket.

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,600
Are they picking on you?

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,300
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out.

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,900
- All right. Yeah, would you?
- You're right.

26
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,400
Let it slide this time.

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear.

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,100
- What happened to your spear?
- I modified it. Made it a snub nose.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,300
It's lighter. It's a better killing tool.
Anyway...

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,800
Oh, there's Maya.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,800
I'll be right back.
Unless something goes horribly right.

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,100
- Hello, Maya.
- Hey, Zed.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Look, you're a special guy.
You've got a lot of personality.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,400
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,300
...you really helped me
see the funny side.

37
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,900
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

38
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,300
"Get off." That's your mom.

39
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,600
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl.

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,500
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me.

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,100
Well, I mean, he is the best hunter
in the village.

44
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,100
- Debatable.
- People voted.

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
- Or gatherer.
- Yes. Or gatherer.

47
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,500
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here.

48
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,500
I can take care of you.
Does it look like I'm starving?

49
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,400
Come on.
Tell me you can say no to this.

50
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,800
Give it a second. Let it work on you.

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely can say no to that.

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Maya. Can I see you later?

53
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,300
I think I have to wash my hair.

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
You washed your hair last year.

55
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Tonight, we feast.

56
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,200
Maya. For you.

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,900
Thanks, Marlak.
Another severed boar's head.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
- It's a different color.
- Yeah, this one is...

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,600
- Left the tongue in.
- Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak.

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,700
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya.
He doesn't know her at all.

61
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,800
Head's not even the best part
of the boar.

62
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,700
It's the back fat, stupid.
Muscleheaded idiot.

63
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,200
Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema.

64
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist.

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
There's like 60 people
in the village. I mean...

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,300
...you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists.

67
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I just wanna lay with her so badly.

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't see it. She's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.

69
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,200
She's your sister. I mean,
that'd be like laying with your mother.

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,300
Which was a big mistake.
I see that now.

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
You think it's not gonna be awkward
in the morning, but... Trust me, wow.

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,600
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,300
...at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut.

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,100
My hut's a mess right now,
and what if she struggles?

76
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,000
You give her a little tap on the head.
Women respond to that.

77
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
I still live with my parents.

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,100
I don't wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking.

79
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,900
I'd get an earful in the morning.
She only likes hunters.

80
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
She doesn't like gatherers.
She's a gatherer herself is the irony.

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,800
She's a self-loathing gatherer.

82
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
- That's pretty suggestive.
- I wouldn't read too much into that.

83
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,200
Okay, now she's just asking
for some splinters.

84
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
Hey, hey... Squanto.
Give me a break, would you?

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
You got the whole forest.

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,500
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

87
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,800
I could be wrong, I think what it is
is that all the poop in the area...

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,300
...fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping.

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,900
It's not that nobody respects you.
I haven't heard that from everyone.

90
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,700
I've had it. Let's go.

91
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,100
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far.

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke.

93
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,200
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Change villages.

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
No. I'm gonna change my head.

95
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
I don't think that's possible.
Your head is attached to your body.

96
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,600
Not the whole head.
I mean, my mind.

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,900
Mind...

98
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit.

99
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,400
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

101
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,100
You don't eat from that one.
It's forbidden.

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,500
But why is it forbidden?

103
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,600
What is it they don't want us
to have?

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
It's not the fruit. It's about the rule.
It's about doing what you're told.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
- How's that worked out?
- I like doing what I'm told.

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
It gives my day
some much-needed structure. Wait.

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,900
Zed. Stop.
It's just a piece of fruit.

109
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life.

110
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,100
What if it's magic fruit?

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,100
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
That's a pretty low bar.

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,100
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me.

114
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Maya would lay with me like that.

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

116
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,700
I have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is.

117
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,000
Put the fruit down.
What if somebody sees us?

118
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,000
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill.

119
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
Now you've done it.

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,700
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste.

121
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,800
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
- Oh, I definitely feel something.
- What?

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,800
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter.

124
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,100
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything.

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,400
Ask me something. Anything. Go.
Test me. Go.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

127
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,100
Pass. Next question.

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,600
- Okay, where do babies come from?
- Pass. Next question.

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
- There's a snake on my foot.
- In the form of a question.

130
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
There's a snake on my foot?

131
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,800
- Correct.
- What do I do?

132
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,100
I got a lot of ideas. I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject.

133
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,800
- It's constricting me.
- You could stick your finger in its hole.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you. Try that.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,600
Eat the snake first.
That's what my new brain tells me.

136
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
- It's preparing to eat me.
- Go for the eyes.

137
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,000
It's big.

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Zed, please help me.

139
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm dying a virgin.

140
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,400
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go eat more fruit.

141
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,000
- This was a bit of a rough day for me.
- Yeah. There's gotta be more to life.

142
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
This is a lot. I don't think I can handle
too much more than this.

143
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,500
No way. Look at these people.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,100
They're like animals.
We're way too good for this.

145
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top.

146
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm bringing you.
You're gonna be my right hand.

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,600
I've seen what you do
with your right hand. No.

148
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,500
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

149
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,300
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

150
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,700
The world ends. Everybody
knows that. You'd fall right off of it.

151
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,100
But what if it doesn't?

152
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,000
It makes my stomach go:

153
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,500
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit.

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

155
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
It's a thing that you eat.
Why do we eat?

156
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,000
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Everything is weird.

158
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,900
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange...

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,500
Why am I talking? What is this?

160
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,900
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

161
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,000
...and you know what I mean.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Blows my mind.

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,100
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk.
I don't wanna hear it right now.

164
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,300
Boy, she looks nice tonight.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Do it, man. Dance for her.

166
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,500
I don't know.
They're doing the jackal dance.

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,100
It's not my strongest.

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,600
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance.

169
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Go. Jackal dance.

170
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,100
Get into it.

171
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
<i>Over the head.</i>

172
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm gonna go and eat.
I'm gonna come back.

173
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,500
Your father was a great hunter.
But you, you're like a little girl.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Good one, Marlak.

175
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden.

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,700
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

177
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,400
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit.

178
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,100
Oh, that.

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I will kill you where you stand.

180
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Oh, a shooting star. That's the best.

181
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
- You really ate the fruit?
- One bite. What's the big deal?

182
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,900
You don't eat the fruit.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time.

184
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,900
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details.

186
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,600
Forbidden. Forbidden fruit.

187
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,500
You ate... You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do. Forbidden.

188
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,500
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room.

189
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden. You're cursed, man.

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,300
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed.
You have to leave.

191
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,100
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I didn't eat the fruit.

192
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
My hands are tied.

193
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,000
I know I'm being a dick right now, man,
but I'm just trying to help you.

194
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Do I detect a little bit of jealousy
because I now have...

195
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,000
...the knowledge of good and evil
and you don't?

196
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You think it's easy being the shaman
of the village?

197
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
You think I like putting on
a boar's head every morning?

198
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Putting a bone through my face?

199
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,700
I know we've known each other for
a long time. We throw the rock around.

200
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,500
We have fun together, man,
but I can't be...

201
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,900
You know what I mean?

202
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Plus, wanna know something?
I am high as shit right now, dude.

203
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,800
I just licked like three toads.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,100
I've been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs.

205
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,200
- Okay.
- I just wanna get a meal...

206
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,100
...I wanna take a fucking nap.
- This is bullshit.

207
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,000
You really... You fucked the pooch
on this one.

208
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,700
- Hard.
- I say what I did...

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
...was a good thing.
- Oh, yeah?

210
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah. Really, really very good thing.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,600
And I should know because I have
the knowledge of good and evil.

212
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
- Oh, okay.
- So I ought to know...

213
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,900
...when I know what I'm saying
is what I know what I'm saying.

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- Good.
- And I'm not leaving.

215
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
You better get out of here.

216
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,500
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing.

217
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,200
I know I'm not the greatest hunter.

218
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
- Or gatherer.
- Or gatherer. Thank you.

219
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,700
But there's gotta be more to life
than this.

220
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm going, but because I choose to.

221
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,300
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome.

222
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,600
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us.

223
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,900
Yeah, light up the darkness.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,900
So who's with me?

225
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
Anyone?

226
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,300
Anyone named Oh?

227
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Okay. Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone.

228
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,900
Which is fine with me.

229
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
Better, in fact...

230
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,500
...because having a partner
would just probably slow me down.

231
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better.

232
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,200
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun.

233
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,400
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence.

234
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,500
And you're not invited. I don't even like
any of you guys. I never did.

235
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,700
Unless anyone changes their mind.
Does anyone wanna come?

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
- We're good.
- Fine. Good. Bye-bye.

237
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't... Nobody panic.

238
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,300
No! That's... That's...
Oh, it's not my house.

239
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,300
I see you.

240
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Go away, Marlak.

241
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
- Really, animal noises?
- Badger.

242
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
This is just insulting.
It's time I killed you.

243
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Fine. But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

244
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,600
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

245
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,200
Nice whack on the head.
You should try hitting Eema that hard.

246
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,800
We can discuss that later.
We should run away.

247
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,100
Yes, yes, of course.

248
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,500
So you decided to come after all.
Was it the speech?

249
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,800
- It was the fire. I lost everything.
- Yeah.

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
I wish we didn't have to leave.

251
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
Probably never gonna see
Eema again.

252
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,700
That's not true. We'll go back.

253
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Those hunters are idiots.

254
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,000
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour.

255
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

256
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,300
There's nothing to go back to.
It's just ashes.

257
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts.

258
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,600
It's just a pile of sticks and dung.

259
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

260
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

261
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,700
- I'm sorry, l...
- It's okay.

262
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,300
- I don't mean that, obviously.
- I know you're mad...

263
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,700
...but this is a great
opportunity for us.

264
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
They didn't appreciate you
back there.

265
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,300
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd.

266
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,300
They were all drinking from their
hands.

267
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,200
Well, it just seems practical.
I mean, I don't know.

268
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,600
We have an incredible destiny.

269
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,300
You don't even know where we are.
We're lost.

270
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Of course I know where we are.

271
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,600
It's a cougar.
Don't move a muscle.

272
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
- What do we do?
- Don't move your lips.

273
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Rule number one: Show no fear.

274
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,800
You're showing fear.

275
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,000
Much better. Very good.

276
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
- Now what?
- There's two opinions on this one.

277
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,400
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still.

278
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,000
- Which one are you gonna do?
- I'm going to run!

279
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,900
You should put some maggots
on those scratches.

280
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
They look pretty deep.

281
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,600
They are very deep.
That's why they appear that way.

282
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
- You're still mad at me, aren't you?
- I wish I hadn't come.

283
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,800
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
...if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

285
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,500
...that attacks you.

286
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh, what does this look like?

287
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,400
You making your own fire?

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,900
No, I'm making arrows.
We're gonna need them.

289
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,300
- You still coming?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,900
Yeah!

291
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,600
Yeah. You're my buddy. Yeah.

292
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,500
You're saying we're gonna walk...

293
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,700
...and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

294
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,900
...and it's like... What is it?
What are we looking at?

295
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,500
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

296
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,300
This is general knowledge.

297
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,600
- I knew it!
- This is incredible.

298
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
You still think the world just ends?

299
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,700
Come on, admit it. The fruit man
has the knowledge.

300
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,000
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

301
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

302
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah. I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now.

303
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,100
- So what am I doing in ten minutes?
- You're having sex with a zebra.

304
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,800
- That's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,100
Hope you're ready to bone some zeeb.

306
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,000
People. More than one.

307
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,400
Walking that way.

308
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there.

309
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
- I mean, it's kind of obvious.
- Oh, yes.

310
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
- They stopped here to poop. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

311
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,200
Two men, maybe three. A child.
Or a small woman, maybe.

312
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,200
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been.

313
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,500
- I know where it's been.
- Don't touch it.

314
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it.

315
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,700
Still warm.
Almost hot in the center.

316
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Looks like they had some nuts.
Apples, maybe.

317
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
What are you doing?

318
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
- Yep, apples.
- What difference does it make?

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
That doesn't help us to know that.

320
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,000
You can tell if they ate some shit.
There's a lot of shit in that shit.

321
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
My mistake, this is bear poop.

322
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
What's that, though?

323
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
This one's mine.

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
Tonight, we feast.

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
We're gonna need
some arrowheads.

326
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
This is where you die!

327
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Easy, easy.

328
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,300
He won't get far.

329
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,200
- Did you shoot my cow?
- Oh, no.

330
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Yes. Well, we're hunters.

331
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,700
Well, he's a hunter. I'm a maker.

332
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,800
- A maker?
- I made this loincloth. I make arrows.

333
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,400
I've made a shelf unit for my hut.

334
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,600
I welcome us to you.

335
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,500
- What do you do?
- What does it look like?

336
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,300
- We're farmers.
- Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman.

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
You're a suck is what you are.

338
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,400
- My brother Cain. I'm called Abel.
- You are called "suck."

339
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,100
There you go with that "suck."
What does that mean?

340
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,900
Short for "suckle."
Short for "suckle up."

341
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,900
You're suckling up to God.
You're a suckle-up.

342
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor.

343
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor." I mean...

344
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

345
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

346
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,500
Why are you bringing these guys
in it?

347
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,300
- They live in a tree.
- Oh, see?

348
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,900
I mean, come on. You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else.

349
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,500
No, but superior to... Than you.

350
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,500
Superior... Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass.

351
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,500
- Oh, yeah?
- You want some of that?

352
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,300
- Yes, I do.
- Guys.

353
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,600
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- No, come on.

354
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,000
No. This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back.

355
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,500
- We're not that insulted.
- Why don't you make me?

356
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
No, no. Boys, boys.
You are brothers. Let's just relax...

357
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,200
...and let's all just get
some perspective...

358
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we do it.
That's how we do it. That's...

359
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,600
- There are rules that we abide by.
- Yeah, right.

360
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,700
- Should we do something?
- Just let them settle it.

361
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
I tripped.

362
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, I guess that settles it.

363
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,600
It's... He's all right.
He's just... He's resting.

365
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,700
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight.

366
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's... You know what?

367
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,600
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

368
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,200
...to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...

369
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,300
Hey. Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

370
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,700
Hey. Oh, hey, stop it.
He's choking me.

371
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,100
Stop it, Abel. Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

372
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,700
"Yes, Cain, I am."
Come on, stop it!

373
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,800
Self-defense. Clearly. Self-defense.

374
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,500
What have I done?
What have I done?

375
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,400
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

376
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,300
What have I continued to do?

377
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,800
Oh, guys.
Guys, we're in some real trouble here.

378
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
What do you mean, "we"?

379
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,200
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him.

380
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
No, no, no. There's two of you
and there's one of me.

381
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
- You could have stopped me.
- Didn't know you were gonna kill him.

382
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,400
- Are you calling me a murderer?
- Did I say that?

383
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,700
It was an accident. Right?

384
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,100
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

385
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,600
...and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

386
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,300
...until he just couldn't pull through.

387
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,300
- It was horseplay.
- It was horseplay.

388
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
It was two horses playing.

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,300
One murders the other one...

390
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah. It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone.

391
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,800
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and...

392
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,100
Who am I gonna tell?

393
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I can't think of one
who'd be interested.

394
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,700
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well.

395
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,000
- Why even bring it up?
- Okay.

396
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,000
- It's like he killed himself.
- Cry for help, if anything.

397
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,800
All right. Good.

398
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
I like you guys. I do.
I like you guys a lot. I do.

399
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

400
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
- We already have dinner plans.
- Damn.

401
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,200
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

402
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,400
We'll come over to your place
for supper.

403
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,900
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

404
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,400
- Just don't kill me.
- No horseplay.

405
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,400
- What?
- Nothing.

406
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,700
What are these big,
round things for?

407
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,500
They're wheels, numbskull.
They make the cart roll.

408
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,100
I feel like a bird.

409
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Bring it forth.

410
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Hello.

411
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,500
I'm gonna yak.

412
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,500
Hey. What's wrong with you?

413
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,900
- Let me get your hair.
- That was too fast.

414
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,900
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

415
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,100
I don't know.
I haven't really seen him at all.

416
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,500
Have you... You guys...
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

417
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't... Never...

418
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,800
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- What's his name?

419
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,400
- Sure he's out there somewhere...
- I haven't seen anybody anywhere.

420
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Never had the pleasure.
Sure he's in the prime of his life.

421
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,200
This is good soup. Really good.

422
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,700
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him.

423
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,500
Oh, man, this bread is good.

424
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, really? That... Oh, yeah.
No, that was yesterday, right.

425
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
No, this day.
She said you both made offerings.

426
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,000
- Oh, that was Boaz. Yeah.
- No.

427
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,900
- Japheth. It was Japheth.
- No.

428
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,500
- Enoch.
- No.

429
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
- I'm sure it was Gilgamesh.
- No.

430
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
- Ishmael.
- No.

431
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,100
- Ezidia?
- No.

432
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,500
- Jennifer?
- No.

433
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
Now I'm remembering correctly.
It was Tishbaven.

434
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,500
It was you. She said
it looked like you were arguing.

435
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah, well, let's be honest.
Lilith is a lying bitch.

436
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,400
Look, I mean, we're brothers.
We're gonna argue, it's human nature.

437
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,700
- Show me the perfect family.
- His flock goes untended in the field.

438
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,700
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

439
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,300
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

440
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I mean, just get off my back, Father.

441
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,100
I wish you were dead too.
Even though Abel's not dead at all.

442
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,000
I fear the worst for Abel.
I'm sorely vexed.

443
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
You're welcome to spend this night
with us.

444
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,100
You may lay with my daughter Lilith.

445
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,800
She is without a husband...

446
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,500
...and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply."

447
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What about me?

448
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,400
You may share the bed
of my son Seth.

449
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,600
- Thanks, Papa.
- Yeah, there you go.

450
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,700
I multiplied with sheep.

451
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
Smell that.

452
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Hello.

453
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,200
Feeling fruitful?

454
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,900
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my people.

455
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,300
That is such a good way to be.

456
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,700
In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty
girl like you is sleeping alone, anyway.

457
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,300
I'd have thought
guys would be lined up at the door.

458
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,700
- Oh. I don't like men.
- Maybe...

459
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,600
...you just ain't met the right one yet.

460
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Loincloth rising.

461
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,900
- No, I like girls.
- We have that in common.

462
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,800
No, I'm attracted to women.

463
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
I don't even know what that means.

464
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,600
- What does that mean?
- I like to have sex with other women.

465
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
All my brain blood was in my boner.

466
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,600
That was such a good one.

467
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay, here we go. Ready, ready?

468
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,900
No, wait.

469
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,100
Little surprise on the end
of that one, right?

470
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
- Very good.
- One more, ready?

471
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,900
No, we're good.
Oh, do you wanna see a trick?

472
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Do I have to?

473
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Your brother Seth
is an interesting guy.

474
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Did you know he can put
his own penis in his mouth?

475
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
I did not know that.

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Whole thing. Right in there.

477
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,800
It's been a great sleepover...

478
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,900
...and thank you
for the gruel and the garb.

479
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,100
- Where's everybody going?
- To look for thy brother Abel.

480
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
- Good luck.
- What?

481
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,500
I said, good luck, Father.
I'm really worried about him.

482
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,800
You're not coming?

483
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,100
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

484
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,900
...and then we'll be right behind you.
- Good.

485
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,900
Hey, I'm heading to the coast.
You guys should come with me.

486
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,300
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you.

487
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,600
- Why blame it on us?
- When they find him...

488
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,400
...and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers. You're drifters.

489
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
They're gonna put two
and two together.

490
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,700
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go. Go, go, go.

491
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,300
Cain. After him.

492
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,900
- They're gaining on us.
- They're getting away.

493
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,900
- Eat my dust, Father.
- This is really too fast.

494
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
- Oh, no, no.
- Hold tight. Hold tight.

495
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Cain! My justice will be swift.

496
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,800
No. No! Damn you, Cain.

497
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

498
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,500
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

499
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Your head's smoking.

500
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,500
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

501
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,400
Just a pink, red hole.

502
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,900
- Your bangs are gonna cover it.
- All right. Whatever.

503
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen.

504
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,900
It's called a town. Just act normal.

505
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,200
- Hi.
- Hello. Greetings, seafarer.

506
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
- That's not normal.
- Hello.

507
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody? It's annoying.

508
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,000
All right, this is a market.
Over there is a Build-A-Bear.

509
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,700
That's a really good container store.
Oh, this place has killer hemp.

510
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,700
- Yes, please.
- Next up is an unusual item.

511
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
- He's big. He's strong.
- It's Marlak.

512
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh, do not worry. He is not fighting,
he is having fun.

513
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,700
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed.

514
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Maya and Eema.

515
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
- Zed.
- Eema.

516
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,600
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Gosh.

517
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
What happened?
How did you get here?

518
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,300
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village.

519
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,600
They held us captive...

520
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,800
...and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here.

521
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,200
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here.

522
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,800
- You think it's a coincidence?
- What do you think?

523
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason.

524
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,500
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil.

525
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,500
- Why would he want that?
- Why are we assuming God's a he?

526
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,900
I don't know what to say to that.

527
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,500
You kidding?

528
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,000
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

529
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,200
Why would he choose you?

530
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,500
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

531
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,300
Chosen doesn't have to be strong.
I'm big like this.

532
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,700
- You have a fat face.
- My brain. It's enormous.

533
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm smarter than you are.
I don't talk as much.

534
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm the smartest guy in the village.

535
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village.

536
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,000
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

537
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,000
Yes.

538
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,800
- This one looks pretty good.
- And her little friend. Very good.

539
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,500
- Just how I like them.
- Hey.

540
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,100
Feisty.

541
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,300
So how do we do this
if we want them?

542
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,000
You have money?

543
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,900
That depends
on what you mean by money.

544
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,900
Excuse me.
Perhaps I could be of some help here.

545
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,000
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal.

546
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
What happened to your forehead?

547
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,900
I didn't murder my brother. I didn't.

548
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,600
All right, I'm just gonna...

549
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,900
We're gonna get you out of this.
You trust me?

550
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,900
- I want to trust you.
- Fair enough.

551
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Next up is a twofer.
It is two for price of one.

552
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
Have a great vacation.

553
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,400
Never trusted that guy.

554
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,700
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

555
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,200
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts.

556
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,500
Sorry, do you think you could move
your hands, please?

557
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Yeah.

558
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,900
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

559
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,500
Enmebaragesi, can you move that way
a little bit? We're crowded back here.

560
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,300
Oh, yeah, no problem.
How's that?

561
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Look, I want you to know...

562
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,500
...I blame myself for everything
that's happened.

563
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,200
- Yeah. So does everybody else.
- Stay away from my woman.

564
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,600
Not gonna be possible, Marlak.

565
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,600
She's not your woman.
You can't own people.

566
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Except for the guy who bought
all of us. Apparently, he can.

567
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
- That's it.
- What?

568
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
- I'm gonna kill you!
- "I'm gonna kill you."

569
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,200
You always say, "I'm gonna kill you"
and you never do.

570
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,100
Be still. Don't make me come in there.

571
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
I'd like to see you try.

572
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,900
Take the slaves!

573
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,700
Go!

574
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,600
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you.

575
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,700
- Zed!
- Eema.

576
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,200
Come here, you two.

577
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,700
Go, go, go, go.

578
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

579
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
Let the desert have them.
They won't get far.

580
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,500
Yes, sir.

581
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,700
- Orders, sir?
- Tend to the slaves.

582
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,000
- We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
I wonder who they are.

584
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,200
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

585
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,700
Their hats?

586
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,900
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

587
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
...I wasn't thinking about
what a great hat.

588
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,100
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there.

589
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
I'm just saying, if I can snag one,
I'm going to.

590
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,000
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema.

591
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,500
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers.

592
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,500
Even killers have to sleep sometime.

593
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
That was refreshing.

594
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,800
Shit!

595
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
They're gone.

596
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,700
Now where do we go?

597
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,900
They said they were going to Sodom.
We're going to Sodom.

598
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,300
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure.

599
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom.

600
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
We making a burnt offering
or something?

601
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,100
Yes, Isaac.
As God has commanded me.

602
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,000
But I don't see the sheep anywhere.

603
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,800
The Lord. The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son.

604
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,200
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

605
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
In a way. In a way.

606
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry.

607
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,900
I'll do it right when I get home.

608
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

609
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,000
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him.

610
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,400
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

611
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
- Forgive me, Isaac.
- My God.

612
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

613
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,300
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

614
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,200
This is my son, sir.
We were playing a game.

615
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,400
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut.

616
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
You weren't.
You were gonna kill him.

617
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,600
I was not going to kill him.
I was going to sacrifice him.

618
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,300
- There is a tremendous difference.
- Not to him.

619
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,100
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

620
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

621
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,500
- Aye. Aye, verily, thou art.
- Verily. Yea.

622
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,700
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand.

623
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,600
- All of that.
- This is Isaac.

624
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,100
And I am Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor.

625
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,800
We were two doors down from Nahor.
We were Nahor's neighbors.

626
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,800
And I am Zed, son of Zero.

627
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,100
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung.

628
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,700
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond.

629
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,500
Come. Come, my friends.

630
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
We are the Hebrews.

631
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,100
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports.

632
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,800
This way, friends. Come.

633
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,600
Brothers, brothers.

634
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,200
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

635
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,400
...for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day.

636
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name.

637
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,200
And let us also praise him...

638
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,500
...for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us.

639
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,200
He hath increased our wealth...

640
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,900
...and blessed us with...

641
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,100
Thanks. Thank you.
A lot of loving things.

642
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,700
- Kind loving kindness.
- Yeah.

643
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Friends, whence comest thou?

644
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
- He wants to know where you're from.
- Thou comest not from...

645
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,300
...the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah.

646
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,700
- Heard of them, never been there.
- Are they nice?

647
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,100
"Are they nice?"

648
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,000
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

649
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,600
...for their abominations.
- I did not know that.

650
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,000
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods.

651
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,100
- Abdominal.
- It's the worst.

652
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,300
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

653
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,700
...fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.

654
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm not hearing the bad part.

655
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,500
The women are whores.

656
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,100
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds.

657
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
They flaunt their flesh...

658
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,100
...and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth.

659
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,100
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

660
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially.

661
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,100
Walk you not the path of Sodom.

662
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,700
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

663
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,800
...that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

664
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,800
...and all who dwell within
for their iniquity.

665
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,900
He shall smite them.

666
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,800
Them, and all of their seed.

667
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,900
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

668
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,700
- Because we have some friends there.
- Their fate is sealed.

669
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,000
But for my faith and devotion...

670
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
...that self-same God...

671
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,300
...has promised unto me
the whole of this land.

672
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south.

673
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,100
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea.

674
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,300
- This is all your land?
- For all of eternity.

675
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,800
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else.

676
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,900
We're at war with someone
every other day.

677
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,100
Excuse me. I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

678
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,900
...by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he.

679
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,300
- Praised is his name...
- Unto us.

680
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
...and glory his graciousness.
- Wealthy bounty.

681
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Therefore, to signify my covenant
with the one true God...

682
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,800
...I shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis.

683
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,400
And of you. And you, and of you,
and every male who dwelleth hereby.

684
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,700
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what you mean.

685
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,000
We shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises...

686
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,600
...and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh. Amen.

687
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,200
I don't think I have any extra.

688
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,000
- Couldn't we pierce our ears?
- No, no, no.

689
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,600
So it shall be written,
and so it shall be done.

690
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,400
Let me get this straight. You're saying
you have too much cock?

691
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,000
And you wanna:

692
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,400
You know, Abe, it's been a long day,
we've all had a lot to drink...

693
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,000
...and I know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now...

694
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,300
...but you might wanna sleep on it.

695
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,300
We can always cut it off
in the morning.

696
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,700
But if we do it now, there's just no way
to get it back on there.

697
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,700
No, no, no, trust me, it's gonna be
a very, very sleek look.

698
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,100
This is gonna catch on. I'm gonna go
get my good knife.

699
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Just wait right there. I'll be right back
to cut your penises.

700
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,400
Not the whole thing,
you understand. Just the very tip.

701
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,700
And after, we're all gonna have wine
and sponge cake.

702
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,200
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

703
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,500
Going to Sodom.
We have to save Maya and Eema.

704
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,200
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire.

705
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,600
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick.

706
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,200
Dad, no! No! No!

707
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,700
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

708
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,600
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine.

709
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,400
- What if the tip is your favorite part?
- The tip is your only part.

710
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,100
Come out here.

711
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,800
Hey, you caught me. Guilty.

712
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,100
What are you doing here?

713
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,600
- I'm gonna come.
- You don't know where we're going.

714
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,400
- You're going to Sodom, right?
- No.

715
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,200
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

716
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,300
...since my dad mentioned it.
If I take you, get me some wine.

717
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,900
Aren't you a bit young?

718
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,500
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

719
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,700
My dad just trimmed my dick skin.

720
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,700
That's Sodom right there.
The Unholy Land.

721
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,900
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners.

722
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,800
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes.

723
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,600
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb.

724
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,200
- Shouldn't be smoking either.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

725
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,200
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good.

726
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,600
These doors are enormous.

727
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,400
- It looks like they're not open, so...
- You just gotta knock.

728
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,500
- They let me in all the time.
- Yeah, knock.

729
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,200
- Why don't you knock?
- You knock.

730
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,300
- What if we're waking somebody?
- Eema and Maya might be in there.

731
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,200
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them.

732
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
I want to get my dicky sticky.

733
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,100
- Halt. Halt.
- Get help. Tell your father.

734
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,000
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom.

735
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,400
So long, suckers.

736
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him.

737
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,100
Get in.

738
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,700
- What's this, then?
- They were banging on the gate.

739
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,800
- Hebrews from the look of them.
- Well, we're not really Hebrews.

740
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,200
We are Hebrews?

741
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,500
I get it. No talking.

742
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,800
- Should we wake the commander?
- Oh, no.

743
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,100
Don't want to wake the commander.
He gets mean when you wake him.

744
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
Meaner than this?

745
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Let go of his titty.

746
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,300
Yeah. Okay. All right, good one.

747
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,700
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

748
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,300
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman.

749
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,600
But you don't look like a woman.
You wanna kiss me?

750
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,900
Like in a romantic way?

751
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,100
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born.

752
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
- I already feel that way right now.
- Yeah.

753
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

754
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,000
Because that I would pay to see.
You versus a guy your size.

755
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
Give me my stick.

756
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,500
Bumpy. You got a smoother one?

757
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,500
Yeah.

758
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,200
Turn around
and put your hands on the table.

759
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,700
Now!

760
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,500
I'll take that kiss now.

761
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,800
- We'll start with the fat one.
- Relatively fat. I mean...

762
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,600
- Welcome to Sodom.
- Hey, I want a piece of that.

763
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,600
- Cain?
- You know them?

764
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,800
Brothers.

765
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,900
I missed you so much. Oh, you guys.
Promise you'll never leave me again.

766
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,600
- This is amazing.
- And this is a Monday.

767
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
You should see this place
on a Thursday.

768
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,000
- Because Thursday's the new Friday.
- Well, thanks for saving us.

769
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,000
- What are you gonna do to us now?
- Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

770
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,200
You did sell us into slavery.

771
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,600
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago.

772
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,900
It was less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight.

773
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,200
- It was a sevennight.
- Oh, give me a break.

774
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,100
I was dealing with the death...

775
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,600
...of a close, personal family member
and I needed some space.

776
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,800
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers.

777
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,500
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill.

778
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

779
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,200
Hey, who's hungry?

780
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,600
- I'm hungry.
- Don't kill me.

781
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
Yeah? Okay.

782
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,500
Excuse me, I was...

783
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,500
Yeah, that's two for flinching.
Hey, let's go.

784
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,400
Here. Now we're even.

785
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,100
Check out the woman across the way.
She's looking at us.

786
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,100
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now.

787
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,100
Well, she's really making
that banana last.

788
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,600
- Go talk to her.
- I kind of have a girlfriend right now.

789
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,800
A girl that I'm going to marry.

790
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,600
Make my wife, make her my girlfriend
one day when I get enough strength.

791
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,300
What transpires within the confines
of the walls of Sodom...

792
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,400
...stays within the confines of the walls
of Sodom.

793
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,100
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard.

794
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,500
- Hey!
- Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah.

795
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,800
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them.

796
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,600
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go.
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant.

797
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,500
- Let's go.
- Hurry now.

798
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,700
This is great. How do I look?

799
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,700
I can't see. This is too big on me.
I wonder if I can get a smaller size.

800
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here.

801
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,800
- Find a...
- Excuse me.

802
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,200
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me. It looks really silly.

803
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,200
- Think I can get a smaller one?
- Line up!

804
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,800
- What are you doing? In the line.
- Wait, he's not...

805
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,600
In the line. Face forward in the line.

806
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,000
- Guys. Guys?
- I don't know where to...

807
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,000
- Guys.
- You too!

808
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,100
- Guys.
- Find a hole, you stupid bastards.

809
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,300
- It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
- Not to me.

810
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,900
Soldiers. Present arms.

811
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,500
I never got a sword.
I only got the holder.

812
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,000
I didn't know
that that's what it was for.

813
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,500
- So this is it? We just walk around?
- Yeah, pretty much.

814
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,000
Just look for troublemakers.

815
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,200
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit.

816
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,400
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes.

817
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,200
Lower lip. Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion.

818
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,600
It seems kind of harsh.

819
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,500
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people. Come on.

820
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,000
Feed us!

821
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,900
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain.

822
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets.

823
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,800
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high.

824
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,400
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food.

825
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,500
We could actually have a riot
on our hands.

826
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,900
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to.

827
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,200
It is the will of the gods.
What do the entrails predict?

828
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,700
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

829
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,300
...but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

830
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,400
...which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region.

831
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,400
The genitals are enormous.

832
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,900
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting.

833
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,800
If you do look at this intestine...

834
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,400
...his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

835
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,300
...then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes.

836
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,100
To me, I see a happy face.
That makes me happy.

837
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,900
What does it mean?

838
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:51,000
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart.

839
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,500
Or that you're going
on a long sea voyage.

840
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,500
Could I come?
I've never been on a boat.

841
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,100
How did you become high priest?

842
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,400
I'm your brother-in-law.

843
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,000
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest.

844
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,800
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest.

845
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Let that be a warning to you.

846
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,700
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face.

847
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Or a fireball.

848
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,500
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy.

849
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,600
You guys are in for a treat.

850
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,200
Down.

851
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,600
Did you see that girl?

852
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,300
That was Princess Inanna.

853
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,100
She's totally hot.
Don't even think about it.

854
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
Why not?

855
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,600
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman.

856
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,000
Where's everybody going?

857
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,400
To the temple.
You guys have to see this.

858
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,800
- Will she be there?
- Yeah, everyone'll be there.

859
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,900
There she is.

860
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,100
The princess isn't eating.

861
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,800
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry.

862
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,200
- You can't keep starving yourself.
- Why not?

863
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,300
Everybody else is starving.
Present company excluded.

864
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,100
Careful, princess.

865
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,600
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

866
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,300
...and those are dangerous words.
- Whatever.

867
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,500
Hi.

868
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,200
Yeah.

869
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,800
- What's happening?
- They're picking a virgin.

870
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,800
Oh, please. If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil.

871
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,400
Back to the whorehouse with you.
Quick as a bunny. There you go.

872
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,000
What do they need a virgin for?

873
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,400
- To throw her in the fire. Are you new?
- What? Why?

874
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,600
An offering to the gods.

875
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,400
- Are you serious?
- There's a famine going on...

876
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,000
...so if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

877
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,600
...then the gods give us rain.
You get rain, you get harvest...

878
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,400
...you get harvest, you get food.
You know what food is?

879
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,000
Yeah, you know food.

880
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,200
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

881
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,400
Where do you think rain
comes from? Clouds?

882
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,100
My 6-year-old knows.

883
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,200
- Hey, how do you get rain?
- Burn a virgin.

884
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,900
I didn't think
it was anything related to...

885
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,300
Yeah, yeah. "I didn't think,
I didn't think."

886
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,200
It's the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned.

887
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,300
Did I do something to offend you?

888
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,900
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it.

889
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,800
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me.

890
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,400
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family.

891
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,600
Do you mind? Do you mind?

892
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,000
For the love of the gods...

893
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,900
...we commit this fair maiden...

894
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,800
...to Moloch's holy fire.

895
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,300
These virgins, it's always a girl?

896
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,700
I'm really happy for her.
She was always the runner-up.

897
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,900
True success story.

898
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,200
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you.

899
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,200
Me? What about my friend?

900
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,100
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair.

901
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three of us are like a pair.

902
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,700
No, not you.
The two of you, follow me.

903
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,500
Great.

904
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,200
- I'll try to put a good word in for you.
- Yeah, do.

905
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,200
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you.

906
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,100
Don't forget about me.

907
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,100
This is Zaftig, the eunuch.
You, go with him.

908
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,100
Oh, can't I go with him?

909
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,000
- Why? Is he your lover?
- No, we're just friends.

910
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,400
That would be weird.
We're both guys.

911
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,500
- Come with me.
- What do you do?

912
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,200
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old.

913
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,100
- How would I become a eunuch?
- They cut off your testicles.

914
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,000
Why all the genital mutilation?

915
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,400
Well, you get to keep them.
I always keep mine close at hand.

916
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,400
Would you like to see?

917
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,900
No.

918
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,600
Can I ask your opinion?

919
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,000
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

920
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,200
- I don't know and I really don't care.
- Okay. I just wanted to know...

921
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,900
...what the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...

922
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,600
This party is insane.

923
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,700
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say.

924
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,900
Hi.

925
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Be sure to try the fruit.

926
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,600
Maya. What are you doing here?

927
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,600
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

928
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,400
...and I'm still a slave.

929
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,800
I was coming to rescue you. Really.
That's why we were here.

930
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,400
- We were gonna find you.
- Yeah?

931
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,400
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago.

932
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,600
I was just...

933
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,200
- You were just chosen again.
- I was.

934
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,000
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

935
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,800
...because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks.

936
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,700
And the princess has crabs.

937
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,400
Oh, yes, it's steamy.

938
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,600
God, that's realistic.

939
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,600
Watch it, jerk.

940
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,300
A real woman, that's...

941
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
Oh, excuse me, Miss...

942
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,200
Ter. Mister. Awkward.

943
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,200
Good concentration.

944
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,200
You're good. You're real good.

945
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,900
- Oh? Is that you?
- I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue.

946
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:53,200
- Yeah, you look so gold.
- It's all the gold paint.

947
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,300
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

948
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,500
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls.

949
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,800
- Oh, how did that go?
- He was extremely thorough.

950
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
- How's it going with you?
- Not bad.

951
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,300
Just had a little rub and scrub.
Now I'm up for some grub.

952
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,000
- Sounds luxurious.
- Hey.

953
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,900
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

954
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,500
That was Maya. She's working here
now and she looks great.

955
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,100
- Kind of mad at me, though.
- And there's Eema.

956
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,200
Come here, wench.

957
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,200
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt.

958
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,600
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- It was no accident.

959
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,800
Hey. You. Slave girl.
I told you to fetch me more wine.

960
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,600
- Apologize to this officer now.
- I'm sorry.

961
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,700
Good. Now go fetch.
Wait over there by the skinny statue.

962
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,800
I'll deal with you later. Go!

963
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,900
Slaves. What are you gonna do?

964
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,800
Wait a minute.

965
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,300
Don't I know you?

966
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,800
- What are you, crazy?
- I will not serve these people.

967
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,500
- I'd rather die.
- Keep it up. You will.

968
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,900
Have you joined them?

969
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,400
I haven't joined anything.
I'm not having fun.

970
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm just checking it out.
A lot to learn here.

971
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,200
- What, human sacrifice?
- No. No human sacrifices.

972
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,500
I've been chosen
to do something great.

973
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,900
Yeah, here we go.

974
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,600
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets.

975
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,900
- Oh?
- Hello, Maya.

976
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,100
She wants to see you. Now.

977
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,800
Don't think
I'm interested in her.

978
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,300
- Whyever would I think that?
- It's part of my plan.

979
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can.

980
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,800
- The princess awaits you.
- And I await her.

981
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,600
You two, await me.
Stay out of trouble. Stay gold.

982
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,800
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

983
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,800
- It's nice to see you like this.
- It's nice to see you too.

984
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,300
We should do something.
When do you get off?

985
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,800
- Never. I'm a slave.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

986
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,400
Slave girl, bring me a towel.

987
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,200
Yeah, I should go be a slave.

988
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,900
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess.

989
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,800
- Okay.
- I love you.

990
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,900
You there. Golden boy.
Come here.

991
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,100
Rub me with oil.

992
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,400
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
That's not...

993
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,800
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard.

994
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,800
Rub me with oil or die.

995
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,200
- Is that enough?
- Much more. Baste me like a chicken.

996
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:08,000
Oh, yes. Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet.

997
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah, okay. You got the whole thing
on you now.

998
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,600
Marvelous, I love it.

999
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,200
All right, well, have a good evening.
I'm glad I could help you out.

1000
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,600
Now rub it in.

1001
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,500
With my hand?

1002
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,200
No. With your nutsack.
Of course, with your hand.

1003
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,500
Oh, yes.

1004
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,400
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness.

1005
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,900
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness.

1006
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,200
Yes, that's right.
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body.

1007
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,100
- Tell a story on my nipples.
- Yeah.

1008
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,900
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates.

1009
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,400
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

1010
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,100
...you naughty little goat.
All right, charm the snake.

1011
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,600
- Eema. Hey...
- Oh, just like that. Now slap me.

1012
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,700
- This isn't what it looks like.
- My tummy. Go ahead, slap me.

1013
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,100
- Slap me. Slap the tummy.
- No, it's fine. I mean, I understand.

1014
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,500
Go on. I love it, I love it.
Oh, you're very gifted.

1015
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,000
No, no, no. I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest. Eema.

1016
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,400
A gift. I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift.

1017
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,000
- Good luck.
- Look, Maya. Maya.

1018
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,700
Come to me.

1019
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,100
Beautiful, isn't it?

1020
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,700
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.

1021
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,900
Yep. Twin cities.

1022
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,500
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

1023
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,000
...because they're so evil.
- And what do you think? Am I evil?

1024
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,100
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil.

1025
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,000
Do you find me attractive?

1026
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,800
Yeah.

1027
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,300
Let me ask you one thing.

1028
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,000
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

1029
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,600
I don't know.
I just find you interesting.

1030
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,000
They say it's the will of the gods...

1031
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,700
...that some men should suffer
while others rule.

1032
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,400
That we're all just victims
of our own fate.

1033
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,300
I believed that until this morning...

1034
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,100
...when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

1035
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:18,100
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything.

1036
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,100
A man with the courage
to question the order of things.

1037
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:26,600
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great."

1038
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,600
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.

1039
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,100
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me.

1040
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,900
- I just didn't know why.
- I know why.

1041
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,300
To bring you here. To this place.
To me.

1042
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,400
I could not agree more.

1043
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,100
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree.

1044
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,600
Come.

1045
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,500
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

1046
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,400
...but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

1047
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,700
...and the good of the people.
I keep nothing for myself.

1048
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,200
- That's very unselfish of you.
- It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

1049
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,400
You're so perceptive
for one so young.

1050
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,600
- Yeah. What are those doors there?
- Behind these doors...

1051
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,700
...is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods.

1052
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,100
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

1053
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,400
...that to enter is instant death.

1054
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,100
- Who cleans it?
- Needs no cleaning.

1055
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,800
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it.

1056
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,700
Like, did they die instantly...

1057
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,800
...or were they given
a courtesy second...

1058
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,800
...to get out of there by the gods?

1059
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,700
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds...

1060
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,800
...then the gods descended.

1061
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,800
- What if a bug goes in there?
- Instant death for the bug.

1062
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,900
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it.

1063
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
They're vaporized immediately...

1064
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,400
...by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor.

1065
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,500
- Can we go in?
- I just told you.

1066
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,300
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce.

1067
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,000
Can't even poke our heads in?

1068
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,100
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

1069
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,700
You want to know it all
and taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

1070
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,800
...dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

1071
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,300
I've got a riddle for you.

1072
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,200
What has two thumbs...

1073
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,500
...and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

1074
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,600
- What?
- This person.

1075
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,000
Come on. Let's go.

1076
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,100
- Come. Come quick.
- That will not be a problem.

1077
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,700
What are we doing here?

1078
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,900
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies.

1079
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,900
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

1080
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,100
...because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys.

1081
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,400
- Oh, no. That's the Holy of Holies.
- I thought you were talking about...

1082
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,800
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods.

1083
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,500
- The gods are in there?
- So they say.

1084
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,000
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest.

1085
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,900
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter.

1086
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:00,400
- Then why am I going in?
- Because you've been chosen.

1087
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,400
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already.

1088
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,500
- Right.
- This is what you've been chosen for.

1089
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,000
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

1090
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,500
...and plead with them
to end this terrible famine.

1091
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,100
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside.

1092
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

1093
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,800
Right.

1094
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,000
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure.

1095
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,800
You're chosen.

1096
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,300
Okay. I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me.

1097
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,500
- You gotta let my friends go.
- Anything.

1098
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,700
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me...

1099
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,400
Get up. You look ridiculous.

1100
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,800
- Oh? What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from the high priest.

1101
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,200
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him.

1102
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,000
Is that chest hair?

1103
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,400
Not all of it. Just don't ask, okay?

1104
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,600
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong.

1105
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,300
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

1106
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,900
- I don't know. How did you?
- Because I'm a chosen.

1107
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,300
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower.

1108
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,200
- I'm not your follower.
- Why are you always following me?

1109
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,900
I'm not following you. I walk
behind you at the same pace as you.

1110
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,300
Not following.
I could be leading from the rear.

1111
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,600
Come on. I'm the leader.
I always have been.

1112
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,900
Some leader.
Told us you were gonna get us out.

1113
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,300
- Just been messing around at orgies.
- Messing around at orgies?

1114
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,700
No, no. I'm not like you.

1115
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,600
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun.

1116
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,900
- I have no downtime.
- Please. Your whole life is downtime.

1117
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,500
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks.

1118
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,700
I'm about to show you something.
Observe.

1119
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,100
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

1120
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,600
...I need to ask a favor of you.

1121
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,500
I know
I've really messed things up...

1122
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,200
...but I really need to come through
on this one...

1123
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,500
...and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends.

1124
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,500
- And that's it, that's the favor.
- Oh, shit.

1125
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,400
And also,
if you could just make it rain...

1126
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,300
...or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin, you know what I mean?

1127
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,800
Because we need our virgins
at the moment.

1128
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,200
And also, if you could give me
the power...

1129
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,100
...to see through women's clothing
without them knowing...

1130
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,200
...that would be really great.

1131
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,200
Hello?

1132
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,700
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

1133
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,600
...because God is not in here?
Look around. There's nothing in here.

1134
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,400
That doesn't prove anything.
Maybe he stepped away.

1135
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,400
- For what?
- God stuff.

1136
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,000
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing.

1137
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,000
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

1138
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Let me just put something out there.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

1139
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,900
What? So everything is just random?

1140
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,800
Then nothing would mean anything.

1141
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,100
- What would be the point?
- That is the point.

1142
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,200
That there's no point? That's stupid.

1143
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,400
- You're stupid.
- No.

1144
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,800
- There's something bigger than me.
- There's nothing bigger than you.

1145
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
- Don't touch my belly to make a point.
- Fine.

1146
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,700
- Okay. I'm sorry, I have a man's body.
- I'm maturing at my own pace.

1147
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,400
- You are so jealous of me.
- Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

1148
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,600
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

1149
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,000
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman.

1150
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,600
- I'm a virgin by choice.
- Not your choice.

1151
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,500
- Take that back.
- I won't.

1152
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,000
- Take back what you said.
- Take back what you said.

1153
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,500
Everything you've ever said.

1154
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,000
Don't stand close.
Get your belly off of my belly.

1155
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,400
Don't touch my belly.

1156
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,800
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever.

1157
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,700
Take everything
you've ever said back.

1158
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,900
- You're out of control.
- You're a freak.

1159
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,600
- Stop screaming, stop screaming.
- You're a freak! Get off me.

1160
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,800
I can pull this thing together.
The princess is right out there.

1161
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,400
And if I play this right...

1162
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,700
...l'm gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too.

1163
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,000
Just trust in me. Have a little faith.

1164
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,800
Fine, but not for you. For Eema.
And I'm too tired to argue right now.

1165
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,500
I had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded.

1166
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,100
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard.

1167
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,300
Let's go. Freak.

1168
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,200
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

1169
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,700
...I would be very grateful. Okay?

1170
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,200
If you do exist.

1171
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,900
You guys waiting to go in there?

1172
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,200
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal.

1173
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,200
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in.

1174
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,400
Seize him.

1175
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,500
I'm seized.

1176
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,800
I wish I was upside down.

1177
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,700
Looks kind of fun.

1178
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,700
Is it fun?

1179
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,200
So you're not talking to me?

1180
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,000
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

1181
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,000
- What have you done for me?
- I brought you out of your shell.

1182
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,500
Yeah? I liked my shell.
I liked the village.

1183
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,200
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

1184
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,100
...and they burn women
and they make people slaves.

1185
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,300
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

1186
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,400
...and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

1187
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,100
...and it's because of you.

1188
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,800
Please forgive me.
I mean, you are my best friend.

1189
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,200
I hate the world! I hate you!

1190
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,200
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee.

1191
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,800
I know I'm not perfect.

1192
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,300
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen.

1193
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,100
That's a lot of responsibility.
You can't even imagine.

1194
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,800
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you. So shut up already!

1195
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,100
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do.

1196
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,100
That was just my first idea.

1197
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm also accepting ideas.

1198
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,000
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

1199
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,200
Oh, I'm peeing.

1200
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Oh, no.

1201
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,000
Try to keep your mouth closed.

1202
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,100
Oh, no. In the nose.

1203
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,900
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside.

1204
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,800
I hate you.

1205
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,300
Observe, my dear...

1206
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,100
...since it was you
who lured him to his death.

1207
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,100
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

1208
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,900
...heresy...

1209
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,100
...conspiracy..."

1210
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,700
- What you thinking about?
- "Treachery...

1211
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,100
...leprosy..."

1212
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,600
Trying to make conversation.

1213
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,400
"Puppetry...

1214
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,200
...hyperbole..."
- Your hair looks really good today.

1215
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,400
- I peed all over it.
- Then that's the secret, I guess.

1216
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,200
"Sodomy..."

1217
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,600
- Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy."
- Yeah!

1218
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,100
Can you just forgive me?

1219
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,900
I think I hate you too much.

1220
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,200
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel."

1221
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,100
- Oh, come on!
- Shut it!

1222
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,500
For these, and other crimes...

1223
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,800
...the prisoners shall be stoned...

1224
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,400
...to death!

1225
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,300
- Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
- What?

1226
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,700
Just have one person throw stones
at us.

1227
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,000
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us.

1228
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,700
No. That doesn't make any...

1229
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,200
- We want that guy.
- That guy.

1230
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
- Me?
- That's our stoner.

1231
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,600
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

1232
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
I'll show you throwing.

1233
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,200
No, no. No, no, no! Gross.

1234
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,700
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular.

1235
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,300
No! That doesn't count.
That was a testicle.

1236
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,700
I think it counts.

1237
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,200
- Pick somebody else.
- What is that idiot doing?

1238
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,200
- I pick that guy!
- Nice.

1239
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,000
- This guy?
- No, no, the shorter man.

1240
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,100
Right in front of him.

1241
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,800
It's a kid. This is a kid.

1242
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,600
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids.

1243
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,500
- Let me smite him!
- Kid hater!

1244
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,000
- One shot!
- No, they're our future!

1245
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,600
All right. Hey, go ahead and...

1246
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,700
Okay. I'm hit.

1247
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,100
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm.

1248
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,300
God. There's two of us.

1249
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Are you guys happy now?

1250
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:15,800
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two...

1251
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Wait! I have a question for the king.

1252
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,200
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

1253
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:32,000
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die.

1254
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:37,600
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

1255
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,200
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

1256
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,600
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

1257
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,600
- Spare the chosen one!
- And his friend!

1258
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,900
- And his young friend.
- Don't kill either of them.

1259
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,700
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one.

1260
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,800
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

1261
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,200
Well, of course it's possible.
Highly doubtful.

1262
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,600
Majesty, with respect...

1263
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,500
...whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue.

1264
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,500
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

1265
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,700
...it could inflame the situation
so as...

1266
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:20,200
...to cause a radical regime change.

1267
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,900
If you take my meaning.

1268
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,600
Yes, that will do.

1269
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:38,100
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

1270
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:44,700
...to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

1271
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,900
Yes!

1272
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,100
And how is that better?

1273
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,000
You seem to enjoy your work.
How long have you been a slave?

1274
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,400
Oh, I'm not a slave. I'm a volunteer.

1275
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,400
Marlak. Enmebaragesi.
Long time no see.

1276
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,200
I deserve that.

1277
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,700
Take these bricks up top.
The masons are waiting.

1278
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,700
I would but I did something to my
neck. I think I slept on it funny.

1279
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,200
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow.

1280
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,300
Move!

1281
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,900
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin.

1282
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,600
- Yeah.
- Ask me why my skin's so good.

1283
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,100
- Why's your skin...?
- The mud.

1284
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,700
I knew you were gonna say that.

1285
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,700
You gotta love being outside.

1286
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,200
Move it!

1287
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,700
Faster!

1288
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,700
- Want some water?
- You're from the village, aren't you?

1289
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,200
I'll bet you wish you were back there
right now.

1290
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,400
- Yeah.
- Don't give up.

1291
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,200
You'll get home someday.

1292
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,000
Who's gonna take him there?
The chosen one?

1293
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,500
You two, up! Get on line. Now.

1294
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,000
- Where are we going?
- To watch the sacrifice.

1295
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,700
- The king demands it.
- Is it compulsory?

1296
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,000
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow.

1297
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,500
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip.

1298
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,400
Same basic size.

1299
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,800
All is in readiness, Your Majesty.

1300
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

1301
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,800
Yes, two. Your own handmaiden
and another slave.

1302
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,900
Followers of the chosen one.
Discovered by this loyal soldier.

1303
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,600
Oh, I was just doing my job.
It's what I do.

1304
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,400
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity.

1305
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

1306
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,200
...we offer a humble sacrifice:

1307
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,300
our own stepdaughter...

1308
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,200
...the Princess Inanna.

1309
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,700
- You're insane.
- For the good of the people, darling.

1310
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,700
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

1311
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,000
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her.

1312
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,500
Mother.

1313
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,300
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

1314
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,100
Burn her.

1315
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,300
Drink it. You won't feel a thing.

1316
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,300
Are they booing me?
How dare they.

1317
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,400
They love you.
They're wooing you.

1318
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,800
That's fine. You know?

1319
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,700
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

1320
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,900
No, don't kill them!

1321
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,700
- Far enough, slave.
- No, kill me! I'm a male virgin.

1322
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,300
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

1323
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,300
Eema. Eema!

1324
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
- I gotta get down there.
- Over my dead body.

1325
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,100
- No problem.
- No. Hey! Hey! Hey!

1326
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,300
- Thanks, Marlak.
- Now what?

1327
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,700
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

1328
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,100
...so that we may honor
your divine will.

1329
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,100
Take this end. Lower me down.

1330
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,000
Oh, dear.

1331
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,800
Oh, no.

1332
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,800
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

1333
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,600
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

1334
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,700
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

1335
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,400
All together!

1336
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,700
Let's cut some foreskins!

1337
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,600
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty.

1338
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,600
Assholes.

1339
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,800
Burn them. Burn them now.
Burn them all!

1340
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,100
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods.

1341
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,500
I don't think so.

1342
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
Zed!

1343
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,300
Guards!

1344
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,200
- Sorry!
- Stupid.

1345
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,600
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

1346
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,700
Okay, we should be safe in here.

1347
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,900
Thank you.

1348
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,300
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

1349
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,100
...but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

1350
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,500
...with the high priest, that...

1351
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,000
He's a friend.
That was totally not a gay thing.

1352
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,600
I always thought
that you and I had a connection.

1353
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,400
So I just wanted to mention it now.

1354
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,600
I always thought that we had
one and maybe...

1355
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,900
...thought you might've
felt the same.

1356
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,200
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say.

1357
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,100
But I always thought... I always
have felt a certain way about you.

1358
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,200
I don't know if you know or not
but you...

1359
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,900
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

1360
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,800
...those were from me.

1361
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,200
- Just kiss me.
- From me like a gift for you.

1362
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,700
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those.

1363
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,400
I always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

1364
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,800
...in a soup or something.

1365
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,400
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical.

1366
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Should I take off my undercloth?

1367
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,200
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

1368
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,000
I'm gonna bash your head in.

1369
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,000
That was a nice shot.

1370
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,700
Hey.

1371
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,100
Hey.

1372
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,100
Zed!

1373
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,100
Get up and die like a man.

1374
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,200
Nobody harm this woman.
She's not a virgin anymore.

1375
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,800
- He's not either.
- I saved her life with my lovemaking.

1376
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,000
Sit tight, Mama. Daddy's gotta fight.

1377
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,800
Okay. No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

1378
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,000
What?

1379
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,300
I just had sex with my new girlfriend.

1380
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
- So?
- I had to tell somebody. It was great.

1381
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,100
I loved it. I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity.

1382
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,900
- What's going on behind you?
- I'm not falling for that.

1383
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,500
Sodomize this!

1384
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,000
Hey, Zed!

1385
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,200
- Stop! No!
- Get back!

1386
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,500
- Let her go!
- No!

1387
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,800
The gods demand a sacrifice.
You're ruining it!

1388
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,200
- How about a little more oil?
- Yes, darling?

1389
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,200
I always knew you'd break my heart.

1390
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,700
A little hot!

1391
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,800
That was ironic.

1392
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,300
So...

1393
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,800
...on behalf of the whole city...

1394
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,800
...l'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice.

1395
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,400
That was really something,
wasn't it?

1396
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,900
Come on. Put your hands together,
it makes a sound.

1397
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:18,300
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>

1398
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,000
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

1399
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,000
Was that a sign from the gods?

1400
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,700
Everybody wants to know.

1401
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,500
Well, I should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

1402
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,800
Yeah!

1403
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,900
You respect me.

1404
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,600
Yeah!

1405
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,500
You love me.

1406
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,300
Yeah!

1407
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,200
You fear me.

1408
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,600
Yeah!

1409
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,500
You would worship me.

1410
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,300
Yeah!

1411
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,800
Yeah!

1412
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,700
Well, don't.

1413
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,400
- Yeah!
- No.

1414
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,600
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't."

1415
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,000
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one.

1416
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,800
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry.

1417
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,900
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

1418
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:30,000
...who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back.

1419
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,300
I'm telling you, you don't need me.

1420
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,100
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny.

1421
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,200
Yeah. Maybe we could all
be chosen.

1422
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,000
Yeah.

1423
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,200
- You! You could be chosen!
- Yeah!

1424
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,100
- And you! And you!
- Yeah!

1425
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,100
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

1426
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,600
Yeah!

1427
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,600
- So you're queen.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

1428
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,800
Yeah, you could've.

1429
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
No, really, I tried for years and...

1430
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:36,600
All right, maybe you couldn't have.
I was pretty amazing with the old...

1431
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,700
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death.

1432
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,400
Oh, please.

1433
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,200
All right.

1434
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,900
Okay.

1435
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,700
See you later.

1436
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,400
Come on, people.

1437
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,700
- Pick up that bag of camel dung.
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,200
Hang on to it all day.

1439
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,500
Hustle up.
These donkeys don't pack themselves.

1440
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,200
- I will kill you where you stand.
- Relax.

1441
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,900
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from.

1442
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,600
This is my woman.
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you.

1443
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,800
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Just go.

1444
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,600
Get out of here or I'll kill you.

1445
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,300
Cranky today.

1446
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,700
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

1447
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,800
Supposed to be a real happening
place. You coming with or not?

1448
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,300
Well, I mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...

1449
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,000
Let me show you this new style.
Everyone's doing it.

1450
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,400
You open your mouth really wide.
It makes it way sexier.

1451
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,900
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet.

1452
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,700
- You know, we'll work on that.
- All right.

1453
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,900
Look at us. Two men.

1454
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,300
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world.

1455
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,500
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

1456
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,400
You don't need me. Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village.

1457
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,700
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen.

1458
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,200
The way you punched that lady? Man!

1459
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,400
I mean, you know...

1460
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,100
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face.

1461
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,600
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire.

1462
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,400
Strangers shake hands.
Get that thing out of here.

1463
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,900
- I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

1464
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,300
Just trying to sniff you.
I wanna remember your scent.

1465
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,400
That's probably the urine in my hair.

1466
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,000
I can't let them see me cry.
They respect me too much.

1467
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,800
Me too. On three.
One, two, three, break.

1468
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,300
Well, may the gods smile on you.
See you around.

1469
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,400
Whatever. Later.

1470
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,200
- Oh?
- What?

1471
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,000
I want you to have babies
with my sister.

1472
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,900
- Try and stop me.
- All right, man.

1473
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,100
- Zed, may the gods smile on you.
- You said that.

1474
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,200
- May they. Yeah.
- Thank you, though.

1475
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,400
All right come on, folks. We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

1476
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,000
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey.
Come on, everyone's looking.

1477
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,500
Please. Go. Good.

1478
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,700
To the north!

1479
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,300
You know that that's west.

1480
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,400
I was just checking to see
if you knew.

1481
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,500
To the west!

1482
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,400
I'm already glad you're here.

1483
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,600
One, two, three, foreskin!

1484
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Invoke your blessing
and do your will.

1485
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,500
What's the fucking line? What is it?

1486
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,600
It was a game.
It was a game of chance...

1487
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,100
...and he hit his head
and he killed himself.

1488
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,300
If anything, it was a suicide.
Okay.

1489
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,500
I let one go.

1490
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:25,900
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

1491
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,200
...l'm going to go back
and say the line again.

1492
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,700
- Let's go back. Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.

1493
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,200
You just want it all.

1494
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,000
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all.

1495
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,200
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

1496
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,000
Sorry.

1497
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,900
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

1498
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,700
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

1499
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,100
I'm an oilman.

1500
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:58,800
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed.

1501
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,400
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

1502
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,200
...and the first man
fell from the stars.

1503
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,700
This is... I don't... This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys.

1504
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,900
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that...?

1505
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,600
What's that?

1506
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,700
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

1507
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:37,500
I weep for the suffering
of my people.

1508
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,600
We're getting boned...

1509
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,100
...by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

1510
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,300
Zed?

1511
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,300
- Oh, that's great.
- Zed? It's constricting me.

1512
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,500
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

1513
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,900
- Yeah.
- It's called a tongue kiss.

1514
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,400
- It's strange. Yeah. Okay.
- Still perfecting it, yeah.

1515
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,900
- It's fine.
- All right.

1516
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,700
What?

1517
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,600
And camera reloading!
