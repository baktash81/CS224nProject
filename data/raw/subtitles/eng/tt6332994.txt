1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,990
For animals,
growing up is a real adventure.

2
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,190
Learning how to
get by in life can be fun,

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,710
but it can also prove testing.

4
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,550
Danger is never far away...

5
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,070
and bad decisions

6
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,750
could land you in
a whole heap of trouble.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,990
ALLIGATOR HISSES

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,190
However, with a little help
from Mum and Dad,

9
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,470
childhood can be an exciting time.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,390
As every day brings
a new lesson for animals

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,590
growing up wild.

12
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,830
For some animals, growing up
is a lonely business.

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,750
They're abandoned
as soon as they're born,

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,990
relying entirely on
their instincts to survive.

15
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,150
From the very beginning of life,
they're left to grow up alone

16
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,390
and have to fend for themselves.

17
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,990
But many animals do benefit from
a little help from their parents.

18
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,950
And in the early days of life,

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,750
they're often completely reliant
on them.

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,710
In this Indian forest,
a new life is exploring the world

21
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,870
for the first time -

22
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,310
a precious tiger cub.

23
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,870
It's just ten days old.

24
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,230
Most cubs will stay in their dens
for the first six weeks,

25
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,190
but this one is clearly adventurous.

26
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,350
Although the cub's eyes are open,

27
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,070
it'll be a few weeks
before it can see properly.

28
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,070
It's completely helpless.

29
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,070
CUB SCREECHES

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,430
There are four new cubs in all,
and they're quite lively.

31
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,830
In these early days,

32
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,590
they're dependent on their mother
for everything,

33
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,390
but right now,
they're not making her life easy.

34
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,870
CUB SCREECHES

35
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,390
It's enough to test
any parent's patience.

36
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,790
Tiger cubs stay with their mother
until they're about two years old.

37
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,630
But typically, only half
will make it to maturity.

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,310
There's no doubt these youngsters
face a bumpy journey to adulthood.

39
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,190
The first steps of growing up

40
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,590
are often some of the most
precarious in any animal's life.

41
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,030
For some, they are literally
a leap of faith.

42
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,230
It's spring in the forests
of Eastern Europe,

43
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,190
and, safe within
the hollow of a tree,

44
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,470
a female mandarin duck is about
to teach her one-day-old ducklings

45
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,510
how to leave their nest.

46
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,630
She leads the way.

47
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,710
DUCKLINGS CHIRP

48
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,110
The ducklings are imprinted
on their mother,

49
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,910
which means they're
pre-programmed to follow her.

50
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,670
However, it's a long drop, and a few
calls of encouragement are needed.

51
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,110
DUCKLING CHIRPS

52
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,790
Two have landed safely,

53
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,310
but there are more left to jump.

54
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,030
At least it's a soft landing.

55
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,070
Off we go!

56
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,030
Deep breath.

57
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,230
Geronimo!

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,870
The final pair take to the air.

59
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,470
Made it.

60
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,510
But their escapade isn't over.

61
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,430
They must now reach water.

62
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,150
The nearest pool
is almost a mile away -

63
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,790
quite a trek for the youngsters.

64
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,190
By following their mother's lead,

65
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,710
these ducklings have
passed their first test.

66
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,790
Now on water, they will spend their
time learning what's good to eat

67
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,310
and exploring
their new watery world.

68
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,910
Wherever your home is,

69
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,950
taking your first big steps in life
can be quite an undertaking.

70
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,110
But for some, the challenge
is far greater than others.

71
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,950
Nevertheless,
it's something they must get right.

72
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,550
Here in Israel, those first steps
don't get much more difficult.

73
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,190
Up here,
your footing needs to be firm

74
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,950
and a head for heights is essential.

75
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,790
Meet the ibex.

76
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,910
They have made these
treacherous cliffs their own.

77
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,230
But for these newborn youngsters,

78
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,990
this rocky wilderness
makes for a nerve-racking nursery.

79
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,150
They spend the first few days
of their life at the highest level,

80
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,470
relatively safe from predators
who can't scale such heady heights.

81
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,390
However, at only a few days old,

82
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,310
they have to leave
their playtime plateaus.

83
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,630
For the first time,
they must attempt to climb down

84
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,670
these terrifying precipices
to find food.

85
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,390
It's a daunting prospect -

86
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,310
certainly not for the faint-hearted.

87
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,830
Their mother leads the way.

88
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,510
The kids are
understandably tentative.

89
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,030
They must slowly pick their way
down the sheer rock faces.

90
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,070
Their mother shows them
the best route.

91
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,430
She has done it
hundreds of times before,

92
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,270
but for the kids,
this is new territory.

93
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,510
Gradually, they start
to get the hang of it,

94
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,230
but they need to focus,

95
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,070
as one slip could be their last.

96
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,110
Finally, they've made it.

97
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,030
There's a whole new world
at the lower levels

98
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,230
with plenty of food and water.

99
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,350
Here, the parents show off
their balancing skills

100
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,790
as they all browse together.

101
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,510
But one kid has been left behind,

102
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,670
and she's in trouble.

103
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,990
A fox.

104
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,230
And it's spotted the straggler.

105
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,550
The young ibex runs as fast
as it can back up the cliff

106
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,790
but the fox is right on its heels.

107
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,030
It'll be hoping for a quick kill.

108
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,950
As the kid heads back up the cliff,

109
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,550
the fox tries to gain
the higher ground.

110
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,310
But the kid has scrambled
onto a rock face.

111
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,270
It's so steep that only it
could possibly stand there

112
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,030
without toppling off.

113
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,110
The fox has no choice
but to give up.

114
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,230
It doesn't stand a chance
on this precipice.

115
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,350
The lessons learned
on this morning's descent

116
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,110
have saved the kid's life,

117
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,150
and despite still being so young,

118
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,510
it has outwitted
one of the canniest of predators.

119
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,390
Conquering your terrain
is a crucial part of growing up,

120
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,670
but for some animals,
it can also be a race against time.

121
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,110
Here in the African Congo,
a colony of skimmers,

122
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,150
so called for their
special feeding technique,

123
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,550
have made these sandbanks
their home.

124
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,070
But it won't be forever, as before
long, the waters here will rise,

125
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,590
and they will have to move on.

126
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:53,030
These young skimmers were born here
and are only a few weeks old.

127
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,790
SKIMMER CHIRPS

128
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,390
Before the waters rise,
they need to learn to fly

129
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,710
and how to catch fish and they
need to learn both skills quickly.

130
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,750
They watch as the adults
gracefully skim the water.

131
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,190
An adult skimmer has a beak

132
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,270
with the lower part
longer than the upper.

133
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,710
With this, they can slice through
the water at ten metres a second.

134
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,630
If their beak hits something,
it will snap shut.

135
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,630
It's a clever technique
for catching fish.

136
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,910
The problem for youngsters
is that they have to wait

137
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,750
for the lower part of their beak
to completely grow.

138
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,550
In the meantime,
while the water is shallow

139
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,350
and they have the sand to run on,

140
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,230
they do their best to learn
the skimming technique.

141
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,550
It's not as easy as it looks,

142
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,070
but they need to perfect the skill
as it's vital to their survival.

143
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,390
The clock is ticking.

144
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,230
Soon, all the sand they are using
as a practice ground will be gone.

145
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,670
THUNDER CRACKS

146
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,790
The annual storms
in the African Congo have arrived.

147
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,790
Very soon, these nursery sand flats

148
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,270
will be under several metres
of water.

149
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,830
The skimmers have to move out.

150
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,470
With their home disappearing,

151
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,470
the time has come for the young
skimmers to take to the air

152
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,670
with the rest of the colony.

153
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,430
Practice time is over.

154
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,270
How well they've mastered
the art of skimming

155
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,110
will affect the future success
of their adult life.

156
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,550
The amount of time animals are with
their parents varies greatly,

157
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,670
and for some,
childhood can be leisurely.

158
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,110
They spend much of their time
playing.

159
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,470
It might only seem like a bit of fun

160
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,630
but it's essential to
a young animal's development.

161
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,430
It helps with their strength,
coordination and social skills.

162
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,670
Playing is a crucial part
of learning.

163
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,590
And the games can be a rehearsal
for adult life.

164
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,990
Six months later in India,

165
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,030
and the tiger cubs are
putting their play into practice

166
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,830
and trying to hunt.

167
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,070
They must closely follow
their mother

168
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,590
as she slowly creeps
through the forest.

169
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,350
It's all about stealth.

170
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,830
Patience and timing are crucial.

171
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,990
The moment to pounce
has to be exactly right.

172
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,470
TIGER CUB GROWLS

173
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,470
But one of the cubs just can't
keep his excitement to himself.

174
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,230
Mum isn't too impressed.

175
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,310
She'll have to start all over again.

176
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,470
The tiger cubs
still have a lot to learn.

177
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,950
Always paying attention
to your parents

178
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,750
and following their lead
can sometimes be trying.

179
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,750
Summer in the Arctic,

180
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,750
and the frozen surface of the ocean
is beginning to disintegrate.

181
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,470
These two polar bear cubs
are six months old.

182
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,110
It's the first time
they've seen the ice break up,

183
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,790
and they're about to get
a swimming lesson.

184
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,270
They're not too sure
about making the plunge.

185
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,030
For their mother,
swimming is second nature,

186
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,190
but the cubs still prefer
to have ice beneath their feet

187
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,590
whenever they can.

188
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,310
Soon, it will be impossible
to avoid the water,

189
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,910
so swimming isn't extra-curricular,
it's crucial.

190
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,670
The cubs will stay with their mother
for another two years -

191
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,270
not until then will they be ready
to leave her side.

192
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,950
For some animals, learning
from your parents can take years.

193
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,470
Apart from humans,

194
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,510
it is the orang-utan which has the
longest of all primate childhoods.

195
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,870
This female orang is 42 years old.

196
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,950
Her daughter is six,

197
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,230
and will stay with her
for at least another two years.

198
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,110
But then,
there is much you must understand

199
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,270
in the treetop world of Sumatra.

200
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,790
She has to learn to collect ants
and termites.

201
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,030
She will need to identify
at least 300 edible plants

202
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,230
and avoid the poisonous ones.

203
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,270
Judging when fruit is ripe
is essential.

204
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,830
The young orang must also be able
to judge which branches

205
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:42,030
can carry her weight and which
insect nests are safe to raid.

206
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,630
BUZZING

207
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,590
Building up a guide
to the foods of the rainforest

208
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,150
is a long and complex process.

209
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,350
But it's vital training
for the future.

210
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,910
When her education is complete,

211
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,350
this young orang
will leave her mother

212
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,590
and eventually she will pass on
this in-depth knowledge

213
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,590
to her own offspring.

214
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,190
It's clear that
your mother's example

215
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,030
has a huge impact on your chance
of survival.

216
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,510
In many cases, she is your
sole teacher when growing up.

217
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,070
However, there are times
when following your mum

218
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,990
can lead you into trouble.

219
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,350
A fast-flowing river in Kenya,

220
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,270
full of strong currents...

221
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,550
as well as crocodiles.

222
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,390
Despite the dangers,

223
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,150
this herd of elephants
has to get across.

224
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,030
The matriarch of the group leads
some youngsters into the river.

225
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,310
She knows that to reach
the other side,

226
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,870
she has to head slightly upstream
into the current.

227
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,630
Watching from the shallows
is a younger group.

228
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,150
These small calves have mothers
who are far less experienced.

229
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,990
They watch the older matriarch
reach the other side safely.

230
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,270
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

231
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,630
Then it's their turn
to brave the river.

232
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,110
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

233
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,710
They are almost immediately
in trouble,

234
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,430
but in too deep to get back.

235
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,870
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

236
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,470
If the youngsters become separated,
they will easily drown.

237
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,230
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

238
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,510
One has been overcome,
and is being swept downstream.

239
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,670
The mothers try to keep hold
of the young ones,

240
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,470
but they can't contain all three.

241
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,590
As they save one,
the others get washed away.

242
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,430
The currents are even
too strong for the mothers,

243
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,710
and they have no choice
but to let their babies go.

244
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,310
Finally, one baby
manages to clamber out,

245
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,390
but the other two
are still struggling.

246
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,390
The mothers come to help,

247
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,070
but they have no way
to lift them out.

248
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,990
The babies are weak and terrified.

249
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,110
Eventually, they manage to get out.

250
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,070
It's a massive relief.

251
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,110
What started as a lesson in life
turned into a nightmare.

252
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,270
Growing up can be hard, even with
your parents there to guide you.

253
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,950
Particularly when they start
dishing out the tough love.

254
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,910
This barren, icy landscape
is Antarctica,

255
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,590
one of the harshest places
to grow up wild.

256
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,710
PENGUINS BRAY

257
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,950
Winter is only a few weeks away

258
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,550
and young Adelie penguins
need to quickly get stronger

259
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,310
before the storms arrive.

260
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,990
The chicks are only three weeks old.

261
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,750
Their downy coats
aren't fully waterproof,

262
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,150
so they cluster together for warmth.

263
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,230
It's essential the young
stay in creches like this

264
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,550
as most of the adults
have gone away.

265
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,590
They have left their offspring
on land

266
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,550
as they go out to sea fishing,
sometimes for days at a time.

267
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,350
When the parents return,

268
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,350
serving dinner becomes
a competitive business.

269
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,710
Both these youngsters
are ravenously hungry,

270
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,950
but before they can eat,
they have to catch their mother.

271
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,550
It's a demanding test
for the siblings.

272
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,230
Just staying on two feet
can be a challenge.

273
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,590
The race for supper is proving
too hard for one of the chicks.

274
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,630
It just can't keep up.

275
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,630
Sadly, there will be no food
for him today.

276
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,630
The winner's reward
is some tasty fish.

277
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,830
It may seem cruel,
but with life so harsh here,

278
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,310
parents need to know
which chick is stronger

279
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,790
and more likely to survive
childhood.

280
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,190
The lessons dealt out by adults
can be particularly tough,

281
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,110
and sometimes they're not always
from your own parents.

282
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,190
These toque macaques in Sri Lanka
live in large troops.

283
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,710
It's a very complex social structure
with a strict hierarchy.

284
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,030
If they're to make it
through childhood,

285
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,870
youngsters must fit in, and
discipline is fiercely maintained.

286
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,990
All young macaques are low-ranking,
and they have to quickly learn how

287
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,470
to show respect through a variety
of gestures and facial expressions.

288
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,630
Adults don't hesitate to show
who's in charge.

289
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,470
This infant female is considered
to be the lowest of the low,

290
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,350
and she won't survive long

291
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,950
if she doesn't learn
the social conventions.

292
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,750
The dominant male
is the overall boss

293
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,950
and he demands respect from
everyone, no matter how young.

294
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,390
He won't tolerate any sign
of insubordination.

295
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,390
If he looks another macaque
in the eye,

296
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,150
they have to express submission
by chattering their teeth.

297
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,950
The tiny female has caught his eye,

298
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,430
but does she know
what sound to make?

299
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,270
If she gets it wrong,
the punishment will be harsh.

300
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,990
TEETH CHATTER

301
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:49,350
She just about manages to chatter
her teeth - and just in time.

302
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,390
There'll be many more tests
in this young macaque's life,

303
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,870
but at least she's passed her first.

304
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,630
Getting through the early stages of
childhood can certainly be daunting.

305
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:20,790
As animals get older, their chances
of survival inevitably increase,

306
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,190
but different issues
have to be confronted.

307
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,390
Just like humans, the teenage years
can prove troublesome.

308
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,230
It's a time
when boundaries are tested

309
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,470
and tempers can fray.

310
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,630
Mistakes are made.

311
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,270
And some can be painful.

312
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,950
Full of testosterone,

313
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,390
young males all want to be
the big guy.

314
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:05,310
They aren't always ready for
independence but act like they are.

315
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,990
Being a teenager
is never without its challenges.

316
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,550
Here in the forests of Uganda

317
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,790
is a family of gorillas.

318
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,230
Gorillas live in
complex social groups

319
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,670
which aren't always the easiest
to grow up in.

320
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,070
They usually form small groups
with one dominant male silverback,

321
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,510
several females and their offspring.

322
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,350
This young teenage male
is at a crossroads in his life.

323
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,350
He enjoys the security of his family

324
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,990
but within the group,
his future is limited.

325
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,910
The dominant silverback is in charge

326
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,470
and only he is allowed to mate
with the females in the group.

327
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,150
Full of hormones,

328
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,350
it's not easy
for the adolescent gorilla.

329
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,710
If he wants a family of his own,

330
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,710
he will either have to leave
the group to set up his own

331
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,190
or overthrow the lead silverback.

332
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,670
He's been trying prove his strength
within the group.

333
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,910
He spots a younger male
and tries to assert his dominance.

334
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,390
He places himself
between the smaller male

335
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,470
and the rest of the family
to show who is boss.

336
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,990
But taking on such small fry
isn't enough to impress.

337
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:16,870
To challenge the dominant silverback
would be a whole different story.

338
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,350
His only other option
is to leave home.

339
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,870
It's not an easy decision to make.

340
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,710
In India,
the tigers are also now teenagers,

341
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,430
but they seem to be having more fun.

342
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,390
Play is still a big part
of their day,

343
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,710
but the rough and tumble has turned
into more aggressive play fighting.

344
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,150
TIGERS GROWL

345
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,230
The sparring is good practice
for when they leave home

346
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,670
and may need to fend off
other tigers.

347
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,790
For now, though,
they keep their claws in.

348
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,310
No hard feelings here.

349
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,190
To be independent, they also need
to learn to hunt their own prey,

350
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,830
but this is proving more difficult.

351
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,830
One of the males
quietly creeps up on a deer.

352
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,310
But he peaks too soon.

353
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,310
His sister also misses her chance
as the deer runs straight past her.

354
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,110
They will just have
to keep practising.

355
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,110
Of course, not all animals
leave home -

356
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,550
some stay within
their extended families.

357
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,510
The size of the group
can vary widely.

358
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,950
Hippos, for example,

359
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,590
can form small pods...

360
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,830
..or come together
in very large numbers.

361
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,950
Many, like wolves, form groups or
packs as a strategy for hunting

362
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,190
and to give them safety in numbers.

363
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,710
The animals within such communities
like these gelada baboons

364
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,750
are old enough to leave home,

365
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,790
but the protection of their social
group takes priority

366
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,030
and they're destined to stay.

367
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,350
But even within such groups
there are individuals that are born

368
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,990
to be different and are destined
to leave their families.

369
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,750
One of those can be
found in the African desert.

370
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,830
This little creature is
a female naked mole rat.

371
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,910
She has never
ventured above ground before.

372
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,310
She doesn't belong here.

373
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,030
Night-time in the desert
can be a dangerous place...

374
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,510
..but tonight she is risking
her life

375
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,590
in an attempt to fulfil her destiny.

376
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,430
She has left the safety of her
family to go in search of a mate.

377
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,790
But...with danger everywhere,

378
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,590
will she even survive the night?

379
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,990
Naked mole rats are one
of the planet's strangest mammals.

380
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,270
Their home is a network of specially
built tunnels under the ground.

381
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,630
They live in large communities
with one dominant female and many

382
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,870
so-called "workers".

383
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,550
Only the dominant female
will reproduce.

384
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:15,110
However, occasionally there is
a "chosen" offspring, a princess who

385
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,310
will grow up pampered and not have
to work.

386
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:23,310
Instead, she reserves her energy for
her big day when she will leave home

387
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,270
to set up a brand-new colony.

388
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,230
But alone in the desert, this
princess won't survive for long.

389
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,790
Her search to find
a partner is urgent.

390
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,110
There's an enticing smell
in the air.

391
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,710
Finally, a seductive scent
draws her down to safety.

392
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,150
She's sniffed out a partner,

393
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,950
he too is alone and eager to start
a new family in his empty burrow.

394
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,030
Two months later
and the princess has become a queen.

395
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,470
She has had her first litter
of babies

396
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,470
and is now ready to start
ruling over

397
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,230
a new dynasty of naked mole rats.

398
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,310
Only certain chosen individual mole
rats will cut loose

399
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,870
from their communities to start new
families, but with some creatures

400
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,670
there can be a whole generation
destined to leave home.

401
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,070
One such species can also be found
under the ground

402
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,150
in the deserts of Arizona.

403
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,270
For the first time for six years,

404
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,670
a generation of honey ants
has been born with wings.

405
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,950
The rest of the colony are wingless
and they are all female,

406
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,750
but these winged offspring
include female and male ants.

407
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,430
When the time is right,
their wings will offer them

408
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,150
the chance to leave home.

409
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,950
THUNDER RUMBLES

410
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,470
This is what they were waiting for -
the summer monsoon.

411
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,830
These torrential downpours can
produce several centimetres of rain

412
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,270
in just a few hours.

413
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,350
The rain will make the normally
hard, dry ground, soft, and that is

414
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:53,030
when the winged ants will be ready
to make their own way in the world.

415
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,430
THUNDER RUMBLES

416
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,470
As the rains stop, the worker ants
come out to prepare the nest hole,

417
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,870
a launchpad
for their special siblings.

418
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,070
Their big moment has arrived.

419
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,110
They come out into the light
and get ready for takeoff.

420
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,510
This is what they were born for.

421
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,750
Hundreds of insects take
to the air...

422
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,310
..from this colony
and from many others.

423
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,790
They frenetically
seek each other out.

424
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,470
They need to mate
as quickly as possible.

425
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,150
Then, they will span
out across the desert.

426
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,270
Those that survive will get the
chance to start their own colony.

427
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,750
If you are destined to leave home
and start your own family,

428
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,830
knowing when to go
isn't always an easy decision.

429
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,750
The young male gorilla is spending
more and more time alone.

430
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,630
The rest of his troop have found
a tasty feast of fungi.

431
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,470
The dominant silverback always
has priority and eats first.

432
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,790
The children arrive
and are allowed to share the fungi.

433
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,790
But the young male is
last in the pecking order -

434
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,070
even the babies can feed before him.

435
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,030
It's all a bit disheartening.

436
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,110
To make matters worse,
the silverback flaunts his right

437
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,910
to mate in front of him.

438
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,430
Is it time for the teenage gorilla
to make his own way in the world?

439
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:40,510
The family set off together
into the forest.

440
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,430
If the young male goes with them,
he will never have a family of

441
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,510
his own as he isn't strong enough to
challenge the dominant silverback.

442
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,550
He doesn't follow the family
but sets off in another direction.

443
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,590
Leaving home could spell
years of hardship living alone,

444
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,750
but at least it offers him
the chance

445
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,390
of one day finding his own group
and fulfilling his ultimate aim -

446
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,630
that of becoming
a dominant silverback.

447
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,190
The tiger cubs are fully grown
and almost ready to leave home.

448
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,230
One of the females is hunting alone.

449
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,630
She has perfected
her stealth technique.

450
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,190
She knows it's all about timing and
she has learned the art of patience.

451
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,390
Success!

452
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,350
It's only a fawn but it's a start.

453
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,310
It's too small to share
with her siblings

454
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,150
and she makes that quite clear.

455
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,870
After two years of living
and learning together,

456
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:52,470
these tigers no longer
need their mother or each other.

457
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,870
They have already begun to carve out
their own territories and are ready

458
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,910
to live life alone.

459
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,870
Growing up wild
is not an easy business.

460
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:25,390
There are many trials
and tribulations along the way.

461
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,470
It can be a long hard journey...

462
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,510
..even with the support
of your parents.

463
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,150
But childhood is also exciting as
animals discover their world

464
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,430
for the first time.

465
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,510
And for those who do make the grade,

466
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:55,430
a new adventure is just beginning
as they start their adult life.
