00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,790
(Molly) <i>A survey was taken
a few years ago that asked</i>

4
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,090
<i>three hundred professionals
one question.</i>

5
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,659
<i>"What's the worst thing
that can happen in sports?"</i>

6
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:57,358
<i>Some people answered,
losing at game seven.</i>

(male announcer) <i>He scores,
Bruins win in seven games!</i>

8
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,324
(Molly) <i>And other people
said getting swept in 4.</i>

<i>[indistinct commentary]</i>

10
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,690
<i>Some people said it was

<i>Guatemala is eliminated!</i>

12

(male #1)
<i>Goal!</i>

13
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:16,190
(Molly) <i>And some Brazilian said
it was losing to Argentina.</i>

14
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:20,924
<i>Not just in the World Cup.
Any time, ever, in any contest.</i>

15
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,891
<i>But one person answered
that the worst thing</i>

16
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:26,956
<i>that can happen in sports is
fourth place at the Olympics.</i>

17
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,990
<i>This is a true story,
but except for my own</i>

18
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,991
<i>I've changed all the names
and I've done my best</i>

19
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:34,723
<i>to obscure identities for
reasons that'll become clear.</i>

20
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:35,991
<i>I'm Molly Bloom.</i>

21
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,190
<i>And right now, I'm ranked third
in North America</i>

22
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:39,690
<i>in Woman's Moguls.</i>

23
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:41,224
<i>I grew up
in Loveland, Colorado</i>

24
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,723
<i>about two hours
north of Denver.</i>

25
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:44,423
<i>I have a B.A.
in Political Science</i>

26
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>from the University
of Colorado</i>

27
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,891

Summa Cum Laude</i>

00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:57,790
Number 87, up!
Fifty six on deck!

32
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,924
<i>I've spent 16 years
chasing winter</i>

33
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:02,856
<i>and being coached
by the best in the world.</i>

34
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,557
<i>Sundays were for working out
with my father.</i>

35
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,358
Something's really wrong.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,390
(Molly)
<i>When I was 12 years old</i>

37
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,422
<i>for no particular reason</i>

38
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:09,790
<i>my back exploded.</i>

39
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,623
Tough it out.

40
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,823
- Good advice.
- And lose the attitude.

41
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:15,257
(Molly) <i>Less than 10
minutes later, I was in</i>

42
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,456
<i>the back of an ambulance.</i>

43
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,724
<i>I had what's called
rapid onset scoliosis.</i>

44
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>My spine was curved
at 63 degrees</i>

45
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,789
<i>and I'd need a seven hour
surgical procedure</i>

46
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,656
<i>that involved
straightening my spine</i>

47
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,090
<i>extracting bone from my hip</i>

48
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:28,657
<i>fusing 11 vertebrae together</i>

49
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,624
<i>and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments.</i>

50
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,724
- She's gonna be fine.
- Oh!

51
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:35,857
I wouldn't let her ski anymore,
definitely not Moguls.

52
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:38,190
<i>And obviously
skiing competitively</i>

53
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,592
<i>is out of the question.</i>

54
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,191
Oh, God, thank you.

55
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:44,923
(Molly)
<i>I was on skis again in a year.</i>

56
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,357
<i>Running Moguls in 18 months</i>

57
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:47,590
<i>and by my 20th birthday</i>

58
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:48,957
<i>I made the U.S. Ski Team.</i>

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,489
<i>It's the last round
of qualifying</i>

60
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,091
<i>for the Salt Lake City
Olympics.</i>

61
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:54,056
<i>This is the champion run
at Deer Valley.</i>

62
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,523
<i>The altitude is 8100 feet.</i>

63
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,057
<i>And the pitch is 52 degrees</i>

64
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:59,590
<i>which is the same as the sides
of the great pyramids.</i>

65
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:02,824
<i>The wind's 20 to 25 miles
an hour blowing left to right.</i>

66
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:05,024
<i>It's 3 below zero
at the top of the slope.</i>

67
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,390
<i>And with seventeen skiers
in front of me</i>

68
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,957
<i>it's gonna be like trying
to stick a landing</i>

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,456
<i>on a frozen infinity pool.</i>

70
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,890
Kiki blew out of her line.

71
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,891
<i>Shannon was off balance
on her second landing.</i>

72
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,258
(Molly)
<i>He's talking about Kiki Bandy</i>

73
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,324
<i>and Shannon Keebler</i>

74
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,723
<i>my two toughest competitors</i>

75
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,457
<i>who had significant
point deductions</i>

76
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,422
<i>on their final runs.</i>

77
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,623
<i>I can make the Olympic team.</i>

78
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,489
- <i>Right now.</i>
- Go get it.

79
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,224
<i>And if I have three prefect
runs in Salt Lake</i>

80
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,057
<i>the best runs of my life</i>

81
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,590
<i>I can beat the Austrians
and the Swiss</i>

82
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,623
<i>and have a realistic shot
at the podium.</i>

83
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,590
<i>Then law school
and then a start up.</i>

84
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:37,957
<i>A foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women.</i>

85
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,757
<i>My father's
at the bottom of the slope</i>

86
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,524
<i>telepathically telling me
to check my line.</i>

87
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:44,657
- Check your line.
- <i>I check my line.</i>

88
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,326
(male announcer)
<i>Ready?</i>

89
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,056
(Molly) <i>Good snow contact.
Calm upper body.</i>

90
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,690
<i>Legs together. Good shape.
No line deviation.</i>

91
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,860
<i>Set up for the D-Spin and...</i>

92
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,356
<i>stick the landing.</i>

93
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,557
<i>Now, two things you need
to know</i>

94
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,789
<i>before the second trick</i>

95
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,223
<i>which will be a 720.</i>

96
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:06,856
<i>The first is that
when visibility is bad</i>

97
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,557
<i>the way it is now,
race officials toss pine boughs</i>

98
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,356
<i>on the course
so the skiers have some</i>

99
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:12,991
<i>foreground depth reference.</i>

100
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,057
<i>The second is that
the tightness of your bindings</i>

101
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:17,156
<i>is determined by what's
called a DIN setting.</i>

102
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,756
<i>If you're a beginner, your DIN
setting is probably a 2 or 3.</i>

103
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,723
<i>If you're an experienced
weekend skier</i>

104
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,923
<i>it's probably seven or eight.
Mine's fifteen.</i>

105
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,057
<i>My boots are basically welded
to my skis, right?</i>

106
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,423
<i>So how does this happen?</i>

107
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,223
<i>It happened
because I hit a pine bough</i>

108
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:34,323
<i>that had become frozen
in the snow.</i>

109
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,091
<i>And I hit it so precisely</i>

110
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:38,590
<i>that it simply snapped
the release of my bindings.</i>

111
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,056
<i>Right in that moment
I didn't have time</i>

112
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,756
<i>to calculate the odds
of that happening</i>

113
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,523
<i>because I was about
to land pretty hard</i>

114
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,490
<i>on my digitally re-mastered
spinal cord</i>

115
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,257
<i>which was being held together
by spare parts</i>

116
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,726
<i>from an Erector Set.</i>

<i>- Give her room!
- Get out of the way! Move!</i>

120
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,790
(Molly) <i>None of this has
anything to do with poker.</i>

121
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,757
<i>I'm only mentioning it
because I wanted to say to</i>

122
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,390
<i>whoever answered that the worst
thing that could happen</i>

123
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,023
<i>in sports was 4th place

124

- <i>Is this Molly Bloom?</i>
- Yes.

129
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,524
(Tomasino) <i>This is Special
Agent Tomasino of the FBI.</i>

<i>Listen to me now. Make sure

134

Who is this?

135
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,256
<i>This is Special Agent Tomasino</i>

<i>of the FBI, Miss Bloom.</i>

137
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:26,956
<i>You've got 30 seconds to open</i>

<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

144
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,090
- There's been a mistake.
- <i>Are you Molly Bloom?</i>

145
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:49,489
<i>I want you to walk toward me
very slowly. Okay? Go ahead.</i>

00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,125
- I'm...
- <i>Slower. Slower. Slow down.</i>

147
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,757
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

148
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,389
I'm having a hard time seeing,
the, the flashlights in my eyes.

149
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,857
- <i>Walk slower.</i>
- Yes, sir.

150
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,389
(female #1) <i>Hands on the wall.
Spread your arms and legs.</i>

151
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,222
(Tomasino) <i>Is there anyone
in your apartment right now?</i>

152
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,590
Uh, no, sir.

153
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,056
Are there any firearms
in your apartment right now?

154
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,156
- No, sir.
- Go.

155
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,524
You're under arrest for running
an illegal gambling operation.

156
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:15,590
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Uh, yes.

157
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,557
(Tomasino)
<i>Say you understand.</i>

158
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,590
I understand, but
there's been a mistake.

159
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,122
Because I haven't
run a game in two years.

160
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,222
<i>I want you to take a look at</i>

161

<i>this piece of paper right here.</i>

162

<i>Can you see what
it says at the top?</i>

163
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:28,490
Yes.

164
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:31,189
Read to me
what it says at the top.

165
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:34,460
"United States of America
vs. Molly Bloom."

166
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:38,760
I bet heavy on the favorite.

167
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:42,789
(Larry)
<i>Alright, what do you, um...</i>

168
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,056
<i>think about
the following concepts?</i>

169
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,422
<i>Just gonna run them by you.</i>

170
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,524
- <i>Marriage.</i>
- It is a trap.

171
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,525
<i>- Society?
- It is a joke.</i>

172
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,156
<i>People.</i>

173
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,126
I... think there's good and bad.

174
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,559
But I don't trust them.

175
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,189
I don't trust people.

176
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,823
(Molly) <i>Every year on our
birthdays, my father would</i>

177
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,924
<i>interview my younger
brothers and me.</i>

178
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:13,423
(Larry) <i>Who are the heroes
or heroines in your life?</i>

179
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:17,256
<i>Who, uh... who do you
really respect?</i>

180
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:18,957
I don't have any heroes.

181
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,757
(Larry)
<i>You don't have any heroes.</i>

182
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,490
(Molly)
<i>How's this for hubris?</i>

183
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,624
I don't.

184
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,723
Because if I reach the goals
I set out for myself

185
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:31,589
then the person I become,
that'll be my hero.

186
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,590
(Molly)
<i>Even by teenage girl standards</i>

187
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:35,456
<i>I would appear
to be irrationally angry</i>

188
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,122
<i>at nothing in particular.</i>

189
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:41,089
<i>It would be another 22 years
before I'd find out why.</i>

190
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,123
<i>After my colossal wipe out
at Deer Valley</i>

191
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,991
<i>I decided to take a year off
before law school.</i>

192
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,456
<i>I needed to go away,
sever myself from reality</i>

193
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,489
<i>and come up with a new plan.</i>

194
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:52,524
<i>So I chose Los Angeles.</i>

195
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,190
<i>A friend of mine
from the ski team</i>

196
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,957
<i>had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while.</i>

197
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,422
<i>My father had disapproved
of postponing law school</i>

198
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:01,356
<i>and so, declined to help out.</i>

199
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:04,257
<i>But I had $1700 dollars I'd
saved from babysitting money</i>

200
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,123
<i>and that would support me until
I found a waitressing job.</i>

201
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,155
<i>I'd already had a career
and retired from it.</i>

202
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:15,256
<i>I wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather.</i>

203
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:19,390
<i>I think that's what I wanted at
first. It's hard to remember.</i>

204
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,724
<i>I got a job working
bottle service at a club</i>

205
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,824
<i>in Hollywood
called "Nacional Nightclub."</i>

206
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,856
<i>It was Cuban themed,
so my uniform</i>

207
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,460
<i>was camouflaged short-shorts
and a wife beater.</i>

208
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,790
<i>The promoter would go over
which record producer</i>

209
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,490
<i>was sitting where, which
hot designers, which Lakers</i>

210
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,323
<i>and Borislava the Bulgarian
billionaire, who didn't drink.</i>

211
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,789
<i>But he ran a $100,000 bar tab.</i>

212
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,322
<i>My job was
to get people to spend</i>

213
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,122
<i>more money than they needed to.</i>

214
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,457
Could we get a bottle of Skyy?

215
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,824
You guys look like
you deserve Grey Goose.

216
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:49,390
What do guys who deserve
Grey Goose look like?

217
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:50,423
To begin with,
they've got a bottle

218
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,824
of Grey Goose in front of them.

219
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:53,924
You're quick. Very clever.

220
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,123
Uh, alright, yeah. Grey Goose.

221
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,390
(Molly) <i>They just spent an
additional $300 dollars</i>

222
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,422
<i>bringing their total
to $900 dollars</i>

223
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,857
<i>for $8 and 50 cents
worth of vodka.</i>

224
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,756
<i>But the club doesn't
need you to buy a bottle.</i>

225
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,422
<i>They need you
to buy five bottles.</i>

226
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,923
<i>So these girls over here</i>

227
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,856
<i>they let you buy them
shots for a living.</i>

228
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,623
<i>It would be like waiting
in a long line to get into</i>

229
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,090
<i>the Gap so you can pay
1000% percent mark-up</i>

230
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:16,759
<i>to buy all the employees
a pair of pants.</i>

231
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,290
<i>I only had one shift a week.
I didn't wanna tell my parents</i>

232
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,789
<i>I was a cocktail waitress and
back then, I never turned down</i>

233
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,657
<i>an opportunity
to make more money.</i>

234
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,756
<i>So I found a second job
as an office assistant.</i>

235
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:30,389
<i>And that's how I ended up
working for Dean Keith.</i>

236
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,990
<i>[instrumental music]</i>

237
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:34,823
<i>Dean was a partner
in Black Hues Investments.</i>

238
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:37,189
<i>He was a regular at the club,
and one night he said...</i>

239
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:38,660
People seem to take to you.

240
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,155
Hey, how would you like to
get paid to go to grad school

241
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:43,889
and get an MBA
in how life works?

242
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,990
What makes you think
you know and I don't?

243
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,922
I'm a regular here
and you're a waitress here.

244
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,589
Look at the fuckin' scoreboard.

245
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,889
(Molly) <i>Dean explained what
my job was by saying...</i>

246
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,857
Me. I'm your job.

247
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,624
(Molly) <i>I answered the phone, made
coffee runs, set appointments.</i>

248
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,422
- <i>Made spread sheets.</i>
- What is that?

249
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,990
<i>And showed Dean
what a spreadsheet was.</i>

250
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:03,523
Spreadsheet.

251
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>But I made $450 dollars
a week on top</i>

252
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,689
<i>of the $300
I was making at the club.</i>

253
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:10,790
<i>Which would be enough
to get off my friend's couch.</i>

254
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:13,223
<i>I remember the day started
by being about bagels.</i>

255
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,456
- This is Molly.
- <i>Get to the office.</i>

256
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,125
(Dean)
<i>Pick up bagels.</i>

257
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,022
Do you mean now?

258
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,557
(Molly)
<i>Dean was a Hollywood staple.</i>

259
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,390
<i>Over leveraged. Going broke.</i>

260
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,222
<i>Trying to prove
he wasn't broke and making</i>

261
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,189
<i>a true effort to be
as vulgar as possible.</i>

262
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,990
<i>Honestly making an effort.</i>

263
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,789
<i>I hadn't told anyone
I was a skier</i>

264
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,556
<i>and it was hard not
to laugh when Dean said...</i>

265
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:36,155
Anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin' hurry?

266
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,623
- No.
- What are those?

267
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,189
Bagels.

268
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,590
- Are these from Blue Bell?
- Yeah.

269
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,757
- It's on the way from my house.
- Seriously?

270
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,089
You might as well have stopped
at a fuckin' homeless shelter!

271
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,357
You might as well
have walked into

272
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,822
a mother fucking
homeless shelter and said

273
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:53,956
"I'd like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter, please."

274
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,489
I do not eat bagels
from Blue-fucking-Bell, Molly

275
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:02,223
because these
are poor people bagels!

276
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:03,556
From where would you like me
to get your bagels...

277
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,090
Forget about the fuckin' bagels.

278
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,190
- Done.
- <i>Except smarten up.</i>

279
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,589
- Got it.
- Hang on.

280
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,155
(Molly)
<i>Like I said, the day started</i>

281
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:12,523
<i>by being about bagels,
but that would abruptly change.</i>

282
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,524
My weekly poker game
is moving to the Cobra Lounge.

283
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,489
Tomorrow night,
and then every Tuesday night.

284
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,623
You'll help run it.

285
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,155
Take these names and numbers.

286
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,757
Tell them to bring
ten grand in cash

287
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,660
for the first buy-in.
The blinds are 51/100.

288
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,223
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

289
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:27,858
Don't fucking tell anybody.

290
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:38,590
(Molly) <i>I'd regarded Dean as a
nitwit when I regarded him at all.</i>

291
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,524
<i>But on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers of</i>

292
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:44,724
<i>some of the wealthiest and most
famous people in the world.</i>

293
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:47,855
<i>I put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message.</i>

294
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:50,290
<i>There'd be a game tomorrow
night at the Cobra Lounge.</i>

295
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,193
<i>There was
a $10,000 dollar buy-in.</i>

296
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,825
<i>All nine players confirmed
that they'd be there.</i>

297
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:03,322
<i>All within 90 seconds
of my sending the text.</i>

298
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,723
(Molly) <i>The Cobra Lounge sits on
the edge of the Sunset Strip.</i>

299
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,690
<i>And in it's heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands</i>

300
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:12,755
<i>like "The Doors"
and "The Beach Boys."</i>

301
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,290
<i>All I knew was school work
and skiing.</i>

302
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,889
<i>I'd always figured
sophistication</i>

303
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,890
<i>would be easy to learn
if I ever needed it.</i>

304
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:20,890
<i>My cheese platter had
a sticker that read</i>

305
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:24,457
<i>"Cheese From the Great State
of Michigan."</i>

306
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,657
<i>Diego, a professional dealer</i>

307
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,556
<i>was setting up the table
when I got there.</i>

308
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,590
<i>I Googled "What type of music</i>

309
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,623
<i>do poker players
like to listen to?"</i>

310
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,423
<i>and then tried to figure out
how to make a playlist</i>

311
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,456
<i>out of one Kenny Rogers song.</i>

312
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,289
<i>I set up the bar...</i>

313
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,889
<i>put out my cheese platter...</i>

314
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,556
<i>and positioned myself
at the door where I'd been</i>

315
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:44,822
<i>instructed to only let in</i>

316
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,422
<i>the names on the list.</i>

317
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,989
<i>I was wearing my best dress,
which I had bought</i>

318
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:51,456
<i>two years earlier
at J.C. Penney for $88.</i>

319
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,489
<i>The players started to arrive.</i>

320
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:55,956
<i>I introduced myself as Molly,
Dean's assistant.</i>

321
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,125
For you.

322
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,392
<i>Asked if I could
get them a drink.</i>

323
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:07,293
<i>And took from each of them
$10,000 in cash.</i>

324
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:11,989
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,158
I'm...

326
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,089
I know.

327
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,155
- Your boss...
- Everybody here?

328
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:20,489
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

329
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,326
Fuck off,
I'm gonna own your shit.

330
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,055
Ugly dress.
Ugly shoes.

331
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:27,526
Let's play!

332
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,688
(Molly) <i>Diego fanned nine
cards out on the table</i>

333
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,858
<i>and the players
chose for seats.</i>

334
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,223
(Diego)
<i>Eleven and eleven...</i>

335
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,423
<i>He checked,
the action's on you.</i>

336
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:52,055
(Molly) <i>I just finished
counting out $90,000 in cash.</i>

337
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,923
<i>I was in a room
with movie stars, directors.</i>

338
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:59,422
<i>Rappers. Boxers.</i>

339
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:01,393
<i>- He's in trouble.
- And business titans.</i>

340
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,523
<i>They were going all in,
all the time.</i>

341
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:08,257
<i>Burning through their
buy-ins over and over.</i>

342
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,622
<i>- Here you go. Good luck
- Thank you so much.</i>

343
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,956
I don't know.

344
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,155
(Molly) <i>I Googled every word
I heard that I didn't know.</i>

345
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,557
- <i>Flop. River.</i>
- Fourth Street.

346
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,589
(Molly)
<i>Fourth Street. Tilt. Cooler.</i>

347
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:21,755
<i>- Boat. Nuts.
- Yeah, he's pot committed.</i>

348
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:22,757
<i>Playing the rush.</i>

349
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,090
You keeping track
of the buy-ins?

350
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,689
- Yeah.
- Where? Where's the paper?

351
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:30,890
Spreadsheet.

352
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,826
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

353
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,892
(male #2)
<i>Yeah, motherfucker.</i>

354
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,560
All in.

355
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:46,855
(Molly)
<i>The game ended at 3:30.</i>

356
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,890
<i>And when it did,
that's when Dean shouted out...</i>

357
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:54,022
Hey, tip Molly if you wanna
get invited back next week.

358
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:55,656
(Molly)
<i>Tip Molly.</i>

359
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:59,089
<i>Deep down, I didn't like
the sound of that.</i>

360
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,589
<i>Deep down, I knew
that when your boss says...</i>

361
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,889
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

362
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,722
Don't fucking tell anybody.

363
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:04,956
(Molly) <i>That's usually
not the beginning</i>

364
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,223
<i>of a promising law career.</i>

365
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:07,758
See you next week.

366
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,357
(Molly)
<i>But that was deep down.</i>

367
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,358
<i>I just made $3000.</i>

368
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,722
What are you reading?

369
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,189
"The Crucible."

370
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,788
For school?

371
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,259
My father assigned it.

372
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,257
Do you know how many witches
were burned at Salem?

373
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,855
- How many?
- None.

374
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:56,356
They didn't burn witches.
It's a myth. They hanged them.

375
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:59,558
Or drowned them, or crushed them
with heavy rocks.

376
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:03,257
Wait. Aren't...
You're Molly Bloom.

377
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,222
- Right?
- Yeah.

378
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,656
You don't look the same
as in your photos.

379
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,126
None of us do.

380
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,123
- Molly.
- Yes.

381
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,655
- I'm Charlie Jaffey.
- Oh.

382
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,622
Thank you again
for seeing me so early.

383
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:18,023
- This is my daughter, Stella.
- We met.

384
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,655
Isabel will be here in 45
minutes to take you to school.

385
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,489
- Finish your math?
- Yeah.

386
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,422
- Civ? You know it?
- Yeah.

387
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:25,989
<i>Could you teach it
in class today?</i>

388
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:29,389
If I asked you to teach me
Roman Law, could you do it?

389
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,524
- Yes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

390
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,457
So. First things first.

391
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,379
When was the last time you
slept? Today's Friday.

392
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,289
Tuesday morning at 5 a.m.,
I was arrested by the FBI.

393
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,523
I spent Tuesday
in L.A. County Jail.

394
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,222
I was assessed to be
a minimal flight risk

395
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:45,956
and bail was set
at a $100,000.

396
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,656
My mother signed over her house.

397
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,655
I was released on Wednesday
and ordered to appear

398
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:52,890
in Federal Court
in New York's Southern District.

399
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,589
10 a.m. today.

400
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:55,625
In here.

401
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,126
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

402
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,755
I flew here Wednesday and met
with five attorneys yesterday.

403
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,656
Have a seat.
You didn't hire any of them?

404
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:09,357
Three of them had
already been taken.

405
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,488
Yeah, 31 people were named
in your indictment.

406
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,956
It's Black Friday
for criminal lawyers.

407
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,189
How about the other two?

408
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,256
One told me money was his

409
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:16,688
second favorite form of payment.

410
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,155
- I know him.
- <i>The fifth was also taken.</i>

411
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,390
- But he recommended I call you.
- Why?

412
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,922
I told him I wanted someone
who'd worked in

413
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:24,624
the prosecutor's office and
wasn't even a little bit shady.

414
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:29,155
Do you know about me?

415
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,956
Um, I've been briefed a little
by my daughter, who knows

416
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,421
a lot about your story
because her mother's a moron.

417
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:37,655
- Her mother reads the tabloids?
- Yeah, and I read them too.

418
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,956
I read your indictment
after I got your call last night

419
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,855
and I bought your book.

420
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,090
I'm only on page 112,
but, Molly, did you commit

421
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,856
a felony and then write
a book about it?

422
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,257
I haven't run a game
in over two years.

423
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,489
Not to spoil the ending,
but that's

424
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,655
when the government
raided my game

425
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,289
<i>and took all my money assuming</i>

426
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,822
all of it was made illegally,
which it wasn't.

427
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,856
I've been living in my
mother's house in Telluride

428
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:59,588
and... I wrote the book so I
could start paying off debts.

429
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,589
<i>I just finished the press tour
for the book and I moved back</i>

430
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,556
to Los Angeles
so I could start over.

431
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,222
Hm. You ran games in L.A.
for roughly eight years?

432
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,389
- Yeah. Right.
- Without taking a rake?

433
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,223
And then you ran games
in New York for roughly two.

434
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,357
Well, I took a rake
for the last six months.

435
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,989
In the first 112 pages,
you name a bunch of names.

436
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,323
- Sorry?
- Uh.

437
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,555
You named the names
of some movie stars

438
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,856
that played in your game.

439
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,388
Yeah.

440
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,591
That not against
some sort of poker code?

441
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,323
Am I supposed to be sitting
all the way over here?

442
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:33,159
- Can you hear me from there?
- Yeah.

443
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,355
Are you taking me
on as a client?

444
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:38,355
<i>My retainer is $250,000.</i>

445
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,825
Do you have $250,000?

446
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:44,489
No. I don't have anything.

447
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,923
What about the sales
from your book?

448
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,323
<i>The book isn't
jumping off the shelves.</i>

449
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:50,323
But I will find a way
to pay you, Charlie.

450
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,691
Ask around about me.

451
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,556
Unfortunately,
the people I'd ask

452
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,456
are goin' away for a while.

453
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,355
What happened on Tuesday morning
was called a "GPS Takedown."

454
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,622
Thirty-one people were arrested
in the same instant.

455
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,155
Something in excess
of 600 agents were dispatched

456
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,855
to locations
in New York and L.A.

457
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:08,055
<i>in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons.</i>

458
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:10,290
And you're trying to tell me
you're in my office

459
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,123
because you raked a game
of Texas Hold 'Em?

460
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,355
Have you seen the other names
in your indictment?

461
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,656
"Nicholas Kozlowski.
Peter Druzhinsky.

462
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:19,421
Peter Antonovich.
The Gershen Brothers."

463
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,923
I mean come on, Molly,
just how deep

464
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,256
into the Russian mob were you?

465
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:23,791
Because your book doesn't say.

466
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:43,222
Why are you making your daughter
read "The Crucible?"

467
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:44,655
So she can see
what happens to a group

468
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,456
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip.

469
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,156
- I never read the play.
- Many consider it to be...

470
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,589
The best play
of the 20th century.

471
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,789
Is that what
many consider it to be...

472
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,288
I don't defend
violent criminals.

473
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,389
- I've never hurt anyone...
- Your friends have.

474
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,389
I've never heard of 90%
of the names...

475
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,488
- On the indictment.
- And the other 10%?

476
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,589
I didn't know they were
connected.

477
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,822
I'd no idea
who they were.

478
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,422
Let me ask you a question.

479
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:05,389
The character in the book
you call "Dean Keith"

480
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:08,223
he didn't say
"Poor people bagels," did he?

481
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,589
<i>I think I know who he is.</i>

482
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:10,755
<i>I think I know
a real estate lawyer</i>

483
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,056
that worked with him
and quit.

484
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,422
He said...

485
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:14,858
"Nigger bagels," right?

486
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,756
I'm not telling you his real
name. He's not involved in this.

487
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:24,892
But you were willing
to name some names.

488
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,422
<i>[chair scraping the floor]</i>

489
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,056
Why is the FBI arresting me

490
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,555
two years after
I stopped running games?

491
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:36,723
Were you paid extra
in your book deal

492
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,325
to name the movie stars?

493
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:44,122
I'm not your guy, Molly.

494
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:47,391
I wish you good luck,
but this just isn't for me.

495
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,193
<i>[Charlie sighs]</i>

496
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:57,189
<i>[sighs]</i>

497
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,388
I didn't know
who the Russians were.

498
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,788
<i>I can get you
the $250,000.</i>

499
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,256
I left 10 times
that on the street.

500
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:04,355
It'll just take some time.

501
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,589
We regularly lend out our best

502
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,889

Southern Poverty Law Center,
veterans groups.

504
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,523
But I don't think
I can convince my partners

505
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,656
to take a flyer
on "The Poker Princess."

506
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,455
I didn't name myself
"The Poker Princess."

507
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:19,788
Uh, "Molly Bloom, the self
proclaimed Poker Princess..."

508
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,956
Is that "Us Weekly?"

509
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,589
Yeah, I would agree
it would be unusual

510
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,523
for them to print
something that wasn't true.

511
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:25,990
But it's not true,
and if you think

512
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:28,689
a Princess can do what I did,
you're incorrect.

513
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:30,256
<i>I'm getting you don't
think much of me.</i>

514
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:32,256
But what if every one
of your ill-informed

515
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:34,255
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong?

516
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,589
- I'd be amazed.
- Yeah. You know what, bud?

517
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,156
- You would.
- You don't need me.

518
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:40,126
- You need a publicist.
- No, I need a fucking lawyer!

519
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,692
You didn't answer my question.

520
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,225
When was the last time
you slept?

521
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:57,692
It was a while ago.

522
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,923
Alright.

523
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,588
I'm gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning

524
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,023
'cause you shouldn't
do that alone.

525
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,989
I'm gonna put some bodies
on you and walk you

526
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,022
through the side door,
'cause I don't know

527
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,056
what you've got on the Russians.

528
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,556
But neither do they.

529
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,322
And the Russians
take care of shit.

530
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:20,859
Do you understand

531
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:24,725
Yes.

Almost. You gotta keep

534
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:34,856
Always gotta look ahead.

535
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:35,889

- Yeah.
- Alright.

You can't be afraid of it,

549
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,155
Don't play defense.

550
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,289
(Molly)
<i>And the first rule</i>

551
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,556
<i>was that he made all the rules.</i>

552

What's another word for tired?

00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:26,192
Name a synonym for tired

560

Weak.

561
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,388
That's right.

566
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:42,022
<i>and asked for a dress that made

<i>after one bad night and I
needed this one to keep going.</i>

569
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:49,822
<i>And I needed to bring

570

Ten thousand.

574
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:59,121

<i>He lived to beat people

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,689
<i>Even a reasonably good amateur</i>

<i>would know it was
mathematically the best hand.</i>

591
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:38,155
<i>Which in poker
is called "The Nuts."</i>

592
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:39,923
<i>There was $47,000 in the pot</i>

593
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,556
<i>and the guest
was holding the nuts.</i>

594
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:43,021
<i>But he was starting
to get confused</i>

595

<i>because a movie star
was talking to him.</i>

Why would you be telling me?

598

Either I am messing with you

599
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,189
or you're new to the game.

600
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:51,422
You've had bad cards all night.

601
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,288
You should've folded
after the flop

602
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,922
and I don't wanna win
more of your money this way.

603

I've got queens under here.

604
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,725

- Fuck you.

- I'm all in.

672
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,989
(Molly)
<i>I had my own apartment now.</i>

673
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,121
I'll take it.

674
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:34,154
(Molly)
<i>A new car...</i>

675
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,421
<i>and $17,000 in a shoebox.</i>

676
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,392
<i>Law school could wait
one more year.</i>

677
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:43,655
(male #3)
<i>Next, please. Come on through.</i>

678
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:47,523
<i>Step on up please. Thank you.
Come on through.</i>

679
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,121
So. Here's all that's
gonna happen today.

680
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:51,556
Judge is gonna ask
each defendant

681
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:52,855
if they've read the indictment

682
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,088
or they'd like the court
to read it to them.

683
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,421
Then the judge is gonna ask
how you plead.

684
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:59,456
You're gonna answer,
"Not guilty."

685
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,888
I'll make it clear
for the record

686
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,954
that I'm not your counsel

687
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,221
but I am appearing
on your behalf

688
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:04,288
at the arraignment.

689
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,822
<i>In propria persona.</i>

690
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:08,121
<i>In propria persona</i>
means on your behalf.

691
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,388
- Yeah.
- No.

692
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,021
I'm saying it means
on your behalf.

693
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,221
I am appearing on your behalf.

694
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,256
<i>In propria persona means</i>

695
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:14,787
you're appearing on your behalf.

696
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,124
Not my behalf.

697
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:20,222
I'll check that out,
but the point is...

698
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,588
I'm not your lawyer.

699
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,591
And I'll make that clear
for the record.

That's us over there.

You know, why don't you
sit there?

704
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:47,458
And you sit on the other side.

705
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:57,555
You've gotta good judge.
He's a good guy.

706
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:00,422
- <i>Counsel, please...</i>
- How about the prosecutor?

707
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,256

<i>On behalf of the defendant...</i>

Just in case your lawyer
doesn't mention it

717
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:24,656
next time you appear
in front of the judge

718
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,623
you might wanna re-think
your clothes. Okay?

719
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,692
You look like the Cinemax
version of yourself.

720
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:33,121
I sold my clothes
when the government seized

721
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,788
all of my money two years ago.

722
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,356
Which, incidentally,
was the last time I ran a game.

723
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:39,954
But I think
I already mentioned that.

724
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,523
- Okay.
- <i>Not guilty.</i>

(Nicholas)
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

Your old boss.

The one in the book
you called Dean Keith.

737
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:05,989
He was terrible to you.

738
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,954
Why cover up for him
by changing it

739
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,588
to "poor people bagels?"

740
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,188
I promise you
it couldn't matter less.

- Seriously?

You said you left ten times
that much on the street.

In my office, when I said
the retainer was $250,000

759
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:12,989
you said,
"I left ten times that much..."

Yeah.

million dollars on the street?

765
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,522

- I couldn't.
- Why?

770
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:38,392
I couldn't be sure
how they were gonna collect.

771

<i>without really knowing

813
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,624
What did everyone
learn in school today?

814
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:25,155
Uh... I learned
that Sigmund Freud

815
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:26,687
was both a misogynist
and an idiot.

816
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,622
And anyone who relies
on his theories

817
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,255
of human psychology is a quack.

818
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:31,554
I don't know why you'd say that.

819
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:33,622
You asked me what I
learned in school today.

820
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,391
- Is this Mrs. Linwood?
- <i>Yup.</i>

821
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,155
Did she happen
to mention anything

822
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,122
about his work
on the unconscious mind?

823
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:43,021
His dream analysis has
the credibility of a horoscope.

824
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:44,622
But what got my attention

825
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,921
was that he opposed the women's
emancipation movement.

826
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:48,188
<i>He believed that a woman's life</i>

827
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,554
is about her
reproductive functions.

828
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,189
So you're really getting
to the nuts and bolts

829
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,421
of why middle-class
suburban white girls

830
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,588
have been oppressed
for centuries.

831
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,788
No, Mrs. Linwood was just...

832
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,122
Barbara Linwood
doesn't like men, Molly.

833
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:00,521
She doesn't like dicks,
dad, there's a difference.

834
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:01,790
Molly...

835
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:07,554
Don't disrespect me
like that at the table.

836
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:08,587
I wasn't disrespecting you.

837
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,356
I was disrespecting Freud.

838
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,655
And it's the kitchen table

839
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,221
not the tomb
of the unknown soldier.

840
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,488
And I'm a professional
psychologist, not a quack.

841
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,922
- I never said you were...
- Yeah, you did.

842
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,258
And don't do it again.

843
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,954
And don't ever use language
like that again.

844
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,621
Okay. Ignore my teachers,
watch my language

845
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,321
and respect the kitchen table.

846
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:28,555
What else do I
need to do before

847
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:29,954
I'm allowed
to disagree with you?

848
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:31,221
Make your own money

849
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,921
so you can live
in your own house...

850
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,390
and eat your own food.

851
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,355
(Molly) <i>I'd been running
the game for three years</i>

852
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:43,021
<i>and saved $58,000.</i>

853
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,655
<i>I was recruiting
and vetting players.</i>

854
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,054
- <i>Keeping the books.</i>
- Call.

855
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,521
<i>Collecting
and delivering checks.</i>

856
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:48,955
<i>Meeting the needs
of all the players</i>

857
00:35:48,957 --> 00:35:50,388
<i>through out the week
and still working</i>

858
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,954
<i>full time for Dean Keith.</i>

859
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:54,222
<i>Who made it clear that
if I quit the office job</i>

860
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:55,288
<i>I'd lose the game.</i>

861
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,954
- Call.
- Eights, full of nines.

862
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:59,890
<i>[clamoring]</i>

863
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:08,754
I thought he had trips too.

864
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:10,388
<i>He was slow-playing
into the river</i>

865
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,355
and he hid the pocket eights
pretty well.

866
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,089
It's a tough beat, man.

867
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,524
- You owe the game...
- I know what I owe the game!

868
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:20,588
I wanna talk to you a minute.

869
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,054
- Okay.
- In the hall.

870
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:25,321

871
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,921
<i>♪ Then it died ♪</i>

872
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:30,824
<i>♪ From the street... ♪♪</i>

873
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,357
Is he cheating?

874
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,454
No.

875
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,755
- How would you know?
- I'd know.

876
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:40,089
He and Diego
aren't in bed together?

877
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:41,391
No.

878
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:44,321
What about him and you?

879
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:45,787
A 52 card deck produces

880
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,321
hundreds of millions
of random patterns.

881
00:36:48,323 --> 00:36:50,621
But every time one of you loses
two weeks in a row

882
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:52,122
you're sure something fishy
is going on?

883
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:53,357
Come on.

884
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:58,555
I'm gonna stop paying you.

885
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:01,855
- What do you mean?
- As my assistant.

886
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,289
- Are you firing me?
- I'm not firing you.

887
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,455
I'm just gonna stop paying you.

888
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:05,822
You get paid once a week
from the game.

889
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,221
It doesn't seem fair.

890
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,621
But I also have a job working
for you 24 hours...

891
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:10,621
And if you didn't have a job

892
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:12,788
you wouldn't have the game.
You understand what I'm saying?

893
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,787
I understand each of the words
that you're saying but I don't...

894
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:17,522
- Look!
- 24 hours a day, every day.

895
00:37:17,524 --> 00:37:18,954
But you're gonna stop paying me
to do that job

896
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:21,189
because I'm making too much
money doing my second job?

897
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:22,955
And if I say no,
I'll lose both jobs?

898
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,188
Because it doesn't seem fair?

899
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,288
Business is bad right now.

900
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,691
Welcome to the real world.

901
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:32,288
Alright, here it is.
Banks are loaning you money.

902
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,622
And they shouldn't.

903
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,222
You're a bad risk, they know it.

904
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:36,688
So the debt service
on your loans

905
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,122
is close to 20%,
which is crazy.

906
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,122
Twenty percent is
barely survivable

907
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:42,522
if it's a bridge loan.

908
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,155
But, like for instance

909
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:47,287
it's taken you 10 years
to build seven houses.

910
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,254
All of which are worth
less than they were

911
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:51,321
before you built them,
because the housing market

912
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:53,488
is on a downward trajectory
for the first time

913
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,655
in the history of houses.

914
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:57,222
And that's why business
is doing bad.

915
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:59,922
Not because you're paying me
$450 a week.

916
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,221
You're a business savant?

917
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:02,687
I've read every piece of paper
in your office.

918
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:04,388
You're making thousands
in tips every week.

919
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,921
Why do you care about $450?

920
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:07,722
Because I don't want to pick up
your dry cleaning for free!

921
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:11,054
Well, you don't have
bargaining power here!

922
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,624
You can refuse the pay cut
but you could lose the game.

923
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,124
Cash me out, please.

924
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:20,254
(Molly)
<i>I wasn't gonna wait for Dean</i>

925
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,454

926
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,822

927
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:25,387
<i>The next morning,

928
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,188

<i>and the Beverly Hills Hotel.</i>

930

<i>The suite was $5200 a night.</i>

931
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,722
<i>I spent $17,000</i>

932
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:37,387
<i>on a shuffle master that was
installed in the table.</i>

933
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,420
<i>Faster, more reliable shuffles.</i>

934
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:40,955
<i>Less downtime between hands.</i>

935
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,622
<i>Food was brought in
from Mr. Chow</i>

936
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:45,022
<i>and available to eat

937
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:46,355
<i>There was Macallan 18</i>

<i>Belvedere, 1942</i>

939
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:50,787
<i>Remy Martin,

<i>served by a bartender who'd
already memorized your drink.</i>

941
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,821
<i>Cohibas and Monte Cristo
were in the humidor.</i>

942
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,587
<i>A professional stylist

00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,421

00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,955
<i>"The Cinemax version

945
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:05,254
<i>I spent almost everything

- <i>'Cause you need to hear this.</i>
- Where are you?

950
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,754
<i>I need to tell you something

951
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,321
<i>and I need to know

952
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,855
- Dean.
- <i>You are unimportant.</i>

<i>Do you hear me?</i>

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,355
<i>And you are fired.</i>

- <i>You're fired.</i>
- Can I ask why?

957
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:31,654
<i>How many of my friends
are you sleeping with?</i>

958
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:32,954
I'm not sleeping
with any of 'em.

959
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,421
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

960
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:37,055
Listen to me.

<i>Can I give you some advice?</i>

962
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:41,354
<i>Lose the bitchy air.</i>

<i>Lose the superior air.</i>

964
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,287
<i>And go to the office

965
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,124
<i>and be out of there

00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,188

I'm Leah, um...

969
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,655
Dean asked me

970
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:55,688
I appreciate it.

971
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,688
He also asked me
to get the numbers

972
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,054

so I can confirm the list.

973

<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

974
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:03,857
Don't be.

975
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:07,187
My phone's in my car.

976
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:08,421
Uh, I'll text you
all the numbers

977
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:10,054

978
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:12,488
<i>I texted my replacement

<i>with 310 area codes.</i>

980
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:14,955
<i>Then I sent a text</i>

<i>to the players for tonight</i>

982
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,755

00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,588
- Amazing.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

I'll be hosting a game in this
suite every Tuesday night.

995
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,355
If you play tonight, you'll be
guaranteed a chair for a year.

996
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:07,288
If you prefer to play
at the Cobra Lounge...

997
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,424
there'll be no hard feelings.

998
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,587
Let's play.

999
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,154
(Molly)
<i>The game is mine now.</i>

1000
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:21,522
<i>I incorporated and Molly Bloom
Event Planning was born.</i>

1001

<i>I paid taxes and 1099'd

<i>I never became romantically

<i>with any of the players.</i>

1004
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:29,922
<i>The game would have
fallen apart.</i>

1005
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:32,754
<i>This was back when I was
still making good decisions.</i>

1006
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,455
<i>And I went to a lawyer
to make absolutely sure</i>

1007
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:36,254
<i>all this was legal.</i>

1008
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,787
<i>- Are you taking a rake?
- No.</i>

1009
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,655
Then you're not
breaking the law.

1010
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:41,388
- But can I give you advice?
- Please.

1011
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,889
<i>There's a saying
in my business.</i>

1012
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,754
Don't break the law
when you're breaking the law.

1013
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,088
- What do you mean?
- No drugs. No prostitutes.

1014
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,487
No muscle to collect debts.

1015
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,021
Oh, I don't do
anything like that.

1016
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:53,054
But you just said
I wasn't breaking the law.

1017
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:55,088
You wanna keep it that way
because you don't wanna

1018
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,770
break the law when
you're breaking the law.

1019
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:59,655
Am I breaking the law?

1020
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:00,822
Not really.

1021
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:02,922
We're able to find out
for sure, aren't we?

1022
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:04,188
Laws are written down.

1023
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,922
You're not taking
a percentage of the pot?

1024
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,121
No.

1025
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,688
You're running a square game.

1026
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,989
(Molly)
<i>My game had a tricky ecosystem.</i>

1027
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,521
<i>These guys could buy anything.</i>

1028
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,021
<i>But here, in this room</i>

1029
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:16,621
<i>you couldn't buy your win.</i>

1030
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:19,087
<i>You couldn't buy me,
you couldn't buy the girls.</i>

1031
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,488
<i>And you couldn't buy
a seat at the table.</i>

1032
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,121
<i>There's nothing as sweet
as a win you have to work for.</i>

1033
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:27,889
<i>And the wins and loses were
compelling, and they were real.</i>

1034
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:30,154
<i>Of course, it helped that the
players were gambling addicts.</i>

1035
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,624
Can I see you for a second?

1036
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,087
(Molly)
<i>Jay, you're famous.</i>

1037
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,120
You are an international
rock star.

1038
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:43,154
Oh, I wasn't sure
you'd noticed.

1039
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:44,755
You can't send
emails like that.

1040
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:46,854
Well, it's not a federal
production, okay?

1041
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,621
I just invited you to Cabo
for the weekend.

1042
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:51,987
The next woman you send
an email like that to

1043
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,088
is not gonna be me.

1044
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,855
It's going to be someone else.

1045
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:56,054
You're playing with fire.

1046
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:57,821
I'm telling you that
I'm in love with you

1047
00:42:57,823 --> 00:43:00,320
and you are worried about me
getting blackmailed?

1048
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:02,454
Oh, my, that just makes me
more into you.

1049
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,188
Lemon head. They won't need
to blackmail you.

1050
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,621
They can get just as
much money from TMZ.

1051
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:09,722
And TMZ will give them
what they really want.

1052
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,354
Tell me the truth.
Was mine the first love letter

1053
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,388
you've gotten from a player?

1054
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,854
It was the seventh.

1055
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,287
All digitally transmitted.

1056
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:17,120
You are begging for
your life to be turned

1057
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:19,154
into a very public hell.

1058
00:43:19,156 --> 00:43:20,521
So that's a no on Cabo?

1059
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:22,320
Why don't you just give your
wife and kids a break

1060
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:23,721
and run 'em over with a limo?

1061
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:25,654
I love the way that
you talk to me.

1062
00:43:25,656 --> 00:43:26,656
Oh, God.

1063
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:34,320
- I've had a thought.
- Yeah?

1064
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:35,557
Raise the stakes.

1065
00:43:38,456 --> 00:43:39,457
To what?

1066
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:43,658
50k buy-in. Blinds are 250/500.

1067
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:49,123
- That's a 500 percent hike.
- Yeah.

1068
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:51,889
I don't think it's a good idea.

1069
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,650
Could you guys give me
the room for a second?

1070
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:56,657
Sure.

1071
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,288
The players that are losing
a $100,000 a week

1072
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,687
are gonna be losing
half a million.

1073
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:06,220
The players winning
a $100,000 a week...

1074
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:08,053
Will have no one left
to play with.

1075
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:10,420
Players are gonna get hurt,
others are gonna get killed.

1076
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:12,420
And some will drop out.
It's not sustainable.

1077
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:13,590
We'll lose the game.

1078
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:16,387
Find new players.

1079
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:18,854
(Molly)
<i>He meant "Find new fish."</i>

1080
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,021
<i>I went recruiting again.</i>

1081
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:21,888
<i>First up was Donnie Silverman.</i>

1082
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,220
<i>Donnie won the World Series
of Poker last year</i>

1083
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:26,187
<i>and got in touch with me
through one of the players.</i>

1084
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:27,755
Are you fucking nuts?

1085
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:30,020
Donnie Silverman won
the World Series of Poker.

1086
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:31,454
You can watch it online.

1087
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:33,853
He took 11 hands
at the final table.

1088
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:36,320
But he had the nuts
on eight of them.

1089
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:38,588
And three of those...

1090
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,020
Three were two outers with
four players still in the hand.

1091
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:42,321
He ran hot.

1092
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:44,488
He doesn't lock his chips down,
he's reckless.

1093
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,920
He gives tons of action
and he's got $12 million.

1094
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:50,856
<i>[instrumental music]</i>

1095
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,524
You know,
I don't like playing poker.

1096
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,321
Why do you play?

1097
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:59,388
I like destroying lives.

1098
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,591
Give him a chair.

1099
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:05,320
(Molly) <i>The next recruit
was Brad Marion.</i>

1100
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:06,921
<i>Who everyone called Bad Brad</i>

1101
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:10,721
<i>because he was uniquely
terrible at this game.</i>

1102
00:45:10,723 --> 00:45:13,153
<i>If there was a worse
player in the world</i>

1103
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:15,587
<i>Brad would still find a way
to lose to him.</i>

1104
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,587
Sorry, I don't have a chair,
but you're welcome to a drink.

1105
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,654
No, I just came to
introduce you to, uh, Brad...

1106
00:45:19,656 --> 00:45:21,554
(male #4)
<i>I'm all in. Calling it.</i>

1107
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:23,387
- <i>Yeah, I call.</i>
- Sorry.

1108
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,021
I just wanted to introduce
you to Brad Marion.

1109
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,754
- <i>He wants to play.</i>
- Give me his information.

1110
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:28,721
- I'll check him out.
- Derek's gonna vouch for him.

1111
00:45:28,723 --> 00:45:30,888
<i>"Derek's gonna vouch for him"
meant Derek would cover</i>

1112
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,591
<i>any losses if Brad didn't pay,
up to any amount.</i>

1113
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,087
- Hi, I'm Molly Bloom.
- Brad Marion.

1114
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:40,622
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1115
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:42,887
(Molly)
<i>But he could pay and had to.</i>

1116
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:45,786
<i>Because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot committed.</i>

1117
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:47,187
I'm all in.

1118
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:48,755
(Molly)
<i>You've already invested so much</i>

1119
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:52,255
<i>you might as well see it
through to the end.</i>

1120
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:54,786
<i>Bad Brad had raised
$700 million</i>

1121
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:57,654
<i>for a fund that traded
oil futures and every week</i>

1122
00:45:57,656 --> 00:46:00,655
<i>he came to the game,
lost a $100,000 and tipped me</i>

1123
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,655
<i>five thousand so he could
play the next week.</i>

1124
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:05,888
<i>He wasn't getting any better...</i>

1125
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,624
<i>and the guys were
feasting on him.</i>

1126
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:13,787
Can I get another 50?

1127
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:16,124
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

1128
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:19,521
Brad, this game might not
be for you.

1129
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,722
I know I'm no card shark.

1130
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:23,191
No, you're not.

1131
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:27,786
Here are your losses
after ten weeks.

1132
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:30,420
And you've won... never.

1133
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:32,786
It's actually
a statistical anomaly.

1134
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:34,257
Yeah. I know.

1135
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:36,521
I like playing with the guys.

1136
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:38,254
I don't have that many friends.

1137
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:40,287
Don't take my seat away.

1138
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,588
I can tip you more.

1139
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,121
No.

1140
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:44,522
Your tips are very generous.

1141
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:46,554
How about I-I get you
some books.

1142
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:49,153
Or even, even a pro
to give you lessons?

1143
00:46:49,155 --> 00:46:51,720
Yeah, maybe.

1144
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:54,320
- Yeah, let me think about it.
- Okay.

1145
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:57,188
(Molly) <i>Turned out Bad Brad
knew what he was doing.</i>

1146
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,687
<i>He was getting customers.</i>

1147
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,455
<i>He'd drop his
100K at the game</i>

1148
00:47:00,457 --> 00:47:02,522
<i>and pick up four million
for his hedge fund.</i>

1149
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:04,288
- Tell him what's smart...
- Not me.

1150
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,255
(Molly)
<i>More on that later, but first</i>

1151
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,555
<i>Harlan Eustice.</i>

1152
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:08,888
<i>Player X said he met Harlan</i>

1153
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,255
<i>at the Commerce Casino</i>

1154
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,720
<i>and that he'd be
good for the game.</i>

1155
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:13,621
<i>But I wasn't seeing
what he was seeing.</i>

1156
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:17,487
<i>He played tight, folding after
the hole cards 64% of the time.</i>

1157
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:19,521
<i>It wasn't clear
where his money came from.</i>

1158
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:21,555
<i>He produced backyard
wrestling videos</i>

1159
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:23,454
<i>and other low-rent productions.</i>

1160
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:24,754
<i>But worst of all</i>

1161
00:47:24,756 --> 00:47:27,354
<i>Harlan Eustice
was a good card player.</i>

1162
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:30,487
<i>Why would Player X want someone
at the game who could beat him?</i>

1163
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:33,188
<i>I learned the answer
to that one the hard way.</i>

1164
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,554
- How was your flight?
- Just fine.

1165
00:47:35,556 --> 00:47:37,754
How are you paying for tickets
between L.A. and New York?

1166
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:39,786
I had two million points
left on my Amex.

1167
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,387
They took the card,
but let me keep the points.

1168
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:42,587
Which I thought
was nice of them.

1169
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:44,888
- You had meetings.
- Hmm?

1170
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,988
You had meetings in L.A.
about your book and life rights.

1171
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,220
- I did.
- Was there any interest?

made a generous offer.

1177
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:57,621
- "Treat?"
- It's a new magazine.

1178
00:47:57,623 --> 00:47:59,421
For the high-end
photography enthusiast.

1179
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,521
- They want you to pose naked.
- I'd be the April treat.

1180
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:03,287
I meant interest in your book.

1181
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:05,187
Ah, yeah.

1182
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:08,121
- Any offers?
- A few, I guess.

1183
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:10,153
Couple...

1184
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,188
Five.

1185
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,555
- Really?
- Yeah.

1186
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,153
- And...
- I passed.

1187
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:15,554
You're destitute
and you passed on

1188
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:17,153
five offers to turn
your book into a movie.

1189
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,187
You will be paid, Charlie.

1190
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,354
I'm just curious as to why

1191
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:20,522
you passed on
what would appear to be

1192
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,455
the only way out you have.

1193
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:23,654
Creative differences.

1194
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:25,455
- Okay.
- Should we start?

1195
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,555
You know, I am gonna
figure you out.

1196
00:48:27,557 --> 00:48:28,754
Well, let me know
what you find.

1197
00:48:28,756 --> 00:48:32,153
You see this?
This is discovery.

1198
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:34,555
Let's see what we discovered.

1199
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:37,354
Over here we have
Peter Druzhinsky

1200
00:48:37,356 --> 00:48:40,087
Peter Antonovich
and Peter Slobo.

1201
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:41,287
The three Petes.

1202
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:42,420
Now the three Petes run a chain

1203
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:43,887
of corrupt medical clinics

1204
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:46,021
<i>and have been committing
insurance fraud</i>

1205
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,254
wire fraud and mail fraud
on an epic scale.

1206
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,488
Now, over here we have

1207
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,653
the Ragnyada-Gershen
Organization.

1208
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:55,786
They're a worldwide
bookmaking operation

1209
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:58,187
handling hundreds of millions
of dollars a year

1210
00:48:58,189 --> 00:48:59,786
in illegal sports betting.

1211
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:00,954
And over here, we have

1212
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:03,621
<i>the Alexander-Habib
Organization.</i>

1213
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:06,320
This is also an illegal
sports betting organization.

1214
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:09,388
But this one,
financed by an art gallery

1215
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,820
owned by Shillel Habib,
who everyone calls...

1216
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:14,290
Shelly.

1217
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:22,188
This is the Russian Mafia
and the three are tied together

1218
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,288
in the indictment through...

1219
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,458
a poker game.

1220
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:29,522
- Were they tapping my phones?
- No.

1221
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:30,554
(Molly)
<i>Thank God.</i>

1222
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:31,586
They were tapping the phones

1223
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:32,887
of everyone you talked to.

1224
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:34,254
<i>Okay.</i>

1225
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:36,020
They got you confirming
that you ran raked games

1226
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:38,653
at the Plaza Hotel and various
locations in New York.

1227
00:49:38,655 --> 00:49:40,953
<i>They've also got
a confidential informant</i>

1228
00:49:40,955 --> 00:49:43,686
confirming that you ran
raked games at the Plaza Hotel

1229
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:45,455
and various locations
in New York.

1230
00:49:45,457 --> 00:49:49,154
You were in violation of 1955,
which is a part of the U.S. Code

1231
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:52,287
<i>that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business.</i>

1232
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,786
<i>You know what you did?</i>

1233
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:56,120
You finished writing a book
before the good part happened.

1234
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:58,754
You really get a kick out
of yourself, don't you?

1235
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:00,754
You know,
I don't like this picture.

1236
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:02,387
- Thank you.
- <i>You're like the cat...</i>

1237
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:03,554
That ate the canary
and then told

1238
00:50:03,556 --> 00:50:04,953
the canary's
parents about it.

1239
00:50:04,955 --> 00:50:06,220
<i>It's the picture
the publisher wanted</i>

1240
00:50:06,222 --> 00:50:07,255
and I didn't get a vote.

1241
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,654
I liked the book, good story.

1242
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:10,020
- Well told.
- Thank you.

1243
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:11,288
I need you to tell
it again, though.

1244
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,421
From the beginning,
and this time

1245
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:14,087
without skipping over
the Russians.

1246
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:15,421
(Jaffey) <i>Would you
like a glass of water?</i>

1247
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,256
I'd like a glass of Bourbon.

1248
00:50:20,156 --> 00:50:22,220
- One more thing.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1249
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:23,586
I need your hard drives.

1250
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:25,154
- Going back how far?
- What do you mean?

1251
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,954
Well, I kept my hard drives
when I'd buy a new laptop.

1252
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:29,121
- You're kidding.
- No.

1253
00:50:29,123 --> 00:50:30,421
It had a record of who owed what

1254
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:31,454
and spreadsheets on the players.

1255
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:32,586
<i>It has more than that.</i>

1256
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:33,987
Every time you charge your phone

1257
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,554
by plugging it into the computer

1258
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:36,988
the computer takes a record

1259
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,854
<i>of all your text messages
and emails.</i>

1260
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,321
My laptop has a record
of all text messages and emails

1261
00:50:41,323 --> 00:50:42,821
received years ago on phones

1262
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:44,520
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat?

1263
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:47,586
I wanna run a forensic imaging
on your hard drives.

1264
00:50:47,588 --> 00:50:49,687
Oh, no. Thanks anyway, but I'll
be destroying those hard drives.

1265
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:51,420
No, you can't do that,
they're evidence.

1266
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:52,854
I'm going to blow them up,
I am literally gonna use

1267
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:54,455
explosives and scatter
the remains in the sea.

1268
00:50:54,457 --> 00:50:56,320
Except you told me they exist.

1269
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:57,455
You're gonna have
to pretend I didn't tell you.

1270
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,921
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

1271
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:00,021
<i>You wanted a lawyer that</i>

1272
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,355
wasn't even a little bit shady.

1273
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:02,520
New information
has come to light.

1274
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:03,553
- I see that was stupid.
- Molly.

1275
00:51:03,555 --> 00:51:04,888
There are no hard drives.

1276
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,587
If you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice

1277
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:08,421
on top of the charges
already brought against you

1278
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:11,121
in this case, you will be,
I promise, incarcerated.

1279
00:51:11,123 --> 00:51:13,554
You don't understand
what's in those text messages.

1280
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:15,487
I understand you've had
boyfriends and there'll be

1281
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,521
some exchanges that are a little
bit, you know, embarrassing...

1282
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,255
I don't care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends

1283
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,021
as there is not left
the smallest corner

1284
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:23,355
of my private life

1285
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:25,653
that isn't available
for public scrutiny.

1286
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:28,454
There are messages that
would destroy other lives.

1287
00:51:28,456 --> 00:51:30,221
<i>There are messages
that would end careers</i>

1288
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,721
and obliterate families.

1289
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:34,454
If those the text messages
were to be made public...

1290
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:35,853
- They won't be.
- If they were...

1291
00:51:35,855 --> 00:51:38,188
- They won't be.
- It would be catastrophic.

1292
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,621
- I'm a lawyer, I'm legally...
- No.

1293
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:41,820
Listen to me,
I am legally prohibited

1294
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:42,821
from disclosing anything...

1295
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:44,254
Someone leaked
my last deposition

1296
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:45,854
to the National Enquirer,
Charlie.

1297
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:47,453
- Butterball?
- My last lawyer's name...

1298
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,453
Was Butterman
and he was one of five people

1299
00:51:49,455 --> 00:51:51,287
in the room besides me.

1300
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:52,820
But the information
in that deposition

1301
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:55,321
will be nothing compared
to the consequences

1302
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:56,854
of those text messages...

1303
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:59,420
Ah! I just got it.

1304
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:00,554
Showing up everywhere.

1305
00:52:00,556 --> 00:52:02,153
I couldn't figure out why you

1306
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:03,988
named some people
but not others.

1307
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,854
I thought that maybe
some people paid you.

1308
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,721
You were wrong.
But doesn't matter.

1309
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,853
No, the only people you named
in that book were the ones

1310
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,187
that were already named in
the Bad Brad Marion deposition.

1311
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:14,553
- Which you think...
- I know.

1312
00:52:14,555 --> 00:52:15,820
- Somebody leaked it.
- Sold it.

1313
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:17,154
- <i>To the tabloids.</i>
- Yes.

1314
00:52:17,156 --> 00:52:18,553
- Maybe even Butterbean.
- Butterman.

1315
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:19,887
But I don't know who it was.

1316
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:21,154
I watched Jenny McCarthy

1317
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:22,453
beat you up
for naming the players.

1318
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:23,553
Why didn't you just say,
"Hey, those names

1319
00:52:23,555 --> 00:52:25,221
are already public record?"

1320
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:28,154
I don't know. 'Cause I wasn't
on "The View" under subpoena.

1321
00:52:28,156 --> 00:52:30,254
Can we please get back
to the emails and texts?

1322
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,853
Is that why you have
creative differences

1323
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:32,888
with the Hollywood offers?

1324
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,154
<i>Because they want information</i>

1325
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:35,321
<i>and you won't give them.</i>

1326
00:52:35,323 --> 00:52:36,355
- I don't know you.
- <i>Hm.</i>

1327
00:52:36,357 --> 00:52:37,387
If what happened last time

1328
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,786
were to happen this time

1329
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,054
it would make
what happened last time...

1330
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:42,354
What is this for?

1331
00:52:42,356 --> 00:52:44,220
It's got every text message
and email

1332
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:46,554
I sent in the last year
as well as a variety

1333
00:52:46,556 --> 00:52:48,586
of incriminating evidence
about my clients.

1334
00:52:48,588 --> 00:52:50,188
Now if anything
of yours get leaked

1335
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,586
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder

1336
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:55,254
and I'll lose my job
and get disbarred.

1337
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,120
So in order to demonstrate
the sanctity

1338
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,187
of your attorney-client
confidentiality

1339
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,188
you're betraying
the confidentiality

1340
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,390
of all your other clients?

1341
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:05,988
I know you're not
gonna look at it.

1342
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,754
How do you know?

1343
00:53:07,756 --> 00:53:08,757
I don't know.

1344
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:16,754
<i>I'll fly home to Colorado...</i>

1345
00:53:16,756 --> 00:53:18,656
and be back the next day
with the hard drives.

1346
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:22,686
(Molly)
<i>Harlan Eustice was excited</i>

1347
00:53:22,688 --> 00:53:24,653
<i>about the surprise
40th birthday party</i>

1348
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:26,954
<i>he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours.</i>

1349
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:29,453
I rented out the whole
courtyard of the Buffalo Club.

1350
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:31,187
It'll be about a hundred people.

1351
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:33,887
Kumamoto oysters,
snow crab, lobsters.

1352
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:36,420
(Molly) <i>He wasn't taking off
menu items to show off.</i>

1353
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,187
<i>He was genuinely excited
about the party</i>

1354
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:39,419
<i>he was giving his wife.</i>

1355
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:40,587
She doesn't know
anything about it.

1356
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:41,620
She thinks we're having dinner

1357
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:44,288
with her brother and his wife.

1358
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,786
(Molly)
<i>I liked Harlan.</i>

1359
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:48,288
<i>But nobody else liked him
except Player X.</i>

1360
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,054
- <i>He played tight.</i>
- Fold

1361
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:51,587
<i>Didn't give a lot of action</i>

1362
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:53,387
<i>and always got
his money in good.</i>

1363
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,221
<i>Which means he was
running the odds.</i>

1364
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:57,020
- <i>Five thousand to call.</i>
- No.

1365
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:59,553
(Molly) <i>In other words,
he was playing poker.</i>

1366
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:01,289
<i>And the others were gambling.</i>

1367
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,190
<i>And he won.</i>

1368
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:08,954
<i>By midnight, Harlan had
tripled his original</i>

1369
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:10,953
<i>fifty thousand dollar buy-in.</i>

1370
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:14,021
<i>But everything came off
the rails with one hand.</i>

1371
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:15,387
<i>And that's how it happens.</i>

1372
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,387
<i>That's how you go full-tilt.</i>

1373
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:19,687
<i>Harlan, the best player
at the table</i>

1374
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,487
<i>the best player at most
tables was about to get</i>

1375
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:25,319
<i>bluffed off the win by,
of all people...</i>

1376
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:28,020
<i>Bad Brad. How?</i>

1377
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:30,720
<i>Because Harlan had never
played with Brad before</i>

1378
00:54:30,722 --> 00:54:34,554
<i>and didn't know yet
that Brad was bad.</i>

1379
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:37,954
<i>Harlan's got a boat.
9's full.</i>

1380
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:39,419
<i>Brad's got nothing.</i>

1381
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:40,987
<i>But his pre-flop
betting made it look</i>

1382
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,553
<i>entirely accidently,
like there was</i>

1383
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:44,820
<i>a chance he had pocket kings.</i>

1384
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:46,020
Twenty thousand.

1385
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:47,353
(Molly)
<i>Which if true</i>

1386
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:50,021
<i>would give him
the better full house.</i>

1387
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:52,920
<i>Brad's counting off $20,000,
which means he's going to call</i>

1388
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,787
<i>and Harlan knows that if
Brad's gonna call and not raise</i>

1389
00:54:55,789 --> 00:54:57,453
<i>it means he didn't
have the boat.</i>

1390
00:54:57,455 --> 00:54:59,088
<i>And he's betting
a high two pair.</i>

1391
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,419
<i>Probably kings and queens.</i>

1392
00:55:01,421 --> 00:55:03,219
<i>But then instead
of calling the bet</i>

1393
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:05,587
<i>Brad pushes $72,000
into the pot.</i>

1394
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:06,622
I'm all in.

1395
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:09,586
(Molly)
<i>Harlan looks at Brad.</i>

1396
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:11,487
<i>Every tell Harlan knows about</i>

1397
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:14,453
<i>carotid artery pumping,
stiff hands...</i>

1398
00:55:14,455 --> 00:55:16,487
<i>Brad's doing the opposite.</i>

1399
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:18,420
<i>Brad's betting represented
a huge hand</i>

1400
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:19,854
<i>by calling on the flop</i>

1401
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:22,187
<i>check raising the turn
and bombing the river.</i>

1402
00:55:22,189 --> 00:55:23,687
<i>Of course, Harlan didn't know</i>

1403
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:26,453
<i>that Brad didn't know
what any of that meant.</i>

1404
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:28,988
<i>So Harlan, always
a good sport said...</i>

1405
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,988
Nice bet. I'm laying this down.

1406
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,287
(Molly) <i>As he tossed in what he
didn't realize was the winning hand</i>

1407
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:37,054
<i>Brad tosses in his cards too</i>

1408
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:39,286
<i>and one of them flips
over and Harlan sees...</i>

1409
00:55:39,288 --> 00:55:42,387
You didn't have pocket kings?

1410
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:43,420
I didn't have any kings

1411
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:45,621
except the one in the middle.

1412
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:48,754
- You had two pair?
- I had one pair.

1413
00:55:48,756 --> 00:55:50,157
The nines in the middle.

1414
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,656
Thank you.

1415
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:04,054
(Molly) <i>It wasn't even that
it was that much money.</i>

1416
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:07,186
<i>Harlan only lost
about $40,000 on the hand.</i>

1417
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:08,620
<i>But a circuit breaker blew</i>

1418
00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:10,821
<i>and Harlan was
out for blood now.</i>

1419
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:12,920
<i>Everyone's.</i>

1420
00:56:12,922 --> 00:56:15,319
(Molly) <i>We have a
$112,000 on the table.</i>

1421
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:16,954
<i>You want another 50?</i>

1422
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,253
Give me another 100, please.

1423
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:21,254
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

1424
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,186
Sign here for a 100,000.

1425
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:26,088
(Molly) <i>By 5 a.m., Harlan
was down half a million.</i>

1426
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,219
<i>He'd abandoned everything
he knew about poker</i>

1427
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:29,686
<i>and was playing
like a frat kid</i>

1428
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,322
<i>swinging for a home run
on every hand.</i>

1429
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:36,954
- Another 100 please.
- Hey, bud...

1430
00:56:36,956 --> 00:56:38,757
Molly, please. Let's go.

1431
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:41,890
(Molly)
<i>Sign here for a 100.</i>

1432
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:53,888
(Molly) <i>Text messages were going
out letting everyone know</i>

1433
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,386
<i>Harlan was bleeding.</i>

1434
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:56,454
<i>Guys were coming by to play</i>

1435
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,020
<i>for a couple hours before work.</i>

1436
00:56:58,022 --> 00:57:00,020
<i>They'd been losing
to him for months.</i>

1437
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:02,386
<i>Everyone wanted a check
from Harlan Eustice.</i>

1438
00:57:02,388 --> 00:57:03,587
If you go home now you can have

1439
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,987
a few hours sleep
before Sheila's party.

1440
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,155
Soon.

1441
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:10,253
Come talk to me.

1442
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:12,389
Hi, guys.
Help yourself to some coffee.

1443
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:18,921
You're on tilt.

1444
00:57:18,923 --> 00:57:20,254
Everybody knows it.

1445
00:57:20,256 --> 00:57:21,320
You're playing
without the weapons

1446
00:57:21,322 --> 00:57:22,523
you need to win.

1447
00:57:23,288 --> 00:57:24,490
You're right.

1448
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:26,623
Alright, thank you.

1449
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:29,189
Just give me $500,000.

1450
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:32,487
I just gotta get back to even.

1451
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:33,921
(Molly)
<i>That should be the second line</i>

1452
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:35,620
<i>of every gambler's obit.</i>

1453
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:39,319
<i>Mr. Feldstein died while
trying to get back to even.</i>

1454
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:40,486
<i>Harlan never did.</i>

1455
00:57:40,488 --> 00:57:41,753
<i>And he never got to his wife's</i>

1456
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:42,988
<i>birthday party.</i>

1457
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,586
<i>She filed for divorce
two days later.</i>

1458
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,854
<i>There was one last punch coming</i>

1459
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:49,857
<i>that would put Harlan
on the floor for good.</i>

1460
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,888
<i>Harlan was heads up against
a guy named Frederick</i>

1461
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,590
<i>who was Austrian royalty.</i>

1462
00:57:57,623 --> 00:57:58,486
Call.

1463
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:00,287
<i>Harlan had pocket queens.</i>

1464
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,654
<i>His Excellency had ace king.</i>

1465
00:58:02,656 --> 00:58:05,854
<i>They were both in 65K pre-flop.</i>

1466
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:07,320
<i>Flops queen seven-seven.</i>

1467
00:58:07,322 --> 00:58:08,887
<i>Harlan has a full house again.</i>

1468
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,621
<i>Queens full of sevens.</i>

1469
00:58:10,623 --> 00:58:13,219
<i>With three rounds of betting
in front of him...</i>

1470
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:14,856
<i>the Count has nothing.</i>

1471
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,653
- All in.
- And the Count goes all in.

1472
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:22,053
<i>He wants Harlan
to think he's got</i>

1473
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:23,253
<i>two more sevens under there.</i>

1474
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:24,888
- Call.
- <i>"Nope," says Harlan.</i>

1475
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,219
<i>He's not falling for this again
and he snap calls all in.</i>

1476
00:58:28,221 --> 00:58:30,857
<i>There's $750,000 on the table.</i>

1477
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,821
<i>Diego burns a card
and deals a turn.</i>

1478
00:58:35,823 --> 00:58:39,420
<i>A king. Otto Von Bismarck
now has two pair.</i>

1479
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:41,387
<i>Kings and sevens.</i>

1480
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,887
<i>But two pair is nothing
next to a full house.</i>

1481
00:58:43,889 --> 00:58:45,186
<i>And at this point</i>

1482
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,386
<i>the only hand left that can</i>

1483
00:58:46,388 --> 00:58:48,155
<i>beat a queen full house...</i>

1484
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:51,289
<i>is a king full house.</i>

1485
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,920
<i>Captain Von Trapp
bluffed two pair</i>

1486
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:58,255
<i>and rivered into kings full.</i>

1487
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:01,052
Motherfucker!

1488
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:02,319
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

1489
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:04,420
- Fuck you, fucking mechanic.
- Hey!

1490
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:06,453
Fuck you, you bottom-dealing
party magician!

1491
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:07,921
Hey! Get out on the terrace.

1492
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:09,687
You've been pulling this shit
on me for two days!

1493
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:11,890
- Come on, come on.
- Party magician.

1494
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,890
- You good?
- I'm okay, thanks.

1495
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:23,253
(Molly)
<i>What the hell?</i>

1496
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:26,020
I'll apologize to Diego.

1497
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:27,987
Yeah. And you're gonna go home.

1498
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:29,656
I'm making a floor call,
that's it.

1499
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,489
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

1500
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,255
I don't have it.

1501
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:40,457
A million two.

1502
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:42,556
I don't have it.

1503
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:47,456
I'm sorry.

1504
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:56,823
Go home.

1505
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:00,422
I'm very sorry.

1506
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:05,890
You got to tell
Sheila the truth, okay?

1507
01:00:07,455 --> 01:00:10,019
Tell her the truth.
Tell her what happened.

1508
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:13,853
And I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna get you to a meeting.

1509
01:00:13,855 --> 01:00:16,553
We'll meet tomorrow
and figure out

1510
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:18,389
what to do about the money.

1511
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:33,853
(Molly) <i>Harlan and I
didn't meet the next day.</i>

1512
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:35,753
<i>He just called me
and said everything was okay</i>

1513
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:37,554
<i>and showed up the next week
with a bank check</i>

1514
01:00:37,556 --> 01:00:39,886
<i>for a million, two hundred
thousand dollars.</i>

1515
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:42,286
(Molly) <i>Where did he
get the money from?</i>

1516
01:00:42,288 --> 01:00:44,186
- I loaned it to him.
- Loaned it?

1517
01:00:44,188 --> 01:00:46,487
<i>I get 50% of his wins
until the debt's paid off.</i>

1518
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:49,952
And then fifty percent for the
next two years with no exposure.

1519
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:51,621
You're getting 50% of the wins.

1520
01:00:51,623 --> 01:00:54,553
- And no exposure on the losses?
- Yeah.

1521
01:00:54,555 --> 01:00:56,287
First of all, he'll never
climb out of that.

1522
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,219
That's sharecropper math.

1523
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,887
It's also usury.
It's racketeering.

1524
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:02,886
<i>Second, you can't
stake a player</i>

1525
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:04,586
and play in the game
at the same time.

1526
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:07,219
I've been doing it
for two years.

1527
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:09,689
- You've been staking Harlan?
- Yeah.

1528
01:01:10,922 --> 01:01:13,587
- Jesus Christ.
- <i>It's not cheating.</i>

1529
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:14,853
It creates
the opportunity for it.

1530
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:16,587
- Tell me how.
- Are you kidding me?

1531
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,420
- Tell me how!
- You've interest in another...

1532
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:19,553
You think I'm going
to take a dive?

1533
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:21,419
And if I did, who would care?

1534
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:22,686
You fold your hole cards.

1535
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:24,387
Five of clubs,
and a jack of hearts.

1536
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,419
He's still in the game.

1537
01:01:25,421 --> 01:01:26,820
It would benefit him to know

1538
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:27,852
that the five of clubs...

1539
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:28,886
You think I'm signaling him?

1540
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:29,919
I'm saying it can't

1541
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:31,389
fucking happen again.

1542
01:01:37,755 --> 01:01:41,787
- You disapprove of me.
- It's not personal.

1543
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:43,419
<i>It feels personal
when you chat up</i>

1544
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:45,087
<i>every other guy
at the game except me.</i>

1545
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:47,487
When you stay late for a drink
with J.T. but never...

1546
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:49,152
Have you visited his Oscar?

1547
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:51,387
I think it's bolted
on the hood of his car.

1548
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:53,753
<i>It's noticeable,
when you go out of your way</i>

1549
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,454
to demonstrate that you
have no interest in me.

1550
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:57,320
You did the same thing to Dean.

1551
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,287
These guys want to play cards
with me, not you!

1552
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:00,721
Be that as it may...

1553
01:02:00,723 --> 01:02:02,420
You know who the biggest
winner in this game is?

1554
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:03,486
- It's you.
- You know who...

1555
01:02:03,488 --> 01:02:04,586
The second biggest winner is?

1556
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:06,289
- Look...
- It's you.

1557
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:09,654
<i>What are you taking home,
10,000 a night now?</i>

1558
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:11,686
That is my business,
literally.

1559
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:13,753
Between you, the dealers
and the servers

1560
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:15,521
you're taking a lot of money
out of this game.

1561
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,187
Not as much
as I'm bringing to it.

1562
01:02:17,189 --> 01:02:18,520
That 10,000 is 10,000

1563
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:19,953
that doesn't go in my pocket.

1564
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,319
Again, my money is...

1565
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,153
Your money is my money.

1566
01:02:24,155 --> 01:02:26,153
Is it?

1567
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,622
I think we should talk
about capping your tips.

1568
01:02:31,688 --> 01:02:33,387
You want to get together
with the other players

1569
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:36,820
who on my tax returns,
are called clients

1570
01:02:36,822 --> 01:02:38,952
and discuss putting
a ceiling on my wages?

1571
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:40,886
That's right.

1572
01:02:40,888 --> 01:02:44,623
It'll be America's most closely
watched anti-trust case.

1573
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,587
(Molly)
<i>Right there, right then</i>

1574
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:50,786
<i>that fast, I lost the game.</i>

1575
01:02:50,788 --> 01:02:53,052
<i>It was the next Tuesday,
game night.</i>

1576
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:56,119
<i>He waited until he knew
I'd be on the way to the hotel</i>

1577
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:57,722
<i>and then sent me a text.</i>

1578
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:04,553
<i>It said, "We're playing
at Dave's tonight.</i>

1579
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:05,919
<i>No need to show up."</i>

1580
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:08,053
<i>And I knew the truth
even before I answered</i>

1581
01:03:08,055 --> 01:03:09,690
<i>the call that came next.</i>

1582
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:18,052
<i>[Player X laughing]
You are so fucked.</i>

1583
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:21,189
<i>[instrumental music]</i>

1584
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:33,819
There's no such word
as verticality.

1585
01:03:33,821 --> 01:03:36,720
- Hmm?
- <i>In the book, on page 152.</i>

1586
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:39,053
"When you lose the game in L.A.
and come to New York

1587
01:03:39,055 --> 01:03:41,120
you admire
the city's verticality."

1588
01:03:41,122 --> 01:03:42,153
It's a word.

1589
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,286
Once you're in New York

1590
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:44,320
you talk about games

1591
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:46,419
lasting all night, two nights.

1592
01:03:46,421 --> 01:03:50,187
Bein' up for days,
but you don't mention drugs.

1593
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:51,653
There were drugs.
I'm two years clean.

1594
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:53,220
But you left the drugs
out of the book.

1595
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:55,287
You know what?
I'm not paying you $250,000

1596
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,521
for your Amazon
customer review.

1597
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:58,719
So far, you're not
paying me for anything.

1598
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:00,420
I just emailed you
verticality

1599
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:02,719
from Merriam-Webster's
Dictionary.

1600
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:05,223
What's an advance
on a book like this?

1601
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:08,423
The advance?

1602
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:11,387
It depends.

1603
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,086
(Eli)
<i>If you guarantee the publishers</i>

1604
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:14,286
certain elements

1605
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:16,253
then I can get you
a million and a half.

1606
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:17,820
Which you'd probably
double on sales

1607
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:19,087
plus ancillary rights.

1608
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:20,454
What kind of elements?

1609
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,453
- You have to use real names.
- Eli...

1610
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:25,654
There's a guy who sits
outside my Starbucks

1611
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:28,120
with a, uh,
with a cardboard sign

1612
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:29,586
that says "Vietnam Vet."

1613
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:31,454
And every morning,
I give him a quarter.

1614
01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,419
And right now,
the only difference

1615
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:34,785
between you and him

1616
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,387
is that you have
a story.

1617
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:38,086
I'm one thousand
percent sure that

1618
01:04:38,088 --> 01:04:39,887
the homeless Vietnam vet
has a better one.

1619
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:41,621
You have one asset.

1620
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:43,219
Write your story
and I can get you

1621
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:45,621
a million and a half,
and-and that's the floor.

1622
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:47,521
Go big or go home

1623
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:48,952
and live with your mother.

1624
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:50,622
For the rest of your life.

1625
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:55,390
What if I...

1626
01:04:57,989 --> 01:04:59,254
What if I told the publishers

1627
01:04:59,256 --> 01:05:02,419
that I-I would name the players

1628
01:05:02,421 --> 01:05:05,052
who are already named in
the Brad Marion Deposition?

1629
01:05:05,054 --> 01:05:06,322
All four?

1630
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:09,220
I'll use the real names
of the players

1631
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:11,053
who are already
named by Bad Brad.

1632
01:05:11,055 --> 01:05:12,720
- What if I told them that?
- You spent eight years...

1633
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:14,420
In Hollywood and
two years in New York

1634
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:15,786
running the world's
most exclusive

1635
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:18,052
glamorous and decadent
man cave.

1636
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:19,620
(Eli) <i>So what do the
publishers get from you</i>

1637
01:05:19,622 --> 01:05:21,622
<i>about people with real names?</i>

1638
01:05:23,955 --> 01:05:25,889
My advance was $35,000.

1639
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:28,952
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is

1640
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:30,520
get you a minor role reduction.

1641
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:32,353
Get the 12 points
knocked down to ten.

1642
01:05:32,355 --> 01:05:34,019
- What's a minor role reduction?
- <i>I'm going to argue...</i>

1643
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,652
To the prosecutor that you're,
uh, an employee that was

1644
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:38,320
hired and fired
by the players.

1645
01:05:38,322 --> 01:05:40,719
- Not a chance.
- I think we got a good chance.

1646
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:42,319
No, not a chance I'm letting
you make that argument.

1647
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:44,653
- Why not?
- <i>It's not true.</i>

1648
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:46,087
Let me explain how
the point system works.

1649
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,419
I know how it works.

1650
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:49,419
Points correspond
with the prosecutor's

1651
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:50,852
sentencing recommendation.

1652
01:05:50,854 --> 01:05:52,052
You try to get a point reduction

1653
01:05:52,054 --> 01:05:53,354
based on a variety of factors

1654
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:55,553
including, say,
prior criminal history

1655
01:05:55,555 --> 01:05:57,586
which I don't have,
or whether the defendant

1656
01:05:57,588 --> 01:05:59,520
<i>played a minor role,
which I certainly did not.</i>

1657
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,253
You really think this is
a good time to hog credit?

1658
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:02,520
- I built it from scratch.
- <i>No.</i>

1659
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:03,785
There was already a game
at the Cobra Lounge

1660
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:04,853
when you came along.

1661
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:06,386
The New York game is
what I'm talking about.

1662
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:07,819
I built from scratch.

1663
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:08,986
<i>I wasn't fireable.</i>

1664
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:10,020
I made sure of that.

1665
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,323
So, no.

1666
01:06:12,523 --> 01:06:13,552
I wasn't really listening.

1667
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:15,286
I'm refusing you permission

1668
01:06:15,288 --> 01:06:16,619
to seek a minor role reduction.

1669
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,053
I'm refusing you permission

1670
01:06:18,055 --> 01:06:19,586
to invalidate
my entire career.

1671
01:06:19,588 --> 01:06:21,852
- And I'm not caring.
- I built a successful...

1672
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:23,355
Hey, do you want kids?

1673
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:27,220
You interested
in having a family?

1674
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:28,685
Very much.

1675
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:30,353
<i>I don't get you
some point reductions</i>

1676
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:32,019
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines

1677
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,419
say eight to twelve years.

1678
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:35,087
And that's before they
try to jam you up

1679
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:36,652
more for money laundering.

1680
01:06:36,654 --> 01:06:38,887
The moment you changed the
Russian's money for chips...

1681
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:40,652
I would've had to been aware
where the money was...

1682
01:06:40,654 --> 01:06:42,686
Find me twelve men and women
who'll believe

1683
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:44,686
that you weren't aware
of exactly who was sitting

1684
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,319
at your table
and where the money came from.

1685
01:06:46,321 --> 01:06:47,953
So, that's it.

1686
01:06:47,955 --> 01:06:50,255
You were a cocktail waitress.

1687
01:06:55,022 --> 01:06:59,387
(Molly) <i>When I lost the L.A. game,
I told myself it was no big deal.</i>

1688
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:01,387
<i>It was just supposed
to be an adventure</i>

1689
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:03,855
<i>and a way to meet
influential people.</i>

1690
01:07:05,587 --> 01:07:08,422
<i>And I'd saved over $200,000.</i>

1691
01:07:10,088 --> 01:07:12,786
<i>But that was just a weak
firewall I'd hastily built</i>

1692
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:15,254
<i>to keep out the humiliation
and depression</i>

1693
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:16,721
<i>I knew was coming.</i>

1694
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:22,355
<i>It had to end sometime.</i>

1695
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:25,888
<i>I just thought
it would be on my time.</i>

1696
01:07:27,321 --> 01:07:30,119
<i>The game had given me
an identity</i>

1697
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:32,585
<i>respect and a defined place</i>

1698
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:35,586
<i>in a world
that was inaccessible.</i>

1699
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:39,155
<i>And in one irrational
heartbeat, it was taken away.</i>

1700
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:43,387
<i>I was irrelevant...</i>

1701
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:45,522
<i>and forgotten, overnight.</i>

1702
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:51,852
<i>It'd been two weeks
since I lost the game...</i>

1703
01:07:51,854 --> 01:07:53,820
<i>and I made an appointment
to see someone.</i>

1704
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:56,585
<i>Because now,
the humiliation and depression</i>

1705
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:58,552
<i>had given way
to a blinding anger</i>

1706
01:07:58,554 --> 01:08:02,222
<i>at my powerlessness
over the unfair whims of men.</i>

1707
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:07,086
<i>It was that
there weren't any rules.</i>

1708
01:08:07,088 --> 01:08:10,354
<i>These power moves weren't
framed by right and wrong.</i>

1709
01:08:10,356 --> 01:08:12,520
<i>Just ego and vanity.</i>

1710
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:15,253
<i>Selfish whims with
no regard for consequence.</i>

1711
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:17,019
<i>No fairness, no justice.</i>

1712
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:19,819
<i>And that giggling,
cackling call from Player X.</i>

1713
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:21,686
<i>[Player X giggling]
You're so fucked.</i>

1714
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:23,685
<i>I couldn't lose to that
green-screened little shit.</i>

1715
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,987
<i>And I didn't want a therapist</i>

1716
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:27,619
<i>to make me feel okay about it.</i>

1717
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:30,585
<i>You know what makes you feel
okay about losing?</i>

1718
01:08:30,587 --> 01:08:32,354
<i>Winning.</i>

1719
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:34,219

<i>The players were here.</i>

1725
01:08:44,022 --> 01:08:45,886
<i>I just had to bait the hook.</i>

1726
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,387
<i>This time,
I didn't have movie stars.</i>

1727
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:52,219
<i>This time,
I used Playboy Playmates.</i>

1728
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:54,520
<i>These weren't
just any Playmates.</i>

1729
01:08:54,522 --> 01:08:56,519
<i>Jesse was

<i>who grew up working
in card rooms</i>

1731
01:08:58,288 --> 01:09:00,385
<i>and was a good player herself.</i>

1732
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,686
<i>I could stake her,
infiltrate other games</i>

1733
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:05,086
<i>and poach

1734

<i>Shelby could write code</i>

<i>- But that's Manhattan.
- What do you mean?</i>

1744
01:09:27,055 --> 01:09:29,186
Biggest game in New York
is in Brooklyn.

01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:30,653
Russian Jews.

1746
01:09:30,655 --> 01:09:31,486
Buy-in's a 100k.

1747
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:32,719
No one runs the game.

1748
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:34,485

<i>Hollywood doesn't.</i>

01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,520
<i>The Yankees.</i>

1754
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:43,253

<i>that every man in America</i>

Don't say his name out loud.

1758
01:09:47,322 --> 01:09:49,052
Write it on a cocktail napkin.

1759
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:50,254
Crumple up the napkin up.

<i>Put it in a glass of water</i>

01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:54,519
- That's really necessary?
- <i>No.</i>

1763
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:56,020
It's not at all necessary.

1764
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:57,052
When do we tell them the game

1765
01:09:57,054 --> 01:09:58,353
is going to start?

1766
01:09:58,355 --> 01:09:59,553
Tell them it's been happening

1767
01:09:59,555 --> 01:10:01,720
once a week for about six months

1768
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:04,152

disclose right now.

1769
01:10:04,154 --> 01:10:05,852
There's a pretty long
waiting list for a chair

1771
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,186

Yeah, fifty...

50K buy-in?

1776
01:10:20,587 --> 01:10:23,619
No, 250.

1777
01:10:23,621 --> 01:10:25,254
That's going to make noise.

1778
01:10:25,256 --> 01:10:27,889
Enough to be
heard on Rodeo Drive.

<i>Percocet and more Adderall.</i>

1823

01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:01,785

<i>Thursdays and Sundays

<i>At 7:00, the dealers came</i>

<i>and the table was set up

or five times.

1849
01:12:58,721 --> 01:13:01,219
You've got hundreds of thousands
on the street.

1850
01:13:01,221 --> 01:13:03,686
That's money you're
never gonna see again.

1851
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:07,253
(Molly) <i>B had been suggesting
it for a long time.</i>

1852
01:13:07,255 --> 01:13:08,552
<i>She was suggesting it again</i>

1853
01:13:08,554 --> 01:13:10,120
<i>because of an incident
the week before.</i>

1854
01:13:10,122 --> 01:13:11,486
- Hey, Cole.
- Hey.

1855
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:14,119
- Come on in.
- Thanks, you got my check?

1856
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:16,086
(Molly)
<i>I do.</i>

1857
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:17,418
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

1858
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,819
Hey can I show you
something on TV?

1859
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:21,753
Umm, actually,
I'm in kinda a hurry.

1860
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:23,589
It'll just take a second.
Have a seat.

1861
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:29,151
This is last Tuesday's game.

1862
01:13:29,153 --> 01:13:30,986
Shit, Molly,
if the guys find out

1863
01:13:30,988 --> 01:13:33,887
you've got cameras on them,
they're gonna go nuts.

1864
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:35,953
Yeah, that's you
in the seventh chair.

1865
01:13:35,955 --> 01:13:37,119
Look at your stack of chips.

1866
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,553
I've got a cab downstairs...

1867
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:41,987
Look at the time stamp.
1:06 a.m.

1868
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:43,586
(Molly)
<i>Let's fast forward to 1:07.</i>

1869
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:46,053
<i>1:07,
you lose a hand to Boosty.</i>

1870
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:48,285
- What is this?
- <i>1:08.</i>

1871
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,920
Our sheets say that
you didn't buy-in again

1872
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:51,419
<i>between 1:06 and 1:08.</i>

1873
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:53,552
<i>But look at that,
your stack's bigger.</i>

1874
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,986
- I can explain, it's just, uh...
- Okay, let's rewind.

1875
01:13:55,988 --> 01:13:57,886
<i>This screen's got
the dealer changeover</i>

1876
01:13:57,888 --> 01:14:00,253
<i>while at the same time,
on this screen</i>

1877
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:04,085
<i>and... there we are.</i>

1878
01:14:04,087 --> 01:14:08,085
<i>This is why I can't reconcile
$57,000 from Tuesday's game.</i>

1879
01:14:08,087 --> 01:14:10,653
A 7-11's got security cameras
on their slushy machine.

1880
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,353
I've got a million
dollars changing hands

1881
01:14:12,355 --> 01:14:14,319
every two minutes, imbecile.

1882
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:16,455
You don't think
I've got eyes on the table?

1883
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,422
Relax.

1884
01:14:23,554 --> 01:14:25,452
I, uh, I owe people money.

1885
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:27,785
I know. Why isn't it coming
from the trust fund?

1886
01:14:27,787 --> 01:14:30,920
I need my parents' permission
to get that much.

1887
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:33,185
And they'd kill me. You don't
even understand what it's like.

1888
01:14:33,187 --> 01:14:35,253
People don't realize
trust fund kids.

1889
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:36,386
Are suffering
in this economy, too.

1890
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,051
I realize what I did was wrong.

1891
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:40,318
Did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there?

1892
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,720
Okay, okay, first of all

1893
01:14:41,722 --> 01:14:43,185
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips

1894
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,486
are taking you for a ride.

1895
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:45,887
They know that
there are signatures

1896
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:46,919
built into the chips.

1897
01:14:46,921 --> 01:14:49,686
Exact weight, infrared markings.

1898
01:14:49,688 --> 01:14:51,386
Breathe. Second.

1899
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:53,253
Don't try this
at anyone else's game

1900
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,785
because if you do,
they are going to express

1901
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,452
their anger in a much different
way than I am.

1902
01:14:57,454 --> 01:14:59,186
You owe me $57,000.

1903
01:14:59,188 --> 01:15:00,752
When I get it, you get the tape

1904
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:01,920
but until then

1905
01:15:01,922 --> 01:15:04,051
you don't play in anyone's game.

1906
01:15:04,053 --> 01:15:07,085
(Molly) <i>So when Tuesday night
came, B was at it again.</i>

1907
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:08,953
Your exposure's crazy.

1908
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:11,085
It's not if, it's when.

1909
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:12,953
You're gonna get blown up.

1910
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:15,452
Your risk is nuts.

1911
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:17,887
If I took a rake, this game
would no longer be legal.

1912
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:21,852
And if you can't cover,
this game will no longer exist.

1913
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:23,620
You're the bank now.

1914
01:15:23,622 --> 01:15:26,289
You're guaranteeing the game.

1915
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:30,218
If you see a hand

1916
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,685
you don't want to carry

1917
01:15:31,687 --> 01:15:33,286
just look at me

1918
01:15:33,288 --> 01:15:35,052
flash me a number

1919
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:37,289
and I'll take it off the table.

1920
01:15:38,488 --> 01:15:42,186
Most runners cap it
at five percent.

1921
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:45,121
- I'll see you out there.
- See you out there.

1922
01:16:03,288 --> 01:16:04,920
(Molly)
<i>Two weeks later, around 2 a.m.</i>

1923
01:16:04,922 --> 01:16:08,385
<i>there was a pot that was up to
$1.3 million, pre-flop</i>

1924
01:16:08,387 --> 01:16:11,619
<i>with five players still in.</i>

1925
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:15,352
<i>My hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off.</i>

1926
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:16,853
(male #5)
<i>$200,000.</i>

1927
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:18,655
<i>Raise a $100,000.</i>

1928
01:16:21,355 --> 01:16:24,686
- $300,000 to you, sir.
- Call.

1929
01:16:24,688 --> 01:16:27,856
(Molly) <i>There was now 2.1
million on the table.</i>

1930
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:32,589
$300,000 to you, sir.

1931
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:35,452
Plus 200.

1932
01:16:35,454 --> 01:16:37,121
(Molly)
<i>$2.6 million.</i>

1933
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:46,218
<i>Three million.</i>

1934
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,485
<i>She was right.</i>

1935
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,519
<i>I was extending credit.
Big numbers.</i>

1936
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,485
<i>And it's not like
Harlan Eustice hadn't already</i>

1937
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:53,620
<i>put the fear of God into me.</i>

1938
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:55,485
<i>If I couldn't pay one time</i>

1939
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,986
<i>that'd be the end of the game.</i>

1940
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,622
<i>I was the house.</i>

1941
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:05,418
<i>That's how quickly
I made the decision.</i>

1942
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,319
<i>And just as quickly, B
calculated 2 percent of the pot</i>

1943
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:10,155
<i>and took it off the table.</i>

1944
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,720
<i>That was it,
I had just taken a rake</i>

1945
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:19,254
<i>in violation of
U.S. Criminal Code, 1955.</i>

1946
01:17:24,154 --> 01:17:26,119
<i>It's time to introduce
Douglas Downey</i>

1947
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:28,919
<i>'cause Downey's gonna
take us all the way home.</i>

1948
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:30,753
<i>Downey was a drunk,
and he'd stay after the game</i>

1949
01:17:30,755 --> 01:17:33,385
<i>and hang out
while I did the books.</i>

1950
01:17:33,387 --> 01:17:35,151
<i>He was hard to understand
when he was drunk</i>

1951
01:17:35,153 --> 01:17:36,353
<i>and his conversation openers</i>

1952
01:17:36,355 --> 01:17:37,419
<i>would always sound like</i>

1953
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:38,886
<i>the title of a detective novel.</i>

1954
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:41,685
Victim of circumstance.

1955
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:42,823
Yeah.

1956
01:17:45,355 --> 01:17:48,218
Story of, you know...

1957
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,521
Story of my proverbial,
you know...

1958
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:58,851
- Life?
- Life.

1959
01:17:58,853 --> 01:18:01,253
(Molly)
<i>He'd talk about his marriage.</i>

1960
01:18:01,255 --> 01:18:04,118
I married young, Mol.

1961
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,652
I married young
and I married dull.

1962
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:10,820
If I'd been born in Greenwich
instead of Flushing...

1963
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:12,752
(Molly) <i>He talked about
wanting a better life.</i>

1964
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,218
New Canaan...

1965
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:17,219
Gone to... Rye Country Day

1966
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:18,855
Princeton...

1967
01:18:20,722 --> 01:18:21,789
The life I'd have.

1968
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,785
The wife I'd have?

1969
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,721
I'd be a player.

1970
01:18:29,853 --> 01:18:31,721
Victim of circumstance.

1971
01:18:35,221 --> 01:18:38,686
Mol, these are things
I only say to you.

1972
01:18:38,688 --> 01:18:39,885
Good call.

1973
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,119
(Molly)
<i>And he'd talk about another</i>

1974
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:42,985
<i>game he played in.</i>

1975
01:18:42,987 --> 01:18:44,385
<i>It was the Brooklyn game.</i>

1976
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,452
<i>The Brighton Beach game</i>

1977
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,686
<i>where they played all night</i>

1978
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:47,885
<i>and all day.</i>

1979
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:50,352
<i>The game that was
populated by Russians.</i>

1980
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:53,553
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

1981
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:57,086
Mol, these are the nicest
guys I've ever met.

1982
01:18:57,088 --> 01:19:00,386
(Molly) <i>Then one night, Douglas
Downey lost $80,000 at my game</i>

1983
01:19:00,388 --> 01:19:01,685
<i>and didn't have it.</i>

1984
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:03,753
Winston, can I have
the room, please?

1985
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:05,019
Sure.

1986
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:06,522
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mm.

1987
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,784
You won a $190,000 last week.

1988
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:16,686
- I owe Teddy Chin and Tutti...
- Right.

1989
01:19:16,688 --> 01:19:18,186
And some sports bets.

1990
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:20,818
I'm a winner trapped
inside the body of a...

1991
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:23,051
- Stop.
- Yeah.

1992
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:25,318
The Brooklyn game.

1993
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,086
Is everything I've heard true?

1994
01:19:27,088 --> 01:19:28,586
What have you heard?

1995
01:19:28,588 --> 01:19:30,151
The Russian's have deep pockets

1996
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:31,552
bad at poker, give action

1997
01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:33,553
pay instantly
and wear a coat and tie.

1998
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:34,822
It's all true.

1999
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,784
Bring me some of those players
and I'll give you

2000
01:19:40,786 --> 01:19:43,819
a piece of the game
until your 80K is paid down.

2001
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,653
Loser is what I was gonna say.

2002
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,785
Winner trapped inside
the body of a...

2003
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:49,119
- I know. Got it.
- Loser.

2004
01:19:49,121 --> 01:19:50,453
Can you bring me some players?

2005
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:52,785
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

2006
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:54,784
Do you understand the deal
I'm offering you?

2007
01:19:54,786 --> 01:19:57,652
No, I'm saying this
because you're Irish

2008
01:19:57,654 --> 01:19:59,653
and they may not want
to play in your game.

2009
01:19:59,655 --> 01:20:01,951
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

2010
01:20:01,953 --> 01:20:03,887
I'm not Irish.

2011
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:09,620
- You're not?
- No.

2012
01:20:09,622 --> 01:20:10,851
Molly Bloom?

2013
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:13,188
You're thinking
of the James Joyce character.

2014
01:20:14,988 --> 01:20:17,152
I always thought you were Irish.

2015
01:20:17,154 --> 01:20:18,951
I'm not.
Can you bring me some players?

2016
01:20:18,953 --> 01:20:20,352
Isn't there a famous book...

2017
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:21,985
Okay, Douglas, focus up.

2018
01:20:21,987 --> 01:20:24,352
Yes, there's a book
by James Joyce called "Ulysses"

2019
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:25,653
and there's a character
named Molly Bloom

2020
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,118
and that is why
you think I'm Irish

2021
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,119
but now it's time
to move past that.

2022
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:31,456
Can you bring me
some Brighton Beach players?

2023
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:36,419
If you're not Irish,
what are you?

2024
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:38,552
I'm a Russian Jew.

2025
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:41,385
(Molly) <i>The next week, I
had some new players.</i>

2026
01:20:41,387 --> 01:20:42,752
<i>Mike was the first one
to arrive.</i>

2027
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,684
- I'm Jesse.
- I'm Mike Davidoff.

2028
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:46,419
(Molly) <i>Mike owned a
chain of medical clinics</i>

2029
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:48,751
<i>and had already posted
with a wire transfer.</i>

2030
01:20:48,753 --> 01:20:51,752
<i>Next were the Gershen brothers.
Illya and Alexei.</i>

2031
01:20:51,754 --> 01:20:54,385
<i>They were in the business
of exporting steel to China.</i>

2032
01:20:54,387 --> 01:20:56,453
<i>Alexei brought a quarter
of a million dollars</i>

2033
01:20:56,455 --> 01:20:58,589
<i>in cash, in a backpack.</i>

2034
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:02,785
Mr. Habib, good evening.
I'm Shelby.

2035
01:21:02,787 --> 01:21:05,619
I'm Shelly.
Only one letter's different.

2036
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:07,986
Also I'm a billionaire. I think
I may have seen you naked.

2037
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,453
No. You would remember.

2038
01:21:10,455 --> 01:21:11,986
(Molly)
<i>And then Shelly Habib.</i>

2039
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:13,886
<i>The Habib family
owns the largest collection</i>

2040
01:21:13,888 --> 01:21:17,553
<i>of classical art in the world,
valued at 3 billion dollars</i>

2041
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:19,285
<i>and Shelly runs
the Hallie Gallery</i>

2042
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:20,452
<i>on Madison Avenue.</i>

2043
01:21:20,454 --> 01:21:22,018
As for tonight, I was not able

2044
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,352
to put my hands on cash today

2045
01:21:23,354 --> 01:21:24,386
because I woke up this morning

2046
01:21:24,388 --> 01:21:25,818
after the banks had closed.

2047
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,119
So I'm hoping you'll accept

2048
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:29,389
this as temporary collateral.

2049
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:35,318
That is an authentic Monet?

2050
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,185
Grabbed it right off the wall.

2051
01:21:38,187 --> 01:21:40,419
You came over here
carrying a Monet?

2052
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:43,651
I was driven and I have security
outside the door.

2053
01:21:43,653 --> 01:21:46,185
Okay, Shelly.
Here's what I need you to do.

2054
01:21:46,187 --> 01:21:47,919
I need you to get this...

2055
01:21:47,921 --> 01:21:49,218
- What, four?
- Seven.

2056
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,319
(Molly)
<i>Seven million dollar</i>

2057
01:21:50,321 --> 01:21:51,652
painting out of here right now.

2058
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:53,819
- And you're, I assume, armed?
- Sure.

2059
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:56,286
(Molly) <i>Security can't stand
in front of the door.</i>

2060
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:57,951
Fix this up, come on back

2061
01:21:57,953 --> 01:22:01,185
and I'll extend you credit
tonight up to one and a half.

2062
01:22:01,187 --> 01:22:03,218
You're a very
beautiful woman.

2063
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,618
Please be careful
with the painting.

2064
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,052
Always.

2065
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,586
(Molly) <i>Mike, Illya,
Alexei and Shelly.</i>

2066
01:22:08,588 --> 01:22:10,651
<i>Those were the players
Doug Downey brought me.</i>

2067
01:22:10,653 --> 01:22:13,652
<i>As advertised,
they played loose, gave action</i>

2068
01:22:13,654 --> 01:22:16,186
<i>lost to the regulars
and settled right away.</i>

2069
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:18,951
<i>People have asked,
"Wasn't there any way to tell</i>

2070
01:22:18,953 --> 01:22:20,718
<i>"that some of the players
at your game were connected</i>

2071
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,552
<i>"to one of the darkest,
deadliest</i>

2072
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:25,851
<i>and far-reaching organized
crime syndicates in the world?"</i>

2073
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,152
<i>No. There wasn't.</i>

2074
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:30,189
I'm gonna go all in.

2075
01:22:53,321 --> 01:22:56,456
<i>[instrumental music]</i>

2076
01:23:24,654 --> 01:23:25,788
<i>[Charlie sighs]</i>

2077
01:23:27,188 --> 01:23:29,652
I wish I had better news.

2078
01:23:29,654 --> 01:23:32,453
Harrison Wellstone didn't go
for the minor role reduction?

2079
01:23:32,455 --> 01:23:33,684
No.

2080
01:23:33,686 --> 01:23:35,486
He didn't buy that
I was a cocktail waitress?

2081
01:23:35,488 --> 01:23:38,585
- No.
- Aww. Is it because I wasn't?

2082
01:23:38,587 --> 01:23:41,151
Hey, I tried, which is what
you're not paying me to do.

2083
01:23:41,153 --> 01:23:42,485
So what now?

2084
01:23:42,487 --> 01:23:43,818
The Government
is expressing an interest

2085
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,386
in you being
a cooperating witness.

2086
01:23:45,388 --> 01:23:46,652
- You don't say?
- Molly.

2087
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,419
Who could've possibly seen that
coming?

2088
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:50,119
- Let's have the conversation.
- It will be short.

2089
01:23:50,121 --> 01:23:51,719
Because I don't know anything
at all that can help them.

2090
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:53,353
You don't know anything that can
help them convict

2091
01:23:53,355 --> 01:23:55,019
the Russians, but you
know things that can help them.

2092
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:57,485
Did you know that
97 percent of Federal cases

2093
01:23:57,487 --> 01:23:58,718
never make it to trial?

2094
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,484
Even though the chances
of being convicted

2095
01:24:00,486 --> 01:24:01,852
at trial is a little more than
one in a hundred?

2096
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:03,651
If you want to go
to trial, that's fine.

2097
01:24:03,653 --> 01:24:06,018
But it's gonna cost you
in the area of $3,500,000

2098
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,086
Which the Justice Department
knows I don't have

2099
01:24:08,088 --> 01:24:09,418
because they took
all of my money

2100
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,919
in a civil forfeiture
which they can do

2101
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,051
without a warrant,
because my property

2102
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,684
<i>doesn't have a presumption
of innocence.</i>

2103
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:16,952
Then after I'm arrested
by 17 agents

2104
01:24:16,954 --> 01:24:19,353
holding automatic weapons,
totally necessary

2105
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:20,819
not at all meant
to intimidate me.

2106
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:22,851
I'm given two days
to hire a lawyer

2107
01:24:22,853 --> 01:24:24,852
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country.

2108
01:24:24,854 --> 01:24:26,585
If you're saying
that everything that happens

2109
01:24:26,587 --> 01:24:28,518
from the moment
you are arrested is designed

2110
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,519
to persuade you to plead guilty,
you are correct.

2111
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:32,219
So tell me all the ways
I can help

2112
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:33,886
'cause I really feel
I owe it to them.

2113
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:35,386
Oh, speaking of owing

2114
01:24:35,388 --> 01:24:37,852
the IRS put a tax lien
on the money they took from me.

2115
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:40,418
Are you ki... Alright.
None of that matters.

2116
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,119
Taking my money wasn't a tax

2117
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:44,019
I also need
to give them my money.

2118
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:45,652
- Or they will take it again.
- None of that matters.

2119
01:24:45,654 --> 01:24:47,385
- It needed to be said.
- Not really.

2120
01:24:47,387 --> 01:24:49,285
So, to be clear, you're not
interested in entering

2121
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:50,818
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors?

2122
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,386
If I had testimony that would
lead to the conviction

2123
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:55,152
of a bad guy, no one would have

2124
01:24:55,154 --> 01:24:56,819
<i>to coerce me into cooperating.</i>

2125
01:24:56,821 --> 01:25:00,986
But I don't. I have dirt.
I have dish. I have gossip.

2126
01:25:00,988 --> 01:25:02,417
So my value to the prosecution

2127
01:25:02,419 --> 01:25:04,951
is exactly the same
as it is to Hollywood.

2128
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:08,086
I'm here to ensure the
New York Post covers the trial.

2129
01:25:08,088 --> 01:25:09,385
I'm here to sell tickets.

2130
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:11,618
Which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution.

2131
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,052
So what we do
is leverage it to get

2132
01:25:14,054 --> 01:25:15,519
you a favorable sentencing
recommendation

2133
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:18,918
or, better yet,
complete immunity. What?

2134
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,519
Oh. Hey, honey.

2135
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:22,488
- Hey, Stella.
- Hey.

2136
01:25:23,054 --> 01:25:24,086
Hey.

2137
01:25:24,088 --> 01:25:25,484
What does he have you doing now?

2138
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:26,818
An essay on three poems

2139
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,484
with what he believes
are a common theme.

2140
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:30,818
Not an essay. Two paragraphs.

2141
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:33,319
- Which three poems?
- Close, Rush and Walls.

2142
01:25:33,321 --> 01:25:36,285
Oh, I know those.
What's the common theme?

2143
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:37,819
Things with one word titles.

2144
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:39,852
Are you sure you're qualified
to be teaching poetry?

2145
01:25:39,854 --> 01:25:41,784
Hang on... And yes.

2146
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:44,651
Anytime you wanna run away from
home, you can come live with me.

2147
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:46,551
(Charlie) <i>Then you'll discover
she doesn't have a home</i>

2148
01:25:46,553 --> 01:25:48,885
and you'll come back to me.

2149
01:25:48,887 --> 01:25:50,418
This is good. Great.

2150
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,185
Why don't you grab a snack
and start your homework

2151
01:25:52,187 --> 01:25:53,219
in one of the conference rooms?

2152
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:54,784
Okay. See ya.

2153
01:25:54,786 --> 01:25:56,618
There's no law that says you
can't just hit him in the head.

2154
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,253
There is a law that says that,
it's the first thing

2155
01:25:58,255 --> 01:25:59,651
I taught her to read.

2156
01:25:59,653 --> 01:26:00,721
Go.

2157
01:26:02,386 --> 01:26:03,720
<i>[door closes]</i>

2158
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:09,417
My father used
to give us extra work.

2159
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,451
Can I ask you a question?

2160
01:26:11,453 --> 01:26:13,918
You think I'm too hard on her?

2161
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,018
I met a girl when I first moved
to L.A., she was 22.

2162
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:19,185
Someone arranged through
a third party

2163
01:26:19,187 --> 01:26:20,485
to spend the weekend
with her in London.

2164
01:26:20,487 --> 01:26:21,819
You know what she got?

2165
01:26:21,821 --> 01:26:24,051
For a weekend? Five grand.

2166
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:27,452
A bag. A Chanel bag she wanted.

2167
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:31,189
Whatever you're doing
with Stella, double it.

2168
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:40,621
Where's your father in all this?

2169
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:44,784
You mean, physically?

2170
01:26:44,786 --> 01:26:47,420
He's in Colorado.

2171
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:51,718
Your parents still together?

2172
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,253
No.

2173
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:55,719
You and your father close?

2174
01:26:55,721 --> 01:26:56,951
No.

2175
01:26:56,953 --> 01:26:59,518
Was he tough on you?

2176
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,151
You know how many girls
at the Olympics

2177
01:27:01,153 --> 01:27:02,752
have demanding fathers?

2178
01:27:02,754 --> 01:27:05,655
- All of them?
- <i>Well, that's right.</i>

2179
01:27:08,419 --> 01:27:10,985
I was tough on him.

2180
01:27:10,987 --> 01:27:12,551
What do you mean?

2181
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:15,119
Um...

2182
01:27:15,121 --> 01:27:17,488
I was a brat.

2183
01:27:20,286 --> 01:27:22,189
(Charlie)
<i>Fathers don't care.</i>

2184
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,418
- I'd start fights with him.
- <i>Why?</i>

2185
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:29,819
(Charlene)
<i>You're lying!</i>

2186
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:31,652
(Molly) <i>Why would I
start fights with him?</i>

2187
01:27:31,654 --> 01:27:33,218
(Charlie)
<i>Yeah.</i>

2188
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,820
(Charlene)
<i>I put you through grad school!</i>

2189
01:27:36,687 --> 01:27:38,253
I raised the kids.

2190
01:27:38,255 --> 01:27:42,385
I did every... God, everything!

2191
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:43,452
No.

2192
01:27:43,454 --> 01:27:45,186
No, you listen to me.

2193
01:27:45,188 --> 01:27:47,385
All you do is cheat on me,
and lie to me

2194
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,222
and lie to the kids!

2195
01:27:50,554 --> 01:27:53,122
You lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids.

2196
01:27:55,754 --> 01:27:57,687
I don't know.

2197
01:28:00,486 --> 01:28:03,018
For the record, the law in 1955

2198
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,784
that I'm accused of breaking it,
defines gambling as betting

2199
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:07,451
on games of chance.

2200
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:09,151
- Yes.
- Poker isn't a game of chance.

2201
01:28:09,153 --> 01:28:11,317
Roulette's a game of chance.

2202
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:15,152
- Poker's a game of skill.
- <i>Still, I me...</i>

2203
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:17,488
I'll tell them everything
they want to know about me.

2204
01:28:19,721 --> 01:28:21,654
About me.

2205
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,654
That's it.

2206
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:30,518
(Molly)
<i>Remember Bad Brad Marion?</i>

2207
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:33,251
<i>It turns out his $700,000,000
hedge fund</i>

2208
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:35,819
<i>wasn't what you would
call... real.</i>

2209
01:28:35,821 --> 01:28:37,452
<i>It was a Ponzi scheme.</i>

2210
01:28:37,454 --> 01:28:39,584
<i>He'd been falsely reporting
profits for years.</i>

2211
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:41,784
<i>He wasn't even registered
with the SEC.</i>

2212
01:28:41,786 --> 01:28:43,819
<i>With the money given to him
by friends and family</i>

2213
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:45,784
<i>and players at the game,
he bought several</i>

2214
01:28:45,786 --> 01:28:47,152
<i>Malibu Beach Houses</i>

2215
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:48,886
<i>an airplane hanger
full of cars</i>

2216
01:28:48,888 --> 01:28:51,852
<i>another one with an airplane,
and a life he wanted.</i>

2217
01:28:51,854 --> 01:28:54,918
<i>When he was arrested,
he had $740 in the bank.</i>

2218
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,451
<i>Brad cooperated with the FBI
and gave them hours</i>

2219
01:28:57,453 --> 01:28:59,684
<i>of testimony
on a range of subjects.</i>

2220
01:28:59,686 --> 01:29:01,317
<i>Including how three years
earlier</i>

2221
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:03,484
<i>he lost $5,200,000</i>

2222
01:29:03,486 --> 01:29:05,485
<i>in an underground
celebrity poker game</i>

2223
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:07,952
<i>that was run by a girl
named Molly Bloom.</i>

2224
01:29:07,954 --> 01:29:09,285
<i>His story was that
I had induced him</i>

2225
01:29:09,287 --> 01:29:10,986
<i>to play in a high stakes game.</i>

2226
01:29:10,988 --> 01:29:12,585
I just wanted to introduce you
to Brad Marion.

2227
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:14,018
(Molly)
<i>And that due to my enabling</i>

2228
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,351
<i>he'd become a gambling addict.</i>

2229
01:29:15,353 --> 01:29:17,417
...who made me
become a gambling addict.

2230
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:18,818
Brad, this game might
not be for you.

2231
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,385
(Molly)
<i>Federal Bankruptcy lawyers</i>

2232
01:29:20,387 --> 01:29:21,751
<i>were brought in to recover
as much</i>

2233
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:23,785
<i>of the boosted money
as they could.</i>

2234
01:29:23,787 --> 01:29:26,919
<i>I was sent a subpoena and flew
out to L.A. to be deposed.</i>

2235
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:29,185
Can you confirm
the names on the list

2236
01:29:29,187 --> 01:29:31,251
all played poker
with Brad Marion?

2237
01:29:31,253 --> 01:29:33,252
This list was provided
to you by Brad Marion?

2238
01:29:33,254 --> 01:29:34,752
I just need you
to confirm for the record

2239
01:29:34,754 --> 01:29:36,818
that your game included
but was not limited to...

2240
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,417
I understand, what I'm trying
to get on the record is that

2241
01:29:39,419 --> 01:29:42,351
I'm not the one
who provided the list.

2242
01:29:42,353 --> 01:29:44,887
These names were provided
by Brad Marion.

2243
01:29:46,286 --> 01:29:48,719
(female #3)
<i>So, under oath...</i>

2244
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:52,052
Yes. I can confirm
the list is accurate.

2245
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:54,518
(Molly) <i>The L.A. players
and I were given a choice.</i>

2246
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,985
<i>Testify against each other
in open court</i>

2247
01:29:56,987 --> 01:30:00,718
<i>or help make restitution to the
victims of Brad's Ponzi scheme.</i>

2248
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,919
<i>I wrote the government
a check for $500,000 dollars.</i>

2249
01:30:03,921 --> 01:30:06,986
<i>And somewhere in an FBI field
office in New York</i>

2250
01:30:06,988 --> 01:30:09,822
<i>someone was pinning
my picture to a wall.</i>

2251
01:30:11,287 --> 01:30:12,885
<i>I was running six games a week</i>

2252
01:30:12,887 --> 01:30:15,519
<i>sometimes at two different
locations in a night.</i>

2253
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:18,952
<i>And by this point,
I was addicted to drugs.</i>

2254
01:30:18,954 --> 01:30:21,218
<i>Adderall. Ambien. Xanax. Coke.</i>

2255
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:24,251
<i>Alcohol, Valium,
Ativan, Trazadone.</i>

2256
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:27,418
<i>Anything that could keep me up
for a few days</i>

2257
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,888
<i>and knock me out
for a few hours.</i>

2258
01:30:32,587 --> 01:30:35,752
<i>But I wasn't just taking them
to stay awake anymore.</i>

2259
01:30:35,754 --> 01:30:39,919
<i>It was dark and friendless
where I was.</i>

2260
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:43,151
<i>I felt like I was in a hole
so deep, I could go fracking.</i>

2261
01:30:43,153 --> 01:30:46,851
<i>It didn't feel like depression,
it felt more violent.</i>

2262
01:30:46,853 --> 01:30:48,317
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

2263
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:49,985
<i>I was tired of living
in the frat house</i>

2264
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:51,585
<i>I'd built for degenerates.</i>

2265
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:53,951
<i>I was tired of the greed.</i>

2266
01:30:53,953 --> 01:30:56,885
<i>Mine, not theirs. Everybody's.</i>

2267
01:30:56,887 --> 01:30:58,819
<i>I was sick
of being high all the time.</i>

2268
01:30:58,821 --> 01:31:01,084
<i>I was sick
of living in the grey area.</i>

2269
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:02,685
<i>I couldn't recognize myself</i>

2270
01:31:02,687 --> 01:31:05,188
<i>and what I recognized,
I couldn't stand.</i>

2271
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,451
<i>After a game one night,
Douglas Downey surprised me</i>

2272
01:31:09,453 --> 01:31:11,217
<i>with a confession,
after opening</i>

2273
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,019
<i>with another
detective story title.</i>

2274
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:15,285
Gut shot on the river.

2275
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,652
- I want to say something.
- Okay.

2276
01:31:17,654 --> 01:31:21,618
- I want to say, um, something.
- Okay.

2277
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,818
- I'm just gonna say...
- Cool.

2278
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:28,384
Because there's a poem,
a famous, uh...

2279
01:31:28,386 --> 01:31:31,218
A poem about...

2280
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,619
thoughts left unexpressed.

2281
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:37,354
Two roads emerged
from the woods.

2282
01:31:38,653 --> 01:31:40,587
Do they explode?

2283
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:44,885
I don't know.
Do you like poetry?

2284
01:31:44,887 --> 01:31:46,518
I did until a second ago.
I'm gonna call you...

2285
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,655
I'm, I'm in love with you.

2286
01:31:50,854 --> 01:31:53,851
- This isn't happening.
- Plain and simple.

2287
01:31:53,853 --> 01:31:56,318
You're the woman
I've always dreamed of

2288
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,585
and I've been dreaming...

2289
01:31:57,587 --> 01:31:59,785
Shh. Stop it.
Listen to me, Douglas.

2290
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:02,184
I'm the woman all of you
have always dreamed of.

2291
01:32:02,186 --> 01:32:05,150
I'm the anti-wife.
I encourage your gambling.

2292
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,685
I have drinks served
to you by models

2293
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,150
who simultaneously
create the impression

2294
01:32:09,152 --> 01:32:10,819
that you're the kind of guy
who can score

2295
01:32:10,821 --> 01:32:12,317
a dime piece anytime you want.

2296
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,886
It's nice for you in here.

2297
01:32:14,888 --> 01:32:17,017
Do you know who Circe was?

2298
01:32:17,019 --> 01:32:20,684
- Uh...
- Circe?

2299
01:32:20,686 --> 01:32:22,485
Used to play
in Teddy Chin's game?

2300
01:32:22,487 --> 01:32:25,719
Nope. Circe did not play
in Teddy's game.

2301
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:27,619
She was the Greek goddess
of magic.

2302
01:32:27,621 --> 01:32:30,619
And she gave men feasts
with wine and honey

2303
01:32:30,621 --> 01:32:32,551
and then turned them into swine.

2304
01:32:32,553 --> 01:32:36,317
- Why?
- Fantastic question.

2305
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,184
I would never do that to you.

2306
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:41,484
Missed the point by miles,
but that's okay.

2307
01:32:41,486 --> 01:32:43,618
Oh.

2308
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:45,284
Um, Molly.

2309
01:32:45,286 --> 01:32:48,818
Shelby and Winston
will close up.

2310
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,455
I'll see you next week.

2311
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,118
Here you go,
thanks a lot, Randy.

2312
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,551
Thanks, Molly.

2313
01:32:59,553 --> 01:33:02,384
- Good morning.
- Morning, Pat.

2314
01:33:02,386 --> 01:33:06,017
(Molly)
<i>Pat was my driver and security.</i>

2315
01:33:06,019 --> 01:33:07,851
- Straight home?
- Yeah.

2316
01:33:07,853 --> 01:33:09,452
(Molly) <i>We didn't know
much more about each other</i>

2317
01:33:09,454 --> 01:33:11,752
<i>than we needed to know,
but I liked him.</i>

2318
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:13,687
<i>We were friends.</i>

2319
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:23,352
I used to be
a competitive athlete.

2320
01:33:23,354 --> 01:33:24,818
I didn't know if you knew that.

2321
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,951
What sport?

2322
01:33:26,953 --> 01:33:29,017
Skiing.

2323
01:33:29,019 --> 01:33:31,251
Freestyle.

2324
01:33:31,253 --> 01:33:33,387
(Pat)
<i>Were you good?</i>

2325
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,454
I don't know.

2326
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,218
- Hey, Molly.
- <i>Pat asked me a favor.</i>

2327
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,284
(Molly) <i>He said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys</i>

2328
01:33:48,286 --> 01:33:49,917
<i>in New Jersey
who wanted to play</i>

2329
01:33:49,919 --> 01:33:51,950
<i>and he could score points
with them if he was able</i>

2330
01:33:51,952 --> 01:33:53,217
<i>to get them a meeting with me.</i>

2331
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:54,884
<i>I said, "Sure," and set
the meeting</i>

2332
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:57,984
<i>for 5 p.m. on a Thursday
at the Four Seasons Bar.</i>

2333
01:33:57,986 --> 01:33:59,684
<i>Knowing that if they were legit</i>

2334
01:33:59,686 --> 01:34:01,819
<i>they'd recognize someone
in the crowd at happy hour</i>

2335
01:34:01,821 --> 01:34:03,951
<i>at the Four Seasons right after
the closing bell.</i>

2336
01:34:03,953 --> 01:34:06,519
<i>It turns out I didn't
need to be that clever.</i>

2337
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:08,251
<i>These weren't finance guys.</i>

2338
01:34:08,253 --> 01:34:10,084
<i>They were from the cast
of "Jersey Boys."</i>

2339
01:34:10,086 --> 01:34:12,218
<i>They looked around the bar
self-consciously.</i>

2340
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,584
<i>They were out of their element.</i>

2341
01:34:13,586 --> 01:34:15,118
<i>And tough guys
try to look tougher</i>

2342
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,484
<i>when they're insecure.</i>

2343
01:34:16,486 --> 01:34:17,818
<i>I had a good hunch
what they wanted</i>

2344
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,418
<i>and I was gonna have
to shut down</i>

2345
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,285
<i>this meeting quickly,
but without being rude</i>

2346
01:34:21,287 --> 01:34:23,685
<i>to Joey Bag-a-Donuts
and Secaucus Sal.</i>

2347
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:25,318
I'm Molly Bloom.
Nice to meet you.

2348
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,985
- John G.
- And you are?

2349
01:34:26,987 --> 01:34:28,655
Paul.

2350
01:34:29,721 --> 01:34:32,351
(John G.)
<i>How do we get a drink?</i>

2351
01:34:32,353 --> 01:34:34,318
(Molly) <i>I don't remember
what the other guy ordered</i>

2352
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,719
<i>but I'll never forget
what John G had.</i>

2353
01:34:35,721 --> 01:34:37,351
<i>He looked at the waiter
as if to say</i>

2354
01:34:37,353 --> 01:34:38,784
<i>that he could handle
himself just fine</i>

2355
01:34:38,786 --> 01:34:40,785
<i>among the Manhattan elite
and said...</i>

2356
01:34:40,787 --> 01:34:42,721
I'll have an Appletini.

2357
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:46,551
- Okay.
- So, how was your week?

2358
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:49,885
My week? Uh, it was fine.
Thank you.

2359
01:34:49,887 --> 01:34:54,384
Pat said you guys might
be interested in a game?

2360
01:34:54,386 --> 01:34:57,151
We want to partner
with you.

2361
01:34:57,153 --> 01:34:59,651
- We've talked to Tutti, Will...
- Teddy Chin.

2362
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:00,951
Teddy Chin.

2363
01:35:00,953 --> 01:35:03,317
We did a little work
with them too.

2364
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:05,454
We can make
your life easier.

2365
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:09,850
Nobody will fuck with you.

2366
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:11,787
Nobody will stiff you.

2367
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:19,551
I appreciate the offer,
but really, I'm fine.

2368
01:35:19,553 --> 01:35:22,351
I don't carry a big debt sheet.
I feel safe.

2369
01:35:22,353 --> 01:35:25,418
Ah-uh, you lied just then

2370
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,751
when you said you don't carry
a big debt sheet.

2371
01:35:27,753 --> 01:35:30,084
You've got 2.8 million
on the street right now

2372
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:31,719
<i>right as we're sitting here.</i>

2373
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:33,352
We do our research.

2374
01:35:33,354 --> 01:35:35,351
That money should be
in your hands.

2375
01:35:35,353 --> 01:35:39,118
'Cause it's yours. It's yours.

2376
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,484
And if you don't have it,
you got

2377
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:42,621
to go into your pocket
to pay the wins.

2378
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:46,285
Fellas, I'm sorry.

2379
01:35:46,287 --> 01:35:49,284
It's just a friendly game
with higher stakes.

2380
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:51,184
It was really nice
to meet you though.

2381
01:35:51,186 --> 01:35:53,484
Let me know if there's ever
anything I can do for you.

2382
01:35:53,486 --> 01:35:55,518
I like to do favors.

2383
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,185
They'll put your drinks
on my card.

2384
01:35:58,187 --> 01:35:59,851
(Molly) <i>There are some
gaps in my memory</i>

2385
01:35:59,853 --> 01:36:01,518
<i>which they say is common
when you've had</i>

2386
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,885
<i>what's called, an event.</i>

2387
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:04,719
<i>For instance, I don't remember
where I was</i>

2388
01:36:04,721 --> 01:36:06,885
<i>coming from when I walked
into my building.</i>

2389
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:08,884
<i>Just that my doorman, Reggie,
said he had packages for me.</i>

2390
01:36:08,886 --> 01:36:10,118
Ms. Bloom, I think
I got some things

2391
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,217
for you in the package room.

2392
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:12,783
- I'll bring them on up.
- Thanks.

2393
01:36:12,785 --> 01:36:14,285
(Molly) <i>It was the first
night of two weeks off</i>

2394
01:36:14,287 --> 01:36:16,150
<i>for Christmas and New Year's.</i>

2395
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:20,385
<i>And my plan was to take a bath
and try not to take drugs.</i>

2396
01:36:20,387 --> 01:36:22,817
<i>Reggie came up
with my packages.</i>

2397
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:25,187
<i>[intense music]</i>

2398
01:36:26,553 --> 01:36:29,417
Ahh, I'm sorry,
you're in the wrong...

2399
01:36:29,419 --> 01:36:31,520
Wait! Okay, hold on a second,
I have...

2400
01:36:36,253 --> 01:36:37,887
Not a sound.

2401
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:43,050
Do you hear me?

2402
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:44,950
I have money. It's all cash.

2403
01:36:44,952 --> 01:36:47,252
- Where?
- S-safe.

2404
01:36:47,254 --> 01:36:48,585
Where is it?

2405
01:36:48,587 --> 01:36:50,787
- It's in the closet.
- Show me.

2406
01:37:08,621 --> 01:37:11,121
Put the money
and jewelry in a bag.

2407
01:37:12,187 --> 01:37:14,887
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

2408
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,154
Gold bars too.

2409
01:37:31,086 --> 01:37:32,150
Come on.

2410
01:37:32,152 --> 01:37:35,717
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

2411
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:39,552
It wasn't an offer they made.
It wasn't a suggestion.

2412
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:42,551
This will be
your only reminder.

2413
01:37:42,553 --> 01:37:47,488
Your mother lives alone
in Telluride, Colorado. Right?

2414
01:37:49,919 --> 01:37:53,220
Right? Right, Molly?

2415
01:37:54,187 --> 01:37:55,618
She doesn't live there anymore.

2416
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,554
Yes, she does.

2417
01:38:59,186 --> 01:39:02,951
(Molly) <i>I couldn't call a
doctor or go to an E.R.</i>

2418
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:05,488
<i>They'd take one look at me
and call the police.</i>

2419
01:39:12,554 --> 01:39:15,452
<i>My eyes were swollen and black.</i>

2420
01:39:15,454 --> 01:39:18,217
<i>My lips were cut and bloody.</i>

2421
01:39:18,219 --> 01:39:20,354
<i>I couldn't feel my face.</i>

2422
01:39:46,986 --> 01:39:50,120
<i>[instrumental music]</i>

2423
01:39:58,652 --> 01:40:00,651
<i>Pat had set up the meeting</i>

2424
01:40:00,653 --> 01:40:03,153
<i>and he was how they knew
where I lived.</i>

2425
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:08,385
<i>I stayed in my apartment
for two weeks</i>

2426
01:40:08,387 --> 01:40:10,352
<i>waiting for my face to heal...</i>

2427
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:13,188
<i>and waiting for the phone call
I knew was coming.</i>

2428
01:40:14,586 --> 01:40:16,951
<i>But the call didn't come.</i>

2429
01:40:16,953 --> 01:40:19,384
<i>Where was the call from John G?</i>

2430
01:40:19,386 --> 01:40:21,686
<i>"So maybe you've had
a change of heart?"</i>

2431
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:27,820
<i>After ten days, I opened my
front door for the first time.</i>

2432
01:40:30,852 --> 01:40:33,684
<i>People were coming back into
town after New Years in Cabo</i>

2433
01:40:33,686 --> 01:40:36,187
<i>and St. Bart's,
and South Beach.</i>

2434
01:40:38,086 --> 01:40:41,618
<i>My phone was blowing up with,
"When's the next game?"</i>

2435
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,754
<i>But nothing from John G.</i>

2436
01:40:45,453 --> 01:40:47,650
<i>And then right there
on the front page</i>

2437
01:40:47,652 --> 01:40:50,985
<i>of the New York Times
from eight days ago...</i>

2438
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:54,820
<i>nearly a 125 arrested
in sweeping mob roundup.</i>

2439
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,184
<i>Those guys
were either laying low</i>

2440
01:40:58,186 --> 01:41:00,317
<i>or they were in custody.</i>

2441
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:02,787
<i>Sometimes God happens fast.</i>

2442
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:07,417
<i>My face had healed enough,
so that a little make-up</i>

2443
01:41:07,419 --> 01:41:09,620
<i>would cover the bruises
that were left.</i>

2444
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:13,151
<i>I put together
a week of games.</i>

2445
01:41:13,153 --> 01:41:16,550
<i>One week of games to get
the 2.8 million I was owed</i>

2446
01:41:16,552 --> 01:41:19,451
<i>and then I was out, I was done.</i>

2447
01:41:19,453 --> 01:41:22,317
<i>One week of epic games.</i>

2448
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:24,217
<i>I had some of my
London players in town</i>

2449
01:41:24,219 --> 01:41:26,750
<i>and the Russians had
visiting friends from Moscow.</i>

2450
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:29,617
<i>Jesse and Shelby had already
started the game at the Plaza</i>

2451
01:41:29,619 --> 01:41:32,351
<i>and were reporting
heavy early action.</i>

2452
01:41:32,353 --> 01:41:34,985
<i>I was on my way
when the phone rang.</i>

2453
01:41:34,987 --> 01:41:37,121
<i>It was Douglas Downey.</i>

2454
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,884
I'm on my way, Doug.

2455
01:41:39,886 --> 01:41:42,683
(Douglas)
<i>Wait, Molly. Wait.</i>

2456
01:41:42,685 --> 01:41:44,384
<i>I'm hiding in the bathroom.</i>

2457
01:41:44,386 --> 01:41:46,150
<i>I just... I-I need you
to believe me, okay?</i>

2458
01:41:46,152 --> 01:41:47,584
- <i>I just...</i>
- Whose bathroom?

2459
01:41:47,586 --> 01:41:49,084
<i>I need you to believe me
because, uh...</i>

2460
01:41:49,086 --> 01:41:51,351
<i>Uh, at the suite, at the plaza.</i>

2461
01:41:51,353 --> 01:41:52,750
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2462
01:41:52,752 --> 01:41:55,416
<i>I would never tell them
anything about you.</i>

2463
01:41:55,418 --> 01:41:57,683
<i>I said, "Guys,
you want me to go further</i>

2464
01:41:57,685 --> 01:42:00,884
<i>"you want me to go other
places, I'll do it.</i>

2465
01:42:00,886 --> 01:42:04,385
<i>"But nothing about Molly,
she can't be touched.</i>

2466
01:42:04,387 --> 01:42:06,718
- <i>Just the Russians."</i>
- Okay, you're drunk.

2467
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,917
And a little difficult
to understand

2468
01:42:08,919 --> 01:42:10,851
so I'll see you in a few minutes
when I get there.

2469
01:42:10,853 --> 01:42:12,885
<i>I was, uh...</i>

2470
01:42:12,887 --> 01:42:15,520
<i>I was... uh...</i>

2471
01:42:17,453 --> 01:42:20,118
<i>I was cited
for securities fraud.</i>

2472
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,783
<i>It was scrubbed from my record.</i>

2473
01:42:21,785 --> 01:42:24,450
- <i>That's why you don't know.</i>
- Did you say Securities Fraud?

2474
01:42:24,452 --> 01:42:26,483
<i>I would never help them
build a case against you</i>

2475
01:42:26,485 --> 01:42:29,918
<i>I would have never give them
anything against you</i>

2476
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,450
<i>I'd commit perjury
before I did that.</i>

2477
01:42:32,452 --> 01:42:35,217
<i>It was such bullshit,
it was 2006.</i>

2478
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:36,784
If you'd had an arrest,
I would've known.

2479
01:42:36,786 --> 01:42:39,051
- <i>It was bullshit!</i>
- Doug.

2480
01:42:39,053 --> 01:42:40,817
<i>I told them I'll go further</i>

2481
01:42:40,819 --> 01:42:44,284
<i>I'll go other places,
but not you.</i>

2482
01:42:44,286 --> 01:42:46,151
<i>I love you, I, I love...</i>

2483
01:42:46,153 --> 01:42:48,617
Doug, listen, I-I need you to
pull it together for a second.

2484
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:50,817
Did they scrub your record,
because you've been informing?

2485
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:53,617
<i>Should I...
Should I have told you?</i>

2486
01:42:53,619 --> 01:42:56,818
<i>That's a question that'll,
that'll haunt me for all my...</i>

2487
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,217
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2488
01:42:58,219 --> 01:43:00,351
<i>...for my days, Molly.</i>

2489
01:43:00,353 --> 01:43:04,351
<i>Always know that I was
trying to protect you.</i>

2490
01:43:04,353 --> 01:43:07,854
(Molly) <i>Five blocks away,
the FBI had raided my game.</i>

2491
01:43:26,452 --> 01:43:27,950
<i>I fully expected the lobby
to be filled</i>

2492
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,951
<i>with guys wearing windbreakers,
but it wasn't.</i>

2493
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:32,017
(Reggie) <i>Ms. Bloom. Haven't
seen you for a while.</i>

2494
01:43:32,019 --> 01:43:34,319
- Yeah.
- You need a cab?

2495
01:43:40,186 --> 01:43:43,384
I guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages.

2496
01:43:43,386 --> 01:43:46,221
Maybe I didn't tip you enough
before Christmas.

2497
01:43:49,253 --> 01:43:51,885
(Harrison) <i>Then you got into
a cab, took the cab to JFK</i>

2498
01:43:51,887 --> 01:43:53,551
<i>and flew to your mother's house
in Denver.</i>

2499
01:43:53,553 --> 01:43:54,851
(Molly)
<i>Telluride.</i>

2500
01:43:54,853 --> 01:43:56,683
My mother lives in Telluride.

2501
01:43:56,685 --> 01:43:58,717
- That was two years ago.
- Mm-hmm.

2502
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,317
In a cab on the way
to the airport

2503
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:02,383
I checked
my bank account balance.

2504
01:44:02,385 --> 01:44:04,084
There should've had a little
over four million dollars

2505
01:44:04,086 --> 01:44:07,351
but instead, it said the balance
was zero, and there was a note

2506
01:44:07,353 --> 01:44:09,451
telling me to contact
the Justice Department.

2507
01:44:09,453 --> 01:44:12,084
I just want to mention that she
also voluntarily checked herself

2508
01:44:12,086 --> 01:44:15,617
into 28-day rehab and has been
sober and clean for two years.

2509
01:44:15,619 --> 01:44:18,651
I don't care. Were the women
that worked for you call girls?

2510
01:44:18,653 --> 01:44:19,817
No, sir.

2511
01:44:19,819 --> 01:44:21,185
<i>They never exchanged
sex for money?</i>

2512
01:44:21,187 --> 01:44:22,483
No.

2513
01:44:22,485 --> 01:44:23,783
Have you ever exchanged
sex for money?

2514
01:44:23,785 --> 01:44:25,851
- <i>No.</i>
- I think he was talking to me.

2515
01:44:25,853 --> 01:44:27,917
I meant, no, she's not
answering that question.

2516
01:44:27,919 --> 01:44:29,717
- <i>The purpose of this meeting...</i>
- I know.

2517
01:44:29,719 --> 01:44:31,118
- Purpose of this meeting...
- <i>We're off the record.</i>

2518
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:32,217
We're not off the record.

2519
01:44:32,219 --> 01:44:33,918
Do you see
a stenographer in here?

2520
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,717
We're off the record in
as much as there is no record

2521
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:37,584
but you're free to use
the information you're given

2522
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:39,717
and we're not giving
the information for free.

2523
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:41,651
I've been sitting at this table
for five hours

2524
01:44:41,653 --> 01:44:44,484
waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do

2525
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:47,817
the right thing while begging my
client for the last three weeks

2526
01:44:47,819 --> 01:44:49,583
to act in her own
best interest.

2527
01:44:49,585 --> 01:44:51,851
Neither of those things
should be hard.

2528
01:44:51,853 --> 01:44:54,384
The purpose of this meeting
is for you to meet Molly Bloom

2529
01:44:54,386 --> 01:44:56,551
and discover, as I have,
that she's not the person

2530
01:44:56,553 --> 01:44:57,783
the press has invented.

2531
01:44:57,785 --> 01:44:59,218
She's not under
Federal indictment

2532
01:44:59,219 --> 01:45:00,784
for getting bad press, Charlie

2533
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,850
<i>and the purpose of the meeting,
for me is to discover</i>

2534
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:05,184
<i>if your client is willing to
cooperate with the government</i>

2535
01:45:05,186 --> 01:45:07,617
<i>in putting away
some bad people.</i>

2536
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:08,550
No.

2537
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:09,817
You're not willing to cooperate?

2538
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:13,718
Uh, no, I never traded
sex for money.

2539
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,584
I'm still not sure if there's
a record but if there is

2540
01:45:16,586 --> 01:45:19,783
I want it to be certain
that was in it.

2541
01:45:19,785 --> 01:45:21,850
It appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner

2542
01:45:21,852 --> 01:45:23,885
you were extremely diligent
about vetting players.

2543
01:45:23,887 --> 01:45:25,185
I was.

2544
01:45:25,187 --> 01:45:26,416
But you let four guys
play in the game

2545
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:27,717
without knowing
they were connected?

2546
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:30,554
Yeah, plus an FBI informant,
it's embarrassing.

2547
01:45:37,519 --> 01:45:40,985
I was high
at the end and...

2548
01:45:40,987 --> 01:45:43,150
doing my job badly.

2549
01:45:43,152 --> 01:45:46,885
I'll also add that in my limited
experience with the Russian mob

2550
01:45:46,887 --> 01:45:51,184
they don't immediately
present themselves as mobsters.

2551
01:45:51,186 --> 01:45:53,584
My experience with the Italian
mob on the other hand...

2552
01:45:53,586 --> 01:45:54,687
<i>Help us.</i>

2553
01:45:56,352 --> 01:45:57,784
I don't know anything
that can help you.

2554
01:45:57,786 --> 01:45:59,684
- Yes. Yes, you do.
- <i>And if I did...</i>

2555
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,718
<i>You can provide color.
You can paint a picture.</i>

2556
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,683
You can tell us Druzhinsky
wore a $100,000

2557
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:05,350
Patek Philippe
and even drove a Phantom.

2558
01:46:05,352 --> 01:46:07,018
<i>You can tell us Illya Gershen
showed up</i>

2559
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:09,084
with a quarter million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can

2560
01:46:09,086 --> 01:46:11,183
tell us how much action Shelly
was taking on a sports bet.

2561
01:46:11,185 --> 01:46:14,917
No one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room.

2562
01:46:14,919 --> 01:46:16,050
They would have to go outside.

2563
01:46:16,052 --> 01:46:17,917
So I had no idea how much

2564
01:46:17,919 --> 01:46:19,584
anyone was taking or laying.

2565
01:46:19,586 --> 01:46:21,351
So now you're saying
you knew they were making

2566
01:46:21,353 --> 01:46:22,518
and taking sports bets.

2567
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,217
That's the point of them
going outside.

2568
01:46:24,219 --> 01:46:26,184
They could have been calling
their mother for all I knew.

2569
01:46:26,186 --> 01:46:28,783
- <i>Molly?</i>
- Yes, sir.

2570
01:46:28,785 --> 01:46:31,184
I don't believe you.

2571
01:46:31,186 --> 01:46:33,451
In Mike Davidoff's phone
intercepts alone

2572
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,483
just Davidoff, your
name comes up 19 times.

2573
01:46:36,485 --> 01:46:38,551
We need Molly... Get
Molly... Bring Molly...

2574
01:46:38,553 --> 01:46:40,417
<i>It strongly suggests
that you were important</i>

2575
01:46:40,419 --> 01:46:41,951
to his business, so it's hard
for me to believe

2576
01:46:41,953 --> 01:46:44,517
that someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect...

2577
01:46:44,519 --> 01:46:47,551
Talking about the drug...

2578
01:46:47,553 --> 01:46:50,283
Get Molly... Bring Molly...
We need Molly...

2579
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:53,586
It's... They're talking
about the drug ecstasy.

2580
01:46:55,653 --> 01:46:58,984
Shit. My office is next to yours
for two years

2581
01:46:58,986 --> 01:47:01,417
and I've seen you make
some bone-headed moves

2582
01:47:01,419 --> 01:47:03,416
but I've never seen
any prosecutor

2583
01:47:03,418 --> 01:47:06,217
step in it
the way you just did.

2584
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,684
You should thank
all of the Gods that

2585
01:47:07,686 --> 01:47:09,018
there is no physical evidence
of that exchange.

2586
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:10,784
- <i>Hey, look.</i>
- No, you look.

2587
01:47:10,786 --> 01:47:12,550
Weren't you going to implore me
to do the right thing?

2588
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:15,885
This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment.

2589
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:17,783
Are you out of your minds?

2590
01:47:17,785 --> 01:47:20,917
<i>She does not belong
in a mob indictment.</i>

2591
01:47:20,919 --> 01:47:24,450
She raked a game, that's it,
for seven months, two years ago.

2592
01:47:24,452 --> 01:47:27,018
And why? Because she was giving
credit in the millions

2593
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:29,783
and she didn't want to use
muscle to collect.

2594
01:47:29,785 --> 01:47:33,783
She has had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit

2595
01:47:33,785 --> 01:47:37,184
herself by just telling
the real stories that she knows.

2596
01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:40,884
Okay? I have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007.

2597
01:47:40,886 --> 01:47:43,451
And I'm talking
about text messages, emails

2598
01:47:43,453 --> 01:47:46,284
movie stars, rock stars,
athletes, billionaires

2599
01:47:46,286 --> 01:47:48,617
all explicit,
some married with kids

2600
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:50,517
and that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

2601
01:47:50,519 --> 01:47:52,350
<i>What about the guy
that comes this close</i>

2602
01:47:52,352 --> 01:47:54,250
<i>to being the U.S. Ambassador
to Monaco?</i>

2603
01:47:54,252 --> 01:47:56,885
He's withdrawn from
consideration at the last minute

2604
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,717
no one knows why, she does.

2605
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:02,217
CEOs with college-aged
mistresses

2606
01:48:02,219 --> 01:48:04,184
an SVP of an investment bank

2607
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:06,584
who wanted Molly to put
a marked deck in a game.

2608
01:48:06,586 --> 01:48:08,316
<i>The head of a movie studio
that texted her that</i>

2609
01:48:08,318 --> 01:48:11,150
<i>a particular movie star was too
black for his liking, I mean...</i>

2610
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:15,584
J. Edgar Hoover didn't
have this much shit on Bobby!

2611
01:48:15,586 --> 01:48:17,316
You know, she could
have written a best seller

2612
01:48:17,318 --> 01:48:18,917
and been set for life.

2613
01:48:18,919 --> 01:48:21,950
Easy, she's got the, she's got
the winning lottery ticket

2614
01:48:21,952 --> 01:48:23,786
and she won't cash it.

2615
01:48:25,819 --> 01:48:29,483
Your office took every dollar
she has in a constitutionally

2616
01:48:29,485 --> 01:48:31,551
fucked up seizure
and then put the IRS on her

2617
01:48:31,553 --> 01:48:34,383
to tax what you seized,
I mean...

2618
01:48:34,385 --> 01:48:35,851
I've been in those
strategy meetings.

2619
01:48:35,853 --> 01:48:38,049
You-you broke her back
so she couldn't possibly

2620
01:48:38,051 --> 01:48:39,683
afford to defend herself.

2621
01:48:39,685 --> 01:48:42,518
And now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom

2622
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,583
by "providing color,"
and she still won't do it.

2623

01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:52,918
So, yes, Harrison,
I am imploring you

2626
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,551

2627
01:48:54,553 --> 01:48:56,250
<i>She knows nothing
about the three Petes</i>

<i>nothing about Ragnyada, nothing

2629
01:49:00,418 --> 01:49:03,184
Between the two of us, we've
appeared in front of this judge

2630

bust together for three years</i>

want to see mobsters go to jail

the one person in the room

01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:40,353
- <i>Bend your knee.</i>
- Dad?

2675
01:52:41,151 --> 01:52:43,152
- Ah! Ah.
- Oh.

2676
01:52:44,252 --> 01:52:46,518
(male #6)
<i>You alright?</i>

2677
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,187
<i>- Sorry about that.
- I got you.</i>

2678
01:52:49,751 --> 01:52:50,750
Sorry.

2679
01:52:50,752 --> 01:52:52,752
Takin' you off the ice
right now.

2680
01:52:56,952 --> 01:52:58,120
How's it goin'?

2681
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:15,351
What're you doing in New York?

2682
01:53:15,353 --> 01:53:16,783
And how'd you know
I was at the skating rink?

2683
01:53:16,785 --> 01:53:20,551
- I'm a doctor of the mind.
- Well, dad...

2684
01:53:20,553 --> 01:53:23,651
I'm here in New York,
because that's where you are.

2685
01:53:23,653 --> 01:53:27,451
I called your mom at the hotel
and she said you were here.

2686
01:53:27,453 --> 01:53:29,651
Listen, it's not a big deal,
but from what I saw out there

2687
01:53:29,653 --> 01:53:31,716
I think you're having
a small breakdown.

2688
01:53:31,718 --> 01:53:33,917
That's weird,
I can't think of why.

2689
01:53:33,919 --> 01:53:35,983
Probably because of the arrest
and not knowing

2690
01:53:35,985 --> 01:53:37,384
what's going to happen next.

2691
01:53:37,386 --> 01:53:40,387
Old man, do you really
not recognize sarcasm?

2692
01:53:41,619 --> 01:53:42,885
Do you?

2693
01:53:44,718 --> 01:53:46,550
Here, drink this.

2694
01:53:46,552 --> 01:53:48,849
I'm an alcoholic, I can't drink,
but thanks for remembering.

2695
01:53:48,851 --> 01:53:50,487
It's hot chocolate.

2696
01:53:51,519 --> 01:53:53,050
Okay.

2697
01:53:53,052 --> 01:53:54,617
And for diagnostic purposes

2698
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:56,650
do you think that we're on
a cocktail lounge right now?

2699
01:53:56,652 --> 01:53:59,250
Seeing waiters
with trays of champagne?

2700
01:53:59,252 --> 01:54:01,387
Wanna check your pulse.

2701
01:54:07,085 --> 01:54:09,383
- Have you found a pulse?
- Yeah.

2702
01:54:09,385 --> 01:54:11,484
Just admiring my watch.

2703
01:54:11,486 --> 01:54:13,383
I can see you're getting
warmed up, but I really

2704
01:54:13,385 --> 01:54:15,216
don't have the emotional
bandwidth to defend

2705
01:54:15,218 --> 01:54:17,250
my "as usual
irresponsible behavior."

2706
01:54:17,252 --> 01:54:18,816
I know, I got your email.

2707
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:20,683
I get that I'm not
welcome in your life right now.

2708
01:54:20,685 --> 01:54:22,250
As your father though,
you should know

2709
01:54:22,252 --> 01:54:24,716
I could give a shit
if I'm welcome or not.

2710
01:54:24,718 --> 01:54:28,450
But I'm not here in my capacity
as your father.

2711
01:54:28,452 --> 01:54:31,517
I'm indifferent to whether
your father lives or dies.

2712
01:54:31,519 --> 01:54:33,817
I'm a very expensive therapist
and I'm here to give you

2713
01:54:33,819 --> 01:54:35,717
one free session.

2714
01:54:35,719 --> 01:54:37,849
You think what I need
right now is a therapist?

2715
01:54:37,851 --> 01:54:40,785
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

2716
01:54:42,718 --> 01:54:45,386
I have to be back
in my lawyer's office soon.

2717
01:54:46,951 --> 01:54:49,017
Do you like your lawyer?

2718
01:54:49,019 --> 01:54:51,317
I wasn't asking for money
when I called you, dad.

2719
01:54:51,319 --> 01:54:53,150
I just needed my dad.

2720
01:54:53,152 --> 01:54:55,484
God forbid you part
with a nickel.

2721
01:54:55,486 --> 01:54:58,250
Yeah, Tiny Tim, you grew up
on a lake and you've skied

2722
01:54:58,252 --> 01:55:00,251
all over the world,
were those work houses tough?

2723
01:55:00,253 --> 01:55:01,616
- I gotta go.
- Molly.

2724
01:55:01,618 --> 01:55:05,453
- I gotta go.
- Molly, sit the fuck down.

2725
01:55:15,552 --> 01:55:17,251
Alright, we're gonna do
three years of therapy

2726
01:55:17,253 --> 01:55:19,017
in three minutes.

2727
01:55:19,019 --> 01:55:20,316
How?

2728
01:55:20,318 --> 01:55:22,117
I'm gonna do what patients
have been begging

2729
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:23,317
therapists to do
for a hundred years.

2730
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:25,783
I'm just gonna give you
the answers.

2731
01:55:25,785 --> 01:55:27,983
- To what?
- Well, let's start with this.

2732
01:55:27,985 --> 01:55:30,049
Why does a young woman,
who, at 22

2733
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:33,883
has a gold-plated resume,
why does she run poker games?

2734
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:35,783
Why did I choose
to make a ton of money?

2735
01:55:35,785 --> 01:55:36,983
That's a head scratcher.

2736
01:55:36,985 --> 01:55:39,284
You were gonna be a success
at anything you wanted.

2737
01:55:39,286 --> 01:55:41,750
You know it. If you'd gone
to law school, you'd have...

2738
01:55:41,752 --> 01:55:44,050
You'd have owned
the law firm by now.

2739
01:55:44,052 --> 01:55:46,752
Why did you do
the other thing instead?

2740
01:55:47,385 --> 01:55:49,950
I don't know.

2741
01:55:49,952 --> 01:55:52,217
Drugs.

2742
01:55:52,219 --> 01:55:53,782
You didn't start with the drugs
until the end.

2743
01:55:53,784 --> 01:55:57,316
They weren't the problem,
they were the medicine.

2744
01:55:57,318 --> 01:56:00,319
It was so you could
control powerful men.

2745
01:56:02,985 --> 01:56:07,186
Your addiction was
having power over powerful men.

2746
01:56:11,419 --> 01:56:14,183
- Is that what you really think?
- No.

2747
01:56:14,185 --> 01:56:15,750
I know it for sure.

2748
01:56:15,752 --> 01:56:18,616
You've now completed
your first year of therapy.

2749
01:56:18,618 --> 01:56:20,884
I saw an opportunity,
it wasn't about you.

2750
01:56:20,886 --> 01:56:22,717
Nah, it wasn't just about me.

2751
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:25,619
- It wasn't at all about you.
- It was.

2752
01:56:26,453 --> 01:56:29,120
Second year, second question.

2753
01:56:31,986 --> 01:56:33,949
Do you think
you were a good husband?

2754
01:56:33,951 --> 01:56:35,451
What do you care?

2755
01:56:35,453 --> 01:56:37,250
I care because you were married
to my mother.

2756
01:56:37,252 --> 01:56:39,216
I care because
my father's an asshole.

2757
01:56:39,218 --> 01:56:41,017
Congratulations.

2758
01:56:41,019 --> 01:56:42,716
You've completed year two.

2759
01:56:42,718 --> 01:56:44,950
And for the record,
your father raised three kids

2760
01:56:44,952 --> 01:56:46,617
on a college professor's salary.

2761
01:56:46,619 --> 01:56:49,250
One of them
is a two-time Olympian

2762
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:51,516
a sixth round draft pick
of the Philadelphia Eagles

2763
01:56:51,518 --> 01:56:54,049
and a leading philanthropist.

2764
01:56:54,051 --> 01:56:56,782
The other is a cardiothoracic
surgeon at Mass General

2765
01:56:56,784 --> 01:57:00,649
and the third managed to build
a multi million dollar business

2766
01:57:00,651 --> 01:57:03,487
using not much more
than her wits.

2767
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:07,717
I'm about to plead guilty
in Federal Court.

2768
01:57:07,719 --> 01:57:09,450
Well, nobody's perfect.

2769
01:57:09,452 --> 01:57:12,284
The point is I did
a few things right.

2770
01:57:12,286 --> 01:57:13,683
Last question.

2771
01:57:13,685 --> 01:57:15,117
No. I've to go.

2772
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:19,153
Last question, Mol. I'll answer
it, but you have to ask it.

2773
01:57:21,951 --> 01:57:24,752
You have... to ask it.

2774
01:57:35,051 --> 01:57:38,084
Why didn't you like me
as much as my brothers?

2775
01:57:38,086 --> 01:57:39,885
There it is.

2776
01:57:42,453 --> 01:57:43,719
I did.

2777
01:57:45,386 --> 01:57:49,117
It only from time to time
appeared that I didn't.

2778
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:51,183
It only appeared
that you didn't?

2779
01:57:51,185 --> 01:57:52,316
Yeah.

2780
01:57:52,318 --> 01:57:55,317
That is some
Schedule 1 bullshit.

2781
01:57:55,319 --> 01:57:57,582
Why would...
"It only appeared..." What?

2782
01:57:57,584 --> 01:58:00,816
What? O-okay,
I had an attitude problem.

2783
01:58:00,818 --> 01:58:03,450
I talked back, I...

2784
01:58:03,452 --> 01:58:05,482
broke some normal
adolescent rules.

2785
01:58:05,484 --> 01:58:08,216
I snuck phone time after curfew

2786
01:58:08,218 --> 01:58:09,283
I took your car
when I wasn't allowed to.

2787
01:58:09,285 --> 01:58:10,883
You drove it into a McDonalds.

2788
01:58:10,885 --> 01:58:12,216
And kids get punished for that
but they don't...

2789
01:58:12,218 --> 01:58:13,616
Did you not see the McDonalds?

2790
01:58:13,618 --> 01:58:15,949
I mean, did you misunderstand
what drive-thru meant?

2791
01:58:15,951 --> 01:58:18,084
You'd turn into a different
person, your voice, your face...

2792
01:58:18,086 --> 01:58:20,387
It's because
I knew you knew.

2793
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:24,284
I didn't hear what you said.

2794
01:58:24,286 --> 01:58:26,016
I said...

2795
01:58:26,018 --> 01:58:28,049
"I knew you knew."

2796
01:58:28,051 --> 01:58:29,449
You knew I knew what?

2797
01:58:29,451 --> 01:58:30,916
(Larry)
<i>What do you, uh, think about</i>

2798
01:58:30,918 --> 01:58:32,316
<i>the following concepts?</i>

2799
01:58:32,318 --> 01:58:34,817
<i>Just going to run them
by you. Marriage?</i>

2800
01:58:34,819 --> 01:58:37,150
It is a trap.

2801
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:40,084
That I was cheating on mom.

2802
01:58:40,086 --> 01:58:41,650
I knew you knew.

2803
01:58:41,652 --> 01:58:44,415
- <i>Society?</i>
- It is a joke.

2804
01:58:44,417 --> 01:58:47,251
No. I didn't know
unt-until I was 20.

2805
01:58:47,253 --> 01:58:49,816
- <i>People?</i>
- I don't trust people.

2806
01:58:49,818 --> 01:58:52,117
<i>No, you'd known
since you were five.</i>

2807
01:58:52,119 --> 01:58:55,786
You saw me in my car and you
really didn't know what you saw.

2808
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:00,486
I don't have any heroes.

2809
01:59:02,886 --> 01:59:06,719
You knew, honey, and I knew
you knew. And that's...

2810
01:59:08,518 --> 01:59:12,183
That's how I reacted
to the shame.

2811
01:59:12,185 --> 01:59:14,782
And you reacted by showing...

2812
01:59:14,784 --> 01:59:17,252
seething contempt for me.

2813
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:21,516
By driving my car
into McDonalds.

2814
01:59:21,518 --> 01:59:23,949
Wanting to have power over
powerful men?

2815
01:59:23,951 --> 01:59:25,482
No.

2816
01:59:25,484 --> 01:59:28,349
That was a red-herring
just to make you mad.

2817
01:59:28,351 --> 01:59:30,819
- You're such...
- You tripped over a stick.

2818
01:59:32,418 --> 01:59:35,984
Okay? Twelve years ago,
you tripped over a stick.

2819
01:59:35,986 --> 01:59:39,984
It was a one in a million thing.
You tripped over a stick.

2820
01:59:39,986 --> 01:59:42,283
That's what you did wrong.

2821
01:59:42,285 --> 01:59:44,419
There's your session.

2822
01:59:50,085 --> 01:59:52,150
It's funny how much faster
you can go

2823
01:59:52,152 --> 01:59:54,683
when you're not charging
by the hour.

2824
01:59:54,685 --> 01:59:57,217
I'm your father.

2825
01:59:57,219 --> 02:00:00,415
Trying to comprehend
how much I love you

2826
02:00:00,417 --> 02:00:03,283
would be like trying
to visualize the size

2827
02:00:03,285 --> 02:00:05,219
of the universe.

2828
02:00:06,585 --> 02:00:08,950
I didn't know...

2829
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:12,286
you'd got beaten up
until I read it in your book.

2830
02:00:13,784 --> 02:00:15,350
It was a hell of a way
to learn about it.

2831
02:00:15,352 --> 02:00:18,050
You should know
that I'm hirin' someone

2832
02:00:18,052 --> 02:00:19,183
to find the guy who did it.

2833
02:00:19,185 --> 02:00:21,149
Then, I'm hirin'
someone to kill him.

2834
02:00:21,151 --> 02:00:22,616
Don't even joke about that.

2835
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:23,885
I'm not.

2836
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:27,816
It wasn't a purse snatcher, dad.
It was the mafia...

2837
02:00:27,818 --> 02:00:29,783
I don't care
if it's the leader of Hamas.

2838
02:00:29,785 --> 02:00:33,452
Someone put their hands
on you, they're gonna suffer.

2839
02:00:37,352 --> 02:00:40,187
- Dad, I'm fine.
- No, they're gonna suffer.

2840
02:00:41,719 --> 02:00:43,016
Dad...

2841
02:00:43,018 --> 02:00:44,716
- I'm, I'm alright.
- No.

2842
02:00:44,718 --> 02:00:46,352
They're gonna suffer.

2843
02:00:51,086 --> 02:00:52,886
Really, I'm fine.

2844
02:01:18,818 --> 02:01:20,750
- <i>Did you know that...</i>
- Oh!

2845
02:01:20,752 --> 02:01:22,516
I didn't see you.

2846
02:01:22,518 --> 02:01:23,984
Did you know that we know
what the center

2847
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:27,183
of our galaxy smells like?

2848
02:01:27,185 --> 02:01:29,950
It smells like
rum and raspberries.

2849
02:01:29,952 --> 02:01:31,883
<i>The center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate</i>

2850
02:01:31,885 --> 02:01:34,116
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell.

2851
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:36,315
And raspberries their taste.

2852
02:01:36,317 --> 02:01:38,017
Why do you know these things?

2853
02:01:38,019 --> 02:01:40,516
<i>To stay busy during games,
I surfed the internet.</i>

2854
02:01:40,518 --> 02:01:43,517
Then I started
taking online courses.

2855
02:01:43,519 --> 02:01:45,582
I'm 12 credits away
from a degree in Astronomy

2856
02:01:45,584 --> 02:01:47,719
I didn't even know
I was enrolled.

2857
02:01:50,718 --> 02:01:52,816
<i>Hey.</i>

2858
02:01:52,818 --> 02:01:55,485
I wanna thank you
for what you said tonight.

2859
02:01:59,252 --> 02:02:00,718
It was Stella...

2860
02:02:04,252 --> 02:02:06,415
who asked me to be your lawyer.

2861
02:02:06,417 --> 02:02:07,816
She read the book.

2862
02:02:07,818 --> 02:02:09,683
I accused her
of reading trash.

2863
02:02:09,685 --> 02:02:14,817
But she defended
the book impressively.

2864
02:02:14,819 --> 02:02:18,083
And then defended you.

2865
02:02:18,085 --> 02:02:20,219
You're her role model.

2866
02:02:21,718 --> 02:02:23,652
I'm good with that.

2867
02:02:27,651 --> 02:02:29,786
There's a new offer
on the table.

2868
02:02:31,052 --> 02:02:32,215
What is it?

2869
02:02:32,217 --> 02:02:34,152
We hand over the hard drives.

2870
02:02:35,317 --> 02:02:36,517
I don't get it.

2871
02:02:36,519 --> 02:02:38,150
We hand over
the forensic imaging

2872
02:02:38,152 --> 02:02:39,984
of the emails and texts
in exchange for...

2873
02:02:39,986 --> 02:02:43,186
Exchange for, what could they
possibly offer me to do that?

2874
02:02:51,684 --> 02:02:54,119
I wrote it all down.
It's, um...

2875
02:03:01,986 --> 02:03:04,450
Your money back.

2876
02:03:04,452 --> 02:03:07,453
They'll give you all your money
back, plus interest.

2877
02:03:08,417 --> 02:03:11,215
It's over five million dollars.

2878
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:13,685
Is that why they took it
in the first place?

2879
02:03:14,785 --> 02:03:16,282
So they could offer it
back to me?

2880
02:03:16,284 --> 02:03:17,749
Yeah. For what it's worth

2881
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:19,783
if we went to trial,
you'd have to hand over

2882
02:03:19,785 --> 02:03:21,683
the forensic imaging
and the discoveries.

2883
02:03:21,685 --> 02:03:23,582
But that's different than
voluntarily handing it over...

2884
02:03:23,584 --> 02:03:26,148
Sure, but it's not really
voluntary anymore

2885
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:28,016
when the alternative
is prison.

2886
02:03:28,018 --> 02:03:30,518
And that's what they're going
to recommend, 42 months.

2887
02:03:34,484 --> 02:03:36,216
<i>Why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me?</i>

2888
02:03:36,218 --> 02:03:38,416
I-I'm looking right at you.

2889
02:03:38,418 --> 02:03:40,182
You think I should do it.

2890
02:03:40,184 --> 02:03:41,749
You gotta let me keep
you out of prison.

2891
02:03:41,751 --> 02:03:43,050
You've seen
what's on those hard drives.

2892
02:03:43,052 --> 02:03:44,316
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

2893
02:03:44,318 --> 02:03:45,382
It's a lot more
than a little color.

2894
02:03:45,384 --> 02:03:47,148
<i>Yeah, but complete immunity.</i>

2895
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,717
Alright?
You get all your money back.

2896
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:50,783
You'd be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom

2897
02:03:50,785 --> 02:03:52,250
<i>better off
than when you walked in.</i>

2898
02:03:52,252 --> 02:03:54,283
Careers will be ruined.

2899
02:03:54,285 --> 02:03:56,750
Families, wives, lives on both...

2900
02:03:56,752 --> 02:03:59,315
<i>Hey, you know,
w-when a rich goes to jail</i>

2901
02:03:59,317 --> 02:04:01,250
he spreads his money around,
his-his lawyer knows

2902
02:04:01,252 --> 02:04:02,717
how to take care of that.

2903
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:05,616
He spreads his money around.
You don't have any.

2904
02:04:05,618 --> 02:04:08,516
<i>The composition of female
inmates in a federal prison.</i>

2905
02:04:08,518 --> 02:04:10,817
<i>They did not commit
financial crimes.</i>

2906
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:13,349
They're drug dealers.
They get raped by prison guards.

2907
02:04:13,351 --> 02:04:14,817
Y-you will... You...

2908
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:16,415
You will not be anonymous,
Molly.

2909
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:17,917
<i>You will be a target!</i>

2910
02:04:17,919 --> 02:04:20,316
Children will read
their father's text messages

2911
02:04:20,318 --> 02:04:23,415
saying he wished
he'd never had kids.

2912
02:04:23,417 --> 02:04:25,483
- These guys...
- <i>These guys, where are they?</i>

2913
02:04:25,485 --> 02:04:27,683
Why're you in this alone?
Where are your friends?

2914
02:04:27,685 --> 02:04:30,449
Where is the one guy saying,
"Hey, you know, Molly

2915
02:04:30,451 --> 02:04:32,282
"I know you're doing everything
to save my life.

2916
02:04:32,284 --> 02:04:34,416
What can I do for you?
Let me buy you a sandwich."

2917
02:04:34,418 --> 02:04:37,017
Where are they, Molly?
You kept their secrets.

2918
02:04:37,019 --> 02:04:38,984
Where are the people
you're protecting by not telling

2919
02:04:38,986 --> 02:04:40,315
the whole story in the book?

2920
02:04:40,317 --> 02:04:42,048
By settling
the Brad Marion suit.

2921
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:44,082
By not taking
five million dollars

2922
02:04:44,084 --> 02:04:45,916
of your own money,
by going to jail!

2923
02:04:45,918 --> 02:04:47,249
Where did everybody go?

2924
02:04:47,251 --> 02:04:49,649
It's not their names
I'm protecting, Charlie.

2925
02:04:49,651 --> 02:04:51,115
- It's mine.
- Oh, that's great.

2926
02:04:51,117 --> 02:04:53,683
Well, we don't have
the luxury of integrity.

2927
02:04:53,685 --> 02:04:55,849
- You have to take the deal.
- No.

2928
02:04:55,851 --> 02:04:57,682
You stay out of jail,
you get your money back.

2929
02:04:57,684 --> 02:04:58,617
You pay your debts.

2930
02:04:58,619 --> 02:04:59,849
- You start a new life!
- No.

2931
02:04:59,851 --> 02:05:01,583
Is this self-imposed punishment

2932
02:05:01,585 --> 02:05:03,517
for namin' four guys
in a book?

2933
02:05:03,519 --> 02:05:05,115
- It's not.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

2934
02:05:05,117 --> 02:05:08,683
I threw four people under
the bus for $35,000, Charlie.

2935
02:05:08,685 --> 02:05:10,249
I noticed you kept that out of
your speech to the prosecutor...

2936
02:05:10,251 --> 02:05:11,649
No, don't do that to me.

2937
02:05:11,651 --> 02:05:13,182
<i>I took advantage
of gambling addicts.</i>

2938
02:05:13,184 --> 02:05:15,416
Donnie Silverman,
my brilliant find.

2939
02:05:15,418 --> 02:05:17,349
He lost six million dollars
on my table...

2940
02:05:17,351 --> 02:05:19,883
- Molly, stop. Stop. Uh-huh.
- <i>Moved to Florida.</i>

2941
02:05:19,885 --> 02:05:21,849
Got a job as a substitute
teacher, then hanged himself.

2942
02:05:21,851 --> 02:05:23,617
- In his shower.
- Oh! And that's your fault.

2943
02:05:23,619 --> 02:05:25,483
- That's not your fault!
- <i>Donnie Silverman's dead!</i>

2944
02:05:25,485 --> 02:05:28,582
Harlan Eustice is in jail
in Nevada wishing he was.

2945
02:05:28,584 --> 02:05:30,015
But that's not why
I'm saying no.

2946
02:05:30,017 --> 02:05:31,415
You're not saying no.

2947
02:05:31,417 --> 02:05:32,850
I was named
after my great grandmother.

2948
02:05:32,852 --> 02:05:34,750
- I don't care, you stay here...
- Molly Dubin Bloom...

2949
02:05:34,752 --> 02:05:36,482
- <i>...all night, you understand?</i>
- ...is my name.

2950
02:05:36,484 --> 02:05:39,015
Until you understand nobody
gives a shit

2951
02:05:39,017 --> 02:05:40,115
about your good name.

2952
02:05:40,117 --> 02:05:41,917
- I do!
- <i>Why?</i>

2953
02:05:41,919 --> 02:05:43,116
- Because...
- <i>Why?</i>

2954
02:05:43,118 --> 02:05:44,616
- Because...
- Tell me why!

2955
02:05:44,618 --> 02:05:48,183
Because it's all I have left.

2956
02:05:48,185 --> 02:05:50,653
Because it's my name.

2957
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:57,685
And I'll never have another.

2958
02:06:02,117 --> 02:06:04,817
Now, you read "The Crucible!"

2959
02:06:04,819 --> 02:06:08,016
Yeah. Everyone's right.
It's great.

2960
02:06:08,018 --> 02:06:09,453
It is great.

2961
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:18,786
I want to go
into that courtroom...

2962
02:06:20,684 --> 02:06:22,151
and plead guilty.

2963
02:06:22,919 --> 02:06:25,553
No deals. No trades.

2964
02:06:30,751 --> 02:06:33,517
And you're very sure?

2965
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:34,519
Yes.

2966
02:06:37,118 --> 02:06:38,816
(male #7)
<i>All rise.</i>

2967
02:06:38,818 --> 02:06:41,582
(Molly) <i>The business
of the court began.</i>

2968
02:06:41,584 --> 02:06:44,983
<i>We stood for the honorable
judge Dustin Foxman.</i>

2969
02:06:44,985 --> 02:06:46,849
<i>And counsel entered
their names for the record.</i>

2970
02:06:46,851 --> 02:06:48,550
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Harrison Wellstone

2971
02:06:48,552 --> 02:06:50,148
for the Southern District
of New York...

2972
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:52,283
- <i>The docket was called.</i>
- Docket number 1009...

2973
02:06:52,285 --> 02:06:55,383
(Molly) <i>And some pro forma
instructions were given to counsel.</i>

2974
02:06:55,385 --> 02:06:57,016
<i>And I was asked a series
of questions</i>

2975
02:06:57,018 --> 02:06:58,716
<i>from a script
the judge had in front of him.</i>

2976
02:06:58,718 --> 02:07:00,148
Molly Dubin Bloom.

2977
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,249
How old are you?

2978
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:02,649
<i>Have you taken any drugs?</i>

2979
02:07:02,651 --> 02:07:04,349
<i>Medicine or pills, or had any</i>

2980
02:07:04,351 --> 02:07:06,650
<i>alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours?</i>

2981
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:07,582
Sudafed.

2982
02:07:07,584 --> 02:07:08,884
Is there anything about
the reasons

2983
02:07:08,886 --> 02:07:10,149
for you taking Sudafed

2984
02:07:10,151 --> 02:07:11,649
that would interfere
with what's going on...

2985
02:07:11,651 --> 02:07:13,717
(Molly) <i>87 questions
he was required to ask</i>

2986
02:07:13,719 --> 02:07:15,649
<i>before he'd permit me
to plead guilty.</i>

2987
02:07:15,651 --> 02:07:17,148
(Foxman) <i>Is your mind
clear today, Ms. Bloom?</i>

2988
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,517
- It is.
- Do you understand...

2989
02:07:18,519 --> 02:07:19,850
- What's going on here today?
- I do.

2990
02:07:19,852 --> 02:07:21,483
(Foxman)
<i>Under the constitution and laws</i>

2991
02:07:21,485 --> 02:07:23,216
of the United States,
you have a right

2992
02:07:23,218 --> 02:07:25,183
to plead to the charges
in the indictment.

2993
02:07:25,185 --> 02:07:27,148
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, Your Honor.

2994
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:28,983
- And do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

2995
02:07:28,985 --> 02:07:31,683
At that trial,
you would be presumed to be

2996
02:07:31,685 --> 02:07:34,449
innocent and would not have
to prove that you were innocent.

2997
02:07:34,451 --> 02:07:36,283
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

2998
02:07:36,285 --> 02:07:37,315
Yes, Your Honor.

2999
02:07:37,317 --> 02:07:38,350
Yes, sir.

3000
02:07:38,352 --> 02:07:39,817
If you plead guilty

3001
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,283
and I accept your plea

3002
02:07:41,285 --> 02:07:42,882
<i>you will give up
your right to appeal</i>

3003
02:07:42,884 --> 02:07:45,682
along with all other rights
I've enumerated.

3004
02:07:45,684 --> 02:07:48,250
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

3005
02:07:48,252 --> 02:07:49,915
Do you understand
that you are charged

3006
02:07:49,917 --> 02:07:53,250
in count 20 with operating
an illegal gambling business

3007
02:07:53,252 --> 02:07:56,049
in violation of Title 18
United States

3008
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:59,149
Code Sections 1-9-5-5 and 2?

3009
02:07:59,151 --> 02:08:00,483
Yes, I understand.

3010
02:08:00,485 --> 02:08:02,949
Understanding everything
you've been told

3011
02:08:02,951 --> 02:08:04,849
do you now wish
to enter a plea?

3012
02:08:04,851 --> 02:08:08,717
- Yes, sir.
- How do you plead to the charge?

3013
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:10,152
Guilty, Your Honor.

3014
02:08:11,185 --> 02:08:14,282
Your plea has been so recorded.

3015
02:08:14,284 --> 02:08:15,915
<i>And you may take your seat.</i>

3016
02:08:15,917 --> 02:08:18,283
<i>Before we move
to the sentencing phase</i>

3017
02:08:18,285 --> 02:08:20,386
I would like a word
with counsel, please.

3018
02:08:23,485 --> 02:08:25,249
(Molly)
<i>And then, something happened.</i>

3019
02:08:25,251 --> 02:08:28,251
Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey,
just government counsel.

3020
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:32,319
Yes, sir.

3021
02:08:36,785 --> 02:08:38,219
What's going on?

3022
02:08:39,950 --> 02:08:41,884
What are they doing?

3023
02:08:47,318 --> 02:08:50,753
- Wait for it.
- What?

3024
02:08:54,818 --> 02:08:57,452
Will the defendant please rise
for sentencing?

3025
02:09:02,285 --> 02:09:04,250
Based on all available
information

3026
02:09:04,252 --> 02:09:06,016
this court manifestly disagrees

3027
02:09:06,018 --> 02:09:08,686
<i>with the government's
sentencing recommendation.</i>

3028
02:09:10,618 --> 02:09:12,449
This courthouse
is located within

3029
02:09:12,451 --> 02:09:14,450
spitting distance
of Wall Street.

3030
02:09:14,452 --> 02:09:16,416
I know this
from my personal experience

3031
02:09:16,418 --> 02:09:17,949
trying to spit at it.

3032
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:19,549
The men and women
who work there will commit

3033
02:09:19,551 --> 02:09:21,649
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today

3034
02:09:21,651 --> 02:09:24,650
than the defendant has committed
in this indictment.

3035
02:09:24,652 --> 02:09:27,650
I simply don't see how
either the people or the cause

3036
02:09:27,652 --> 02:09:30,215
of justice are served
by locking Molly Boom in prison.

3037
02:09:30,217 --> 02:09:33,249
(Molly) <i>It was as casual as if he
was ordering lunch off a menu.</i>

3038
02:09:33,251 --> 02:09:35,749
Ms. Bloom,
this court sentences you

3039
02:09:35,751 --> 02:09:37,948
to 200 hours
of community service.

3040
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:40,616
<i>One year
of supervised probation.</i>

3041
02:09:40,618 --> 02:09:45,016
<i>Drug testing
and a $200,000 fine.</i>

3042
02:09:45,018 --> 02:09:47,249
This case is adjourned.

3043
02:09:47,251 --> 02:09:49,386
(Molly)
<i>And that was that.</i>

3044
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,382
<i>There was crying and hugging.</i>

3045
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,182
<i>Jokes from my brothers.</i>

3046
02:09:54,184 --> 02:09:57,781
<i>Tough talk about how no one
messes with the Blooms.</i>

3047
02:09:57,783 --> 02:10:01,749
<i>And level-headed talk
about Christmas miracles.</i>

3048
02:10:01,751 --> 02:10:04,782
<i>Steaks and beer
bought by my father</i>

3049
02:10:04,784 --> 02:10:06,282
<i>and full reenactments.</i>

3050
02:10:06,284 --> 02:10:08,383
<i>And in the middle of it all</i>

3051
02:10:08,385 --> 02:10:10,715
<i>as grateful as you are</i>

3052
02:10:10,717 --> 02:10:13,717
<i>the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide.</i>

3053
02:10:15,917 --> 02:10:19,416
<i>And that's the first time
you have the thought.</i>

3054
02:10:19,418 --> 02:10:22,149
<i>What do I do know?</i>

3055
02:10:22,151 --> 02:10:23,749
(male #8)
<i>We've got a racer down!</i>

3056
02:10:23,751 --> 02:10:25,583
<i>We need a toboggan
and a back board!</i>

3057
02:10:25,585 --> 02:10:28,483
(Molly) <i>I'm a felon,
I'm 35 years old</i>

3058
02:10:28,485 --> 02:10:31,650
<i>unemployed, and pled guilty
in a mob indictment.</i>

3059
02:10:31,652 --> 02:10:33,550
Make way, people!
Make way!

3060
02:10:33,552 --> 02:10:35,383
Patrol here, move away!
Move away!

3061
02:10:35,385 --> 02:10:37,582
(Molly) <i>I owe the government
close to $2,000,000</i>

3062
02:10:37,584 --> 02:10:40,382
<i>in taxes assessed
on the civil forfeiture.</i>

3063
02:10:40,384 --> 02:10:42,682
<i>Plus, a $200,000 fine.</i>

3064
02:10:42,684 --> 02:10:44,415
<i>And you better believe
they're gonna come get it.</i>

3065
02:10:44,417 --> 02:10:47,049
Clear a path!
Move back please!

3066
02:10:47,051 --> 02:10:49,550
<i>I have a quarter of a million
dollars in legal bills.</i>

3067
02:10:49,552 --> 02:10:51,883
<i>I don't know what I'd say
in a job interview.</i>

3068
02:10:51,885 --> 02:10:55,250
<i>Or if I'll ever be given
a job interview.</i>

3069
02:10:55,252 --> 02:10:57,016
<i>I'll never be allowed
to vote again.</i>

3070
02:10:57,018 --> 02:10:58,948
(female #4) <i>I'm going to
need a set of vitals.</i>

3071
02:10:58,950 --> 02:11:01,182
(Molly) <i>And for some
reason, I'm not allowed</i>

3072
02:11:01,184 --> 02:11:03,617
<i>to go to Canada.</i>

3073
02:11:03,619 --> 02:11:05,749
(female #4)
<i>Molly, can you hear us?</i>

3074
02:11:05,751 --> 02:11:09,482
<i>Hips are stable.
Pelvis is stable.</i>

3075
02:11:09,484 --> 02:11:10,949
Yeah.

3076
02:11:10,951 --> 02:11:12,550
- Her dad's here.
- What's her LOA?

3077
02:11:12,552 --> 02:11:14,282
<i>- Uh, she's comin' around now.
- Open your eyes...</i>

3078
02:11:14,284 --> 02:11:15,916
<i>- If you can hear us.
- Okay, she's conscious.</i>

3079
02:11:15,918 --> 02:11:17,715
- Molly, what day is it?
- <i>You need to stay down, okay?</i>

3080
02:11:17,717 --> 02:11:19,649
<i>You need to go to a hospital.</i>

3081
02:11:19,651 --> 02:11:21,483
What day?

3082
02:11:21,485 --> 02:11:23,482
- Dad, I'm fine.
- <i>Trust you not to move, Molly.</i>

3083
02:11:23,484 --> 02:11:24,882
- Let go of my arm.
- <i>You trying to get up, hon?</i>

3084
02:11:24,884 --> 02:11:26,749
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- She wants to get up.

3085
02:11:26,751 --> 02:11:28,083
(male #9) <i>Our cameras
can't get in there</i>

3086
02:11:28,085 --> 02:11:29,617
<i>so we don't know...</i>

3087
02:11:29,619 --> 02:11:30,883
(male #10) <i>I wonder if
Tracy's got an update</i>

3088
02:11:30,885 --> 02:11:32,148
<i>for us on the ground.</i>

3089
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:34,516
<i>- She's moving.
- She's moving.</i>

3090
02:11:34,518 --> 02:11:36,282
- You sure you're good?
- Yeah.

3091
02:11:36,284 --> 02:11:39,082
Okay, here we go.

3092
02:11:39,084 --> 02:11:42,615
(male #9) <i>We can see that she's
being helped to her feet now.</i>

3093
02:11:42,617 --> 02:11:45,349
Molly Bloom is of course,
the sister of Jeremy Bloom

3094
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:47,948
who holds the world's
number one ranking.

3095
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:50,781
<i>That's her long time coach
there, Ted Keene</i>

3096
02:11:50,783 --> 02:11:52,550
<i>and her father.</i>

3097
02:11:52,552 --> 02:11:56,149
<i>She came back from an injury
when she was just 13.</i>

3098
02:11:56,151 --> 02:11:58,883
<i>You know, you have to wonder
about the psychological toll</i>

3099
02:11:58,885 --> 02:12:03,250
<i>coming that close,
only to lose it like that.</i>

3100
02:12:03,252 --> 02:12:06,015
(Molly)
<i>Did anything good come of this?</i>

3101
02:12:06,017 --> 02:12:07,218
<i>Not really.</i>

3102
02:12:10,885 --> 02:12:13,048
<i>But I learned
something encouraging.</i>

3103
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:15,116
<i>I'm very hard to kill.</i>

3104
02:12:15,118 --> 02:12:17,215
(male #9) <i>You and I both know
people who've never gotten over it.</i>

3105
02:12:17,217 --> 02:12:19,416
(male #10) <i>I don't know if the
young woman we've just seen is</i>

3106
02:12:19,418 --> 02:12:21,282
<i>is one of those people,
we may not see her ski</i>

3107
02:12:21,284 --> 02:12:23,550
<i>competitively again, but I
think we're gonna see her.</i>

3108
02:12:23,552 --> 02:12:25,615
(Molly) <i>Winston Churchill
defined success</i>

3109
02:12:25,617 --> 02:12:28,449
<i>as "The ability to move

<i>with no loss of enthusiasm."</i>

3111
02:12:30,519 --> 02:12:33,250
<i>So, I guess I'm pot-committed.</i>

3112
02:12:33,252 --> 02:12:34,316
(male #9)
<i>She'll be back.</i>
