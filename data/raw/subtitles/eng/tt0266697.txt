1
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,740
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,716
You know...

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,929
...I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now...

4
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,323
...if I wanted to.

5
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,027
You know, kiddo...

6
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,436
...I'd like to believe...

7
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,335
...you're aware enough, even now...

8
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:58,716
...to know that there is nothing
sadistic in my actions.

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,689
Maybe towards those other jokers...

10
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,090
...but not you.

11
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,724
No, kiddo, at this moment...

12
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,927
...this is me...

13
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,871
...at my most masochistic.

14
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,170
Bill...

15
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,943
it's your baby...

16
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,909
Coming!

17
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,774
Sarah, I cannot believe you are early.

18
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,843
What you going to do now, huh?!
What you got?!

19
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,312
I got your ass.
Wrap it up! Come on!

20
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,654
Okay. Come on, bitch.

21
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,293
Come on.

22
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,256
Bring it on.

23
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,495
- Mommy, I'm home.
- Hey, baby.

24
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,164
How was school?

25
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,105
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

26
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,552
Your good-for-nothing dog got into
the living room and acted a damn fool.

27
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,950
That's what happened, baby.

28
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,247
Barney did this?

29
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,551
Baby. Now, you can't come in here.

30
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,686
There's broken glass everywhere and
you could cut yourself.

31
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,597
This is an old friend of Mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

32
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,502
Hi, honey.

33
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,211
I'm (BLEEP). What's your name?

34
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,475
Her name is Nikki.

35
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,175
Nikki.

36
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,011
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

37
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,852
How old are you, Nikki?

38
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,727
Nikki.
(BLEEP) asked you a question.

39
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,699
I'm 4.

40
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,868
4 years old, eh?

41
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,231
You know, I had a little girl once.

42
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,538
She'd be about 4 now.

43
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:15,019
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk to talk about.

44
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,985
So go in your room now and leave us
alone till I tell you to come out.

45
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,551
Okay?

46
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,784
Nikkia!

47
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,957
In your room. Now.

48
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,211
You want some coffee?

49
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,743
Yeah. Sure.

50
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,123
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>
<i>is Jeanne Bell.</i>

51
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,820
<i>Her husband is</i>
<i>Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

52
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,900
<i>But back when we were acquainted four</i>
<i>years ago, her name was Vernita Green</i>.

53
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:06,596
<i>Her code name was Copperhead</i>.
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

54
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,728
Do you have a towel?

55
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,135
Yeah.

56
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,906
Thanks.

57
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,184
- You still take cream and sugar, right?
- Yeah.

58
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,014
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology, huh?

59
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,988
You suppose correctly.

60
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,994
Look, bitch...

61
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,563
I need to know if you're going to
start any more shit around my baby girl.

62
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,428
You can relax for now.

63
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,802
I'm not going to murder you
in front of your child, okay?

64
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,472
That's being more rational than Bill
led me to believe you were capable of.

65
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,479
It's mercy, compassion and forgiveness
I lack...

66
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,777
...not rationality.

67
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,881
Look...

68
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,254
...I know I fucked you over.

69
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,093
I fucked you over bad.
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

70
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,195
You have every right
to want to get even.

71
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,267
No, no, no, no, no.

72
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,030
No. To get even, even-steven...

73
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,204
I would have to kill you...

74
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,468
...go up to Nikki's room, kill her...

75
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,941
...then wait for your husband, the good
Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him.

76
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,550
That would be even, Vernita.
That'd be about square.

77
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,494
Look, if I could go back in a machine,
I would. But I can't.

78
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,929
All I can tell you is
that I'm a different person now.

79
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,995
Oh, great. I don't care.

80
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,937
Be that as it may, I know I don't
deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.

81
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,239
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

82
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,848
Bitch, you can stop right there.

83
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,545
Just because I have no wish to murder
you in front of your daughter...

84
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:06,056
...doesn't mean that parading her around
in front of me will inspire sympathy.

85
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,487
You and I have unfinished business.

86
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,224
And not a goddamned thing you've done
in the subsequent four years...

87
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,462
...including getting knocked up
is going to change that.

88
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,630
So when do we do this?

89
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,534
It all depends.
When do you want to die?

90
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,776
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?

91
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,544
- How about tonight, bitch?
- Splendid. Where?

92
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,655
There's a baseball diamond where I coach
Little League about a mile from here.

93
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,790
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning dressed all in black.

94
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,918
Your hair in a black stocking.

95
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,765
And we have us a knife fight.
We won't be bothered.

96
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,293
Now...

97
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,072
...I have to fix Nikki's cereal.

98
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,378
Bill always said you were one of
the best ladies with an edged weapon.

99
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,115
Fuck you, bitch.
I know he didn't qualify that shit.

100
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,852
So you can just kiss
my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

101
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,388
Black Mamba.

102
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,555
I should have been motherfucking
Black Mamba.

103
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,561
Weapon of choice? If you want to stick
with your butcher knife, that's fine.

104
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,531
Very funny, bitch.

105
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,702
Very funny!

106
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,269
It was not my intention to do this
in front of you.

107
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,334
For that, I'm sorry.

108
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,202
But you can take my word for it:

109
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,441
Your mother had it coming.

110
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,099
When you grow up...

111
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,769
...if you still feel raw about it...

112
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,174
...I'll be waiting.

113
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,809
<i>For those regarded as warriors...</i>.

114
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,916
<i>...when engaged in combat...</i>

115
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:26,685
<i>...the vanquishing of thine enemy can be</i>
<i>the warrior's only concern.</i>

116
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:34,323
<i>Suppress all human emotions</i>
<i>and compassion...</i>

117
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:45,203
<i>...kill whoever stands in thy way,</i>
<i>even if that be Lord God,</i>

118
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,006
<i>or Buddha himself</i>.

119
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:57,749
<i>This truth lies at the heart of</i>
<i>the art of combat.</i>

120
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,482
<i>...and next, we got some record.</i>

121
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,682
<i>Very own wildman, Charlie Feathers.</i>

122
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,998
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

123
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,363
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

124
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,699
They wiped out the whole wedding party,
execution-style.

125
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,240
Give me a figure.

126
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,038
Nine dead bodies.

127
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,880
And we're talking the whole shebang:

128
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,947
Bride, groom...

129
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,212
...reverend, reverend's wife.

130
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,621
Hell, they even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

131
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:46,226
Seems like someone objected to the union
and wasn't able to hold their peace.

132
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,469
Good gravy, Marie.

133
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,806
What'd I tell you, Pop?

134
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,183
Looks like a goddamn Nicaraguan
death squad.

135
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,549
You better shit-can that blasphemy, boy.
You in a house of worship.

136
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,178
Sorry, Pop.

137
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,625
This is the work of professionals.

138
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,054
I'd guesstimate Mexican mafia hit squad.

139
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,197
Four, maybe five strong.

140
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,934
How can you tell?

141
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,365
Well, a sure and steady hand did this.

142
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,207
This ain't no squirrelly amateur.

143
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,342
This is the work of a salty dog.

144
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,944
You can tell by the cleanness
of the carnage.

145
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,315
Now a kill-crazy rampage
though it may be...

146
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,352
...all the colors are kept
inside the line.

147
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,483
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

148
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,174
Who's the bride?

149
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,707
Don't know.

150
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,576
The name on the marriage certificate
is Arlene Machiavelli.

151
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,472
That's a fake.

152
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,080
We've all just been calling her
"The Bride" on account of the dress.

153
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,688
You can tell she was pregnant.

154
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:23,388
He must be a mad dog to shoot a goddamn
good-Iooking gal like that in the head.

155
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,130
Look at her.

156
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,403
Hay-colored hair,
big eyes.

157
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,131
She's a little blood-splattered angel.

158
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,980
- Son Number One?
- Yeah?

159
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,275
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

160
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,133
I might never have liked you.

161
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,242
Point in fact, I despise you.

162
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,919
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

163
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,326
Dying in our sleep...

164
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,521
...is a luxury that our kind is rarely
afforded.

165
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,232
My gift to you.

166
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,374
For fuck's sake.

167
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,371
Hello, Bill.

168
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,941
What's her condition?

169
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,353
Comatose.

170
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,621
Where is she?

171
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,952
I'm standing over her right now.

172
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,816
That's my girl.

173
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,628
Elle, you will abort the mission.

174
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,825
<i>What?!</i>

175
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,333
We owe her better than that.

176
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,266
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

177
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,970
Will you keep your voice down?

178
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,835
You don't owe her shit!

179
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,000
May I say one thing?

180
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,270
Speak.

181
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,907
Y'all beat the hell out of that woman,
but you didn't kill her.

182
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:43,881
And I put a bullet in her head,
but her heart just kept on beating.

183
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:48,821
Now, you saw that yourself with your
own beautiful blue eye.

184
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,552
Did you not?

185
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,823
<i>We've done a lot of things</i>
<i>to this lady</i>.

186
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,803
<i>And if she ever wakes up, we'll</i>
<i>do a whole lot more</i>.

187
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,872
But one thing we won't do...

188
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:07,342
...is sneak into her room in the night
like a filthy rat...

189
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,613
<i>...and kill her in her sleep</i>.

190
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,951
<i>And the reason we won't do that</i>
<i>thing</i>...

191
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,613
...is because that thing
would lower us.

192
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,482
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

193
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,759
I guess.

194
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,322
Do you really have to guess?

195
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,925
No. I don't really have to guess.

196
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,630
I know.

197
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,934
Come on home, honey.

198
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,766
Affirmative.

199
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,445
I love you very much.

200
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,810
I love you too.

201
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,948
Bye-bye.

202
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,124
Thought that was pretty fucking funny,
didn't you?

203
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,930
Word of advice, shithead:

204
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,672
Don't you ever wake up.

205
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,374
<i>This moment, this is me</i>...

206
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,012
...at my most masochistic.

207
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,178
Bill, it's your baby...

208
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,043
My baby.

209
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,147
Four years. Four years.

210
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,306
Price is $75 a fuck, my friend.

211
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,011
- You getting your freak on, or what?
- Oh, yeah, boy.

212
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,622
20, 40, 60, 75. Yeah.

213
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,356
Now here's the rule.
Rule number one: no punching her.

214
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,956
Nurse comes in tomorrow and she got
a shiner or less teeth, jig's up.

215
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,536
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

216
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,072
And by the way, this cunt's a spitter.
It's a motor reflex thing.

217
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,005
But spit or no, no punching.

218
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,236
We absolutely clear on
rule number one?

219
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,676
- Yeah.
- Good.

220
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,840
Now, rule number two: no monkey
bites, no hickeys. In fact,

221
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:44,182
no leaving no marks of no kind.
After that, it's all good, buddy.

222
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,048
Her plumbing don't work no more so
come in her all you want.

223
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,560
Keep the noise down. Try not to make
a mess. I'll be back in 20.

224
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,088
Yeah.

225
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,197
Oh! Shit. By the way,

226
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,502
sometimes this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

227
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,199
If she dry, just lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

228
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,111
Bon appètit, good buddy.

229
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,085
Oh, yeah.

230
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,526
Oh, goddamn, you are the best-looking
girl I've had today.

231
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,313
Yo, stud! Time's up, buddy.

232
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,139
I'm coming in, ready or not.

233
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,014
Good buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?

234
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:23,982
Whoa.

235
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,785
Where's Bill?

236
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,454
Where's Bill?!

237
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,356
- Please stop hitting me.
- Where's Bill?!

238
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,060
- I don't know who Bill is!
- Bullshit!

239
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,670
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
pie they said you was?

240
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,210
<i>Jane Doe. We don't know shit</i>
<i>about you</i>.

241
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:27,945
Well, I'm from Huntsville, Texas.
My name is Buck and I'm here to fuck.

242
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,587
Your name is Buck. Right?

243
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,588
And you came here to fuck. Right?

244
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,486
"Pussy Wagon."

245
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,619
You fucker.

246
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,017
Texas. Okay.

247
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,733
Wiggle your big toe.

248
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,639
Wiggle your big toe.

249
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,984
Wiggle your big toe.

250
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,125
Wiggle your big toe.

251
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,891
Wiggle your big toe.

252
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:06,902
<i>As I lay in Buck's truck trying</i>
<i>to will my limbs out of entropy</i>...

253
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,699
Wiggle your big toe.

254
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:15,439
<i>I saw the faces of the cunts who</i>
<i>did this to me and the dlck responsible</i>.

255
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:22,644
<i>Members all of Bill's brainchild:</i>
<i>The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.</i>

256
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:28,987
<i>When fortune smiles on something</i>
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge...</i>.

257
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,063
<i>...It seems proof like no other</i>
<i>that not only does God exist.</i>...

258
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,960
<i>...you're doing his will.</i>

259
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,827
<i>At a time when I knew the least about</i>
<i>my enemies...</i>

260
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,666
<i>...the first name on my death</i>
<i>list, O-Ren Ishii...</i>.

261
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,865

262
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:49,071
<i>But when one manages the hard task</i>
<i>of becoming queen of Tokyo's underworld...</i>

263

<i>...one doesn't keep it a secret,</i>
<i>does one?</i>

264
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,933
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born on an American</i>
<i>military base in Tokyo, Japan.</i>

265
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,069
<i>The half-Japanese, half</i>

<i>She swore revenge.</i>

<i>Do I look familiar?</i>

281
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:51,005
<i>Do I look like somebody you murdered!</i>

282

Hard part's over.

Now, let's get these other piggies
wiggling.

294
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,725
Welcome to Air O. May I help you?

295
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,225
Okinawa. One-way.

296
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,379
Hi.

297
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,815
<i>Welcome...</i>.

Welcome.

You English?

300
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,462
Almost. American.

301
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,298
American. Welcome, welcome.

302
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,405
My English very good.

303
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,976
You said <i>domo</i>.

304
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,807
Can you speak Japanese?

305
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,611
No, no. Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

306
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:34,422
- May I sit at the bar?
- Oh, sure! Sure, sure. Please, sit.

307
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,552
What other words did you learn?

308
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:42,932
Just a minute.

309
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:47,332
<i>We have a customer.</i>
<i>Bring out some tea, quickly.</i>

310
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,468
<i>I'm watching my soap operas.</i>

311
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,665
Oh, shit.

312
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,970
<i>Lazy bastard</i>...

313
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,169
<i>Screw your soap opera.</i>...
<i>hurry upl</i>

00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,805
<i>The tea's hot. Why don't you</i>
<i>serve it yourself for once?</i>

315
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,408
Shut up! Get your ass out here!

316
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,514
Excuse me.

317
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,886
What other Japanese do you know?

318
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,692
Oh, let's see.

319
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,490
Good.

320
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,703
I already said <i>domo</i>, right?

321
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,329
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,908
Please repeat.

323
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,141
Perfect. Good, good, good.

324
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,776
You say Japanese word
like you're Japanese.

325
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:42,255
- Now you're making fun of me.
- No. Serious business.

326
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,257
Pronunciation very good.

327
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:50,099
You say <i>arigato</i>
like we say <i>arigato.</i>

328
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,767
Well, thank you. I mean, <i>arigato</i>.

329
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:02,077
You should learn Japanese.
Very easy.

330
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,012
- No kidding? I heard it was kind of hard.
- Most difficult.

331
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,111
But, you have Japanese tongue.

332
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,120
Oh, my God.

333
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:26,897
<i>Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.</i>
<i>Hurry up....goddamit!</i>

334
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,735
<i>Lazy oaf.</i>...

335
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,743
<i>What'd ya want?</i>

336
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,151
I beg your pardon?

337
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,421
Drink.

338
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,184
Oh, yes, a bottle of warm sake, please.

339
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,062
Warm sake? Very good.

340
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,289
<i>One warm sake.!</i>

341
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,791
<i>Sake? In the middle of the day?</i>

342
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,734
<i>- Day, night, afternoon</i> - 
<i>Who gives a damn. Get the sake!</i>

343
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,638
<i>How come I always have to</i>
<i>get the sake?</i>

344
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,244
<i>You listen well...</i>

345
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,743
<i>For thirty years you make the fish.</i>
<i>I get the sake.</i>

346
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:17,343
<i>If this were the military,</i>
<i>I'd be General by nowl</i>

347
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,119
<i>Oh, so you'd be General, huh?</i>

348
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,091
<i>If you were General, I'd be Emperor,</i>

349
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:29,096
<i>and you'd stlll get the sake</i>.
<i>So shut up and get the sake.!</i>

350
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,130
Do you understand?

351
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,335
<i>I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.</i>
Do you understand?

352
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:38,801
Sorry.

353
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,507
First time in Japan?

354
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,615
What brings you to Okinawa?

355
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,847
I came to see a man.

356
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,751
Oh, yeah?

357
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,520
You have a friend live in Okinawa?

358
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:57,987
Not quite.

359
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,622
Not friend?

360
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,027
- I never met him.
- Never?

361
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,999
Who is he, may I ask?

362
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,372
Hattori Hanzo.

363
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:26,080
<i>What do you want with</i>
<i>HattoriHanzo?</i>

364
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,984
<i>I need Japanese steel.</i>

365
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,423
<i>Why do you need Japanese steel?</i>

366
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,993
<i>I have vermin to kill.</i>

367
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:48,442
You must have big rats
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

368
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,848
Huge.

369
00:52:20,902 --> 00:52:22,062
May I?

370
00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:24,298
You may.

371
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:28,800
Wait.

372
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:31,741
Try the second one down.

373
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:26,128
Funny...

374
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:29,165
...you like samurai swords.

375
00:53:32,073 --> 00:53:34,667
I like baseball.

376
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,314
<i>I wanted to show you these</i>.

377
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:51,425
<i>However, someone as you, who knows</i>
<i>so much, must surely know...</i>

378
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:57,692
<i>...I no longer make instruments</i>
<i>of death</i>.

379
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:07,199
<i>What I have here I keep for</i>
<i>their aesthetic and sentlmental value.</i>

380
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:12,779
<i>Yet proud as I am</i>
<i>of my life's work...</i>.

381
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:20,421
<i>...I have retired</i>.

382
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,161
Then give me one of these.

383
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:32,830
These are not for sale.

384
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:38,366
I didn't say "sell me."
I said "give me."

385
00:54:40,642 --> 00:54:43,736
Why should I help you?

386
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:48,707
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

387
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:53,853
And considering the student...

388
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:59,917
...I'd say you have a rather large
obligation.

389
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,084
<i>You can sleep here.</i>

390
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,151
<i>It will take me a month</i>
<i>to make the sword</i>.

391
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:08,155
<i>I suggest you spend it practicing.</i>

392
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:40,181
<i>I've completed doing</i>...

393
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:46,093
<i>what I swore an oath to God,</i>
<i>28 years ago,</i>

394
00:57:47,996 --> 00:57:51,227
<i>...to never do again.</i>

395
00:57:54,335 --> 00:57:57,600
<i>I have created,</i>
<i>"something that kills people."</i>

396
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:04,835
<i>And in that purpose, I was a success.</i>

397
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:17,381
<i>I've done this because phllosophically,</i>
<i>I am sympathetic to your aim</i>.

398
00:58:20,628 --> 00:58:25,827
<i>I can tell you with no ego,</i>
<i>this is my finest sword</i>.

399
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:31,799
<i>If on your journey,</i>
<i>you should encounter God...</i>.

400
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,908
<i>...God will be cut.</i>

401
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:50,317
<i>Yellow-haired warrior. Go</i>.

402
00:59:14,649 --> 00:59:18,278
<i>It was one year after the massacre</i>
<i>in El Paso, Texas</i>...

403
00:59:18,419 --> 00:59:22,150
<i>...that Bill backed his Nippon progeny</i>
<i>financially and philosophically...</i>.

404
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,386
<i>..!n her Shakespearian-like power</i>
<i>struggle with the other yakuza clans...</i>

405
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:29,963
<i>...over who would rule vice in</i>
<i>the city of Tokyo.</i>

406
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:33,229
<i>When the final sword was sheathed...</i>.

407
00:59:33,368 --> 00:59:36,963
<i>...It was O-Ren Ishii</i>
<i>and her powerful posse.</i>...

408
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:40,967
<i>The Crazy 88 that proved the victor.</i>

409
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:47,915
<i>The pretty lady to O-Ren's right, who's</i>
<i>dressed like a villain on Star Trek.</i>...

410
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:51,951
<i>...is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend</i>
<i>and second lieutenant...</i>.

411
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:55,544
<i>...the half-French, half-Japanese</i>
<i>Sofie Fatale.</i>

412
00:59:56,324 --> 00:59:59,521
<i>Another former protègèe of Bill's</i>.

413
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:06,396
<i>The young glrl In the schoolgirl</i>
<i>uniform is O-Ren's personal bodyguard...</i>.

414
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:09,435
<i>...17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

415
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:15,537
<i>Gogo may be young but what she lacks</i>
<i>in age, she makes up for in madness</i>.

416
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:18,043
<i>Do you like Ferraris?</i>

417
01:00:21,315 --> 01:00:24,079
<i>Ferrari....Itallan trash</i>.

418
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:34,895
<i>Do you want to screw me?</i>

419
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:40,333
<i>Don't laugh.</i>
<i>Do you want to screw me, yes or no?</i>

420
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:42,563
<i>Yes</i>.

421
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,864
<i>How 'bout now, big boy?</i>

422
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,708
<i>Do you still wish to penetrate me.</i>...

423
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:57,384
<i>...or is it I</i>...
<i>who has penetrated you?</i>

424
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:00,953
<i>See what I mean?</i>

425
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:07,184
<i>The bald guy in the black suit</i>
<i>and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo...</i>

426
01:01:07,328 --> 01:01:11,765
<i>...the head general of O-Ren's</i>
<i>personal army, The Crazy 88</i>.

427
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,829
<i>And just In case you were wondering...</i>

428
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:19,872
<i>...how could a half-breed</i>
<i>Japanese-Chinese American...</i>.

429
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:24,341
<i>...become the boss of all bosses in</i>
<i>Tokyo, Japan?</i>

430
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:26,346
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

431
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:29,245
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood and</i>
<i>nationality.</i>...

432
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:32,079
<i>...came up before the council</i>
<i>only once:</i>

433
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,520
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power</i>
<i>over the crime council.</i>

434
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:42,091
<i>The man who seems bound and determined</i>
<i>to break the mood is Boss Tanaka</i>.

435
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:45,821
<i>And what Boss Tanaka thinks is:</i>

436
01:01:49,637 --> 01:01:52,629
<i>Boss Tanaka!</i>
<i>What's the meaning of this outburst?</i>

437
01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:54,366
<i>This is a time for celebration!</i>

438
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:58,206
<i>And what exactly are we celebrating?</i>

439
01:01:59,113 --> 01:02:01,308
<i>The perversion of</i>
<i>our illustrious council?</i>

440
01:02:03,384 --> 01:02:07,821
<i>Tanaka, have you gone mad?</i>
<i>I will not tolerate this.!</i>

441
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:10,617
<i>You're disrespecting our sister!</i>
<i>Apologize!</i>

442
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:17,128
<i>Tanaka-San,</i>
<i>of what perverslon do you speak?</i>

443
01:02:22,537 --> 01:02:27,531
<i>My father along with yours, and</i>
<i>along with yours, started this council.</i>

444
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:29,841
<i>And whlle...</i>

445
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:33,344
<i>... you laugh like stupid donkeys</i>
<i>they weep in the afterlife...</i>

446
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:35,079
<i>Shut upl</i>

447
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,880
<i>...over the perversion</i>
<i>committed todayl</i>

448
01:02:38,186 --> 01:02:43,556
<i>Outrageousl Tanaka, it is you</i>
<i>who insults this councill</i>

449
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:45,056
<i>Bastardl</i>

450
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:47,021
<i>Fuck facel</i>

451
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,526
<i>Gentlemen</i>.

452
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:56,866
<i>Tanaka obviously has something</i>
<i>on his mind.</i>

453
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:02,470
<i>By all means, allow him to express it.</i>

454
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:08,371
<i>I speak, of the perversion done</i>
<i>to this council,</i>

455
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,984
<i>...which I love.</i>...

456
01:03:11,752 --> 01:03:13,583
<i>...more than my own children,</i>

457
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:19,282
<i>...by making a Chinese Jap-American</i>
<i>half breed bitch its leaderl</i>

458
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:45,010
<i>So that you understand</i>
<i>how serious I am...</i>

459
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,619
<i>...I'm going to say this in English.</i>

460
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,297
As your leader...

461
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:08,708
...I encourage you, from time to time,
and always in a respectful manner...

462
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:10,843
...to question my logic.

463
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:15,774
If you're unconvinced a particular plan
I've decided is the wisest, tell me so.

464
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,475
But allow me to convince you...

465
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:22,783
...and I promise you right here and
now no subject will ever be taboo.

466
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:26,688
Except of course the subject that was
just under discussion.

467
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:30,855
The price you pay...

468
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:35,594
...for bringing up either my Chinese
or American heritage as a negative is:

469
01:04:35,736 --> 01:04:37,931
I collect your fucking head.

470
01:04:38,406 --> 01:04:40,374
Just like this fucker here.

471
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:47,405
Now if any of you sons of bitches got
anything else to say...

472
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:50,142
...now's the fucking time!

473
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:53,811
I didn't think so.

474
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,949
<i>Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.</i>

475
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:01,858
One ticket to Tokyo, please.
