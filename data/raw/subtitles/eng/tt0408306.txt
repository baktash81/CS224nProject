uncertainty about how many Israelis...

are being held hostage in the apartment.

00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,406
It now appears that Black September

out the window. A list of demands.

32
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,453

"the Israeli war machine"...

retreating from the area.

Officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans...

67
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,525
when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building...

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,779
and demanded they call off the siege
pointing out that the entire operation...

69
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,156
was being watched on a television set
within the apartment.

70
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,533
Apparently, new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen...

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,702

though it isn't yet known...

175
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,382
Look what happened to them.

176
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,386
What now?

177
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,224
Now we're going to have a baby.

178
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,395
Eleven names.

179
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,066
Give us the order, and we'll begin.

180
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,863
It's the same as Eichmann.

181
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,342
We say to these butchers:

182
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,261
"You didn't want to share
this world with us...

183
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,079
"then we don't have to
share this world with you."

184
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,541
There's legitimacy for this.
Am I correct?

185
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,172
Ambushed and slaughtered again...

186
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,279
while the rest of the world is
playing games, Olympic torches...

187
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,472
and brass bands
and dead Jews in Germany.

188
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,867
And the world couldn't care less.

189
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,036
We've responded.
We sent 70 fighter jets.

190
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,288
A response no one heard.

191
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,915
Air strikes on guerrilla training centers.
That's a response.

192
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,917
No one notices what happens
in the border camps.

193
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,712
Sixty Arabs dead, at least.
Who knows how many wounded.

194
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,214
This is about fixing
the world's attention.

195
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,967
Well, it's not just a publicity stunt.

196
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,992
Let me remind you.

197
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,307
Ali Hassan Salameh,
he invented Black September.

198
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,458
He is the architect
of the Munich murders.

199
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,211
These people.

200
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,172
They're sworn to destroy us.

201
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,510
Forget peace for now.

202
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,471
We have to show them we're strong.

203
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,100
We have laws, we represent civilization.

204
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,121
Some people say we can't
afford to be civilized.

205
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,856
I've always resisted such people.

206
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,002
But I don't know
who these maniacs are...

207
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,403
and where they come from.

208
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,114
Palestinians?

209
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,491
They're not recognizable.

210
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,873
You tell me what law
protects people like these.

211
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,462
Today I'm hearing with new ears.

212
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,192
Every civilization finds it necessary...

213
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,344
to negotiate compromises
with its own values.

214
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,742
I've made a decision.

215
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,602
The responsibility is entirely mine.

216
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,380
- Avner?
- Yes?

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,114
We're going to Jerusalem. Get in.

218
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,534
Come on, sir.

219
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,188
Hello. I'm General Zamir.

220
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,671
Yes.

221
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,650
You swore us in.

222
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,944
My unit, when I joined Mossad.

223
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,094
I don't remember you.

224
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,515
Of course, I know your father.

225
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,734
Avner.

226
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,549
- It's been...
- Two years since I worked for you.

227
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,492
I remember. Please, sit down.

228
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,078
Harari.

229
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,413
General Nadav.

230
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,791
And General Yariv.

231
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,520
How are you? How is your father?

232
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,671
He's fine. Thank you.

233
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,444
Coffee? It's wonderful to see you again.

234
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,927
Sit.

235
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,825
The chief of the Mossad, two generals...

236
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,977
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

237
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,291
This is something new.

238
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,150
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

239
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,990
We want to ask you.
Will you undertake a mission?

240
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,595
An important mission.
You will have to leave the country...

241
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,972
and your family, maybe for years.

242
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,975
- And it is dangerous.
- You can't talk about it to anyone.

243
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,001
Not even your wife.

244
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,008
Now you should say something.

245
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,136
Do you have any questions?

246
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,600
So, this isn't about guarding
tourists on El Al jets?

247
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,687
No questions?

248
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,648
Did we mention how dangerous it is?

249
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,651
You know, my sister died on Tuesday.

250
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,255
- No, I didn't know that.
- Cancer.

251
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,758
I couldn't go to
the athletes' funerals...

252
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,658
because she died.

253
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,079
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

254
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,166
Family matters.

255
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,900
- Your wife is pregnant.
- Yes, seven months.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,508
Mazel tov.

257
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,279
You were one of my favorite bodyguards.

258
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,389
You know, I like neat, durable men.

259
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,726
You liked having the son
of a hero around.

260
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,040
Truth be told,
you don't look much like your father.

261
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,565
No?

262
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,028
Your mother is who you resemble.

263
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,548
Tomorrow morning.

264
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,468
If you can't decide in one day...

265
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,929
you can't decide.

266
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,958
Her sister died.

267
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,627
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

268
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,379
because some people are angry at her...

269
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,406
for not negotiating with the terrorists.

270
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,349
She didn't go to the funerals...

271
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,685
because she didn't want to be booed.

272
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,104
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

273
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,564
You'll say yes.

274
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,174
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

275
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,387
(PANTING)

276
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,704
How late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex?

277
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,291
Labor.

278
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,099
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

279
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,186
Will you?

280
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,958
Whatever they want,
make sure they give you a raise.

281
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,378
I need things for the baby.

282
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,987
I can't live with refusing this.

283
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,658
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

284
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,596
- She abandoned you on that kibbutz.
- She didn't abandon me.

285
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,098
My father was missing.

286
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,517
He was in prison, she was overwhelmed.

287
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,478
- Oh, yes.
- She did what anybody would do.

288
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,172
Yeah, so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you.

289
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,550
Now you think Israel is your mother.

290
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,850
So listen.

291
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,021
I'm going to go along with this,
until I don't.

292
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,317
- Do you understand me?
- I love you.

293
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,864
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

294
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:20,166
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

295
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,021
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits, or pensions...

296
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,816
or legal aid or medical assistance.

297
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,968
It's a contract that
there is no contract.

298
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,321
- Do I get a copy?
- You don't.

299
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,056
Your pension contribution refund.

300
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,452
You're now officially unofficial.

301
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,811
Unemployed and uninsured.

302
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,623
You'll open two accounts...

303
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,001
at the Union de
Banques Suisse in Geneva...

304
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,544
on Rue du Commerce.

305
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,173
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

306
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,425
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

307
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,177
when you get what accumulates.

308
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,096
Also, for each of your men,
you open an account for his salary.

309
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,184
- How many men do I have for this...
- In the operational funds box...

310
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:05,378
we will deposit 250,000
American dollars.

311
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,399
You take it out, we put more in.

312
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,902
I want receipts.

313
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,987
You are not working for
the Baron Rothschild.

314
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,364
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

315
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,951
I'm an old Galicianer from
a mud hut in the Ukraine.

316
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,621
And I don't trust Yekke
putzes let loose in Europe...

317
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,873
with unlimited operational expenses.

318
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,375
I was born in Israel. I'm not a Yekke.

319
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,444
- Where is your grandpa from?
- Frankfurt.

320
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,422
You're a Yekke.

321
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,843
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

322
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,555
Also, we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds.

323
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,623
You can leave messages for us.

324
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,461
- But there shouldn't be messages.
- I don't care about that.

325
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,775
- Bring me receipts, you got me?
- I got you.

326
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,969
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying for it.

327
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,243
We have 11 Palestinian names.

328
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,370
Each had a hand in planning Munich.

329
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,248
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

330
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,582
They're all in Europe now.

331
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,125
You'll stay there as long as it takes.

332
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,295
Europe only, not the Arab countries.
That's for us, not you.

333
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,548
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

334
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,365
Who needs it?

335
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,701
You'll have no contact with us.

336
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,264
You're not going to
give me any information?

337
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,766
We deposit money from a
fund that doesn't exist...

338
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,936
into a box we don't know about,
in a bank we never set foot in.

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,564
We can't help you because we
never heard of you before.

340
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,315
You'll do what the terrorists do.

341
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,009
You think they report back to home base?
They don't.

342
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,220
We want them dead.

343
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,199
Nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea.

344
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,159
You can ask questions now.

345
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,453
- Am I alone?
- Four others.

346
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,373
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

347
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,749
cleanup to make sure you don't...

00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:45,617
He cost us, by my calculations,
roughly $352,000.

521
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,056
You didn't finish the story.

522
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,434
The angels respond to God.

523
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,269
They say, "God, we're celebrating...

524
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,938
"because when the people hear
what happened to the Egyptians...

525
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,565
"they'll understand your point."

526
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,298
Which was?

527
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,301
Don't fuck with the Jews.

528
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,157
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm not celebrating.

529
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,433
I'm goddamn rejoicing.

530
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,370
Here. Put that down.
Put it down. Get up.

531
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,080
- No, please.
- Come on, dance with me.

532
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,499
- Dance with me. Come on.
- No.

533
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,191
Come on.

534
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,778
Come on. Hey.

535
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,564
This is... What shall I call you today?

536
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,025
Franz Storsch.

537
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,653
You can call me Louis.

538
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,701
- Our service has been satisfactory?
- Pricey.

539
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,183
A Jew and a Frenchman.
We could haggle forever, huh?

540
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:19,062
- I'm not a Jew.
- What do you suppose a ramson is?

541
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:23,340
It's a kind of a wild leek.
Not in season, but garlic will do.

542
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,694
My papa sometimes loses
track of the seasons.

543
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,095
I know nothing about food.

544
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,765
Why does he make me shop?

545
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,705
You're wondering
if I'm French Intelligence.

546
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,981
Or CIA or KGB.

547
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,711
Or an agent with a profitable
sideline in information.

548
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,113
I could be anybody.
You could be anybody, too.

549
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,075
Identity. That's the boring part now.

550
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,703
Here's what isn't boring.

551
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,349
As long as you don't work
for any government...

552
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,227
- I'm in private business.
- Rich Americans, I heard.

553
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,295
I'm in private business, too. My family.

554
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:07,193
We can locate almost anyone
for anyone anywhere...

555
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,863
and we are ideologically promiscuous.

556
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,198
We love everybody, hate everybody.

557
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,683
I get my feelings confused.

558
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,036
If you're not working
for any government...

559
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,955
we know, or we find...

560
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,606
we don't find, you don't pay.

561
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,669
REPORTER: (ON TV) Initially it was
the intention of the hijackers...

562
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,131
to bring the Lufthansa to
Munich International Airport...

563
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,425
and then take onboard
the three prisoners...

564
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,761
at the end of the runway,
where Captain Klausen took his plane...

565
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,389
while an Arab held a
hand grenade at his head.

566
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,849
Hey, Avner.

567
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,685
A Lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from Damascus.

568
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,188
The hijackers demanded
the release of three killers...

569
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,439
who survived Munich...

570
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,774
and the Germans said yes, instantly.

571
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,069
The Arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to Zagreb.

572
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,387
Look. They're free now.

573
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,222
They're in Libya.

574
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,524
No qualms about rejoicing
on their side, eh?

575
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,945
The Israeli kills the Arabs...

576
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,550
in Egypt, in Jordan,
in Lebanon, in Syria...

577
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,409
Look at them.

578
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,329
They're movie stars.

579
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,082
But did you shoot any
of the Israeli hostages?

580
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:26,481
It's not important to say
if I killed Israelis or not.

581
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,733
We should go to Tripoli.

582
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,276
Kill them.

583
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,344
We don't go to Arab countries.

584
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,055
We stick to the names we've been given.

585
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,351
Mahmoud Hamshari.

586
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,794
Do you think, looking back on it now...

587
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,505
that you achieved anything
in the Munich operation?

588
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:55,802
We have made
our voice heard by the world.

589
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,869
Are those your words?

590
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,517
The same thing again.

591
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,688
They have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world...

592
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,089
who has not been hearing before.

593
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,779
Well, I believe
what he meant by this is...

594
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,931
that now the world
will begin hearing us.

595
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:23,746
We are, for 24 years,
the world's largest refugee population.

596
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,915
Our homes taken from us.

597
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:29,752
Living in camps, no future, no food.

598
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,487
Nothing decent for our children.

599
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:36,199
And, so was the attack
in Munich justified?

600
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,679
The PLO condemns attacks on civilians.

601
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,724
- Though for 24 years...
- Tell your newspaper that.

602
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:46,602
...our civilians have been attacked
by the Israelis day after day...

603
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,689
Tell them about all the years
and years of Palestinian blood...

604
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,066
spilled by Israel.
And who mourns for us?

605
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,110
You know, Israel just bombed...

606
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,696
two refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon.

607
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,407
- Tell them that...
- 200 people killed.

608
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,744
- Right after Munich they did this.
- It did not begin in Munich.

609
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,913
And where does it end?
How will it ever end?

Yes, yes. Sorry.

This man, we don't know
what he did specifically?

618
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,647
Hamshari arranged the attempted
assassination of Ben-Gurion...

619
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,441
in Copenhagen a few years ago.

620
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,276
Now he organizes for Fatah in France.

621
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,569
- He organizes?
- Yes.

622
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,488
In Tel Aviv they showed
you evidence for this?

623
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,072
Not evidence. It was more...

624
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,949
this is the story and I believe them.

625
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,576
Why? Don't you?

626
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,537
It's a crisis, a war.
You don't have to always...

627
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,749
- What? Be thinking?
- Scrutinize. Yeah, think.

628
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,418
You want to wire Ephraim
and ask for evidence, you do it.

- Good.

Don't think about it.

632
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,594
Okay.

633
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:10,663
So, now, I turn it on.

634
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,293
He picks up the phone,

Will the remote still work?

REPORTER: The Israeli embassy in
London was rocked by a letter bomb...

665

shortly after 9:30 this morning.

666
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,868
Dr. Ami Shachori was
opening his morning mail...

667
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:07,121
when the envelope exploded,
killing him instantly.

668
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:11,691
They discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in Earls Court.

669
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,986
- I guess they missed one.
- Right after Hanukkah.

670
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,823
I guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless.

671
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,844
They found other letters
in Israel, of course.

Now if al-Chir sleeps in his closet,
we're in trouble.

his weight arms the device...

than his predecessor.

- Three names for $600,000...

So when they explode, they toss
little white balls of phosphorus...

here all around his room.
Each ball, it's like a little sun.

1055
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:28,977
It burns at around 5,000 degrees.

1056
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:32,254

01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,370
Did the CIA know about Munich?

1210
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,914
The CIA didn't even know
Black September existed...

1211
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:26,856
before Munich.

1212
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,002
One of the guerrillas was
shot through the head...

1213
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:31,295
by a ricochet bullet.

1214
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,881
A second was blown up
by his own hand grenade.

1215
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:36,366
LOUIS: Since then, he's been busy.

1216
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:38,576
Hasn't he?

1217
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,205
All manner of costly exercises.

1218
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:44,642
Shooting tourists
in the Athens airport...

1219
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:47,103
blowing up pharmacies in Amsterdam...

1220
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,547
and that Mossad agent
in Barcelona before that.

1221
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:55,718
Europe hasn't been this interesting
since Napoleon marched to Moscow.

1222
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:58,763
Do you have to do that here?

1223
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:03,226
Salameh is in London.
For the usual price.

1224
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:14,589
We followed him from
his doctor to his hotel.

1225
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,966
- He's here for eye treatment.
- Salameh. You saw him?

1226
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:18,342
- You followed him?
- Yes.

1227
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,595
- Wearing sunglasses in the rain.
- Why didn't you shoot him?

1228
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,096
There were bodyguards. Civilians.

1229
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,347
- Were they armed?
- Yes.

1230
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,850
Well then, they're not civilians.
I'd have done it...

1231
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,810
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

1232
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:30,271
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

1233
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:32,064
Maybe that's why we never let you do it.

1234
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:34,358
- We only go after our targets.
- Since when?

1235
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,152
I mean, why are
we worried about that now?

1236
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:39,530
Do you have any idea how
many laws we've broken?

1237
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,909
It's time to stop your agonizing.
It's counterproductive.

1238
01:43:43,009 --> 01:43:46,412
Including, incidentally,
the laws of the state of Israel...

1239
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:47,789
which has no death penalty.

1240
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:50,500
You know what your problem is, habibi?

1241
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,043
You're disorientated.

1242
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:54,545
Because the guys we're killing
are dressed in expensive suits...

1243
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,006
and this is London
and not some ugly Arab village.

1244
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:58,758
I'm not disoriented.

1245
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:01,302
I'm keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself...

1246
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:02,470
that in spite of...

1247
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,305
But it's the same
old war we're fighting...

1248
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:05,640
I'm still, at least in principle,
a human being.

1249
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,016
...over the same old scrap of desert!

1250
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:09,477
It's just we've brought our war
to Copenhagen and Kensington...

1251
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:12,063
and it's not like these European
anti-Semites don't deserve that.

1252
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,399
Unless we learn to act like them,
we will never defeat them.

1253
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,735
We act like them all the time.

1254
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,071
What, you think the Palestinians
invented bloodshed?

1255
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:22,573
How do you think we got control
of the land? By being nice?

1256
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:25,076
Somebody pull down this man's pants.
See if he's circumcised.

1257
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,661
I think we have
a double agent in our midst.

1258
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:29,413
- Don't you dare accuse me of that!
- Stop it!

1259
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:32,375
My son died in '67,
you foul-mouthed son of a bitch.

1260
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,669
Everything you can ask,
I've done for Israel.

1261
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:37,797
Ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful.

1262
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:40,740
- Why, it's not distasteful to you?
- No.

1263
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:44,827
'Cause the only blood that
matters to me is Jewish blood.

1264
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:50,250
Nice job, eh. Nice job leading.

1265
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:54,188
If the bodyguards are armed,
we kill them.

1266
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:57,340
- They're armed.
- Well, then we kill them!

What are you doing in London?

1271
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:34,455
Get your hands off me.

Put them up.
Put them up, you fat, wet puss!

what we're made of.

Hey, wait a minute! Who the fuck...
Who do you think this is then?

1275
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:42,672
- Roger Burke.
- Who do you think this is?

1276
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:45,591
- No, you idiot. That is not...
- Lay off him, asshole.

1277
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,659
- That's not him. Come on.
- It's Roger Burke.

1278
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,221
I'm sorry about my friend, you know?

1279
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:53,599
He's a fucked-up, belligerent guy
with a serious drinking problem.

- Lose it.

- Come on. Calm down!
- Hey, calm down.

1282
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:02,465
Hey, come here! Calm down!

1283
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:08,280
Back off. Get back!

1284

- Back off! Back off!
- Fuck off!

1285
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,201
It's me. All right!

1286
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,811
- All right. Come on.
- Fuck off!

- Come on.

1288
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:22,026
- It's me. Remember me? Sorry.
- It's all right.

1289
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,363

- What the fuck is that?
- Was it Salameh?

1292
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,917
Yes, of course it was fucking Salameh!

These are wild stories.

- Wild stories.
- Yeah?

1300
01:48:16,115 --> 01:48:17,415
Yeah.

01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,608
Can I?

1302
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:56,078
I have to go to bed soon.
I work in the morning.

What kind of work do you do?

1304
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:04,295
The kind that drives you to drink.

It's very nice.

Look, I don't want to be forward...

1312

but it's late...

1313
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:46,045

Are you really going to make me ask?

01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,986
I just can't.

1319
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:12,321
Pity.

- You're very attractive.
- I know.

well, maybe I'll be here.

1324

Or maybe I'll be in my room,
alone in bed.

Good night.

The drunk Americans.
You think they were CIA?

1327
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:05,768
They could've been.
For all we know, Louis is CIA.

1328
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:08,479
They work both sides. Everyone does.

1329
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:11,523
Or Louis is Mossad.
Now, maybe he isn't...

1330
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,275
but they're using him
to feed us information.

1331
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:14,944
There's no direct link.

1332
01:51:15,044 --> 01:51:17,863
Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,
which is giving it to Louis...

1333
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:19,782
and Ephraim's demanding
we give him Louis...

1334
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:22,326
because he knows we expect him to do...

01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,548
I thought the same about you.

1338
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:39,343
From the beginning
you seemed so reluctant.

1339
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:41,303
I was born reluctant. Ask my mother.

1340
01:51:41,403 --> 01:51:43,013
If I can't kvetch, I can't do my job.

1341
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,349
You ever feel reluctant?

1342
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:48,000
I'm not comfortable with confusion.

1343
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:51,689
I knew guys like you in the army.

1344
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:54,316
You'll do any terrifying
thing you're asked to do...

1345
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:56,926
but you have to do it running.

1346
01:51:57,753 --> 01:52:02,264
You think you can outrun
your fears, your doubts.

1347
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:08,979
The only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness.

Will you join me?

No, I'm going to go upstairs,
straight to bed.

Best guy he ever worked for, and so on.

1545
02:17:41,045 --> 02:17:44,406
He says this French group...
Louis was his name?

1546
02:17:44,506 --> 02:17:47,493
They sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

1547
02:17:47,593 --> 02:17:49,602
They helped kill your men.

1548
02:17:50,596 --> 02:17:52,832
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

1549
02:17:52,932 --> 02:17:54,523
Tell us who they are.

1550
02:17:56,852 --> 02:17:59,153
They won't work with you.

1551
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:03,425
- It's about loyalty.
- You're an Israeli officer.

1552
02:18:03,525 --> 02:18:06,410
That's your only loyalty! That's it!

1553
02:18:09,156 --> 02:18:10,539
Okay.

1554
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:14,728
This is General Hofi of
the Northern Command.

1555
02:18:14,828 --> 02:18:16,629
You look good.

1556
02:18:17,039 --> 02:18:20,609
Listen, the Prime Minister is
proud of you and your men.

1557
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:22,736
She wishes she could tell you herself,
but she can't.

1558
02:18:22,836 --> 02:18:25,054
She never heard of you, right?

1559
02:18:25,547 --> 02:18:28,993
Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

1560
02:18:29,093 --> 02:18:30,768
For Israel.

1561
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:38,025
That's it.
There is no medal or anything.

1562
02:18:49,405 --> 02:18:52,748
June 16, 1973. Avner Kaufman interview.

1563
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:56,502
Go ahead.

1564
02:19:00,582 --> 02:19:02,883
Tell me what you learned.

1565
02:19:05,546 --> 02:19:07,573
- What I learned?
- Yes.

1566
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:09,724
What did you learn?

1567
02:19:12,052 --> 02:19:13,537
For God's sake!

1568
02:19:13,637 --> 02:19:16,314
Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

1569
02:19:20,394 --> 02:19:21,837
Avner, tell me.

1570
02:19:21,937 --> 02:19:25,239
Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

1571
02:19:26,358 --> 02:19:27,867
Please.

1572
02:19:28,819 --> 02:19:32,038
I can have you court-martialed,
and I might.

1573
02:19:32,448 --> 02:19:35,916
You can't. I don't work for you.

1574
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:39,337
I don't exist.

1575
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:44,592
- You look terrible.
- I'm not good right now.

1576
02:19:46,837 --> 02:19:50,973
You don't need to tell me anything.
It's taken a lot from you.

1577
02:19:51,383 --> 02:19:55,728
- I'm alive, right?
- And the rest sorts itself out.

1578
02:19:56,930 --> 02:20:00,649
I'm not a fool, Avner.
I never said you were a fool.

1579
02:20:10,444 --> 02:20:14,538
Everyone in Europe died.
Most of my family.

1580
02:20:15,199 --> 02:20:16,684
A huge family.

1581
02:20:16,784 --> 02:20:18,417
(MAKING BLOWING SOUND)

1582
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:22,773
I never talked to you about it.

1583
02:20:22,873 --> 02:20:26,133
- I knew.
- You knew? So what was there to say?

1584
02:20:27,294 --> 02:20:29,905
I didn't die, because I came here.

1585
02:20:30,005 --> 02:20:33,409
When I arrived, I walked up to
the top of a hill in Jerusalem...

1586
02:20:33,509 --> 02:20:36,620
and prayed for a child.

1587
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:39,707
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

1588
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:43,359
And I could feel every one
of them praying with me.

1589
02:20:46,605 --> 02:20:48,989
You are what we prayed for.

1590
02:20:49,858 --> 02:20:52,326
What you did, you did for us.

1591
02:20:52,486 --> 02:20:55,597
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

1592
02:20:55,697 --> 02:20:59,208
Every one of the ones who died,
died wanting this.

1593
02:21:00,536 --> 02:21:04,231
We had to take it,
because no one will ever give it to us.

1594
02:21:04,331 --> 02:21:07,842
A place to be a Jew among Jews,
subject to no one.

1595
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:12,430
I thank God for hearing my prayer.

1596
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:16,642
Do you want to know, Mama?

1597
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:20,729
Do you want me to tell you what I did?

1598
02:21:22,432 --> 02:21:23,774
No.

1599
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:28,696
Whatever it took, whatever it takes.

1600
02:21:30,274 --> 02:21:35,536
A place on Earth.
We have a place on Earth.

1601
02:21:36,697 --> 02:21:38,247
At last.

1602
02:21:47,833 --> 02:21:50,217
- What's this?
- Baklava.

1603
02:21:50,794 --> 02:21:53,989
From Rehovot? The only edible
baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

1604
02:21:54,089 --> 02:21:56,283
Eat it on the plane. You're too thin.

1605
02:21:56,383 --> 02:21:58,726
I hope it gives you a bellyache.

1606
02:21:59,845 --> 02:22:01,163
Listen, forget it.

1607
02:22:01,263 --> 02:22:03,957
You go see your wife, your child,
rest for a few more months.

1608
02:22:04,057 --> 02:22:05,751
Then we're gonna
put you back in the field.

1609
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:07,586
Not Europe. Probably Latin America.

1610
02:22:07,686 --> 02:22:11,197
You think it over. Rest, Avner.
Then you come back.

1611
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:14,492
No.

That's all right.

1614
02:22:42,304 --> 02:22:45,749
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

1615
02:22:45,849 --> 02:22:49,318
Look at that beautiful hair.

1616
02:23:36,024 --> 02:23:37,658
Nightmares?

1617
02:23:38,527 --> 02:23:39,868
Yes.

1618
02:23:43,031 --> 02:23:44,915
Come back to bed.

1619
02:23:47,202 --> 02:23:49,837
I have no idea where I should be.

1620
02:23:55,919 --> 02:24:00,681
The place is nice.
You've made it really nice.

1621
02:24:01,717 --> 02:24:03,851
The kitchen's too big.

1622
02:25:21,546 --> 02:25:24,473
Sylvie, I need to speak to your father.

1623
02:25:26,301 --> 02:25:28,102
Is Louis there?

1624
02:25:29,471 --> 02:25:32,207
I need to speak to your father.
Have him call me.

1625

212-664-7665.

Is my family being hunted?

How is your father? He's well?
Your family is well?

1631

I don't know. How is my family?
Are they well?

1632
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:57,482
Are they going to be okay?

1633

I'm sending you a parcel
of sausage and cheese.

1634
02:26:00,419 --> 02:26:03,572
Real cheese.
The kind you can't find in America.

1635
02:26:03,672 --> 02:26:07,474
It isn't pasteurized,
so it won't taste like shit.

1636
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:11,812
It's a real pleasure to
hear your voice again.

1637
02:26:12,639 --> 02:26:15,190
I think about you with concern.

1638

You can't go in there, sir.
It's a restricted area. Sir?

1648

- if you hurt my child. Understand?
- Do I know you, sir?

1656

Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt my father.

I don't care. I'll go to the newspapers.

I'll give every name of everybody
who was in the meetings.

don't leave my family alone! Okay?

You think we'd hurt your family?

I think anyone is capable of anything.

1667
02:32:52,247 --> 02:32:54,881
I think you're losing your mind.

1668
02:32:59,546 --> 02:33:01,596
Did I commit murder?

1669
02:33:04,509 --> 02:33:06,578
I want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed...

1670
02:33:06,678 --> 02:33:07,704
had a hand in Munich.

1671
02:33:07,804 --> 02:33:10,123
I don't discuss such things
with people who don't exist.

1672
02:33:10,223 --> 02:33:12,709
You want to discuss,
come back to existence.

1673

You want your daughter
to grow up in exile?

1674

Professor Hamshari with
the beautiful wife and child?

1676
02:33:23,945 --> 02:33:27,182
He was implicated in a failed
assassination attempt on Ben-Gurion.

1677
02:33:27,282 --> 02:33:29,601
He was recruiting for Fatah France.

1678
02:33:29,701 --> 02:33:30,977
You stopped him.

1679
02:33:31,077 --> 02:33:32,562
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

1680
02:33:32,662 --> 02:33:34,689
And Zwaiter,
your harmless little writer in Rome?

1681
02:33:34,789 --> 02:33:38,067
He was behind the bomb on
El Al flight 76 in 1968.

1682
02:33:38,167 --> 02:33:39,944
He was working on
another bomb last August.

1683
02:33:40,044 --> 02:33:41,112
I could go on and on with this.

1684
02:33:41,212 --> 02:33:43,740
According to evidence nobody has seen.

1685
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:46,659
If these people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

1686
02:33:46,759 --> 02:33:48,560
Like Eichmann.

1687
02:33:48,761 --> 02:33:50,580
If these guys live, Israelis die.

1688
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:54,941
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

1689
02:34:04,277 --> 02:34:06,513
You did well, but you're unhappy.

1690
02:34:06,613 --> 02:34:09,289
- I killed seven men.
- Not Salameh.

1691
02:34:09,824 --> 02:34:11,583
We'll get him, of course.

1692
02:34:14,537 --> 02:34:16,796
You think you were the only team?

1693
02:34:17,165 --> 02:34:20,151
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

1694
02:34:20,251 --> 02:34:22,344
Does that assuage your guilt?

1695
02:34:23,296 --> 02:34:25,472
Did we accomplish anything at all?

1696
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:28,326
Every man we killed has
been replaced by worse.

1697
02:34:28,426 --> 02:34:31,412
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

1698
02:34:31,512 --> 02:34:33,915
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

1699
02:34:34,015 --> 02:34:35,375
or the Palestinian leadership?

1700
02:34:35,475 --> 02:34:37,126
You tell me what we've done.

1701
02:34:37,226 --> 02:34:38,920
You killed them for the
sake of a country...

1702
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:40,570
you now choose to abandon.

1703
02:34:41,773 --> 02:34:45,635
The country your mother and father built,
that you were born into.

1704
02:34:45,735 --> 02:34:48,745
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

1705
02:34:50,281 --> 02:34:53,393
There's no peace at the end of this,
no matter what you believe.

1706
02:34:53,493 --> 02:34:56,771
- You know this is true.
- Here's what I know.

1707
02:34:56,871 --> 02:34:58,857
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

1708
02:34:58,957 --> 02:35:02,467
You're a sabra.
Your wife and daughter are sabras.

1709
02:35:03,086 --> 02:35:05,595
What I came to say is this...

1710
02:35:06,506 --> 02:35:08,139
come home.

1711
02:35:22,146 --> 02:35:24,406
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

1712
02:35:25,942 --> 02:35:27,969
Come on.
You're a Jew, you're a stranger.

1713
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:30,638
It's written someplace or

1714
02:35:30,738 --> 02:35:33,748
ask you to come and break bread with me.

1715
02:35:34,033 --> 02:35:38,878
So break bread with me, Ephraim.

1716
02:35:42,583 --> 02:35:43,925
No.
