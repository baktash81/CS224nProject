00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:17,228
A Daiei/Nippon Television Network/
/Hakuhodo/IMAGICA Production

2
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:30,138
Change course
Direction, 120 degrees

3
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,871
Roger, hard to port

4
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:34,579
Hard to port

5
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,276
I need navigational information

6
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,445
It all began one day,

7
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:10,373
without warning,

8
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:13,514
like this. . .

9
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:35,336
Still no answer at Taguchi's?

10
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,202
No

11
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,713
It's been a week,
he must have his reasons

12
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:47,479
It shouldn't take a whole week
to work on that disk

13
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:48,815
No. . .

14
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,717
Something’s wrong

15
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,559
Maybe I should see if he's OK

16
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:57,696
I just got the creeps

17
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,459
What?

18
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:07,134
Like something's. . .
horribly wrong

19
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,616
What's up with Taguchi?

20
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,483
I don't know

21
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,163
The deadline's tomorrow

22
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,635
I know that

23
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:56,040
a KUR0SAWA Kiyoshi film

24
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,452
Taguchi?

25
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:27,372
PULSE

26
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,008
Hey, you are here

27
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,340
Hey, Michi. . .

28
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,446
Right, sorry

29
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,712
Did you finish working on that disk?

30
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,758
Yeah, it's somewhere in that pile

31
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,657
You 0K?
Are you sick?

32
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,661
No. . .

33
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,037
Yeah. . .
Stuff. . .

34
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,711
Help yourself to the disk

35
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,443
You ought to label your disks

36
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,456
This it?

37
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:39,009
The one marked Work File?

38
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,279
Taguchi?

39
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:20,505
Michi

40
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,203
0h, Junco

41
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,680
You 0K? Was it awful?

42
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,077
I'm fine

43
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,946
I'd say it's break time

44
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,223
Oh, I forgot, here

45
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,426
Thanks

46
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:46,099
It's so upsetting

47
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,474
I don’t know what he was
so depressed about

48
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:56,306
He never said anything,
so what could we have done?

49
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,615
Maybe,

50
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,314
he suddenly just wanted to die

51
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,793
I get that way sometimes

52
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,199
It's so easy to hang yourself

53
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,678
Hey! Why so gloomy

54
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,320
0h, sorry

55
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,585
About Taguchi?

56
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:45,522
He seemed like the Taguchi I know

57
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:50,463
I never imagined he'd
do something like that

58
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,567
Yeah. . .

59
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,847
Say. . .
Would you take a look?

60
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,483
At what?

61
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,991
Taguchi's disk

62
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,600
What is it?

63
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:35,842
It's Taguchi's place

64
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,349
Is that Taguchi?

65
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,286
Yeah, I think so

66
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:43,844
Look

67
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,860
I can't tell

68
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,336
Hey, look

69
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,573
That’s a face. . .

70
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,266
A reflection

71
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:05,602
You' re right

72
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,770
Can you blow it up?

73
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,015
Let me see. . .

74
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,538
That was Taguchi wasn't it?

75
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,974
Sure seems like it

76
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,712
What's going on?

77
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,283
Maybe something strange is going on

78
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,184
Strange?

79
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:52,348
I don't know

80
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,687
I don't even care anymore

81
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,761
Something's definitely not right

82
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,066
A message in a bottle
launched 10 years ago

83
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,196
by a boy on
Tanegashima Island,,

84
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,832
was recently discovered

85
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:14,970
on a beach in Malaysia
some 4.000 kms away

86
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:16,905
Hikono Koichi was

87
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,544
a 4th grader when he
sent off his message

88
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,986
Members of a local group,
cleaning up the beach,

89
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:29,493
a sea turtle habi tat.

90
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,358
discovered the bottle by accident

91
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:35,558
I never imagined it would find its
way to some foreign country

92
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:39,338
I was shocked to get
an answer after 10 years

93
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,063
The group located Hikono

94
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,110
through his former
elementary school

95
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,780
Next, the National Weather Service

96
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:54,046
forecasts another unseasonably
hot summer, it's the 3rd

97
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:58,180
for eastern Japan. . .
for western Japan. . .

98
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,955
Northern Japan. . . will. . .

99
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,394
“Welcome to the Internet”

100
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,569
No, this way, here

101
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:21,669
OK

102
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,267
Next, 0K

103
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:26,537
Next

104
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:32,417
“Have Fun”
0K, I'll have fun

105
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:36,880
Done “OK”

106
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,857
What’s this crap?
Yes, I agree

107
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,674
Next. . .

108
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:03,238
What? I guess that’s 0K

109
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,751
Next again, huh

110
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,544
What?

111
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:19,620
What the. . .
Oh well. . .

112
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,771
What the hell. . .

113
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,692
Hey. . . this. . .

114
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,627
Who’s. . . what’s. . .

115
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,362
Would you like to meet a ghost?

116
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,809
Stupid crap!

117
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,175
What the. . .

118
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,392
Maybe you should change
the size on this batch file

119
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,034
Using the variable?

120
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:13,297
Yeah

121
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,939
So you' ll find its property, right?

122
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,876
0h, conventional memory

123
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,273
Right

124
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:24,844
See

125
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,414
So that’s how you do it

126
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:39,896
Say. . .

127
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,861
Can the internet dial
you up itself?

128
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,869
You in computer science?

129
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:52,032
No, economics, no relation

130
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,841
Huh. . .
Sounds like a hacker

131
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,114
A hacker. . .

132
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,848
Huh. . .

133
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,889
It said
“Do you want to meet a ghost?”

134
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,728
Some website like that

135
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:20,404
A ghost, huh. . .

136
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,602
Which website was that?

137
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,169
What?

138
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,035
Something about meeting ghosts?

139
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:04,077
I don’t really know
It just appeared last night

140
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,649
Know the address?

141
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:09,382
What? Um. . . address?

142
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,046
I see

143
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,691
Windows?

144
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,020
Yeah

145
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,324
Open the Explorer log. . .

146
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,831
Oh, no, no, I really don’t

147
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,401
know anything about computers

148
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,865
The next time the site shows up,

149
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,976
click on it to bookmark it

150
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:34,841
Not so fast

151
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,776
Click. . .

152
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,614
Can you repeat that?

153
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,190
Click on it

154
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,590
Click. . . on. . . it. . .

155
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,355
To bookmark it

156
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:54,898
To. . .

157
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,168
Bookmark it

158
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,863
If that doesn’t work,

159
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,835
You know the print screen key?

160
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,734
Yeah, this one?

161
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,310
Try pressing it

162
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,173
If it doesn’t work. . .

163
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,412
Print screen key

164
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:16,919
Press the. . .

165
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,156
Print screen. . .

166
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,451
Got it

167
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:21,855
Let me know?

168
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:22,983
Sure

169
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:26,856
See you

170
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,822
Don’t bother with that Mom

171
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,859
What? Sure

172
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,801
Are you eating this junk again?

173
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,301
It’s not good for you

174
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,138
I’m going now

175
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:20,515
Have you called your father?

176
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:21,813
Nope

177
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,556
I see. . . but what if
you get in trouble?

178
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,417
I can’t rush over

179
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:34,989
It’s awkward for me
to see him, but you should

180
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,070
He lives here in Tokyo

181
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,070
But Tokyo’s huge

182
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,902
I know, but. . .

183
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,341
I’m fine
I’ve got my friends

184
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:49,673
You sure?
I guess you' ll be allright then

185
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:52,782
You' re so trusting and
get carried away. . .

186
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,485
Hello

187
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:05,293
Hello

188
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:07,388
Help. . .

189
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,993
Help. . .

190
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,797
Help. . .

191
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:17,707
Who’s this?

192
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,202
Help. . .

193
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,458
What is this. . .

194
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,637
The Forbidden Room

195
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,210
Taguchi?

196
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:37,945
What happened, Taguchi. . .

197
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,980
What?

198
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,218
What am I saying?

199
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:09,152
What happened to Yabe?

200
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,696
Try his house?

201
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,027
No answer

202
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:16,731
Huh. . .

203
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,467
I hope nothing’s wrong

204
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,602
0h no, what’s he up to?

205
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,904
I' ve got to go see him

206
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,107
No! Don’t go!

207
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:38,151
Nothing strange has happened yet

208
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:40,650
Yeah. . .

209
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,153
Let’s just act normal

210
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:47,092
Yeah. at least for today

211
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:08,885
Sorry, I’m late

212
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:10,785
Sure, sure

213
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,254
Hey!

214
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:25,166
What’s going on?

215
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,737
Who cares. . .

216
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:42,165
What do I do now?

217
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,298
Click it,

218
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,703
and bookmark it

219
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,976
Doesn’t work

220
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:53,949
If that doesn’t work,
press the print screen key

221
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,354
There

222
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:58,567
Hi

223
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:00,973
You’re the one. . .

224
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,438
Um. . .

225
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,913
Kawashima

226
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:07,518
Kawashima

227
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:08,914
Yeah, Kawashima

228
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:12,051
I’m Karasawa Harue

229
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,954
Haruesan, Haruesan

230
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,764
How’d it go?

231
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:25,695
Well. it came back again

232
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:26,963
Really?

233
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:28,429
Yeah

234
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,271
And,

235
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:35,637
I pressed that
print screen key. . .

236
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,414
Right

237
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,851
Can I come over and check it out?

238
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:47,651
Yeah, sure, absolutely fine

239
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,917
I just need a minute

240
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,152
Um. . .

241
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,157
What’s this?

242
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:28,197
That? Something we programmed here

243
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:33,437
If two dots get too close,
they die,

244
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:41,068
Huh. . . what’s it for?

245
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:49,379
A miniature model of our world. . .

246
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:55,823
But only the grad student
who des igned it understands it

247
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,642
I wouldn’t. . .

248
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:18,477
Suggest staring at it too long

249
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,192
Sorry, it’s a mess

250
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,055
Thank you

251
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,902
There you go

252
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:46,442
Thank you

253
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,338
Getting the data?

254
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,244
Yeah, almost set

255
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:22,408
What got you started
on the internet?

256
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:26,677
Nothing in particular. . .

257
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:30,351
You don’t like computers, right?

258
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:31,546
No

259
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,121
Wanted to connect with other people?

260
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:41,592
Maybe. . . I don’t really know

261
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,459
Everybody else is into it

262
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:49,301
People don’t really connect,
you know

263
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:50,633
What?

264
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,776
Like those dots simulating humans

265
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,514
We all live totally separately

266
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:05,379
That’s how it seems to me

267
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,122
Oh. . . Huh. . .

268
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,425
I wonder. . .

269
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:24,172
Yabe. . .

270
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:31,246
Kudosan

271
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:32,516
Yes

272
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,552
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?

273
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:39,283
Yes

274
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:52,565
Um, boss. . .

275
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:53,728
Yes?

276
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:57,138
Isn’t Yabe acting strange?

277
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,041
You think so?

278
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,471
Can I go check on him?

279
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,544
Fine, but. . .

280
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:08,277
It might be a waste of time

281
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:15,956
Words said in friendship with
the best of intentions

282
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:21,063
always winding up hurting
your friends deeply

283
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:24,866
And then you wind up getting hurt

284
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,772
Is friendship always that way?

285
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,768
If that’s so, what’s left?

286
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,079
If I were you. . .

287
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:46,150
Who needs friends like that

288
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:51,058
A courageous choice in itself

289
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,950
Are you 0K?

290
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:20,082
Did something happen?

291
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,705
Both Junco and I,

292
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,504
are really worried

293
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:45,146
I saw. . .

294
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,517
A face. . .

295
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,247
What?

296
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,917
A horrible face. . .

297
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,487
I' ve never seen anything like it. . .

298
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,264
What are you saying?
What did you see?

299
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,369
The Forbidden Room

300
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:09,337
Forbidden Room?
What’s that?

301
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,735
Is that. . .

302
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:18,973
The room with the red tape?

303
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:20,845
Don’t dare go in there !

304
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,052
Please,

305
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:30,558
tell me

306
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,521
What happened?

307
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:43,972
I' m cold

308
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:52,214
Yabe. . .

309
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,678
Are you 0K?

310
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:47,186
Exit

311
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,639
Harue

312
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,303
Hi

313
00:45:37,948 --> 00:45:41,247
I don’t really use
the library much

314
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,649
Couldn’t find the way out

315
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:50,187
Phantoms

316
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,491
You reading this?

317
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,292
Yeah

318
00:45:57,101 --> 00:45:59,831
Is it related to your
work in the lab?

319
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:03,632
Yeah

320
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:05,706
Huh. . .

321
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,077
Do you have a minute?

322
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:14,580
What? Sure

323
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:17,015
Come

324
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,906
Isn’t it strange?

325
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,608
Yeah. . . sort of. . .

326
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,781
Almost like ghosts, right?

327
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,288
You’re right, they’re like ghosts

328
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:02,899
Sometimes, these turn up

329
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,468
At first, they look
like the other dots

330
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:09,704
What are they?

331
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:12,108
I don’t know

332
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:15,305
A bug?

333
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,040
No

334
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,531
That website. . .

335
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:38,962
What?

336
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:43,571
Oh, what happened with that?

337
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:46,067
Nothing. . . yet. . .

338
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:47,969
Huh. . .

339
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:50,807
But I think they’re related. . .

340
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:55,475
I’m sure they’re related

341
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,019
You think?

342
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,165
Let me know if anything happens

343
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:14,771
Yeah, sure

344
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,840
Karasawasan

345
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,681
I need you to check this

346
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,045
Yes

347
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,644
And you are?

348
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,980
My friend, Kawashima

349
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:35,418
Huh. . .

350
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,424
The grad student, Yoshizakisan

351
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:39,563
Hello

352
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:03,715
I forgot to give you my number

353
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:05,450
0h, right

354
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:07,079
Call me, 0K?

355
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:09,255
Right

356
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,860
Anytime, 0K?

357
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:12,155
Yeah

358
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:13,727
Thank you

359
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:23,304
“Everyone dies, therefore there’s no
logical reason for ghost s not to exist”

360
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:28,907
“How many ghosts have. . .”

361
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:32,379
“existed s ince prehistoric times. . . “

362
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,093
Do you see it too?

363
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:02,240
Who is that?

364
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,176
You' ll have to catch him
to find out

365
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:11,246
Start right now;
and you might succeed

366
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:16,990
Have a go?

367
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:19,021
What?

368
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,260
Why don’t you, right now

369
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:10,010
He disappeared

370
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:11,805
I see

371
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:18,047
He must be a student. . .
I don’t know him

372
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:22,985
Maybe you' re right
Sorry I encouraged you

373
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:25,354
See you

374
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,155
Wait a minute

375
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:36,406
Just what was that?

376
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:55,718
I’m cold. . .

377
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:14,074
The spirit. . .

378
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:18,612
Or consciousness, the soul,
whatever you want to call it,

379
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:22,979
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity

380
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:28,486
Whether that capac ity
accommodates billions or trillions,

381
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,724
eventually, it will run out of space

382
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:36,129
0nce it’s filled to the brim,

383
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,097
it’s got to overf low
somehow, somewhere

384
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,505
But where?

385
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:47,209
The soul s have no choice

386
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:50,745
but to ooze into another realm,
that is to say, our world

387
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,674
Maybe, at first. . .

388
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:58,115
it started with something
really simple

389
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,711
0nce that realm
reached critical mass,

390
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,805
any device would have sufficed

391
00:53:27,818 --> 00:53:31,549
Thrown it together with
the means and materials at hand

392
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,479
That’s how I see it

393
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:37,520
Excuse me, do you have any tape?

394
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:41,694
Anything’ll do, some tape

395
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,528
How’s this?

396
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:46,728
Thank you

397
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:20,568
After many hours or days,

398
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:24,968
or many weeks,
it finally happens

399
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,522
Through that process,
it spreads around the world

400
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:22,722
But now they' re no longer
the faint presence they began as

401
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,269
You saw one yoursel f

402
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:33,301
I don’t believe your stories

403
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:36,705
Right, sorry, it’s all hypothetical

404
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,285
Thanks for the tea

405
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,546
Are you 0K?

406
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:46,246
Just fine

407
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:49,624
But if this really happened,

408
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,853
there’s no turning back

409
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,798
No mat ter how simple the device,

410
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:02,534
and become permanent

411
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:04,704
In other words,

412
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:42,070
Hello

413
00:56:42,446 --> 00:56:45,415
0h, I see, our boss isn’t there?

414
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:48,577
Yes, I understand

415
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:51,346
If he does stop by,

416
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:54,753
Will you please
ask him to call us?

417
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:58,483
Yes, thank you very much

418
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:05,891
Michi,

419
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:10,703
what do you think’s going on?

420
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:19,605
Why’s everyone disappearing?

421
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:39,168
Oh; hello, this is
Sunny Plant Sales calling

422
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:42,130
Thank you for your business

423
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:46,072
Is our boss there
with you by any chance?

424
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:52,008
Oh, I see. . .
Thank you, and excuse me

425
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:57,845
I’ll go look for him

426
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:00,549
Wait, Junco, wait

427
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:08,095
Yes, hello. . .

428
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,567
Boss?

429
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:16,395
Help

430
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,506
Yabe!

431
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:23,069
Are you Yabe?

432
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:27,716
Yabe!

433
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:39,722
Help me. . .

434
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,501
