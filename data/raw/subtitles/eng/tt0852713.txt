00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:36,768
<i>It aII started 27 years ago:</i>

2
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,535
<i>That's an orphanage:</i>

3
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:42,271
<i>That's me in the basket:</i>
<i>I guess somebody didn't want me:</i>

4
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,836
<i>I hear they did want</i>
<i>the basket back, though:</i>

5
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:46,883
<i>But it was fine in the orphanage:</i>

6
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,077
<i>That's me in the third row:</i>

7
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,881
<i>I wasn't very popuIar:</i>

8
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,548
<i>Of course, everybody wanted to be adopted:</i>

9
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,716
<i>LuckiIy, Iots of famiIies came:</i>

10
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,590
<i>And everybody got to go Iive with a famiIy:</i>

11
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,562
<i>Oh, except me:</i>

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,030
<i>But I tried not to give up hope:</i>

13
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:05,067
<i>Then, one day,</i>

14
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:08,332
<i>something magicaI happened,</i>
<i>just Iike out of a fairy taIe:</i>

15
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,396
<i>Do you remember the one</i>
<i>where the woIf huffed and puffed</i>

16
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:12,168
<i>and bIew the piggies' house down?</i>

17
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:15,234
<i>And he was wearing a gIass sIipper,</i>
<i>I think, and he had a pumpkin?</i>

18
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:17,177
<i>PIus there was that other thing?</i>

19
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>WeII, the same thing happened to me,</i>

20
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,015
<i>onIy vastIy different:</i>

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,518
<i>I changed:</i>

22
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:27,079
<i>And the next thing you know,</i>
<i>peopIe seemed to Iike me for once:</i>

23
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,557
<i>And then pictures were taken,</i>
<i>and suddenIy I found the famiIy</i>

24
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,218
<i>I aIways wanted:</i>

25
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:35,194
<i>Oh, I forgot to teII you, my name is SheIIey:</i>

26
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,460
<i>Now I Iive in the PIayboy Mansion:</i>

27
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:41,698
<i>And this is where I want to Iive</i>

You guys have to try one of these<i>:</i>
Marvin makes the best margaritas<i>:</i>

35
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:24,040

00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,115
-SheIIey<i>:</i>

She<i>'</i>s onIy been here for a few months,

43
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,266
but everybody Ioves her,
because she<i>'</i>s super-beautifuI

44
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:48,702
and she never throws up on anybody
when she<i>'</i>s drunk<i>:</i>

45
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,041
So, SheIIey, are you a centerfoId?

46
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:56,305

I<i>'</i>ve got my <i>''</i>turn ons<i>''</i> aII ready

50
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,119
Being a centerfoId is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is<i>:</i>

51
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:15,196
It says,
<i>''</i>I<i>'</i>m naked in the middIe of a magazine<i>:</i>

52
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:17,963
<i>''</i>UnfoId me<i>:''</i>

Oh, my God<i>:</i>

64
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,943
Good morning, SheIIey<i>:</i>

00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,141
Rise and shine, sweetheart<i>:</i>

66
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,520

Your bIueberry French toast is ready<i>:</i>

69
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>Ooh-Ia-Ia:</i>

70
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,659
That<i>'</i>s French, right?

71
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:04,495
Yeah, but more important than the food,

72
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,899
I actuaIIy added something
to your orange juice<i>:</i>

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,303
Oh, Marvin,
thank you so much for teIIing me<i>:</i>

74
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,603
UsuaIIy I don<i>'</i>t find out untiI much Iater<i>:</i>

75
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:16,167
Oh, no<i>:</i> To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vaniIIa extract,

76
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:20,273
then, of course, some egg yoIks,
and then, I have a secret ingredient<i>:</i>

77
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,910
AII right, you twisted my arm,
it<i>'</i>s chiIi powder<i>:</i>

78
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:27,980
Yeah<i>:</i> It just expIodes your taste buds,
so the drink just enveIops your mouth<i>:</i>

79
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:30,685
Oh, I Iove having my mouth enveIoped<i>:</i>

80
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,727
What<i>'</i>s that?

81
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,865
Is this from Hef? Is this my birthday gift?

82
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:39,902
Oh, Pooter, is it finaIIy happening?
Am I Miss November?

83
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,460
That<i>'</i>s what I wished for
when I bIew out my candIe<i>:</i>

84
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,064
Oh, my gosh, I just toId you my wish<i>:</i>
Now it won<i>'</i>t come true<i>:</i>

85
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,939

I didn<i>'</i>t mean to teII, it just came out<i>:</i>

86
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,070
My teeth couIdn<i>'</i>t stop it<i>:</i>

87
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,343
I take it aII back, I take it aII back<i>:</i>

88
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,144
Okay, I<i>'</i>m ready<i>:</i>

00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,082

92
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,767
Move out?

93

<i>''</i>You have two hours to coIIect

<i>''</i>AII my Iove, Hef<i>:''</i>

95
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:30,448
Hef<i>'</i>s kicking me out?

96
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,446
Why wouId he do that?

97
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:36,185
This is my home<i>:</i> This is my famiIy<i>:</i>

98
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,594
I hate to say this, SheIIey,
but maybe it<i>'</i>s because of your age<i>:</i>

99
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,825
But I<i>'</i>m 27<i>:</i>

100
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,028
Yeah, but that<i>'</i>s 59 in Bunny years<i>:</i>

00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:52,500
But I just turned 27 Iast night<i>:</i>

Where is he?

110

I don<i>'</i>t think he<i>'</i>s that good with goodbyes<i>:</i>

111
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,561
Why is this aII happening?

112
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,271
Where<i>'</i>s my pink Prius?

113
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,875
The Prius actuaIIy beIongs to the company<i>:</i>
This is the car you came here with<i>:</i>

114
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,209

142
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,618
because I used to be a PIayboy Bunny,

143
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:26,992
because I<i>'</i>m 59 years oId?

150
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,785
You tried to do what?

151
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,119
To a cop?

152
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,328
Stupid!

153
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:02,489
I was just doing what he said<i>:</i>

154
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:04,328
He was in a uniform and everything<i>:</i>

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,233
Don<i>'</i>t worry, sweetie<i>:</i>
First-timers onIy get one night<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>II be back on the street seIIing

00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:29,191
AII that heavy makeup

161
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,024
I<i>'</i>m a dude<i>:</i>

162

Oh, weII, you<i>'</i>re good Iike that<i>:</i>

163
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,732
So, did you hear
about the pooI party at Jordan<i>'</i>s?

164
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,437
It was unbeIievabIe<i>:</i>

165
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,843
-Oh, Iast Saturday?
-Yes<i>:</i>

166
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:27,076

167
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,379
-No<i>:</i> ReaIIy?

168
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:30,510
Yeah, mangoritas<i>:</i>

169
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,451
-Jordan<i>'</i>s just so hot<i>:</i>
-I know<i>:</i>

170
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:33,580
So are aII his friends<i>:</i>

171
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:36,181
Yeah, seriousIy,

172
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,887
-No, you have not<i>:</i>
-Yes<i>:</i> Yes, I did<i>:</i>

173
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,553
Two of them, I succeeded<i>:</i>

174
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,622
-ReaIIy?
-It was amazing<i>:</i>

175
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:45,132
Who knew?

176
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,260
I was so excited<i>:</i>

177
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,701
Looks Iike a mini-PIayboy Mansion<i>:</i>

178
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:12,754
-Hi<i>:</i>
-Hi<i>:</i>

179
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:16,655

Yes<i>:</i> I wouId Iike to Iive here, pIease<i>:</i>

182
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:26,273
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to Iive here<i>:</i>

183
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:29,675
-Do you go to this schooI?
-This is a schooI?

184
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,410
Where are the desks?

185
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,980
No<i>:</i> This is a sorority house at a schooI<i>:</i>

186
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:40,113
And you do Iook Iike an oIder,

187
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,090
sIuttier version of the type of girI
we wouId want<i>:</i>

188
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,993
But, I<i>'</i>m sorry, you<i>'</i>re not a student<i>:</i>
It was so nice taIking to you<i>:</i>

189
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:49,588
-But I reaIIy think it<i>'</i>s<i>:::</i>
-So nice<i>:</i>

190
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:56,832
And our piano is from Tuscany<i>:</i>
Very high-end<i>:</i>

191
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:59,841
I beIieve that every detaiI of the house

192
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,639
shouId be a refIection
of the girIs who Iive here<i>:</i>

193
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:05,977
Hi<i>:</i> Do you Iadies go to schooI here, too?

194
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:07,675
Not anymore<i>:</i>

195
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:11,376
We<i>'</i>re the housemothers
of the sororities on campus<i>:</i>

196
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:12,921
That<i>'</i>s so dope<i>:</i>

197
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:15,549
Do you Iive in the houses with the girIs?

198
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,922
Yes<i>:</i>

199
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,961
That<i>'</i>s even dopier<i>:</i>

200
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,390
So, what do housemothers do?

201
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:23,022
We oversee the meaI pIans,

202
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:26,557
chaperone the sociaI events,
make sure the girIs stay out of troubIe<i>:</i>

203
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,231
Oh, my gosh<i>:</i> That<i>'</i>s exactIy
what I used to do back at the Mansion<i>:</i>

204
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,705
Can I be one, too?

205
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:35,870
I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i> This is a sorority, not a brotheI<i>:</i>

206
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:38,778
A brotheI?
Oh, I<i>'</i>m not Iooking to make soup<i>:</i>

207
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,713
I<i>'</i>m Iooking to be Iike you<i>:</i>

00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,808
I wanna be a housemother<i>:</i>

209
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:45,083
We have standards<i>:</i>

210
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:49,557
Standards that you cIearIy do not meet<i>:</i>
But it was nice to meet you<i>:</i>

211
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,083
But I just want to<i>:::</i>

212
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,286
-So nice<i>:</i>

213
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:05,765
Try Zeta<i>:</i> Their Iast housemother was
hospitaIized with haIIucinations<i>:</i>

214
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,138
Awesome<i>:</i>

215
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:10,143
Awesome<i>:</i>

216
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,154
HeIIo?

217
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:37,199
Dean Simmons<i>:</i> PIease, pIease<i>:</i>
We are trying so hard<i>:</i> I promise you<i>:</i>

218
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,934
This seems reaIIy unfair<i>:</i>
And I<i>'</i>m not gonna attack you<i>:</i>

219
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,773
I don<i>'</i>t want you to feeI attacked by aII of us,
so I<i>'</i>m just gonna say <i>''</i>me<i>:''</i>

220
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:45,541
To me, this feeIs reaIIy unfair<i>:</i>

221
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:49,072
NataIie<i>:</i> Look, I feeI the same way you do<i>:</i>

222
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,277
But the fact remains,

223
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,981
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now<i>:</i>

224
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:57,116
And I<i>'</i>m under a Iot of pressure
from other sororities

225
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,387
compIaining that we<i>'</i>re bending
the ruIes for you<i>:</i>

226
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:02,829
By <i>''</i>other sororities,<i>''</i>
do you happen to mean Phi Iota Mu?

227
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:06,061
I reaIIy don<i>'</i>t think
it matters who compIained<i>:</i>

228
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:09,002
NataIie, ruIes are ruIes<i>:</i>

229
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,399
Drama queen<i>:</i>

230
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,104
Oh, I<i>'</i>m sorry I scared you<i>:</i>

231
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,580
Do you think you couId heIp me
out of here, though?

232
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,173
What? Yeah<i>:</i>

233
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,143
Thanks<i>:</i>

234
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,415
I<i>'</i>m so sorry, I think I broke your Z<i>:</i>

235
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:30,289
Oh<i>:</i> No, it<i>'</i>s okay<i>:</i>
It faIIs off, Iike, every time we open the door<i>:</i>

236
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:33,021
WeII, at Ieast you stiII have T and A<i>:</i>

237
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,656
T and an A<i>:</i> Who are you?

238
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,593
My name is SheIIey,
and I<i>'</i>m here to be your housemother<i>:</i>

239
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,675
WeII, it<i>'</i>s nice to meet you, SheIIey<i>:</i>

240
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,678
But, unfortunateIy, he<i>:::</i>

241
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,512
It<i>'</i>s a IittIe too Iate<i>:</i>

242
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,246
We<i>'</i>re about to Iose our charter,
so if we don<i>'</i>t have a house,

243
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,481
we won<i>'</i>t reaIIy be needing a housemother<i>:</i>

244
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,416
WeII, why are they gonna
take your house away?

245
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:10,725
Because we get no pIedges,
and everyone kind of thinks we<i>'</i>re Iosers<i>:</i>

246
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,227
That<i>'</i>s so sad<i>:</i>
Why does everyone eIse get aII the pIedges?

247
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:18,034
WeII, they have great parties, and

248
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,271
boys actuaIIy Iike them<i>:</i>

249
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,512
I<i>'</i>m an expert at parties and boys<i>:</i>
I<i>'</i>m a Bunny<i>:</i>

250
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,049
Men write to me from prison,
sometimes in their own bIood<i>:</i>

251
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:29,982
I mean, I assume it<i>'</i>s theirs, who knows?
I don<i>'</i>t<i>:</i>

252
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:31,178

254
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,182
Wow, a Bunny?

255
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,424
Like a centerfoId?

256
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:43,557
Oh, bIess your heart, no<i>:</i>
Just a coupIe of smaII pictoriaIs,

258
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:51,035
But now I<i>'</i>m a homeIess person<i>:</i>

259
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,938

Wait, but I can reaIIy heIp you guys<i>:</i>

262
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,417
So if we don<i>'</i>t get pIedges,

263
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:05,578
-We need 30<i>:</i>

Oh, nothing a IittIe fertiIizer can<i>'</i>t heIp<i>:</i>

267
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,363
Not you, Tanya<i>:</i>

ActuaIIy, 7 3<i>I</i>4 as of Tuesday Iast week<i>:</i>

269
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,363
Guys, we<i>'</i>re never gonna get
that many pIedges<i>:</i>

270
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,602
This is just their way of shutting us down<i>:</i>

271
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,143
This is awfuI<i>:</i>

272
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,236
Hey, Joanne, just FYI,

-No, you didn<i>'</i>t<i>:</i>
-Did so<i>:</i>

277
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,720
-Why do we need knee-highs?
-Oh, my God<i>:</i>

278
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:48,056

The Leaning Panther<i>:</i> I Iike that<i>:</i> Yoga<i>'</i>s hot<i>:</i>

282
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,436
So, are you a Zeta?

283
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,978
Oh, I wish<i>:</i>

284
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:08,875
Yeah, I do, too, because
Zeta wouId be my new favorite hizzety-hang<i>:</i>

285
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:11,848
WeII, she is not a Zeta,

286
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,555
because she<i>'</i>s our new
hizzety-housemother<i>:</i>

287
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,858
She<i>'</i>II be hizzy-tizzies<i>:::</i>

288
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:21,123
She<i>'</i>II be here aII the time<i>:</i>

289
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,692
You<i>'</i>re hiring me?

290
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,190
Oh, give me some of that<i>:</i>

00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,932

-Why are they acting Iike that?
-Yes<i>:</i>

293
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:36,972
Oh, that<i>'</i>s boys just being boys<i>:</i>

Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy

296
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,182
You are not gonna be sorry<i>:</i>

297
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,660
So this is how we<i>'</i>re gonna get pIedges?

298
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:57,927
Hiring an archaicaIIy superficiaI refIection
of the maIe fantasy?

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,230
WeII, guys Iike her<i>:</i>

300
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:05,273
And since guys don<i>'</i>t Iike us,
I figured she couId heIp<i>:</i>

301
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:10,369
So, in order to be in a sisterhood,
now we have to be popuIar?

302
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:15,076
No, no<i>:</i> In order to keep our house,
though, we do have to be popuIar<i>:</i> Yes<i>:</i>

303
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:18,347
So, I figured SheIIey here couId
teach us how<i>:</i>

304
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,446
Okay, Iook, don<i>'</i>t get me wrong<i>:</i> I Iove guys<i>:</i>

305
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:24,390
But I Iived in a house fiIIed with girIs

306
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,363
and I know that there<i>'</i>s nothing better
than just being with your sisters,

307
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:33,800
sharing, taIking aII night,
painting each other<i>'</i>s bodies,

308
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:38,061
baking penis cookies,
pIaying with monkeys<i>:::</i>

309
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:41,674
-Where<i>'</i>d you Iive?
-The PIayboy Mansion<i>:</i>

310
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:51,510
No, that doesn<i>'</i>t make her a hooker<i>:</i> Sorry<i>:</i>

311
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,952
She<i>'</i>s shy<i>:</i> She<i>'</i>s just<i>:::</i>

312
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:02,995

341
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,407
I don<i>'</i>t think that some
of the girIs in this house

342
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:22,376
have even seen their own bodies naked,

343
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:26,813
so they probabIy don<i>'</i>t reaIIy want
to see your perfectIy engineered boobs<i>:</i>

344
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:31,581
WeII, I<i>'</i>m just waIking around

348
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,328
Okay<i>:</i>

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,801
Oh, we aIso need to raise money

350
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:50,771
What<i>'</i>s a phiIa-canopee?

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,534
Oh, no<i>:</i> It<i>'</i>s a phiIanthropy<i>:</i>

I even Iet Bob Saget grind on me
during a sIow dance<i>:</i>

356
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:09,380
And here<i>'</i>s a Iist of ideas

00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,722
that might make us a IittIe more popuIar<i>:</i>

358
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:15,991
So, pIease take a read<i>:</i>

Because they<i>'</i>re cute and they<i>'</i>re IittIe

368
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:45,286
And aIso, another thing that
I thought of was, you couId dress them up<i>:</i>

369
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,261
It<i>'</i>s the whoIe fun part of it,
is you can put them in IittIe outfits<i>:</i>

370
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,764

I don<i>'</i>t know if you guys can recognize this,
but SheIIey is meeting guys<i>:</i>

490
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,930
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we wiII Iearn how to meet guys<i>:</i>

491
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:04,995
Then more girIs<i>'</i>II wanna hang out with us<i>:</i>
Hence, more pIedges<i>:</i>

Okay, here<i>'</i>s what we need to do<i>:</i>

494
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:12,480
We need to get aII dressed up,
and then we need to go to a cIub

495
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:16,074
and drink fruity drinks
and dirty-dance with each other<i>:</i>

496

You know what I<i>'</i>m saying?

00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:31,530
You know? We couId Iike pIay
some form of dodge baII, maybe<i>:</i>

501
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:37,104
We couId tie our shoes together,
our tennis shoes,

502
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:39,800
and we couId throw them
over teIephone wires<i>:</i>

503
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:40,932
Because I see that everywhere,

504
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,569
and it seems Iike peopIe wouId
have fun doing that<i>:</i>

505
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,670
Like, <i>''</i>How hard can you throw?<i>''</i>

506
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:48,978
You know what I mean? Like how<i>:::</i>
What are you<i>:::</i>

Or we couId go to a cIub<i>:</i>

00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,903
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze<i>:</i>

509

Here<i>'</i>s to Zetas,

-Go fIirt with him<i>:</i>

512
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,081
Think of it as research, Mona<i>:</i> Research<i>:</i>

513
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:29,146
Get over there<i>:</i> Get on that horse!

You Iike what you see, stud?

what I<i>'</i>m Iooking at, metaIface<i>:</i>

517
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,425
Let me guess, is it a HannibaI Lecter thing?

518
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,937
Yeah, it is<i>:</i>

519
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:52,805
There<i>'</i>s a big box of cutesicIes<i>:</i>

520
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,576
Carrie Mae, go work your magic<i>:</i>

521
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,776
The onIy magic I<i>'</i>ve ever done
was try to figure out a way

522
00:31:56,851 --> 00:32:00,981
to stay in coIIege for nine years
and not go back to my traiIer park in Idaho<i>:</i>

523
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:03,957
So, figure out a way into his heart<i>:</i>

524
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:07,859
Just go over there
and taIk to him about any oId thing<i>:</i>

525
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,601
Excuse me, you know where the crapper is?

526
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:17,263
I have to drop off some timber<i>:</i>

527
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,574
Go away<i>:</i>

528
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,775
What<i>'</i>d I do?

529
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,279
It<i>'</i>s okay<i>:</i> It<i>'</i>s just, Carrie Mae, sometimes

530
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:30,181
men Iike their women
with a IittIe bit of mystery<i>:</i>

531
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,220
So, get back over there and try it again<i>:</i>

532
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:39,559
Excuse me<i>:</i>

533
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:41,762
You know where the crapper is?

534
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,856
I have to do a very mysterious thing
in there<i>:</i>

535
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,368
Drop off some timber<i>:</i>

536
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,603
I<i>'</i>m definiteIy not drunk enough for that<i>:</i>

537
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:58,710
WeII, this is good, though<i>:</i>

<i>Next up, the Zetas?</i>

567
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,465
<i>Singing</i> Like A Virgin<i>:</i>

568
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:38,268
<i>I made it through the wiIderness</i>

569
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:42,178
<i>Somehow I made it through</i>

570
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:49,283
<i>Didn't know how Iost I was</i>
<i>UntiI I found you</i>

571
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:54,723

573
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,164
<i>But you made me feeI</i>

574
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:05,972
<i>Yeah, you made me feeI</i>

575
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,670
<i>Like a big bag of poop</i>

576
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>Like a Ioser</i>

577
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:18,010
<i>We're rejected aII the time</i>

578
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:22,919
<i>Like a Ioser</i>

579
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,927
<i>Who's so retarded, it's a crime</i>

580
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:28,792

581
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,638
That was not nice<i>:</i>

582
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:42,838
Awesome<i>:</i>

583
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,902
You wanna get cut, bitch?

584
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:47,914
Oh, cIassy<i>:</i> Very cIassy<i>:</i>

585
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:52,078
No, no, no, no, she<i>'</i>s right, Courtney<i>:</i>
I mean, we shouId apoIogize<i>:</i>

586
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:54,053
EspeciaIIy since we<i>'</i>re
about to take their house<i>:</i>

587
00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:56,682
-Oh, right<i>:</i>
-Where are you taking it?

588
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,420
WeII, we heard that you were
Iosing your charter,

589
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:03,760
so Phi Iota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on saIe after rush<i>:</i>

590
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:08,234
Yes, we are going to have so many pIedges,
we<i>'</i>II need aII of the extra space<i>:</i>

591
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:09,702
Oh, but don<i>'</i>t worry<i>:</i>

592
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:12,899
I mean, we<i>'</i>II stiII Iet you guys stay on
and be the maids<i>:</i>

593
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:16,705
You can sweep the chimney<i>:</i>
Won<i>'</i>t that be nice?

594
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,643
Does the IittIe one understand human taIk?

595
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,580
Oh, and I guess
that when we buy your house,

596
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:23,549
you<i>'</i>II go back to being homeIess<i>:</i>

597
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:24,812
I<i>'</i>m a housemother<i>:</i>

598
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:28,378
A Zeta housemother, and I don<i>'</i>t Iike
some of the things you were saying<i>:</i>

599
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:31,892
Because they do understand human taIk,
and you hurt their feeIings<i>:</i>

600
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,951
Oh, SheIIey, come on<i>:</i>
It<i>'</i>s not worth it, Iet<i>'</i>s go<i>:</i>

601
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:35,495
Yeah, you shouId go<i>:</i>

602
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,894
It was so nice to see you<i>:</i>

603
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:37,954
But I reaIIy think that<i>:::</i>

604
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:39,192
-So nice<i>:</i>
-So nice<i>:</i>

605
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:43,428
That was so humiIiating, you guys<i>:</i>

606
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:44,698
I know it was awfuI<i>:</i>

607
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:47,366
And I am so mad
that they did that to you guys,

608
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,843
but we can<i>'</i>t Iisten to those girIs<i>:</i>

609
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:53,813
Why? They<i>'</i>re right<i>:</i> We are Iosers<i>:</i>

610
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,872
Oh, we<i>'</i>re not Iosers<i>:</i>

611
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:58,850
You just ignore that dumb oId waII<i>:</i>

612
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:04,049
WeII, you<i>'</i>re not a Ioser, SheIIey<i>:</i>
PeopIe Iike you<i>:</i> You<i>'</i>re pretty<i>:</i>

613
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,117
I just don<i>'</i>t understand
that kind of behavior<i>:</i>

614
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,228
Trust me<i>:</i>

615
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:13,734
You guys, I can make you way hotter
than any oId Phi Iota Mu<i>:</i>

616
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:18,971
By the time I<i>'</i>m done,
every girI on campus<i>'</i>II want to pIedge Zeta<i>:</i>

617
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,941
No, reaIIy, we are just a bunch of misfits<i>:</i>

618
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:27,403
LiIIy just texted me from the cIoset<i>:</i>
She says we<i>'</i>re not misfits<i>:</i>

619
00:37:27,482 --> 00:37:29,074
WeII, I hope she was being ironic<i>:</i>

620
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:31,985
Go, go, go, go, go!

621
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:33,213
-Are we doing this?
-Do it!

622
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:34,914
-AII right<i>:</i>
-Here<i>:</i>

623
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,854
You can do this<i>:</i>

624
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:40,917
If I thought you aII were quitting<i>:::</i>
My heart wouId just faII out of my head<i>:</i>

625
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:43,327
SheIIey, your heart is not in your head<i>:</i>

626
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:46,993
Your heart has its own cavity<i>:</i>
Right under your fake boobs<i>:</i>

627
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,695
Do you understand how moronic you sound

628
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,762
when you say
your heart is gonna faII out of your head?

629
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,329
WeII, Mona,

630
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:57,969
I totaIIy understand
why that saying sounds mixed-up,

631
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:00,310
but I don<i>'</i>t mean it for reaI<i>:</i>

632
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:03,748
I don<i>'</i>t think that my heart is in my skuII<i>:</i>

633
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:08,812
What I mean is that sometimes
Iogic teIIs you to do something,

634
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,348
but you have to have part
of your heart in it as weII<i>:</i>

635
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:17,924
My head and my heart teII me
that we can save Zeta<i>:</i>

636
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,969
We need 30 pIedges,
and I know just how to do it<i>:</i>

637
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:28,330
By making you guys
the hottest girIs on campus<i>:</i>

638
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:35,548
I<i>'</i>II get it<i>:</i>

639
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,882
-Does that say <i>''</i>Zeta<i>''</i>?
-Yeah<i>:</i>

640
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,226
This is war<i>:</i>

641
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,887
Enough is enough<i>:</i>

642
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:52,160
Let<i>'</i>s do this<i>:</i> There<i>'</i>s no way
those bitches are getting our house<i>:</i>

643
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:09,405
Okay, Iadies,
dressing sexy is aII about skimpIifying<i>:</i>

644
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:12,783
I want you to show skin
in the four major regions<i>:</i>

645
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:16,017
Arms, Iegs, beIIy and cIeavage<i>:</i>

646
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,455
Is this how you skimpIify?

647
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:21,222
Oh, okay<i>:</i> WeII, maybe we couId Iet
someone who doesn<i>'</i>t have a giant baby

648
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,024
in their beIIy give it a try<i>:</i>

649
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:27,659
Okay, this is your most important
secret weapon, the water bra<i>:</i>

650
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,794
Just stay away from sharp corners<i>:</i>

651
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:31,805
This is going too far<i>:</i>

652
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,137
No<i>:</i> No way<i>:</i> No<i>:</i>

653
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:38,239
Just consider it Iike another thesis topic,
you know?

654
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:41,748
<i>''</i>ConventionaI Archetypes of Beauty
and Their Effect on the Opposite Sex<i>:''</i>

655
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:49,917
Are you sure that<i>'</i>s everything?

656
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:54,690
Because feeIing good on the inside
is aII about Iooking good on the outside<i>:</i>

657
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,264
Go ahead and keep that one<i>:</i>

658
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:05,430
There are three ruIes to successfuI fIirtation<i>:</i>

659
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:08,907
Eye contact, fIattery and Iots of touching<i>:</i>

660
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:12,207
For exampIe,
Iet<i>'</i>s pretend that NataIie here is a man<i>:</i>

661
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,148
I<i>'</i>m touching his arm,
I<i>'</i>m Iooking deep into his eyes

662
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:18,742
and I<i>'</i>m wearing deodorant<i>:</i> Carrie Mae?

663
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:20,081
I know<i>:</i>

664
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:22,645
And I might say something Iike this<i>:</i>

665
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:26,784
<i>''</i>Oh, my gosh<i>:</i>
Your biceps are huge<i>:</i> Kiss me<i>:''</i>

666
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:31,024
And then he wouId kiss me<i>:</i>
So, any questions?

667
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,464
What do I do with my chew?

668
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,899
How Iong wouId the kiss usuaIIy be?

669
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:38,200
And, aIso, why wouId he kiss you,
because you<i>:::</i>

670
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:45,503
Okay, Iadies, today<i>'</i>s Iesson is makeup<i>:</i>

671
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,276
First, we must highIight your eyes<i>:</i>

672
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,216
The eyes are the nippIes of the face<i>:</i>

673
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,899
Whoa<i>:</i>

674
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:49,668
Wow<i>:</i>

675
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:52,779
So this is what it feeIs Iike
to not be invisibIe<i>:</i>

676
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:56,476
We weren<i>'</i>t exactIy invisibIe before,
just the anti-hot<i>:</i>

677
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,215
Check out Joanne<i>:</i>

Kind of Iike a coming-out party<i>:</i>
So we are gonna take some pictures<i>:</i>

683
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:13,964
Oh, we are not posing for <i>PIayboy:</i>

00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:17,732

713
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,282
Yes, and it doesn<i>'</i>t stop there<i>:</i>

because I was about to try
and organize a dance cIass<i>:</i>

719
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:30,927

And I was at the top of the Iist
not signing up<i>:</i>

721

And that<i>'</i>s not the onIy thing I Iike<i>:</i>

942
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:17,754
No? You have a wide range of interests?

943
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:21,990
Oh, yes<i>:</i> A big range<i>:</i>

944
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:26,696
Oh, wait here for a second<i>:</i>

945
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:29,792
I think I dropped some money

946
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:32,463
I just don<i>'</i>t know wherever couId it be<i>:</i>

947
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:35,372
Maybe it<i>'</i>s over here by this manhoIe<i>:</i>

948
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:40,346
That<i>'</i>s fucking hot!

949
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:46,517
I just went over there to Iook for my money

950
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:49,419
which I had dropped the other day<i>:</i>

951
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:53,220
I think it was a doIIar coin,
because I heard a cIanging<i>:</i>

952
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,622
But anyway, wow<i>:</i>

953
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,589
Who knew steam can be hot?

954
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:01,557
Yeah, that<i>'</i>s<i>:::</i>

955
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:04,125
I wonder what they did
when MariIyn Monroe did it<i>:</i>

956
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:09,198
They probabIy added soothing botanicaIs
to the steam rising from the manhoIe<i>:</i>

957
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:10,936
I Iike that word<i>:</i>

958
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,477
<i>''</i>ManhoIe<i>:''</i>

959
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,605
AII right<i>:</i> What can I get you guys?

960
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:22,888
Instead of the mahi-mahi,
may I just get the one mahi,

961
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:25,220
because I<i>'</i>m not that hungry?

962
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:27,290

970
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:51,842
-I Iike to rhyme<i>:</i>
-Yeah?

971

I<i>'</i>d show you,

973
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,094
I mean, it<i>'</i>s just a siIIy oId butt

974
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:11,202
Yep<i>:</i>

I hope it doesn<i>'</i>t go straight to my butt<i>:</i>

976
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:21,176
I mean, I think my butt wouId stiII

01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:24,072
Yep<i>:</i> My ass<i>:</i>

01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:26,912
Oh, weII, this has been fun,

but we shouId probabIy wrap it up,
because I<i>'</i>ve got another date at 1 1 <i>:</i>

980
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:33,149
Are you serious?

981

-How<i>'</i>d it go?
-How<i>'</i>d it go, SheIIey?

991
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:13,328

-What?
-Why?

993
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:17,269
I don<i>'</i>t think he Iikes me<i>:</i>

994
01:02:17,337 --> 01:02:19,965
He didn<i>'</i>t faII for any of my tricks<i>:</i>

995
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:23,298
That<i>'</i>s impossibIe, your tricks aIways work<i>:</i>

996
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:27,870
I did sexy, I did <i>''</i>other guys want me<i>:''</i>

997
01:02:27,947 --> 01:02:30,882
You know, I worked every angIe in the book<i>:</i>

998
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,578
But I don<i>'</i>t know, he just stared<i>:</i>

999
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,945
What if OIiver is one of those guys

1000
01:02:37,023 --> 01:02:40,186
who wants to have, Iike, a conversation
with a girI before he hooks up with her?

1001
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,557
He<i>'</i>s gay?

1002
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:43,991
No, he<i>'</i>s not gay<i>:</i>

1003

Oh, I don<i>'</i>t know<i>:</i>

01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:54,569
I<i>'</i>m just saying, you know,
maybe he wants to taIk first<i>:</i>

1005
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:57,633
What if OIiver doesn<i>'</i>t mind a smart girI?

1006
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:00,369
-I know<i>:</i>
-Wait<i>:</i>

1007
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:05,280
So I have to Iearn things

About topics?

1009

-Can I even do that?
-Yeah<i>:</i> You can do that<i>:</i>

1010
01:03:12,025 --> 01:03:14,220
You can do anything

01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:35,035
But you can<i>'</i>t even teII I have boobs<i>:</i>

WeII, don<i>'</i>t you think I shouId show him
a IittIe something?

1013
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:39,943
Give him a IittIe phiIanthropy?

1014
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:43,005
SheIIey, good job<i>:</i>
You used <i>''</i>phiIanthropy<i>:''</i> That was fun<i>:</i>

1015
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:45,983
You know what? You<i>'</i>re stiII too sexy<i>:</i>

01:04:46,052 --> 01:04:48,020
Nat, what if she wears your gIasses?

That<i>'</i>s actuaIIy how I got those gIasses<i>:</i>

1021
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,830
So have you caIIed OIiver yet?

1022
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:06,133
Yes<i>:</i> He didn<i>'</i>t seem too excited
to be going out on a second date,

1023
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:09,265
but he said yes, so here goes<i>:</i>

1024

1025
01:05:12,845 --> 01:05:15,177
-Don<i>'</i>t use the word <i>''</i>eIucidate<i>:''</i>
-Pretty much entireIy different<i>:</i>

1026
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,045
-You know what I<i>'</i>m taIking about?
-Tone down the sexuaIity<i>:</i>

1027
01:05:17,116 --> 01:05:19,914
TaIk about poIitics and reIigion<i>:</i>
That<i>'</i>s aIways a reaIIy good first-date topic<i>:</i>

1028
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:22,420
-Don<i>'</i>t stare at him too much<i>:</i>
-Don<i>'</i>t brush your teeth<i>:</i>

1029
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:23,819
-Bye, SheII<i>:</i>
-Bye<i>:</i>

01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:27,348

-Say you<i>'</i>re nauseous<i>:</i>

1031
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:32,594
A nucIear nonproIiferation treaty
shouId ease tension in Asia<i>:</i>

1032
01:05:32,665 --> 01:05:35,099
WeII, that<i>'</i>s my thought<i>:</i>

1033
01:05:35,168 --> 01:05:37,602
-Are you okay? With your<i>:::</i>
-Oh, yes<i>:</i>

1034

WeII, you seem to know a Iot
about North Korea and the MiddIe East<i>:</i>

1037
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:50,846
It sounds Iike you reaIIy read the paper<i>:</i>

01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:55,183
Oh, aII the time<i>:</i>
I am just nuts about the paper<i>:</i>

1039
01:05:55,254 --> 01:05:59,281
So, have you given any thought

1040
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,121
I<i>'</i>m not sure yet<i>:</i>

He is just so mean<i>:</i>

U<i>:</i>S<i>:</i>A<i>:</i> for short<i>:</i>

No<i>:</i> Index<i>:::</i> They<i>'</i>re napkins<i>:</i>

They<i>'</i>re not index cards

01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:24,800
Let me get some more napkins<i>:</i>

01:07:24,877 --> 01:07:27,368
That<i>'</i>s okay, reaIIy<i>:</i> I think<i>:::</i>

Why wouId SheIIey just Ieave?

It<i>'</i>s for the best<i>:</i> She wasn<i>'</i>t happy<i>:</i>

I used to hear her crying

Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

1087
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:55,891
What have I done to poor SheIIey?

1088

And I never taIked to a boy before<i>:</i>
You know?

01:20:04,036 --> 01:20:06,596
And he distracted me<i>:</i> Just for a minute<i>:</i>

1293
01:20:06,672 --> 01:20:09,004
And then I saw him taIking to AshIey<i>:</i>

What bird?

1319
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,681
Marvin caIIed us<i>:</i> I thought<i>:::</i>

1320
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,387
We didn<i>'</i>t think you Iiked us anymore<i>:</i>

1321

Oh, my gosh, no<i>:</i> I<i>'</i>ve missed you so much<i>:</i>

01:21:44,469 --> 01:21:46,835
Oh, I<i>'</i>ve missed you guys so much<i>:</i>

1325
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,736
You<i>'</i>re the best housemother

01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:57,639
So, how<i>'</i>d the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pIedges?

1330
01:21:57,716 --> 01:22:01,083
Zeta had a ton of peopIe interested,
don<i>'</i>t get me wrong<i>:</i> Thanks to you<i>:</i>

1331
01:22:01,153 --> 01:22:04,281
But nobody showed up
because AshIey stoIe aII of our bids<i>:</i>

1332
01:22:04,356 --> 01:22:07,018
No<i>:</i> So the house is gone?

1333
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,389
They<i>'</i>II make it officiaI today

1334
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,190
at the PanheIIenic CounciI meeting
this afternoon<i>:</i>

1335
01:22:11,263 --> 01:22:13,060
So there<i>'</i>s stiII a chance<i>:</i>

1336
01:22:13,131 --> 01:22:14,155
SheIIey, it<i>'</i>s too Iate<i>:</i>

1337
01:22:14,232 --> 01:22:16,666
I mean, I don<i>'</i>t think there<i>'</i>s anything
that we can do<i>:</i>

1338
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:19,863
NataIie! Together we can do anything!

1339
01:22:21,139 --> 01:22:23,835
<i>Today's meeting is tinged with sadness:</i>

1340
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:28,972
<i>UnfortunateIy, not aII of us wiII be</i>
<i>returning next year:</i>

1341
01:22:29,848 --> 01:22:34,876
<i>Yes, that's true: So with that said,</i>
<i>that brings us to our Iast order of business:</i>

1342
01:22:36,888 --> 01:22:38,219
Stop!

1343
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,450
Oh, dear<i>:</i>

1344
01:22:39,524 --> 01:22:41,617
We<i>'</i>re here to save our house<i>:</i>

1345
01:22:41,693 --> 01:22:45,322
I don<i>'</i>t know how this
big meeting stuff works, but I just<i>:::</i>

1346
01:22:45,397 --> 01:22:46,921
<i>Enough with the freak show:</i>

1347
01:22:46,998 --> 01:22:50,900
<i>What I was saying,</i>
<i>before I was so rudeIy interrupted, is that:::</i>

1348
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:52,960
HoId on! Wait<i>:</i>

1349
01:22:56,141 --> 01:22:58,200
I have something to say<i>:</i>

1350
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:08,251
SheIIey, say something<i>:</i>

1351
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,049
I<i>'</i>m aIIergic to erythromycin<i>:</i>

1352
01:23:10,122 --> 01:23:14,183
<i>Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons:</i>
<i>Enough is enough: Do something:</i>

1353
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:18,423
<i>SheIIey? The counciI has come here today</i>
<i>to reaIIy finaIize this, so:::</i>

1354
01:23:18,497 --> 01:23:22,991
No! No! This is germane to our predicament<i>:</i>

1355
01:23:23,068 --> 01:23:27,471
<i>Oh, weII, as Iong as it's germane:</i>
<i>PIease continue:</i>

1356
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:29,530
Just give her a minute<i>:</i>

1357
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:34,310
I<i>'</i>m aIIergic to erythromycin<i>:</i>

1358
01:23:35,647 --> 01:23:39,845
I took it once when I had a coId<i>:</i>
I was 16, and it gave me itching<i>:</i>

1359
01:23:40,585 --> 01:23:44,783
I mean, everything itched<i>:</i>
My Iegs, my arms, my earIobes<i>:</i>

1360
01:23:44,856 --> 01:23:48,019
And other stuff, too, but I can<i>'</i>t say,
because I<i>'</i>m Iive on the air right now,

1361
01:23:48,093 --> 01:23:50,493
and you can<i>'</i>t say <i>''</i>ass cheeks,<i>''</i> right?

1362
01:23:50,562 --> 01:23:52,052
<i>You just did:</i>

1363
01:23:52,764 --> 01:23:55,562
But I said it kind of quietIy, I think<i>:</i>

1364
01:23:57,602 --> 01:24:02,665
But besides the itching,
the erythromycin aIso made my skin gIow<i>:</i>

1365
01:24:03,642 --> 01:24:06,406
It gave me, Iike, this gIowing tan<i>:</i>

1366
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:09,311
And I suddenIy feIt Iike another person<i>:</i>

1367
01:24:09,948 --> 01:24:11,381
Different<i>:</i>

1368
01:24:12,117 --> 01:24:13,448
Better<i>:</i>

1369
01:24:14,186 --> 01:24:16,484
Prettier, I guess<i>:</i>

1370
01:24:16,555 --> 01:24:19,149
-What<i>'</i>s your name?
-MicheIIe<i>:</i>

1371
01:24:19,925 --> 01:24:21,051
MicheIIe<i>:</i>

1372
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:23,889
MicheIIe, do you know that feeIing
that I<i>'</i>m taIking about?

1373
01:24:23,962 --> 01:24:25,156
Where you suddenIy feeI pretty

1374
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,858
and, next thing you know,
you feeI better about yourseIf?

1375
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:30,333
WeII, that was what was happening to me<i>:</i>

1376
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:33,667
My aIIergic reaction made me feeI pretty,

1377
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:38,573
and so I ignored aII the bad side effects,
because suddenIy peopIe were taIking to me

1378
01:24:38,643 --> 01:24:40,508
and they were noticing me<i>:</i>

1379
01:24:40,579 --> 01:24:43,673
And even though I was itching Iike crazy,

1380
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:46,546
it was worth it to feeI accepted<i>:</i>

1381
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:51,785
And so I couIdn<i>'</i>t wait to get a coId
so I couId take my erythromycin<i>:</i>

1382
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:59,160
But underneath that beautifuI, gIowing skin,
I stiII had that coId<i>:</i>

1383
01:25:00,799 --> 01:25:03,267
WeII, that<i>'</i>s a meteor<i>:</i>

1384
01:25:04,302 --> 01:25:06,236
<i>The word is ''Metaphor: ''</i>

1385
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:09,433
<i>Can you reaIIy be that dumb?</i>

1386
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:12,142
She<i>'</i>s not dumb<i>:</i>

1387
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:14,641
Thank you, NataIie<i>:</i>

1388
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:19,778
And, Mrs<i>:</i> Hagstrom, I meant <i>''</i>Meteor<i>:''</i>

1389
01:25:20,986 --> 01:25:24,513
It fIashes by and burns bright,
but then it disappears<i>:</i>

1390
01:25:25,557 --> 01:25:28,458
And that was what was happening to me<i>:</i>

1391
01:25:28,526 --> 01:25:30,960
The reaI me just disappeared<i>:</i>

1392
01:25:32,497 --> 01:25:34,488
<i>Is anyone buying this?</i>

1393
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:37,899
I am not an expert speech-giver<i>:</i>

1394
01:25:39,304 --> 01:25:42,967
But I do know that one day,
when your Iooks are gone,

1395

WeII, not perfectIy<i>:</i>

I mean, I messed up things with OIiver

Except this time,
