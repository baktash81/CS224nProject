Adam.

ALL:
White.

200
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,832
White? Who says so?

201
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,500
I never saw that
in the Bible.

202
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,502
Did you see it in the Bible?
No. It doesn't say that.

203
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,504
It says, "God created man
in his own image,"

204
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,174
which means to be like him.

205
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,968
So, what color is God?
Give me a color, people.

206
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,179
{\an5}Gold!

207
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,179
BOY: Pink! Black!

208
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,388
{\an5}Silver!

209
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,388
Green!

210
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,891
Green! Green!
I like green.

211
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:38,020
What kind of green?
Pea green? Sea green?

212
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,189
Grass green? Olive green?

213
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,191
Emerald green?
Jade green?

214
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,526
Green as the dollars
in American wallets,

215
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,072
or green as the mists
on the hills of Kinchasa?

216
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,825
God green, mankind green,
yes! I like it.

217
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,369
So, what is the name

218
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,039
of the first man
in South Africa?

219
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,666
Right, right, right.

220
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,167
Nobody knows his name.

221
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,711
What's the name of
the first white man

222
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,046
in South Africa?

223
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,506
ALL ( in unison ):
Jan van Riebeeck.

224
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,549
{\an5}Date?

225
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,549
ALL: 1652.

226
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,552
History is so beautiful,
it makes you cry.

227
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,805
( laughter and talking )

228
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,933
Here is Holland.

229
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,560
Here comes
Jan van Riebeeck in his boat,

230
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,354
followed by lots
of other boats,

231
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,356
and they're on their way
to the East Indies

232
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,732
to fetch some spices,

233
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,734
but they're passing
South Africa,

234
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
and they know
that they're thirsty,

235
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,238
so they stop here
for a drink.

236
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,200
Jan says, "hey,
why don't I stay here

237
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,035
"and set up
a refreshment stop?

238
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,245
"This way, it will be here

239
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,080
every time you pass by."

240
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,082
Good idea!

241
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,252
So that's what South Africa
is for the whites:

242
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,256
a gas station stop on
the way to somewhere else,

243
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,216
a Pepsi and a piss
in the sun...

244
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,426
( giggles )

245
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
And it's, "let's go, fellas.

246
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,138
We can't stay here forever."

247
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,765
But some of them did. Right?

248
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,143
{\an5}STUDENTS: Right!

249
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,143
Right!

250
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,272
{\an1}You think children
would do a thing like this?

251
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,733
Oh, yes.

252
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,276
{\an1}But why?

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,280
Well, they're being used,
aren't they?

254
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,657
You see, children
will believe anything.

255
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,951
A child will believe anything
an adult tells him--

256
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,078
Father Christmas,
talking animals,

257
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,622
Communism, anything.

258
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,750
To me, a school
is a holy place,

259
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
like a church.

260
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,462
That's why I hate to see
soldiers in this school.

261
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,088
Me too.
Leave the kids out of it.

262
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,133
Let the men
fight it out.

263
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,593
What about the teachers?

264
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,095
Any rotten apples there?

265
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,306
I don't know.

266
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,645
MARY:
So now begins the great trek

267
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,981
of 1836.

268
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,317
The white boys
are looking north.

269
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,818
They say,
"what do you see?"

270
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,071
"We see great land, men,
beautiful land!"

271
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,323
"Anybody there?"

272
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,076
"No. Just a few gaffers

273
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,995
sticking spears up
each other's future."

274
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,997
"So, what do you say
we make a trek?"

275
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,373
"Good idea."

276
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,794
And what does this
bring to us?

277
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,045
Shambucks,

278
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,797
passbooks,

279
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,465
P.W. Botha.

280
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,092
Afrikaans lessons, and--

281
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,807
And democracy and justice

282
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,726
and very, very,
very fine schools, yes.

283
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,728
( laughs )
We're so lucky!

284
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,313
Isn't history beautiful?

285
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,690
ALL ( in unison ):
Yeah!

286
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,985
( chattering )

287
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,171
( indistinct chatter )

288
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,216
{\an5}SARAFINA:
<i>There's this boy</i>
<i>who wants to go out with me.</i>

289
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,051
<i>His name is Crocodile.</i>

290
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,137
<i>He thinks he's great.</i>
<i>But I like him--</i>

291
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,557
<i>Except he burns down schools.</i>

292
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,725
<i>What's the future in that?</i>

293
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
<i>He'll take me to the movies,</i>

294
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,772
<i>and then he'll be</i>
<i>in prison for 20 years.</i>

295
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,901
You don't
go in store.

296
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,444
You stay outside.

297
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,029
You don't hurt anybody.

298
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,573
We hurt
the Boers' business.

299
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,241
Hey! Burn the store.

300
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,368
You want to hurt the Boers'
business, burn it down!

301
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,704
It takes one man
to burn a store.

302
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,206
It takes a thousand
to close it down.

303
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,749
We need thousands!

304
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,252
We want the people awake,
alive, angry!

305
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,753
{\an3}That's it!

306
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,714
They don't want angry,
they want quiet!

307
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,923
Mama goes to church,

308
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,258
Papa goes to the<i> shebeen,</i>

309
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,551
the kids play
in the streets!

310
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,927
Burn it down!

311
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,721
They're not going to
get a quiet life

312
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,306
so long as I'm around.

313
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,100
( overlapping talking )

314
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,769
I'm asking you

315
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,939
to help me...

316
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,234
for the sake
of the children.

317
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,945
All it takes is
a few troublemakers,

318
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,780
but they all pay the price,

319
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,283
all of them.

320
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
So I want you to help me

321
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,787
to identify
these troublemakers.

322
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,131
What is this silence?

323
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,175
What does it mean, huh?

324
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,762
That you don't believe that
there are any troublemakers?

325
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,182
Or that you don't
want to help me, huh?

326
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,683
Huh?

327
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,977
You want us to tell you
who firebombed the wall.

328
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,479
We don't know that.

329
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,773
Maybe you know
some kids with bad attitudes

330
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,149
cursing the soldiers,

331
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,442
shouting, "viva Mandela!"

332
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,527
Sure.

333
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,321
So tell me.

334
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,115
All of them.

335
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,575
That's funny.

336
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,494
That's really funny, lady.

337
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,996
Maybe there's some teachers
with bad attitudes,

338
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,998
teachers who teach
children to hate

339
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
and burn and kill.

340
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,002
To me, that is
worse than murder.

341
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,672
That is killing
a child's soul.

342
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,632
None of my staff
teach violence.

343
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,300
That is not enough!

344
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,178
Not for teachers who are
responsible for young minds.

345
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,513
They have to
reject violence.

346
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
They have to
hate violence!

347
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,349
They have to tear it
out by the roots!

348
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,522
We know there are people behind
this trouble in the schools,

349
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
and we know
where to look,

350
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,984
and believe me--
Believe me,

351
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,778
we're looking.

352
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,417
( singing in
South African language )

353
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:00,819
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I'm here!

354
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,571
Better late than never.

355
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,031
Sarafina, Crocodile.

356
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,866
Here today
is the plan, people.

357
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,284
You will do all the work,

358
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,786
and I go to sleep.

359
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,621
Have we got it
all worked out then?

360
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,874
ALL:
Yes!

361
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,584
Who needs a show?

362
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,503
I sing a song,
everybody watches me.

363
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,755
Song about what?

364
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,256
SARAFINA:
About me! What else?

365
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,383
MARY:
We have six weeks.

366
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,260
Let's move it.

367
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,095
Hey! Train song!
Stimela says!

368
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,430
( cheering )

369
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,599
( singing in
South African language )

370
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,102
( laughter and drumming )

371
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,771
♪ This is the night
For you and me ♪

372
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,606
{\an5}♪ Aiy yo yo yo ♪

373
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,606
Hmm.

374
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,192
And just where is
this train going?

375
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,777
Just going, mistress.

376
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,737
At 4:00 in the morning,

377
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,906
Stimela takes the men
from their loved ones,

378
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,282
and at 6 in the evening,

379
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,117
the children are
waiting for Stimela

380
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,952
to bring back their
fathers and mothers.

381
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,287
Stimela says so.

382
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,541
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yes, I see. Hmm.

383
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
{\an5}So they come back?

384
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
Sure, they come back.

385
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,962
A happy ending.
I like that.

386
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,422
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

387
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,299
I love happy endings.

388
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,093
You think of
a happy ending,

389
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,761
and you've got a show.

390
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,763
{\an5}BOY 1:
Here's the story
with a happy ending!

391
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,974
Killer disease
comes to South Africa,

392
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,851
but only the Boers get it.

393
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,770
( laughter )

394
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,523
BOY 2:
Mistress! Mistress! Gold!

395
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,776
We strike gold in Soweto,
and we all get rich!

396
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,528
Jesus comes back!

397
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,155
( laughter )

398
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,698
Bah bah bah!

399
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,325
( laughter )

400
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,035
Mandela comes back!

401
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,621
{\an5}Yes!

402
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,621
( cheering )

403
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,833
MARY:
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

404
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,127
Day of liberation.

405
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,296
Mandela comes home
from prison.

406
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,340
I like that. I like it.

407
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,716
I play Nelson Mandela!

408
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,677
The speaker
of the nation!

409
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,345
Why you?

410
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,805
Because I'm a man.

411
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,516
Okay. You want to know
who plays Mandela?

412
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,017
{\an5}Hmm?

413
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,017
I play Mandela.

414
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,978
{\an5}You are a girl.

415
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,978
So what?!

416
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,396
MARY:
Sarafina,

417
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,024
tell us what happens
in your story, hmm?

418
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,028
The day Nelson Mandela
walks free,

419
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,574
all the crowds, everyone
laughing and singing.

420
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,659
Yes, Sarafina!

421
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:16,371
♪ Free at last ♪

422
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,040
♪ Nelson Mandela ♪

423
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,460
♪ Walking down
The street of Soweto ♪

424
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,921
Yes! You got it!

425
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,299
And he speaks
to the people.

426
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,218
{\an1}Free at last!
Nelson Mandela!

427
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,763
{\an5}( cheering )

428
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,763
Yes! Yes! Yes!

429
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,811
Yeah!

430
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,858
SARAFINA:
<i>Why can't I be you, Nelson,</i>

431
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>just for the school concert,</i>

432
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,738
<i>just once make a big speech</i>

433
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,406
<i>just the way you do it?</i>

434
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,200
<i>Mandela free at last,</i>

435
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,744
<i>everybody clapping</i>
<i>and cheering.</i>

436
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,246
<i>Mandela's free</i>
<i>and I'm the star,</i>

437
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,874
<i>just for a day.</i>
<i>Okay, Nelson?</i>

438
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,210
<i>Your day will come.</i>

439
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,589
MARY:
Hey, Sarafina.

440
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,758
Are you all right,
mistress?

441
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,468
No, but what else is new?

442
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,013
It'll be all right
in heaven, as they say.

443
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,474
Is there anything
I can do?

444
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,268
Just stay as beautiful
as you are.

445
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,521
{\an1}You know, I liked
your idea for the show.

446
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,941
Mandela free.

447
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,944
It would make a great show,

448
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,029
only...

449
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,909
Only they won't like it.

450
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,495
No, they won't.

451
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,289
So you're saying
we shouldn't do it?

452
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm saying
it'll make trouble,

453
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,753
and right now they're
looking for the troublemakers.

454
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,965
I know who the
troublemakers are, mistress.

455
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,509
They get special training
how to kill.

456
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,262
{\an5}They have guns. I've seen them.

457
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,262
Shh!

458
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
( men talking outside )

459
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,014
There's two of them.

460
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,019
( Mary exhales )

461
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,480
( laughs )

462
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,774
( laughs )

463
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,985
Hmm.

464
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,289
The Boers want
everything quiet, right?

465
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,292
Everything under control.

466
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,169
Look! The keffeirs are quiet.

467
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,298
A quiet keffeir
is a happy keffeir, man.

468
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,216
But we are not happy,

469
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,093
and we are not quiet,

470
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,929
and we are not under control.

471
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,849
So somebody
better tell the Boers.

472
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,560
People don't like
the boycott of the Boer stores.

473
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,729
They say we only
hurt ourselves.

474
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,731
People say? What people?

475
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
People say, "do nothing."

476
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,526
People say,
"what can we do?"

477
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,113
People say, "please,
Mr. Boer, beat me again."

478
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,491
I say, bullshit.
I say, fight!

479
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,869
( overlapping talking )

480
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,164
Okay, sure, fight,
but don't fight the school!

481
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,540
What's the use of that?

482
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,544
The great school.
The wonderful school.

483
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,714
You think they put us
here for education?

484
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,716
This isn't education.

485
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,677
This is some way to
keep us off the streets.

486
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,763
Miss Masembuko
gives us education.

487
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,723
How long
do you give her?

488
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,058
What do you mean?

489
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,560
Open your eyes, Sarafina.

490
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,562
People disappear.

491
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,147
Haven't you noticed?

492
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,233
{\an1}Mary Masembuko's
one crazy teacher.

493
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,069
How long will they
let her alone

494
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,738
to corrupt
our innocent minds?

495
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,032
( overlapping talking )

496
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,038
Sarafina,
I'll pick you up

497
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,247
at your house later,
okay?

498
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,540
What am I, your<i> pasah?</i>

499
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
{\an5}You're my girl!

500
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
Uh-uh.

501
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,044
What is it that
she wants, China?

502
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,754
( speaking
native language )

503
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,422
Maybe she's waiting
for Michael Jackson.

504
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,383
I'm going to Pac Town
to see my mother.

505
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,218
So? You coming back.

506
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,594
Today it's
your lucky day!

507
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,555
Treat yourself.

508
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,891
You really do love yourself,
don't you, Croc?

509
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,476
{\an3}Sure, I do.
Why not?

510
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,603
There's so much
to love, baby.

511
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,440
So I'll come around
your house later, okay?

512
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,484
You know, he's such
a jerk, that one,

513
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,236
I almost like him.

514
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,238
What is it that
you want, Sarafina?

515
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,157
China,
you know how it is.

516
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,576
{\an5}I want more.

517
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,576
More what?

518
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,787
More than this.

519
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,877
( muffled announcement
over P.A. System )

520
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,848
This store
is owned by Boers.

521
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,184
We have to support
each other!

522
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,480
Don't give your money
to the Boers.

523
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,150
There's no law that says
you have to show up here.

524
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,153
{\an5}( rumbles )

525
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,153
( brakes screech )

526
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,654
Boycott the Boers!

527
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:01,990
( overlapping yelling,
singing, and shouting )

528
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,870
Hey! Hey! Shut up!

529
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,663
You go home.

530
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,583
What's all this fooling
with other people's business?

531
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,959
Why do you show up here,
Mama?

532
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,502
Because I want to,

533
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,463
and I'm not your mama.
Now, out of my way!

534
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,673
You want to give
your money to the Boers?

535
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,467
You want to help them
and not your own people?

536
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,885
You get out of my way!

537
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,678
You boys don't help no one!

538
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,346
All you do is
make things bad!

539
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
What's your daddy doing,

540
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,391
letting you run wild
like this?

541
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,810
My daddy is doing
the same as you: nothing!

542
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,353
That's right!

543
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,813
That's why nothing changes,
mama!

544
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,442
Leave my sugar!
Leave my sugar!

545
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,694
( rumbling )

546
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,864
( indistinct talking )

547
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,408
{\an5}SARAFINA:
<i>I want to tell you something,</i>
<i>Nelson,</i>

548
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,744
<i>I can't tell anyone else.</i>

549
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,205
<i>Whenever I go</i>
<i>to visit my mother,</i>

550
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,999
<i>I feel like I'm visiting</i>
<i>another world</i>

551
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,084
<i>and that I don't</i>
<i>belong there.</i>

552
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,253
<i>That's a bad feeling, right?</i>

553
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,839
<i>I feel like I belong</i>
<i>somewhere else,</i>

554
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,467
<i>somewhere</i>
<i>I've not even seen yet,</i>

555
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,886
<i>but I'll know it</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

556
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,096
( siren wailing )

557
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,394
( yelling and screaming )

558
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,924
<i>This other world</i>
<i>is called Pac Town.</i>

559
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,760
<i>They keep the streets</i>
<i>very clean in Pac Town.</i>

560
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,221
<i>Mama lives</i>
<i>in a big white house.</i>

561
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,015
<i>Well, in a small room</i>
<i>in the back, really.</i>

562
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,976
<i>But they treat her well.</i>

563
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,021
<i>They say, "oh, Angelina's</i>
<i>just like one of the family."</i>

564
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,274
<i>"The children just love her.</i>

565
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,110
<i>You know how good these</i>
<i>black women are with children."</i>

566
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,444
<i>They're right.</i>

567
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,446
<i>Mama is good with children.</i>

568
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,616
<i>Only her children</i>
<i>don't live here, do they?</i>

569
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,201
{\an5}Hello.

570
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,201
Hi.

571
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,452
{\an5}How are you?

572
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,452
I'm fine.

573
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
Good.

574
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,138
( humming )

575
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,147
Mama.

576
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,108
Sarafina.

577
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,156
How are my babies?

578
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,283
Jabu is as naughty
as always.

579
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,535
But everyone's fine,
Mama.

580
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,455
Mama,
I need some money.

581
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,291
Lindiwe has to
have new shoes.

582
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,168
They split.

583
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,671
They're no good.

584
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,632
Have the Boers gone away?

585
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,510
Yes.
Just for the afternoon.

586
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,846
How much money
do you want?

587
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,723
{\an1}Sarafina!

588
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,476
Sarafina!

589
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,519
Where do you think
you are going?

590
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,063
{\an1}Sarafina!

591
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,231
Sarafina,
come back here!

592
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,526
A little refreshment,
Mrs. Vandermoever.

593
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,695
The maid
will take your coat.

594
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,573
Gin, brandy, rum?

595
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,533
Or perhaps you would
like the maid

596
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,620
to mix you
a refreshing lemonade?

597
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,247
Do sit down,
Mrs. Vandermoever.

598
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,542
You walked all the way
from the front gate

599
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,503
on your own legs.

600
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,381
Huh! You must be exhausted.

601
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,217
Next time,
you wait by the gate,

602
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,052
and the maid
will carry you.

603
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,887
No problem, my dear.

604
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,390
These black women
are so strong.

605
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,351
That's enough, Sarafina!

606
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,396
Sometimes you're such
a naughty little girl.

607
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,399
Sarafina!

608
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,193
Sarafina, where
are you going now?

609
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,195
( humming )

610
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,408
Whoo!

611
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,331
Get off that bed,
you silly girl!

612
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:26,421
Sarafina,
come back here!

613
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,297
What's the matter
with you anyway?

614
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,674
Have you gone crazy?

615
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,967
Yes, I've gone crazy.

616
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,427
You want me
to lose my job?

617
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,886
Yes.

618
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,388
And who's gonna buy
your school books?

619
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,765
School books
are full of lies.

620
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:47,316
You're a stupid girl,
Sarafina.

621
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,569
Get off that bed
and show some sense.

622
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,945
I want to kill them.

623
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,947
Kill them? What for?

624
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,741
They are good people.

625
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,827
You've been a servant
for too long, Mama.

626
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,955
Maybe that's because
your papa's been dead too long.

627
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,124
Papa died fighting.

628
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,459
He did not die fighting.

629
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,836
He got sick in Mozambique,
and he died.

630
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,463
He died for the struggle.

631
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,340
Oh, sure. He went away
to be a hero,

632
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,302
and I stayed home to work.

633
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,345
Don't talk like that.

634
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,973
I've got four children
and no man.

635
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,434
My children
cannot eat glory.

636
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,478
We eat servant food.

637
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,646
Food is food.
You want to starve?

638
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,483
Maybe.

639
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,984
The way you're going on,

640
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,487
you just might end up
dead like your papa.

641
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,740
I'd rather die like him
than live like you.

642
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,578
I've got work to do.

643
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,086
( man shouting,
boy screaming )

644
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,550
( indistinct shouting
and screaming )

645
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,556
{\an3}( laughs )

646
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,016
I'm not your brother, okay?

647
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,851
I'm not your brother.

648
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,561
( screaming )

649
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,523
Eh, who's paying you?
I'm not your brother!

650
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,234
I'm not your brother!

651
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,027
{\an5}MAN: Sabela!

652
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,027
Yes, sir!

653
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,403
Give him Prince.

654
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,863
Thank you, sir.

655
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,407
( boy screaming )

656
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,370
( dog barking )

657
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,830
Sic 'im! Sic 'im!

658
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,206
Go, Prince!

659
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,708
( dog barking )

660
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,169
( men laughing )

661
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,675
( dog growling )

662
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:40,346
( screaming )

663
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,724
Go on! Go on!

664
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,934
Aah! Aah!

665
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,936
Aah! Aah!

666
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,605
( dog barking )

667
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,898
( shouting
in native language )

668
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,401
{\an5}Ha, ha, ha!

669
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,401
( dog barking )

670
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,883
( knocks on door )

671
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,886
( knocking )

672
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,810
Unh!

673
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,273
It was Sabela.

674
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,400
They set a dog on me.

675
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,402
Our time will come.

676
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,779
I'll kill him!

677
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,781
And his bloody dog.

678
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,742
No need for killing.

679
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,619
When the people rise up,

680
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,787
you'll see him
singing a new song...

681
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,957
when they march down
commissioner street like a sea,

682
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,628
Constable Sabela will shit
himself with fear,

683
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,089
and up will go his fist.
"viva, Mandela, viva."

684
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,468
Oh, man, I'd love
to see that.

685
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,929
(<i> singing in native language</i> )

686
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,345
( indistinct chatter )

687
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,942
( man whistles )

688
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,865
( wolf whistle )

689
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,408
( knocking )

690
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,873
( knocking )

691
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,630
Miss Masembuko?

692
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,431
Sarafina.

693
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,112
Come in.

694
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,614
Give me a moment, okay?

695
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,532
Okay.

696
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,126
( whispering )

697
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,424
I love you.

698
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,510
MARY:
I love you too.

699
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,558
Ow! Ooh!

700
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,810
Aah.

701
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,686
All right.

702
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,563
Please.
Okay. Okay.

703
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,792
Next week?

704
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,336
I love you too. Okay.

705
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:26,215
Go, go.
Okay. Bye.

706
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:29,135
Bye.

707
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,351
What happened?

708
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,602
The water spilled.

709
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,229
Oh, leave it.
Give me.

710
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,189
Sit down.

711
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,570
So, Sarafina,

712
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,613
what brings you here?

713
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,993
Trouble at home?

714
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:02,209
The boys...
they can fight.

715
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,878
What can I do?

716
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,756
There are other ways,
Sarafina.

717
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,925
Like what?

718
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,344
You know
what they say.

719
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,930
If you want
to find a way,

720
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,057
you must first know
where you're going.

721
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,059
No way.

722
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,228
That's not true.

723
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,899
What do you want?

724
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,194
What do you want,
mistress?

725
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,862
Me?

726
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,574
I want
very many things.

727
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,869
I want the war
to be over.

728
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:41,040
I want the hate
to be over.

729
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,418
I want my Joe
back in my arms.

730
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:50,257
I want quiet days
and loving nights.

731
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,552
I want babies.

732
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,848
I want to come home
to kindness.

733
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,794
Would you believe me
if I told you

734
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,879
this was not mine?

735
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,965
Yes.

736
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,468
{\an1}I've never even held it
in my hands.

737
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,263
It's Joe's.

738
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,932
{\an3}He uses it?

739
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,269
He has done.

740
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,939
I won't tell anyone.

741
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,651
I meant what I said.

742
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,319
I hate the killing.

743
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,489
I hate the violence.

744
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,449
But I cannot stand aside

745
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,078
and let others die for me.

746
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,623
I will fight too.

747
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,543
I can't kill.

748
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,254
Don't ask me to kill.

749
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,466
It's the same
old argument.

750
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,844
What if they
come for you...

751
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,013
Come to the door...

752
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,056
kick it in?

753
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,392
Do you reach
for the gun?

754
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,061
Do you shoot?

755
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,357
Do I?

756
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,693
I don't know.

757
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,240
I don't know.

758
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,909
( thunder rumbles
in the distance )

759
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,496
( thunder )

760
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,259
( thunder )

761
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,558
( crashing )

762
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,394
( children screaming )

763
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,812
( yelling )

764
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,119
( yelling continues )

765
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,839
Get in. Get in!

766
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,424
Get in there!
Oh, shut up,

767
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,635
the rest of you!

768
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,678
( helicopter hovering )

769
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,889
( children crying )

770
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,438
{\an5}PRINCIPAL:
It's no more than rumors,
but in the present climate,

771
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,607
we must listen
to everything.

772
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,444
I've given Lieutenant Bloem
my firm opinion which is:

773
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,405
you are
a responsible teacher

774
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,615
who would do nothing
to harm the children.

775
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,825
Am I right?

776
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, yes, principal.

777
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,913
Mary, do you teach
the children Communism?

778
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,164
No, principal.

779
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,291
{\an1}Do you teach them
violent revolution?

780
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,252
No, principal.

781
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,963
Do you teach the authorized
syllabus, Miss Masembuko?

782
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,464
{\an1}Yes.

783
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,466
With additional material
of your own?

784
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,051
{\an5}Yes.

785
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,051
PRINCIPAL: Mary...

786
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,011
you have to follow
the authorized syllabus.

787
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,471
You know that.

788
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,974
And what is this, um,
additional material?

789
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,643
I want them to know
where they come from.

790
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,396
I want them to have
a sense of pride in themselves.

791
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,939
Black pride.

792
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,316
If you will.

793
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,694
You're playing with fire.

794
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,155
Would you rather
they were ashamed of themselves?

795
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,323
I'll tell you
what I'd rather.

796
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,492
I'd rather they be left in peace
to go to school,

797
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,786
get an education,
get a chance in life,

798
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,663
not get their heads stuffed
with crazy dreams.

799
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,458
Like maybe one day there
won't be police at the school?

800
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,294
Like maybe one day we won't be
afraid of each other?

801
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:58,338
PRINCIPAL:
Mary, you're a fine teacher.

802
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,507
I don't want to lose you.

803
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,802
Follow the authorized syllabus
from now on, please,

804
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,220
and nothing else.

805
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,514
Right, principal.

806
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,852
{\an5}PRINCIPAL:
I don't think we have anything
else to say, do we, lieutenant?

807
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,355
Just a small piece
of advice.

808
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,150
Don't think that we're
all idiots. Okay?

809
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,776
That would be a mistake.

810
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:39,046
Somebody in this room
has got the wrong idea,

811
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,050
and that person
talks too much.

812
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,888
So listen, huh?

813
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,518
I do not teach Communism.

814
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,896
I teach history.

815
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,566
And history
is a beautiful thing.

816
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,235
Do you know why?

817
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,071
STUDENTS:
No.

818
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:09,618
Because history teaches you
where you come from.

819
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,621
I want you to know this.

820
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,541
I want you to be proud
of what we got right

821
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,252
and tell the truth
about what we got wrong

822
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,088
and learn from it.

823
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,300
Otherwise,
what's the use of tomorrow?

824
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,262
If you don't learn,

825
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:33,141
all you've got is today
and today and today.

826
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,144
And you're much better
than that, people.

827
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,106
Believe me.

828
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,442
Believe me.

829
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,111
Okay?

830
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,572
STUDENTS:
Yes.

831
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,535
( church bell tolls )

832
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,373
( indistinct chatter )

833
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,471
Ha, ha, ha!

834
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,933
Jabu, come back here!
Jabu!

835
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,273
Jabu!

836
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,321
SARAFINA:
<i>We knew there was an informer,</i>

837
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,156
<i>but not Guitar.</i>

838
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,201
<i>Guitar, of all people,</i>
<i>the quietest boy in the class.</i>

839
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,996
<i>Guitar, why?</i>

840
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,458
<i>I felt sick inside.</i>

841
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:46,048
Sarafina, beautiful mama,
pretty thing, baby. Mmuh!

842
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,008
Put Jabu down!

843
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,677
Hey. Hey, take it easy.

844
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,847
{\an1}Why don't you take out
your shambuck and beat me?

845
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,849
Did I ever hurt you?

846
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,684
Leave me alone!

847
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,228
Oh, baby, when did I ever give
you anything but sweet words?

848
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,648
Jabu, go back
to the others.

849
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,109
{\an1}You know what? If I was a man,
I would kill you.

850
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,736
Me? Why kill me?

851
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,696
Everybody loves Sabela,

852
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,490
except the trash
in the streets.

853
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,326
You see I sweep away
the streets for you, sweetheart.

854
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,203
I make the streets
clean for you

855
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,038
so you can walk so pretty.

856
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,916
Our day will come.

857
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,877
Sure it will,
but you'll be needing policemen.

858
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,712
You see, everybody
needs policemen.

859
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,631
Not that like you.

860
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,093
Oh, so I'm the bad man,
am I?

861
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,719
( mutters
in native language )

862
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,223
Princess, here.
You be the policeman.

863
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,059
You beat me. Okay?

864
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,103
Come on. Go ahead.

865
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,523
Those kids burnin' the schools.
You let them go free.

866
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,900
Those kids driving the stores
out of business.

867
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,777
You let them go free too.

868
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,697
Those mobs running around the
streets looting and killing.

869
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,865
Let them go free.

870
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,411
Be the policeman.
I'm the bad man.

871
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,789
Okay? Beat me. Come on.

872
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,085
( snickers )
You need me, princess.

873
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,295
You need me.

874
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,307
( indistinct chatter )

875
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,646
( guitar notes play )

876
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,990
( indistinct chatter )

877
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,617
What's wrong?

878
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,119
{\an5}You've been talking.

879
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,119
Talking?

880
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,829
You've been talking
to the wrong people.

881
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,831
{\an5}What wrong people?

882
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,831
Police wrong people!

883
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,458
Who says that?
It's a lie!

884
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,169
{\an4}SARAFINA:
I saw you with Sabela.
Don't lie to us.

885
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,462
Tell us why.

886
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,465
{\an1}You can talk!
You're not dumb!

887
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,592
{\an1}SARAFINA:
Put him down, Crocodile!

888
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,930
You live here
with your father, don't you?

889
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,476
He's sick, isn't he?

890
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,811
His legs are no good.

891
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,481
He's a cripple.

892
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,816
Is he home?

893
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,819
Just tell us why, Guitar.

894
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,781
What you goin' to do to me?

895
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,867
You have to tell us
why first.

896
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,457
One day I came home
from school,

897
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:31,338
and I found my dad lying
in the rubbish outside.

898
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,175
{\an1}He was trying to crawl,
but he couldn't move.

899
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:39,888
His fingers were bleeding

900
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:44,351
from trying to drag himself
through the dirt.

901
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,853
He had been laying there
for hours,

902
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,731
but he didn't cry out for help

903
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,693
because his pride
would not let him.

904
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,571
{\an1}He laid there
waiting for me.

905
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,200
Then<i> he</i> came--

906
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,660
Sabela--

907
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,662
Constable Sabela.

908
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,540
He told me that my dad
was no good,

909
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,835
that he couldn't work,
and that in the old days,

910
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:16,007
{\an1}men like him were taken out
into the bush and left to die.

911
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,845
He said, next time,
maybe he will do that--

912
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,808
take him out into the bush
and leave him there to die.

913
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:30,522
He said he will do this
unless I helped him.

914
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,692
I thought of him--

915
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:38,446
my dad--out in the bush...

916
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,743
calling, not moving.

917
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,329
Just calling.

918
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,458
What was I supposed to do?

919
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,298
I'm sorry.

920
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,758
I'm sorry.

921
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,178
It's okay, Guitar.

922
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,098
It's okay.

923
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,398
Can I go in?

924
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,444

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

926
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,296
The Napoleonic War--

927
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,757
that is what
the syllabus says,

928
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,301
so that is what I teach.

929
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,137
So, what do we learn
from this?

930
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,682
Napoleon's army--
the best equipped,

931
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,935
the best-trained army,

932
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,813
the most powerful army
on the continent....

933
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,692
everybody says
they cannot be beaten.

934
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,361
So, what happens?

935
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,321
Fft! They gone.

936
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:05,367
Why?
Were they beaten in battle?

937
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,955
No. They were defeated
by the people.

938
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,957

Oh, my God.

941
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,544
{\an1}People can defeat
the armies.

942
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,546
History has proved it.

943
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,175
{\an1}People can
defeat the armies.

944
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,432
You. Come.

945
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,028
{\an1}There's something at my house
which I don't need anymore.

946

going to be all right.

950

You know me.

951
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,257

Good morning, sir.

958
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,104
I am replacing
your regular teacher

959
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,814
for the rest of the term.

960
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,482
{\an5}Sir.

961
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,482
Yes?

962
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,400
Why have they taken
Miss Masembuko?

963
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,987
That's none of my business
and none of your business.

964
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,532
{\an1}We won't touch the subject
again. Is that clear?

965
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,996
We are here to do history.

966
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,999
How far have you got?
Somebody show me.

967
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,506
Hmm.

968
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:10,635
The Napoleonic Wars.
Right?

969
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,680
Why did the Russian campaign
of 1812 fail?

970
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,640
What defeated them?

971
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,975
The people, sir.

972
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,644
I said "what," not "who."

973
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,399
( sighs ):
The winter.

974
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,360
Napoleon hadn't reckoned
with the Russian winter.

975
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,320
He thought his army
was safe in Moscow,

976
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,030
but the people in Moscow

977
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,199
had burnt down their city
before he could get there.

978
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,493
{\an5}So it was the people.

979
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,493
Burning.

980
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,537
The people burned
their own houses

981
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,998
rather than let the army win.
That's what you're teaching us.

She wanted so much.

pretty well, huh?

1207

help me, can't you?

When I cried,

1256
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,737
they put their biggest gun
in my mouth

1257
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,906
so I wouldn't cry.

1258
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,450
Then they covered my head
with a wet sack

1259
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,578
and gave me the electricity.

1260
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,874

I began to cry.

1265
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:55,600
He took my face,
then turned it to the light...

1266
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,936
and he laughed.

1267
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,729

<i>"Come to me, boy."</i>

1273
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:44,190
I was so afraid
I couldn't speak.

1274
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,819
I walked slowly towards him.

1275
01:21:47,902 --> 01:21:49,654
When I was close,

1276
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,490
he hit me hard, here.

1277
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,492

1278
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,330
I screamed
and fell to the ground.

1279

He pointed at me again.

1280

"Come to me, boy."

1281
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:08,798
I was still crying.
I knew he would hit me again.

1282
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,675
I put my hands here

1283
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,219

1284

1285
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:20,352
It hurt so bad
I couldn't cry anymore.

1286
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:25,649
There were many of us,
all from my school.

1287
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,318
They took us to a big room.

1288
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:31,696
<i>They told us</i>
<i>to take off our clothes,</i>

1289

<i>to lie down on the floor.</i>

1291

Then many police came in.

1292
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:45,710
They whipped us with shambucks
until we bled.

1293
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:50,548
When they were tired,
more police came in.

1294
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:54,469
They whipped us again,
and we bled more.

1295
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:10,568
This time is called

in the prisons.

1298
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,661
They hurt us
to make us fear them.

1299
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,913
We fear them,

1300
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:25,250
but we do not forget.

1301
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,751
We are still children.

1302
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,171
We are young
and full of fear.

1303

But every day
we grow older.

1304

Hi, Guitar.

1437
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:53,025
{\an1}I've come to do
the concert.

1438
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,278
But the concert

1439
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,822
We can sing our song.

1440

There is no concert,
Sarafina.

1441
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:03,244
Let's go, please?

1442
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,662
Where to?

1443
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,290
{\an1}School hall. That's where
we do the concert.

1444
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,543
But the school hall
burnt down.

1445
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:15,339
I just want to sing
our song, Guitar.

1446
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,383
Just once.

1447
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:24,724
Can you imagine that day?

1448
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:29,687
Millions of people waiting
in a big field in Soweto.

1449
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,065

1450

My people!

Today I am free!

1456
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:55,046
I am free because
you never forgot me.

1457
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:59,383
The day is coming
when we will all be free.

1458
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,427
Free from hatred!

1459
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,220
Free from fear!

1460
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,222
Free from killing!

1461
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,851
You are young.
You'll live to see the day.

to see the day,

1463

1464
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:17,068
I'll be there.
