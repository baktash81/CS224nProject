00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,374
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

2
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,459
-How are you today?
-Fine, thank you.

3
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,587
lt's okay, l've got it. Thanks.

4
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,758
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning, Karl.

5
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,929
Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

6
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,971
Rats?

7
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,057
l'm afraid so.

8
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,142
But the attic is clean.

9
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,228
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

10
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,313
-No rats.
-l just heard them, Karl.

11
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,399
Maybe plumbing.

12
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,527
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

13
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,569
Yes, l go now.

14
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,698
-Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet.
-l'll go see.

15
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,740
They're closed!

16
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,954
In the group over here,
I need a couple ofpriests, a nun....

17
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,167
That's exactly what we want.

18
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,552
ls this scene really essential? Would you
just consider if we can do without it?

19
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,680
Look at this damn thing.
lt just doesn't make sense.

20
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,723
lt's perfectly plain.

21
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,851
You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

22
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,979
-l can read, for Christ's sake!
-What's wrong?

23
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,064
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

24
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,192
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, l believe.

25
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,235
Hiding?

26
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,278
Fucking.

27
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,491
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

28
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,577
All right. Hustle back on in.

29
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,833
Is this your campus?

30
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,961
Let's get the Defense Department
off this campus!

31
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,132
It's our school!

32
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,217
They have no right!

33
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,516
I've seen enough killing in my life!

34
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,644
There's no reason for it anymore!

35
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,773
Wait a minute!

36
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,029
We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...

37
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,157
...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right, too!

38
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,541
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

39
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,798
You can't accomplish anything
by shutting kids out of their....

40
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,310
Ifyou want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

41
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,481
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

42
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,250
l think l'll walk home.

43
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,335
Here, take that and drop it by my house.

44
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,421
Good night, Tom.

45
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,086
There's not a day in my life
that l don't feel like a fraud.

46
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,214
l mean, priests, doctors, lawyers,
l've talked to them all.

47
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,343
l don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.

48
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,599
Hello?

49
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,641
ln here.

50
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,855
-Hi, how did your day go?
-Not too bad.

51
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,983
lt was like the Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh Story.

52
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:46,154
Other than that, it was terrific.
What have we got, anything exciting here?

53
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,239
And you got an invitation.

54
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,325
What's this?

55
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,368
Dinner at the White House.

56
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,453
You're kidding!
ls it a big party or something?

57
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,538
l think it's five or six people.

58
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,667
Thursday? All right.

59
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,709
Hi, Mom.

60
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,752
What did you do today?

61
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,880
-Stuff.
-What does that mean, ''stuff''?

62
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,051
Me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

63
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,136
And we had a picnic down by the river.

64
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,393
Mom, you should have seen it! This man
came along on this beautiful gray horse.

65
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,478
Really? What kind?

66
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,521
Was it a mare, a gelding?

67
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,649
l think it was a gelding.

68
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,692
lt was gray.

69
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,862
lt was so beautiful. The guy let me ride it
all around and everything.

70
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,990
She rode it for about half an hour.

71
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,161
l loved it! Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

72
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,289
-Not while we're in Washington, honey.
-Why not, Mom?

73
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,375
We'll see when we go home, okay?

74
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,418
When could l have one?

75
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,503
We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

76
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,631
On the party invitations,
l want to write a personal--

77
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,717
Regan, don't! Come back!

78
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,016
All right, give it up!

79
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,058
No!

80
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,186
You'll be sorry!

81
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,510
Father?

82
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,596
Could you help an old altar boy?

83
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,681
l'm a Catholic.

84
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,269
Mama?

85
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,379
-l'm so glad to see you.
-You look good.

86
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,422
l'm all right.

87
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,593
-How's your leg?
-How about you? You are all right?

88
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,635
Mama, l'm fine.

89
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,849
Your Uncle John...

90
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:44,934
...passed by to visit me.

91
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,020
Really, when?

92
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,063
Last month.

93
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,319
-ls that too tight?
-No.

94
00:19:55,362 --> 00:20:00,575
You have to stay off it. You can't go up
and down the stairs. Give it a rest.

95
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,618
Okay.

96
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,173
l could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

97
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,258
There'd be people around.

98
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,387
You wouldn't be sitting here listening
to a radio.

99
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,600
You understand me?

100
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,771
This is my house
and l'm not going no place.

101
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,412
Dimmy, you worry for something?

102
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,497
-No, Mama.
-You're not happy.

103
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,582
Tell me, what is the matter?

104
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,711
Mama, l'm all right. l'm fine. Really, l am.

105
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,163
Here it comes.

106
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,248
There!

107
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,419
-Look at that!
-Do you like it?

108
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,504
Oh, isn't that funny?

109
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:41,718
l better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

110
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,974
Hey, where did this come from?

111
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,102
-l found it.
-Where?

112
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,273
ln the closet.

113
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,444
Have you been playing with it?

114
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,529
-Yes.
-Do you know how?

115
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,572
l'll show you.

116
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,871
Wait a minute. You need two.

117
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,956
No, you don't. l do it all the time.

118
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,085
Well, let's both play.

119
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,255
You really don't want me to play?

120
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,384
No, l do! Captain Howdy said no.

121
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,512
-Captain who?
-Captain Howdy.

122
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,597
Who's Captain Howdy?

123
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,725
You know. l make the questions
and he does the answers.

124
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,896
-Captain Howdy. l see.
-He's nice.

125
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,024
l'll bet he is.

126
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,067
Here, l'll show you.

127
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,280
Captain Howdy,
do you think my mom is pretty?

128
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,579
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

129
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,665
-Maybe he's sleeping.
-You think?

130
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,836
Why are you reading that stuff?

131
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,921
Because l like it.

132
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,007
lt's not even a good picture of you.

133
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,135
-You look so mature.
-l wouldn't talk!

134
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,220
You wouldn't talk?

135
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:11,391
l didn't have my makeup man there.

136
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,476
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

137
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,562
No, l didn't get it.

138
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,818
What are we going to do on your birthday?
lsn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

139
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,903
No work. What can we do?

140
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,946
l don't know.

141
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:28,074
What would you like to do? Got any ideas?

142
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,245
Let me think....

143
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:36,416
We never finished seeing all the sights
in Washington.

144
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,501
We didn't get to the Lee Mansion,
lots of stuff.

145
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,629
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing...

146
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,715
-...if it's a nice day?
-Yeah, let's do that.

147
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,928
And tomorrow night,
l'll take you to a movie.

148
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,057
Oh, l love you!

149
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,142
l love you, Rags.

150
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,356
We'll have a good day.

151
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,441
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

152
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,526
Mr. Dennings?

153
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,612
Well, you know, it's okay.

154
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,697
Thank you very much...

155
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,825
...but why would l want to bring Burke
on your birthday?

156
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,868
Well, you like him.

157
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,039
Yeah, l like him. Don't you like him?
What's going on? What is this?

158
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,167
You're going to marry him, aren't you?

159
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,295
You've got to be kidding!
Me marry Burke Dennings?

160
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,381
Don't be silly. Of course not.

161
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,466
Where'd you ever get that idea?

162
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,509
But you like him.

163
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,722
Of course l like him. l like pizzas too,
but l'm not going to marry one.

164
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,808
You don't like him like Daddy?

165
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,936
Regan, l love your daddy.

166
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,064
l'll always love your daddy, honey.

167
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:45,235
Burke just comes around here a lot
because...

168
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,363
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do!

169
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,491
Well, l heard differently.

170
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,576
You did? What did you hear?

171
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,747
l don't know. l just thought.

172
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,790
You didn't think so good.

173
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,875
How do you know?

174
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,004
Because Burke and l are just friends.
Okay? Really.

175
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,174
Are you ready for sleep?

176
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,345
Good night, honey.

177
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,285
lt's my mother, Tom.

178
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,413
She's alone and l never
should have left her.

179
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,626
At least in New York, l'd be near her.
l'd be close to her.

180
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,712
l could see about a transfer, Damien.

181
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,968
l need reassignment, Tom. l want out
of this job. lt's wrong, it's no good.

182
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,054
You're the best we've got.

183
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,182
Am l really?

184
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,395
lt's more than psychiatry,
and you know that.

185
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,523
Some of their problems
come down to faith...

186
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:09,694
...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,
and l can't cut it any more.

187
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,950
l need out. l'm unfit.

188
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,207
l think l've lost my faith, Tom.

189
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,378
Hello?

190
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,463
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

191
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,591
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

192
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,719
l have been on this line for 2O minutes!

193
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,847
Jesus Christ, can you believe this?

194
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,933
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday!

195
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,018
Maybe the circuit is busy.

196
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,104
Circuit, my ass! He doesn't give a shit!

197
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:48,274
-Why don't you let me--
-No, l've got it, Sharon. lt's all right.

198
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:53,488
Don't tell me there's no answer.
lt's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome!

199
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,573
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

200
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,659
Hello? Yes.

201
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,830
No, Operator,
l've given you the number four times!

202
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:06,001
Do you take an illiteracy test
to get that job, for Christ's sake?

203
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,129
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

204
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,257
l've been on this fucking line
for 2O minutes!

205
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:24,769
Yeah?

206
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,940
You're kidding me!

207
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,111
l thought l just went to bed.

208
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,324
What are we doing, Scene 61?

209
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,538
Oh, just remind Flo
about that blue belt, huh?

210
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,221
What are you doing here?

211
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,350
My bed was shaking.

212
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,392
l can't get to sleep.

213
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,894
Goddamn it!

214
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,944
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that!

215
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:24,115
l'm very sorry, but you see? No rats.

216
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,201
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

217
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,233
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

218
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,318
She don't let no doctor go near her.

219
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,404
She was all the time screaming,
even talking to the radio.

220
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,489
You should've called me when it happened.

221
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,617
Regular hospital is not going
to put up with that, Dimmy.

222
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,703
We give her a shot and bring her here...

223
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,831
...until the doctors fix her leg,
then we take her right out.

224
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,959
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new!

225
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,344
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

226
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,386
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.

227
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,514
-Are you a relative?
-l am her brother. He is her son.

228
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,557
Just a minute.

229
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,582
lt's funny...

230
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:41,753
...if you wasn't a priest, you'd be a famous
psychiatrist now on Park Avenue.

231
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,881
Your mother would be living
in a penthouse instead of this.

232
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,137
You go in, Dimmy. l'll wait for you outside.

233
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:58,436
You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed
on the left-hand side.

234
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,632
lt's Dimmy, Mama.

235
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,974
Why did you do this to me, Dimmy?

236
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,017
Why?

237
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,315
Mama, l'm going to take you out of here.
l'm going to take you home.

238
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:50,572
Mama, everything's going to be all right.
l'm going to take you home.

239
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:56,828
Couldn't you have put her someplace else?

240
00:33:56,828 --> 00:34:00,999
Like what? Private hospital?
Who's got the money for that, Dimmy?

241
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,042
You?

242
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,494
There seems to be an alien pubic hair
in my drink.

243
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:38,536
l beg your pardon?

244
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:42,707
Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

245
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,049
We're pretty comfortable up there...

246
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:55,220
...compared to the Gemini and Mercury
programs, which were tight for space.

247
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,348
We've got about 21O cubic feet,
so we can move around.

248
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:01,476
lf you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

249
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,519
What for?

250
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,604
First missionary on Mars!

251
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,775
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

252
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:10,860
l'm Swiss!

253
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,903
Yes, of course.

254
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:16,074
And you never went bowling
with Goebbels either, l suppose, huh?

255
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,202
Nazi bastard!

256
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:23,373
Over behind the church. You know
where l mean? lt's a red brick wing.

257
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,544
What goes on there?
Who's the priest l keep seeing there?

258
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,586
He's always there.

259
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,715
He has black hair, very intense looking.
Who's that?

260
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,843
Damien Karras. That's his office,
in the back of Saint Mike's.

261
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,928
He's our psychiatric counselor.

262
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:43,184
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

263
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,270
She was living by herself, and...

264
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,398
...l guess she was dead a couple of days
before they found her.

265
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,526
Cunting Hun!

266
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,740
Bloody, damned, butchering, Nazi pig!

267
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,868
Stop it! l'll kill you!

268
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,380
What's the matter with you?

269
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,466
What's for dessert?

270
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:22,807
You sleeping?

271
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:45,747
Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. lt's nice and warm.

272
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,174
Yes, honey. What?

273
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,259
Fuck it.

274
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:07,644
-Was he acting up!
-Blind is what he was.

275
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,114
Hi, Chris, it's a great party.

276
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,199
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

277
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,370
l don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

278
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,541
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

279
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:35,797
''Down on the eastside
of toidy-toid and toid

280
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:41,011
''That's my home sweet home!''

281
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,480
l think we've got a guest.

282
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,651
You're going to die up there.

283
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,078
Oh, my God, honey.

284
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,164
Honey, what's the matter?

285
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,335
l'm sorry, she's been sick.
She didn't know what she was saying.

286
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,847
What made you say that, Regan?

287
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,018
Do you know, sweetheart?

288
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,274
Mother?

289
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,402
What's wrong with me?

290
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:49,829
lt's just like the doctor said.
lt's nerves, and that's all.

291
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:55,043
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine, really.

292
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:56,086
Okay?

293
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,196
ls it coming out, Willie?

294
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,281
Yes, l think so.

295
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,324
Good.

296
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,452
Mother!

297
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:19,502
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal, the poor box?

298
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,588
That's an insult. l've got a vow of poverty.

299
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,801
Where'd you get it, then?

300
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,844
l stole it.

301
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,015
l believe you.

302
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:35,143
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

303
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,271
l figure l saved him from a big temptation.

304
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,399
Oh, Christ!

305
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,527
l should have been there. l wasn't there.

306
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,613
There was nothing you could do.

307
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:48,698
Lie down.

308
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,784
Give me the butt. Come on.

309
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,997
Now you think you can sleep?

310
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:59,125
Yeah. Are you going
to steal my shoes now?

311
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,168
No.

312
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:04,339
l tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

313
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,851
Good night.

314
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,193
Stealing is a sin.

315
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,200
l don't want it!

316
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,286
Honey, it's to help you.

317
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,371
l don't want it!

318
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,499
You fucking bastard!

319
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,670
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

320
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:34,012
...who has gone before us, with the sign
of faith, and sleeps the sleep of peace.

321
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:39,225
''Lord, l am not worthy to receive you.

322
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:43,396
''But only say the word
and l shall be healed.

323
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:48,610
''May the body of Christ bring thee
to everlasting life.''

324
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,293
lt's a symptom...

325
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,592
...of a type of disturbance in
the chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

326
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,678
ln your daughter's case,
in the temporal lobe.

327
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,763
That's up here in the lateral part
of the brain.

328
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,891
lt's rare, but it does cause
bizarre hallucinations...

329
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,976
...and usually just before a convulsion.

330
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,062
A convulsion?

331
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:27,190
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

332
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:30,318
No, no, that was no spasm.

333
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:36,574
l got on the bed. The whole bed was
thumping and rising off the floor...

334
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,660
...and shaking, the whole thing!
With me on it!

335
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:42,831
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

336
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:43,873
lt's her brain.

337
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,258
What causes this?

338
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,343
A lesion in the temporal lobe.

339
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:57,429
lt's a kind of seizure disorder.

340
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:01,599
Look, Doc, l really don't understand
how her whole personality could change.

341
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:04,728
ln the temporal lobe, it's very common.

342
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:05,770
lt is?

343
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:08,898
lt can last for days, even weeks.

344
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:12,027
lt isn't rare to find destructive...

345
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,112
...even criminal behavior.

346
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:18,283
Do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

347
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,454
Don't be alarmed. lf it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

348
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:25,582
All we have to do is remove the scar.

349
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:44,351
Regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?

350
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,479
Watch the l.V.

351
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,649
A little more.

352
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:53,735
Good.

353
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:01,034
l'm just going to move you down
on the table, okay?

354
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,589
Just for a short time.

355
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:31,272
Very sticky.

356
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:35,443
Now, Regan, you're going to feel
something a little cold and wet.

357
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:50,041
Now you're going to feel a little stick here.
Don't move.

358
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:56,297
Good.

359
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:03,596
You're going to feel some pressure here.
Now, don't move.

360
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,031
Hook up!

361
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:37,440
There's just nothing there.

362
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,526
No vascular displacement at all.

363
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:42,654
Do you want me to run another series?

364
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,697
l don't think so.

365
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,782
l'd like you to see her again.

366
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,910
Excuse me, Doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

367
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,995
She says it's urgent.

368
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,081
-Have you got some time?
-Of course.

369
00:47:59,337 --> 00:47:59,337
Dr. Klein?

370
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:02,465
Yes, l'm Dr. Klein. This is Dr. Tanney.

371
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:04,551
Things have gotten worse since l phoned.
Come upstairs.

372
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:07,679
-ls she having spasms again?
-Yes, but they're violent.

373
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,764
-You gave her the medication?
-Yes.

374
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:11,850
-What was that?
-Thorazine.

375
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:14,978
Before that, it was Ritalin.

376
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:19,149
Chris, doctors.

377
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,234
Mother, please!

378
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,319
Please, Mother, make him stop!

379
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,448
lt's burning! lt's burning!

380
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,533
Do something, Doctor. Please, help her!

381
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:33,747
Make him stop! He's trying to kill me!

382
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:34,789
Mother!

383
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,174
All right, Regan,
let's see what the trouble--

384
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:45,216
Keep away!

385
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:46,259
The sow is mine!

386
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,345
Fuck me!

387
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:50,430
Fuck me!

388
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:02,942
Stay away from me!

389
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:08,156
Hold her tight!

390
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,241
Don't let them, Mother!

391
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,266
She's heavily sedated.

392
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:38,395
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

393
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,651
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

394
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:48,822
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

395
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:52,992
...accelerated motor performance.

396
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:55,078
For example...

397
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:00,291
...say a 9O-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

398
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,420
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground.

399
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,548
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

400
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,676
Same principle, l mean.

401
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:13,847
So what's wrong with her?

402
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:18,018
We still think that the temporal lobe--

403
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:21,146
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sake?

404
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:23,231
Did you see her or not?

405
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,316
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

406
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:29,487
Psychotic, like a split personality, or....

407
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,786
There haven't been more
than 1OO authentic cases...

408
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,914
...of so-called ''split personality,''
Mrs. MacNeil.

409
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,128
Now, l know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry...

410
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:50,342
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

411
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,555
So, what's next?

412
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:59,726
A pneumoencephalogram,
l would think, to pin down that lesion.

413
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,854
lt will involve another spinal.

414
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:03,897
Oh, Christ!

415
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:07,025
What we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

416
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,153
...could conceivably turn up there.

417
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:15,367
At least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities.

418
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:32,050
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.

419
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,135
ln other words, normal.

420
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:43,520
Do you keep any drugs in your house?

421
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,648
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

422
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:48,733
Are you sure?

423
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,819
Of course, l'm sure.

424
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:51,861
l'd tell you.

425
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:54,989
Christ, l don't even smoke grass.

426
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:02,288
Are you planning to be home soon?

427
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,374
l mean to LA.

428
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:08,545
No, l....

429
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,716
l'm building a new house.

430
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:14,801
My old one has been sold.

431
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:29,399
l was going to take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

432
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:33,570
Why do you ask?

433
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:40,869
l think it's time we started
looking for a psychiatrist.

434
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,107
Hello?

435
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,285
Shit!

436
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:17,841
God!

437
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:33,481
What do you mean going off
and leaving Regan by herself?

438
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:35,567
Are you crazy? Her window's wide open!

439
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,652
-Didn't he tell you?
-Who?

440
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:39,738
-Burke!
-What's Burke got to do with it?

441
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,823
Nobody was here.
When l went to get the Thorazine...

442
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:44,951
...l had him stay with her, and....

443
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:45,994
l should've known better.

444
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:48,079
l guess you should have!

445
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,122
How were the tests?

446
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,207
We have to start looking for a shrink.

447
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:53,293
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

448
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,421
l suppose you heard.

449
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,464
Heard what?

450
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:01,634
You haven't heard.

451
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,763
Burke is dead.

452
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:12,062
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.

453
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,190
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

454
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:17,275
Oh, God!

455
00:55:27,702 --> 00:55:29,788
Yeah, l know.

456
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:35,001
When l touch your forehead,
open your eyes.

457
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,343
Are you comfortable, Regan?

458
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:47,514
Yes.

459
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:50,642
How old are you?

460
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,727
Twelve.

461
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,855
ls there someone inside you?

462
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:57,941
Sometimes.

463
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:01,069
Who is it?

464
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:04,197
l don't know.

465
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,282
ls it Captain Howdy?

466
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:08,368
l don't know.

467
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:11,496
lf l ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

468
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:14,624
No.

469
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,710
Why not?

470
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:18,795
l'm afraid.

471
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,923
lf he talks to me, l think he'll leave you.

472
00:56:21,923 --> 00:56:24,009
Do you want him to leave you?

473
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:26,094
Yes.

474
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:37,564
l'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

475
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:40,692
lf you are there, you too are hypnotized...

476
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,820
...and must answer all my questions.

477
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,948
Come forward...

478
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,076
...and answer me now.

479
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:02,589
Are you the person inside of Regan?

480
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:08,845
Who are you?

481
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:19,272
-Help me!
-Let go!

482
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:08,279
Father Karras?

483
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:12,450
Have we met?

484
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,621
No, we haven't met,
but they said l could tell.

485
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:19,749
That you look like a boxer.

486
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:23,920
William F. Kinderman, Homicide.

487
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,006
What's this all about?

488
00:58:27,048 --> 00:58:29,134
lt's true. You do look like a boxer.

489
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:33,304
Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.

490
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:36,433
Exactly. John Garfield.
Do people tell you that, Father?

491
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:39,561
Do people say you look like Paul Newman?

492
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:40,603
Always.

493
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:53,116
You know this director who was doing
a film here, Burke Dennings?

494
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,159
l've seen him.

495
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:56,244
You've seen him.

496
00:58:57,287 --> 00:59:00,415
You're also familiar how last week he died?

497
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,500
Only what l read in the papers.

498
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,671
Father, what do you know
on the subject of witchcraft?

499
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:10,842
From the witching end, not the hunting.

500
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:12,927
l once did a paper on it.

501
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:15,013
Really?

502
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:16,056
From the psychiatric end.

503
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:19,184
l know. l read it.

504
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:24,397
All of this desecration in the church...

505
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:26,483
...does this have anything to do
with witchcraft?

506
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:30,653
Maybe. Some rituals used
in the Black Mass.

507
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:34,824
And now Dennings. You read how he died?

508
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:36,910
ln a fall.

509
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:44,209
Let me tell you how. Please, Father...

510
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:47,337
...confidential.

511
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:51,508
Burke Dennings, good Father, was found...

512
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:54,636
...at the bottom of those steps leading
to M Street...

513
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,721
...with his head turned completely around...

514
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,807
...facing backwards.

515
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,148
That didn't happen in the fall?

516
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:08,191
lt's possible.

517
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,362
-Possible, however....
-Unlikely.

518
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:14,447
Exactly.

519
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:20,704
So, on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

520
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:25,917
...and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type
desecration in the church.

521
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:29,045
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

522
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:34,259
Maybe somebody crazy, somebody with...

523
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,301
...a spite against the Church.

524
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:38,430
Some unconscious rebellion.

525
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,472
A sick priest, is that it?

526
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:43,643
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, l understand...

527
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:48,857
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

528
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,942
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

529
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:54,070
l mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

530
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,198
l don't know anyone
who fits that description.

531
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:04,497
Doctor's ethics. lf you knew,
you wouldn't tell, huh?

532
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,583
No, l probably wouldn't.

533
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,668
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

534
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:11,796
...in sunny California, no less...

535
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:17,010
...was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient.

536
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,053
ls that a threat?

537
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:21,181
No, l mention it only in passing.

538
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:25,352
lncidentally, l mention it only in passing...

539
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:29,522
...l could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession.

540
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:34,736
Father, wait a minute!

541
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:36,821
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.

542
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:39,949
Well, l get passes
to the best shows in town.

543
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:43,078
Mrs. K, you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

544
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,163
That's too bad.

545
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:46,206
l hate to go alone.

546
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:49,334
l love to talk film...

547
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:52,462
...to discuss, to critique.

548
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:57,676
You want to see a film with me?

549
01:01:58,718 --> 01:01:59,761
Who's in it?

550
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,932
Debbie Reynolds does Desdemona and
Othello: Groucho Marx. Are you happy?

551
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:06,017
l've seen it.

552
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,188
One last time. Can you think
of some priest who fits the bill?

553
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:11,231
Come on!

554
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:14,359
No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

555
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:17,487
All right.

556
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,658
You know who l think really did it?

557
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:22,701
Who?

558
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:24,786
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

559
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:27,914
l could have you deported, you know that?

560
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,042
l lied.

561
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:34,170
You look like Sal Mineo.

562
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,469
It looks like a type of disorder
that's rarely ever seen anymore...

563
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:43,555
...except in primitive cultures.

564
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:47,726
We call it ''somnambular-form possession. ''

565
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:52,939
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all, except that...

566
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:57,110
...it starts with a conflict or a guilt...

567
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,195
...and leads to the patient's delusions
that his body...

568
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:03,366
...has been invaded
by some alien intelligence:

569
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:05,452
A spirit.

570
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:09,622
Look, l'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

571
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:12,751
...l am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum!

572
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:16,921
And l don't care what you call it,
l'm not putting her away!

573
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:19,007
l'm sorry.

574
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,135
You're sorry? Jesus Christ, 88 doctors...

575
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:25,263
...and all you can tell me,
with all your bullshit is....

576
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:46,117
Of course, there is one outside chance
for a cure.

577
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:53,416
l think of it as a shock treatment.

578
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:56,544
As l said, it's a very outside chance.

579
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:59,673
Would you just name it,
for God's sake? What is it?

580
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,758
Do you have any religious beliefs?

581
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:02,801
No.

582
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,886
What about your daughter?

583
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:05,929
No.

584
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:06,971
Why?

585
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:09,057
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

586
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:15,313
Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...

587
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:20,527
...rabbi or the priest try to drive out
the so-called invading spirit.

588
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,655
lt's been pretty much discarded
these days except by...

589
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:27,826
...the Catholics, who keep it in the closet
as a sort of embarrassment. But...

590
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:29,911
...it has worked...

591
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:34,082
...in fact, although,
not for the reasons they think.

592
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,253
lt's purely force of suggestion.

593
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:41,381
The victim's belief in possession...

594
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,509
...is what helped cause it,
so in that same way...

595
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:48,680
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

596
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:54,936
You're telling me l should take
my daughter to a witch doctor.

597
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,022
ls that it?

598
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:41,292
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

599
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:45,463
She's going to be well?

600
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:51,720
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
l want you to tell me. Now, did you?

601
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,805
No, not me.

602
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:55,890
l didn't.

603
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:16,745
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

604
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:18,830
Of course, l didn't.

605
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:21,958
l didn't put it.

606
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:25,086
Excuse me, madam.

607
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,129
What?

608
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,214
A man to see you.

609
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:29,257
What man?

610
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:37,599
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

611
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:40,727
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

612
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:43,855
Why do you ask?

613
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,983
Might she remember?

614
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,197
No, she was heavily sedated.

615
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:54,282
lt's serious?

616
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:56,368
Yes, l'm afraid it is.

617
01:07:58,453 --> 01:07:59,496
May l ask--

618
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:00,538
We still don't know.

619
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:03,667
Watch out for drafts.

620
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,795
A draft in the fall,
when the house is hot, is...

621
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,880
...a magic carpet for bacteria.

622
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,965
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

623
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:13,051
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

624
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:15,136
lt's all right.

625
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:21,393
Why are you asking all this?

626
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:22,435
lt's strange.

627
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:27,649
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 2O minutes...

628
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:31,820
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

629
01:08:33,905 --> 01:08:35,990
Speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

630
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:41,204
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

631
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:45,375
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found...

632
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,460
...except maybe one chance in a thousand.

633
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,588
No, my hunch....

634
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,717
My opinion...

635
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,930
...he was killed by a very powerful man,
point one.

636
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:02,058
And the fracturing of his skull, point two...

637
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,186
...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

638
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,314
...would make it very probable...

639
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:11,443
...probable, not certain...

640
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:17,699
...that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter's window.

641
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:22,912
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

642
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:29,169
lt could be one way.

643
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:33,340
lf someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

644
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,425
...and the time you returned.

645
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,510
Judas Priest, just a second.

646
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:40,638
The servants? They have visitors?

647
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:42,724
Not at all.

648
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:44,809
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

649
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:45,852
None that l know of.

650
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,980
Groceries, cleaning...a package?

651
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:52,108
l really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.

652
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:55,236
l see.

653
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:57,322
Would you like to ask him?

654
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,450
No, never mind, it's...

655
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:03,578
...it's very remote.

656
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:06,706
No, never mind.

657
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,261
Would you like some more coffee?

658
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:22,347
Please.

659
01:10:57,799 --> 01:10:58,842
That's cute.

660
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:01,970
Your daughter, she's the artist?

661
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:06,141
Thank you.

662
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:09,269
lncidentally...

663
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:12,397
...you might ask your daughter...

664
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,525
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

665
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:18,653
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go to her room.

666
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:21,781
l know, l realize, but...

667
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:25,952
...if certain British doctors never asked,
''What is this fungus?''...

668
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:29,080
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

669
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,294
When she's better, l'll ask her.

670
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:35,337
lt couldn't hurt.

671
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,422
ln the meantime....

672
01:11:39,507 --> 01:11:41,593
That's okay.

673
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:43,678
l really hate to ask you this, but...

674
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,892
...for my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

675
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:52,020
Of course. Where's a pencil?

676
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:54,105
Right here.

677
01:11:57,233 --> 01:11:58,276
She'd love it!

678
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,404
What's her name?

679
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,575
l lied. lt's for me.

680
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,789
The spelling is on the back. Kinderman.

681
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:14,959
You know that film you made, Angel?

682
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:18,088
l saw that six times!

683
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:19,130
Really?

684
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:21,216
lt was beautiful.

685
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:23,301
Thank you.

686
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:28,515
You're a very nice lady.

687
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:33,728
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.

688
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,899
l'll come back when she's feeling better.

689
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,155
-'Bye.
-'Bye.

690
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,052
Please, no!

691
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,138
-Do it!
-Please, don't!

692
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,308
You bitch! Do it! Do it!

693
01:13:12,308 --> 01:13:13,351
Please, no!

694
01:13:17,522 --> 01:13:19,607
Let Jesus fuck you!

695
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,693
Let Jesus fuck you!

696
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,035
Give it! Give it to me!

697
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,248
Lick me! Lick me!

698
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,675
-Mrs. MacNeil!
-Open the door!

699
01:13:55,060 --> 01:14:00,273
Do you know what she did,
your cunting daughter?

700
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:21,127
Chris MacNeil?

701
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,213
Please go away.

702
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,255
l'm Father Karras.

703
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:28,426
l'm very sorry. Hello.

704
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:31,554
lt's all right. l should've said
l wouldn't be in uniform.

705
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:33,640
That would've helped.

706
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,725
-Have you got a cigarette, Father?
-Sure.

707
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:40,939
Thanks.

708
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:54,494
Cold.

709
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,537
Yeah.

710
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,836
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

711
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:07,007
lt's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

712
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,092
Where?

713
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,177
Harvard, Bellevue...

714
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,305
...Johns Hopkins. Places like that.

715
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:20,562
-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
-Yes, l am.

716
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,647
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.

717
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,733
Did he talk to you about my party?

718
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:26,818
He sure did.

719
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:28,903
About my daughter?

720
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:30,989
No, l didn't know you had one.

721
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,160
-He didn't mention her?
-No.

722
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,373
He didn't tell you what she did?

723
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:42,459
He didn't mention her.

724
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:46,629
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed,
then, huh?

725
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:47,672
That depends.

726
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,800
-On what?
-The priest.

727
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:56,014
l mean, what if a person...

728
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:01,227
...came to you, you know, that was
a murderer or a criminal of some kind...

729
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:05,398
...and they wanted some kind of help?

730
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:07,484
Would you have to turn them in?

731
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:10,612
Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,
l'd say no.

732
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:12,697
-You wouldn't?
-No, l wouldn't.

733
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:15,825
But l would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

734
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:19,996
And, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

735
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,295
l beg your pardon?

736
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:35,637
lf a person is, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

737
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,765
...how do they get an exorcism?

738
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:41,893
First, l'd have to get them
into a time machine...

739
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:43,978
...and get them back to the 16th century.

740
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:45,021
l didn't get you.

741
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,107
lt just doesn't happen any more,
Mrs. MacNeil.

742
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,192
Oh, yeah? Since when?

743
01:16:50,235 --> 01:16:54,406
Since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia, schizophrenia...

744
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,491
...those things they taught me at Harvard.

745
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:59,619
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day l joined the Jesuits...

746
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:03,790
...l've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

747
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,875
Yeah, well...

748
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:12,132
...it just so happens
that somebody very close to me...

749
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:15,260
...is probably possessed.

750
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:17,345
And needs an exorcist.

751
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,473
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

752
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,644
That's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

753
01:17:24,644 --> 01:17:26,730
Why? l don't understand.

754
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,815
To begin with, it could make things worse.

755
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:29,858
How?

756
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,943
The Church, before it approves
an exorcism...

757
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:34,029
...conducts an investigation
to see if it's warranted.

758
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:36,114
That takes time.

759
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:38,199
You could do it yourself.

760
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:41,327
No, l couldn't. l'd need Church approval,
and that's rarely given.

761
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:45,498
Could you see her?

762
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:48,626
Yes. l could see her as a psychiatrist--

763
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,712
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest!

764
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:53,840
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world...

765
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,968
...and they sent me to you!
You're gonna send me back to them?

766
01:17:56,968 --> 01:17:59,054
Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?

767
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:03,224
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

768
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:35,548
lt wants no straps.

769
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:53,274
Hello, Regan.

770
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:59,531
l'm a friend of your mother's.
l'd like to help you.

771
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:01,616
You might loosen these straps, then.

772
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:05,787
l'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.

773
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,872
I'm not Regan.

774
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:09,958
l see.

775
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:18,299
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
l'm Damien Karras.

776
01:19:18,299 --> 01:19:20,385
And I am the devil.

777
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,470
Now kindly undo these straps.

778
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,598
lf you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

779
01:19:25,598 --> 01:19:28,727
That's much too vulgar a display
ofpower, Karras.

780
01:19:29,769 --> 01:19:31,855
Where's Regan?

781
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:33,940
In here, with us.

782
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:38,111
Show me Regan
and l'll loosen one of the straps.

783
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:41,239
Could you help an old altar boy, Father?

784
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:45,410
Your mother is in here with us, Karras.

785
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,495
Would you like to leave a message?

786
01:19:47,495 --> 01:19:49,581
I'll see that she gets it.

787
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:56,880
lf that's true...

788
01:19:58,965 --> 01:20:02,093
...then you must know
my mother's maiden name.

789
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,221
What is it?

790
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:14,606
What is it?

791
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:09,869
Thank you.

792
01:21:12,997 --> 01:21:17,168
Look, l'm only against the possibility
of doing her more harm than good.

793
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:20,296
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

794
01:21:21,339 --> 01:21:22,382
l can't do it.

795
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:27,595
l need evidence that the Church
would accept as signs of possession.

796
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:28,638
Like what?

797
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:30,724
Her speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

798
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:31,766
What else?

799
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:35,937
l don't know. l'd have to look it up.

800
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,065
l thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

801
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:42,193
There are no experts.

802
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:46,364
You probably know as much
about possession as most priests.

803
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:49,492
Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.

804
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:51,578
She says she's the devil himself.

805
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,663
lf you've seen as many psychotics
as l have...

806
01:21:53,663 --> 01:21:57,834
...you'd realize that's the same as saying
you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

807
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:03,048
You asked me what l think is best
for your daughter.

808
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:07,218
Six months under observation...

809
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,347
...in the best hospital you can find.

810
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:14,517
You show me Regan's double...

811
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,688
...same face, same voice, everything...

812
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:21,816
...and l'd know it wasn't Regan.

813
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:23,902
l'd know in my gut.

814
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:29,115
l'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

815
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:32,243
l want you to tell me
that you know for a fact...

816
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:35,372
...there's nothing wrong with my daughter
except in her mind!

817
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:38,500
Tell me you know for a fact,
an exorcism wouldn't do any good!

818
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,585
You tell me that!

819
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:55,183
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?

820
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,268
No.

821
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:59,354
Did you know my mother died recently?

822
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:02,482
Yes, l did. l'm very sorry.

823
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:05,610
ls Regan aware of it?

824
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:07,696
Not at all.

825
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:10,824
Why do you ask?

826
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:14,994
lt's not important. Good night.

827
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:47,318
''He broke the bread,
and gave it to his disciples and said:

828
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:52,532
'''Take this, all of you, and eat it.

829
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,746
'''For this is my body.'

830
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:07,130
''When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

831
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,258
''Again he gave you thanks and praise.

832
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:14,429
''He gave the cup to his disciples and said:
'Take this...

833
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:17,557
'''...all of you, and drink from it.

834
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:22,771
'''This is the cup of my blood.

835
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:29,027
'''The blood of the new and everlasting
Covenant, the mystery of faith.'''

836
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,155
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

837
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,326
You'd like that?

838
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:37,369
Intensely.

839
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:41,539
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?

840
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:42,582
It would bring us together.

841
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:45,710
You and Regan?

842
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:47,796
You and us.

843
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:00,308
Did you do that?

844
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:09,693
Do it again.

845
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:10,735
In time.

846
01:25:10,735 --> 01:25:11,778
No, now.

847
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:12,821
In time.

848
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:16,991
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

849
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,162
You speak Latin?

850
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:23,248
Ego te absolvo.

851
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,376
Quod nomen mihi est?

852
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:28,461
Bonjour!

853
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:29,504
Quod nomen mihi est?

854
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:31,589
La plume de ma tante.

855
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:34,718
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

856
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:37,846
Until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth.

857
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,017
What's that?

858
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,059
Holy water.

859
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,187
You keep it away!

860
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:51,401
It burns!

861
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:54,529
Oh, it burns!

862
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,554
Who are you?

863
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:33,109
You know, l'm like in seclusion.

864
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:40,408
No, l'm just exhausted from work.

865
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:47,707
She's, she's all right. She's just....

866
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:53,963
l don't want to talk about it, okay?

867
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:02,305
Okay, l'll talk to you, huh?
l'll call as soon as it's over, all right?

868
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:07,519
No, l just, l'm going through something
and l just have to....

869
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:10,647
No, no....

870
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:12,732
There's nothing.

871
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:15,860
Hey, thanks a lot.

872
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:33,586
-Want a drink?
-Please.

873
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:36,715
What do you drink?

874
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:37,757
Scotch.

875
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:40,885
lce and water.

876
01:27:48,184 --> 01:27:51,312
No ice. l'll get some from the kitchen.

877
01:27:51,312 --> 01:27:52,355
l'll take it straight.

878
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,441
No, that's fine. Please sit.

879
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:55,483
-You sure?
-Yeah, sit.

880
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,039
Where's her father?

881
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:10,081
ln Europe.

882
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,209
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.

883
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:14,252
Well, l think you should.

884
01:28:22,594 --> 01:28:23,636
l told Regan that was holy water.

885
01:28:23,636 --> 01:28:26,765
l sprinkled it on her
and she reacted very violently.

886
01:28:29,893 --> 01:28:30,935
lt's tap water.

887
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:33,021
What's the difference?

888
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:37,192
Holy water is blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

889
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:50,747
She killed Burke Dennings.

890
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,832
What?

891
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,046
She killed Burke Dennings.

892
01:29:00,131 --> 01:29:02,217
She pushed him out her window.

893
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:15,772
No one.

894
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:17,857
Who are you?

895
01:29:17,857 --> 01:29:18,900
No one!

896
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:23,071
lt's a language, all right. lt's English.

897
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:26,199
What do you mean, English?

898
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:28,284
lt's English in reverse. Listen.

899
01:29:28,284 --> 01:29:30,370
Give us time.

900
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,455
Let her die.

901
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:37,669
I am no one. I am no one.

902
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:39,754
Fear the priest.

903
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,882
Fear the priest.

904
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:47,053
Merrin!

905
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:56,438
I am no one.

906
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:01,651
Merrin! Fear the priest!

907
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:03,737
Merrin!

908
01:30:12,078 --> 01:30:13,121
Yeah?

909
01:30:14,164 --> 01:30:15,206
l'll be right there.

910
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:36,061
l don't want Chris to see this.

911
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,103
What's wrong? What is it?

912
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:49,050
You're convinced that it's genuine?

913
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:51,136
l don't know.

914
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:54,264
No, not really, l suppose.

915
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:57,392
But l have made...

916
01:31:57,392 --> 01:32:01,563
...a prudent judgement that it meets
the conditions set down in The Ritual.

917
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:04,691
You would want to do
the exorcism yourself?

918
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:06,776
Yes.

919
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:13,033
lt might be best to have a man
with experience.

920
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:16,161
Maybe someone who's spent time
in the foreign missions.

921
01:32:17,203 --> 01:32:19,289
l understand, Your Excellency.

922
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:21,374
Let's see who's around.

923
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:24,502
ln the meantime,
l'll call you as soon as l know.

924
01:32:25,545 --> 01:32:26,588
Thank you, Your Excellency.

925
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:29,716
Well, he does know the background.

926
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:32,844
l doubt there's any danger
in just having him assist.

927
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:35,972
There should be
a psychiatrist present, anyway.

928
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:38,058
What about the exorcist?

929
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:40,143
Have you any ideas?

930
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,271
How about Lankester Merrin?

931
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,442
l had a notion he was in lraq.

932
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:49,527
l read he was working
on a dig near Nineveh.

933
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:50,570
You're right, but he's finished.

934
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:54,741
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

935
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:56,826
What's he doing there, teaching?

936
01:32:56,826 --> 01:32:58,912
He's working on another book.

937
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:02,040
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

938
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:07,253
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

939
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:11,424
Besides, he's had experience.

940
01:33:11,424 --> 01:33:12,467
l didn't know that.

941
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:14,552
Ten, twelve years ago, l think, in Africa.

942
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:18,723
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
l heard it damn near killed him.

943
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:24,979
Father?

944
01:34:31,713 --> 01:34:33,798
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.

945
01:34:33,798 --> 01:34:34,841
l'm Father Merrin.

946
01:34:35,884 --> 01:34:36,926
Come in.

947
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:37,969
Thank you.

948
01:34:37,969 --> 01:34:41,097
-ls Father Karras here?
-Yes. He's here already.

949
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:46,311
lt's an honor to meet you, Father.

950
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:53,610
-Are you very tired?
-No.

951
01:34:55,695 --> 01:34:58,823
l'd like you to go quickly
across to the Residence...

952
01:34:58,823 --> 01:35:00,909
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

953
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:04,037
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

954
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,122
...and...

955
01:35:07,165 --> 01:35:09,250
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

956
01:35:10,293 --> 01:35:11,336
l believe we should begin.

957
01:35:12,379 --> 01:35:14,464
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first?

958
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:15,507
Why?

959
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:21,763
Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.

960
01:35:22,806 --> 01:35:26,976
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

961
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:30,105
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

962
01:35:30,105 --> 01:35:32,190
He will lie to confuse us.

963
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:36,361
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

964
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:39,489
...to attack us.

965
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:42,617
The attack is psychological, Damien.

966
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,745
And powerful.

967
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:49,916
So don't listen. Remember that.
Do not listen!

968
01:35:52,002 --> 01:35:55,130
lt might be helpful
if l gave you some background...

969
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,258
...on the different personalities
Regan has manifested.

970
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:00,343
So far, l'd say there seem to be three.

971
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:03,471
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.

972
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:04,991
Stick your cock up her ass,
you mother-fucking worthless cocksucker!

973
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:07,077
Be silent!

974
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:24,803
''Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

975
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:28,973
''Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

976
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:32,102
''Give us this day our daily bread.

977
01:37:32,102 --> 01:37:34,187
''Forgive us our trespasses...

978
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:37,315
''...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

979
01:37:38,358 --> 01:37:40,443
''And lead us not into temptation...

980
01:37:40,443 --> 01:37:41,486
''...but deliver us from the evil one.

981
01:37:41,486 --> 01:37:45,657
''Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

982
01:37:47,742 --> 01:37:51,913
''Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

983
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:56,084
''...but God is my helper

984
01:37:57,127 --> 01:37:59,212

985
01:37:59,212 --> 01:38:01,297
''Glory be to the Father,

01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,468
''As it was in the beginning, is now
and ever shall be, world without end.''

987
01:38:05,468 --> 01:38:08,596
-''Save your servant.
-''Who places her trust in thee, my God.

988
01:38:08,596 --> 01:38:10,682
''Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.''

989
01:38:10,682 --> 01:38:12,767
''ln the face of the enemy...

990
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:14,853
''...let the enemy have no power over her.

''And the Son of lniquity
be powerless to harm her.''

992
01:38:16,938 --> 01:38:21,109
Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras!
You faithless slime!

993
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:22,152
''The Lord be with you.''

994
01:38:22,152 --> 01:38:24,237
-''And also with you.
