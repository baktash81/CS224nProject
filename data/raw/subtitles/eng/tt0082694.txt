1
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,682
My life fades...

2
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,768
...the vision dims.

3
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,813
All that remains are memories.

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,859
I remember... a time of chaos...

5
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,780
...ruined dreams... this wasted land.

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,994
But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior...

7
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,915
...the man we called Max.

8
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,086
To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time...

9
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,007
...when the world was powered
by the black fuel...

10
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:16,094
...and the deserts sprouted great cities
ofpipe and steel.

11
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,891
Gone now... swept away.

12
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,730
For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war...

13
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,734
...and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.

14
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:35,239
Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.

15
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,034
The thundering machines sputtered
and stopped.

16
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,415
Their leaders talked... and talked...
and talked...

17
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,631
...but nothing could stem the avalanche.

18
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,969
Their world crumbled...
the cities exploded.

19
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,557
A whirlwind of looting...

20
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,184
...a firestorm of fear.

21
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,521
Men began to feed on men.

22
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,985
On the roads it was a white-line nightmare.

23
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,697
Only those mobile enough to scavenge...

24
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,950
...brutal enough to pillage would survive.

25
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,245
The gangs took over the highways...

26
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,832
...ready to wage war for a tank of juice.

27
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,170
And in this maelstrom of decay...

28
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,882
...ordinary men were battered
and smashed.

29
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,925
Men like Max...

30
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,511
...the warrior Max.

31
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,559
In the roar of an engine,
he lost everything...

32
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,400
...and became a shell of a man...

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,028
...a burnt out, desolate man...

34
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,823
...a man haunted by the demons
of his past.

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,870
A man who wandered out
into the wasteland.

36
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:10,209
And it was here... in this blighted place...

37
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
...that he learned to live again.

38
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,184
Don't hurt the snake! Put it down...

39
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,937
...gently, gently... nice.

40
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,856
Now the iron.

41
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,236
The gun.

42
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,531
Down, down. Turn around.

43
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,464
Looks like I've got myself
some gasoline, eh?

44
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,383
V8? Eh?

45
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,011
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and boom!

46
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,480
Booby-trap! Back up!

47
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,443
Oh, you crafty little man, you!

48
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,321
You're quick... very quick.

49
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:42,035
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

50
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,291
Reflexes... that's what you've got.

51
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,920
Me... l've got brains.

52
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,471
A fella... a quick fella...

53
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,852
...might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

54
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,663
Don't play me the fool!

55
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,548
Gas! Fuel! Gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

56
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,926
- As much as you want!
- Where? Where?

57
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,346
20 miles from here!
Pumping it, they are! Refining!

58
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,891
- A huge tanker full.
- Crap!

59
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,976
No, it's true!

60
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,688
It's not self-service, no.
It's too hard for me...

61
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,149
...but a man of your ingenuity...

62
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,192
Where?

63
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,570
Kill me and you'll never find out!

64
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,758
Good dog.

65
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,677
Nice doggy, eh?

66
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,129
Well, there it is.

67
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,052
Four days I was up here.

68
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,973
Me and the snakes...
playing mah-jong, taking tea...

69
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,643
...watching, thinking...

70
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,606
...how was I going to get in
and get the gas?

71
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,359
Day and night it's pumping.

72
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,239
Fuel to burn.

73
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,535
They've got the lot:
Power, lights, you name it.

74
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,873
You can bet your life they mean to keep it.

75
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,709
Thirty of them in there.

76
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,170
Arrows, flame-throwers, guns!

77
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,007
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

78
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,552
Then this trash arrived...

79
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,597
...as moths to a flame.

80
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,308
Round and round, attack, attack...

81
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,687
...like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

82
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,957
In the tanker, that's where they keep it.

83
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,378
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

84
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,008
If anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

85
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,553
Me... l'm gonna feed the snakes.

86
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,686
A man lives by his word, I reckon.
I've kept mine, eh?

87
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,448
We had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

88
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,284
The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.

89
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,369
After all I've done for you...

90
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,622
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

91
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,903
Attack, my vermin, attack!

92
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,806
Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.

93
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,434
For the great glory of Humungus.

94
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,358
Smegma crazies to the left!

95
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,030
The gate! Gayboy berserkers to the gate!

96
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,121
I am your Lord.

97
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,336
Attack, my vermin, attack!

98
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,745
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

99
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,706
Save it.

100
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,625
I'm just here for the gasoline.

101
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,467
As much as you like.

102
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,678
Just take me back there.

103
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,102
Show your weapons and come forward!

104
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:24,733
Steady now!

105
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,695
Take it real easy!

106
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,157
That's as far as you go!

107
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,284
Turn around!

108
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,663
Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!

109
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,123
Lose them!

110
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,878
Open the gate!

111
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,427
Hurry up with that damned stretcher!

112
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,099
Hey, that's fine, that's fine.
Just stay there.

113
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,393
Cover him, cover him!

114
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,522
Come on! Quick, quick!

115
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,108
Oh, what a waste!

116
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,777
Watch his leg!

117
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,740
You and your handiwork!

118
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,909
He didn't stand a chance!

119
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,496
I warned him! You all heard me!
"Madness," I said.

120
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,708
"We can escape. Take our gas," he said.

121
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,470
Get that machine inside!

122
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,182
Close the damned gate!

123
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,870
Who are you?

124
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,998
How did you get through out there?

125
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:06,084
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

126
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,005
Two or three miles down the road
left for dead. We had a deal.

127
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,424
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

128
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,093
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

129
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,262
He said if I brought him back
you'd give me some gas.

130
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:20,849
- Now there's not much time.
- There was a woman in the car.

131
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,893
She's dead.

132
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,271
- What did they do?
- It was quick.

133
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,982
I just want my gas
and I want to get out of here.

134
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,818
For all we know he's one of them!
Give him nothing!

135
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,654
She's right, he's a parasite!

136
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,532
Trading in human flesh! Mercenary trash!

137
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,369
- We had an arrangement.
- What do you mean?

138
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,454
You talk to this man.

139
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,291
Try something! Try something!

140
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,474
If you had a contract, it was with him.

141
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,393
And it died with him.

142
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,144
Get rid of him!

143
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,063
Left!

144
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:19,032
Got to hand it to you, treasure!
The last of the V8 Interceptors!

145
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,909
A piece of history!

146
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,788
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

147
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:42,723
Here they come! Close the gates!
They're coming back!

148
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,379
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

149
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,925
For Christ's sake, hold your fire!

150
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:57,107
Greetings from The Humungus!

151
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,610
The Lord Humungus!

152
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,571
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

153
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,534
The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller!

154
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,624
I am gravely disappointed.

155
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,461
Again you have made me unleash my dogs
of war.

156
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,006
Look at what remains
ofyour gallant scouts.

157
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,635
Why? Because you're selfish!

158
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,596
You hoard your gasoline.

159
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,557
Don't listen to him!

160
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,143
Now, my prisoners say...

161
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,605
...you plan to take your gasoline
out of the Wasteland.

162
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,651
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

163
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,321
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

164
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:47,908
What a puny plan!

165
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,118
Look around you.

166
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,248
This is the Valley of Death.

167
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:55,791
See!

168
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,170
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the Wasteland!

169
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,965
Give them nothing! Blow it up!

170
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,679
Humungus will not be defied!

171
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,701
Wez! Wez!

172
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,879
I've got it! I've got it!

173
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,103
Quiet! Quiet! No more games!

174
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,648
No more games!

175
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,318
We're here for a purpose.

176
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,570
We come with an offer.

177
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,783
No! No more talk!

178
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,370
We go in! We kill!

179
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,623
We'll kill them!

180
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,143
Be still my dog of war!

181
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,646
I understand your pain.

182
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,274
We've all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way!

183
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,318
Losers wait!

184
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,779
We do it my way!

185
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,533
Fear is our ally... the gasoline will be ours.

186
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,204
Then, you shall have your revenge.

187
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,211
Take him away!

188
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:22,145
There has been too much violence,
too much pain.

189
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,607
None here are without sin.

190
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,111
But I have an honorable compromise.

191
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,572
Just walk away.

192
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,657
Give me the pump...

193
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:35,784
...the oil...

194
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,578
...the gasoline...

195
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,498
...and the whole compound,
and I'll spare your lives.

196
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,503
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the Wasteland.

197
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,966
Just walk away and there will be an end
to the horror.

198
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,432
I await your answer.

199
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,226
You have one full day to decide.

200
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,547
We'll never walk away!

201
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,050
Never!

202
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,490
You heard what he said!
It sounds reasonable!

203
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,326
We don't have to die!

204
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,995
All we have to do is walk away!

205
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,664
No! We've worked too hard!

206
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:08,085
It's simple! All we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives!

207
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,712
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us!

208
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,132
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs!

209
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,801
Don't listen to them!

210
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,886
All right, this is it!

211
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,639
I'll talk to this Humungus!

212
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,226
He's a reasonable man...

213
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,145
...open to negotiation.

214
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,399
He promised us safe passage!
He gave his word!

215
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,901
And let us suppose he keeps it...

216
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,281
...and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

217
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,602
But remember!

218
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:52,314
Remember one thing:
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

219
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:56,568
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

220
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,488
That's 2,000 miles from here!

221
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:03,534
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

222
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,578
If we have to, yes! There's always a way!

223
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,331
But the first step:

224
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,084
Defend the fuel.

225
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,461
Words!

226
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,672
Just words!

227
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,091
You'd die for a pipe dream!

228
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,468
We fight for a belief! I stay!

229
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,397
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

230
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,858
You can't expect to compete with that.

231
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,028
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished!

232
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,905
I'm sorry.

233
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:52,040
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that could haul that tanker.

234
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,670
If you wanna get out of here...
you talk to me.

235
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,179
Okay, so that's my offer.

236
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,639
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker...

237
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,351
...you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

238
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,979
We lost eight good people this morning.

239
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,025
What's he got in mind?

240
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:21,612
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel...

241
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,947
...and some high-octane gasoline.

242
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,494
Think of it as a down payment.

243
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,289
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

244
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,708
He has to come back for his wheels.

245
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,668
What have we got to lose?

246
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,297
You've got yourself a deal.

247
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,367
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

248
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,794
Come on, dog.

249
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,096
You know what I miss most of all?
Clean women.

250
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,183
Nail polish, perfume...

251
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:05,854
...the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails...

252
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,774
- Shut up!
...desserts.

253
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,985
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

254
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,917
I knew it! I knew it would work!

255
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,170
Lethal! Lethal these snakes. Born killers.

256
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,219
It's my snake! I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it!

257
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,930
So find your own! Get out of it!

258
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:43,976
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

259
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,812
Fricassee of reptile.

260
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,857
Better than your dog food!

261
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,234
Pure protein...

262
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:56,154
...minerals, vitamins.
A man's gotta look after himself.

263
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,992
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

264
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:03,120
You are what you eat, I reckon.

265
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:04,580
Get away!

266
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:07,916
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

267
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,793
No style, no taste.

268
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,338
Empty!

269
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,674
All this time!

270
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:22,139
That's dishonest... low!

271
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,146
Let's have a look at this machine of yours.

272
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:32,149
How do I know that one's not a dud?

273
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,401
Find out.

274
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,824
You've got to understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

275
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,618
Shut up, shut up!

276
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:30,582
What about me?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

277
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:35,879
Do what you want.

278
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,508
We're partners!

279
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,269
You and me, we're partners!

280
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,647
Partners!

281
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,509
Go! Go!

282
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,512
My dogs, run! The gate!

283
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:42,394
The gate! The gate!

284
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:06,937
You! You can run...

285
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,189
...but you can't hide!

286
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:36,842
You did a great job.

287
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,390
Don't go overboard now.

288
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:47,644
Don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

289
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,158
Don't touch!

290
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:14,379
Tell me, son... this machine of yours...

291
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,591
...it can take two, can it?

292
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:20,928
Possibly.

293
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,103
I'm okay. Just get them organized.
We're moving out tonight.

294
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:37,361
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

295
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,239
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

296
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:43,075
Timbo, Derek... Pappagallo's been hurt.

297
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,994
How's the rig?

298
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,747
The rig. How is she?

299
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:52,417
Cracked timing case cover. It's broken
a couple of teeth off the timing gears.

300
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,587
Got a cracked timing case cover.
It's broken...

301
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:58,215
...a couple of teeth off the timing gear.

302
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,759
The radiator's damaged at the core.

303
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:03,679
It's got a cracked water pump.

304
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,849
It's got a fractured injector line.

305
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,392
Well, what does all that mean?

306
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,727
Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

307
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,814
- What does that mean?
- Twenty-four hours!

308
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,234
They got twelve!

309
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:19,653
You've got twelve!

310
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,623
Listen, I was wrong about you...

311
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:33,917
...and I'm sorry.

312
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,854
It's a long time since
I've seen driving like that, man.

313
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,939
You're okay by me, son.

314
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:59,693
With you driving that rig, we got it licked!
Nice to have you aboard.

315
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:02,613
I've been saving these.
I want you to have them.

316
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,452
Thank you, and welcome.

317
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:15,125
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

318
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,985
You have defied me! You will know...

319
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,490
...the vengeance of The Lord Humungus!

320
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:49,284
I promise you...

321
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,204
...nobody, nobody...

322
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,916
...gets out of here alive!

323
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:50,470
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums?

324
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,514
Come on!

325
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,941
Come on with the drums, come on!

326
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,526
What's wrong? Come on.

327
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,863
It just seems wrong
sneaking away like this.

328
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:57,204
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

329
00:58:58,205 --> 00:58:59,706
I know I did.

330
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,461
Look, you're scared now.
Come on, it'll be much safer up there.

331
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:06,797
What are we waiting for, eh?

332
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,467
This is my family.

333
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,513
I'm not going to leave these people.

334
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:17,307
I'm staying.

335
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:20,477
I'm sorry.

336
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,923
Come on, I'll show you!

337
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,177
I told you. He's leaving.

338
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:01,226
Look, I don't have time for long speeches,
I want you to drive the tanker.

339
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:04,396
Sorry.

340
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,984
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

341
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,695
We'll make a new contract.

342
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,784
I've got all I need here.

343
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,206
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

344
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,709
Buy a ticket for 2,000 miles.

345
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:30,047
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise!

346
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,217
2,000 miles from here.

347
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,094
Fresh water, plenty of sunshine...

348
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,472
Nothing to do but breed.

349
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,391
No thanks.

350
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:45,270
What is it with you?
What are you looking for?

351
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:48,774
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

352
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,568
You happy out there, are you?

353
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:55,030
Eh? Wandering...
one day blurring into another?

354
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,033
You're a scavenger, Max. You're a maggot.

355
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,955
Do you know that? You're living
off the corpse of the old world.

356
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:07,209
Tell me your story, Max.
What burned you out, huh?

357
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,672
Kill one man too many? See too many
people die? Lose some family?

358
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:16,343
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

359
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,053
Listen to me.

360
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,245
Do you think you're the only one
that's suffered?

361
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:47,374
We've all been through it in here,
but we haven't given up.

362
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,420
We're still human beings with dignity.

363
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,882
But you, you're out there with the garbage.

364
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,634
You're nothing!

365
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,802
Get out, kid!

366
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,849
Go on, get out of here.

367
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:09,706
Go on, get out. Scat! Get out!

368
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:43,365
You're letting him go?

369
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,036
Well, let's keep his vehicle at least.

370
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:51,582
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

371
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:56,211
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

372
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:58,630
I am.

373
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:28,160
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

374
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:30,662
Stupid, maybe, but not a coward.

375
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:34,333
You're making a serious mistake...

376
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,169
...splitting a great team.

377
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,173
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

378
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:44,218
See you around, maybe.
Good-bye, good luck.

379
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:12,996
We go!

380
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,759
You disobey me! You puppy!

381
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:31,575
Toadie, the gas! Hurry up!

382
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:38,415
Don't waste him! If he's alive...

383
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,084
...I want him!

384
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:15,327
The tanks are full, O mighty Wez,
and it's all yours.

385
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,633
It's all over. Let's go!

386
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:27,316
Look! Out there.

387
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,784
Oh, hell!

388
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,164
You blew it, you fool!

389
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:00,993
Relax, partner!

390
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,425
I'll be driving the tanker.

391
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,012
We're going to crash or crash through.

392
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:49,560
Now, at this point, that's all they want:
The tanker.

393
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:52,104
So they'll come straight after us.

394
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:55,148
So we'll use that to punch our way out...

395
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,652
...which will give all of you a very,
very good chance.

396
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:00,404
Now, don't hesitate!

397
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:04,575
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

398
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:08,120
Now, 200 miles to the north...

399
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:11,999
...there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

400
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,169
That's our rendezvous.

401
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,505
Give us till sunset.

402
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:22,426
If we haven't made it by then... keep going.

403
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:25,929
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride.

404
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:27,598
You're not coming on this tanker!

405
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,017
I sweated blood on this.
No bastard's gonna to tell me...

406
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,520
...to ride in no lousy school bus!
- Okay, settle down!

407
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,647
If it's all the same to you...

408
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,401
...l'll drive that tanker.

409
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:43,780
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

410
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:48,035
No deals. I want to drive the truck.

411
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:51,288
Why? Why the big change of heart?

412
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,582
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

413
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:56,001
And how do you think you'll do it?

414
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:59,963
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair!

415
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:04,176
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

416
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,346
Come on, cut the crap!

417
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:11,683
I'm the best chance you've got.

418
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:21,860
Right, let's get moving!

419
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,851
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

420
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,512
Shit!

421
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:10,125
Go! Go!

422
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,534
I'm all right! I'm all right!

423
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,159
Come on! Come on!

424
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:07,154
The tire! Shoot the tire!

425
01:25:40,641 --> 01:25:42,476
Boy! Come on, jump!

426
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,316
We've won!

427
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:51,193
It's over, boy.

428
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,431
Get the bullet!

429
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:50,479
Get the shell.

430
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,658
And so began thejourney north...
to safety...

431
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:34,286
...to our place in the sun.

432
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:38,582
Among us we found a new leader:
The man who came from the sky...

433
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,626
...the Gyro Captain.

434
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:43,462
And just as Pappagallo had planned...

435
01:31:43,629 --> 01:31:47,257
...we traveled far beyond the reach
of men on machines.

436
01:31:47,799 --> 01:31:51,595
The juice, the precious juice,
was hidden in the vehicles.

437
01:31:53,305 --> 01:31:55,682
As for me, I grew to manhood...

438
01:31:56,308 --> 01:31:59,478
...and in the fullness of time,
I became the leader...

439
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:02,314
...the Chief of the Great Northern Tribe.

440
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:05,776
And the Road Warrior?

441
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:09,321
That was the last we ever saw of him.

442
01:32:10,614 --> 01:32:12,199
He lives now...

443
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:15,536
...only in my memories.

444
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:29,383
