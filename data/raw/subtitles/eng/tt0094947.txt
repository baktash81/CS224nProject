1
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,019
Sequence.

2
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,357
Well, my dear.

3
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,568
So how are you adapting
to the outside world?

4
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,986
Very well, I think.

5
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:44,116
I've advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to.

6
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,872
So we must see what we can devise
for your amusement.

7
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,092
Valmont is here.

8
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,594
You receive him, do you?

9
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,097
Yes.

10
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,890
So do you.

11
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,896
Monsieur le Vicomte de Valmont, my child...

12
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,399
whom you very probably don't remember...

13
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,943
except that he is conspicuously charming...

14
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:23,155
never opens his mouth
without first calculating what damage he can do.

15
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,658
Then why do you receive him, <i>maman?</i>

16
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,077
Everyone receives him.

17
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,512
- Madame.
- Vicomte.

18
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,556
What a pleasant surprise.

19
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,934
Madame de Volanges.
How delightful to see you.

20
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,896
You remember my daughter, Cécile?

21
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,109
Well, indeed, but who could have foretold
she would flower so gracefully?

22
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,697
I wanted to call on you
before leaving the city.

23
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,993
I'm not sure we can allow that.
Why should you want to leave?

24
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,120
Paris in August, you know...

25
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,372
and it's time I paid a visit on my aunt.

26
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,624
I've neglected her disgracefully.

27
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,628
Madame de Rosemonde has been good enough
to invite us to stay at the château.

28
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,506
Won't you please give her
our warmest regards?

29
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,134
I shall make a point of it, madame.

30
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,138
I think it's time we took you home.

31
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,808
I'm used to being in bed
by 9 at the convent.

32
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,060
So I should hope.

33
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,608
Madame.

34
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,413
Your aunt?

35
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,915
That's correct.

36
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,086
I thought she'd already made arrangements
to leave you all her money.

37
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,009
Do you know why I summoned you
here this evening?

38
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,012
I'd hoped it might be
for the pleasure of my company.

39
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,722
I need you...

40
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,308
to carry out an heroic enterprise.

41
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,229
You remember when Bastide left me?

42
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,190
- Yes.
- Went off with that fat mistress of yours...

43
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,734
- whose name escapes me.
- Yes, yes.

44
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,821
No one has ever done that to me before.
Or to you, I suspect.

45
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,448
I was quite relieved to be rid of her, frankly.

46
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,783
No, you weren't.

47
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,623
For some years now,
Bastide has been searching for a wife.

48
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,378
He was always unshakably prejudiced
in favor of convent education.

49
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,964
And now he's found the ideal candidate.

50
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>Cécile Volanges.</i>

51
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,386
<i>Very good.</i>

52
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,474
<i>And her 60,000 a year.</i>

53
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,186
<i>That must have played some small part
in Bastide's calculations.</i>

54
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,522
<i>None whatsoever.</i>

55
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,233
<i>Bastide's priority, you see...</i>

56
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,986
<i>is a guaranteed virtue.</i>

57
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,697
<i>I wonder if I'm beginning to guess...</i>

58
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,449
<i>what it is you're intending to propose.</i>

59
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,372
<i>Bastide is with his regiment in Corsica
for the rest of the year.</i>

60
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,416
<i>That should give you plenty of time.</i>

61
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,670
You mean to...?

62
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,716
- She's a rosebud.
- You think so?

63
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,718
And he'd get back from his honeymoon...

64
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,095
to find himself the laughing stock of Paris.

65
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,431
- Well....
- Yes.

66
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,685
Love and revenge.
Two of your favorites.

67
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,940
No, I can't.

68
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,110
- What?
- Oh really, I can't.

69
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,738
- Why not?
- Oh, it's too easy.

70
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,743
It is. She's seen nothing.

71
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,746
She knows nothing.
She's bound to be curious.

72
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,122
She'd be on her back...

73
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,292
before you'd unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers.

74
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,254
Any one of a dozen men could manage it.

75
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,965
I have my reputation to think of.

76
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,352
I can see I'm going to have
to tell you everything.

77
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,229
- Of course you are.
- Yes.

78
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,107
My aunt is not on her own
just at the moment.

79
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,652
She has a young friend staying with her.

80
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,988
<i>Madame de Tourvel.</i>

81
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,869
You can't mean it.

82
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,665
To seduce a woman famous for strict morals...

83
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,001
religious fervor
and the happiness of her marriage....

84
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,921
What could possibly be more prestigious?

85
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,092
I think there's something degrading
about having a husband for a rival.

86
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,012
It's humiliating if you fail,
and commonplace if you succeed.

87
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,765
<i>Where is Monsieur de Tourvel anyway?</i>

88
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>Presiding over some endless case in Burgundy.</i>

89
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,853
<i>I don't think you can hope
for any actual pleasure.</i>

90
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,146
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

91
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,401
You see, I have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices.

92
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,530
I want her to believe in God and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage...

93
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,241
and still not be able to stop herself.

94
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,162
I want the excitement of watching her...

95
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,124
betray everything that's most important to her.

96
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,209
Surely you understand that.

97
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,545
I thought "betrayal" was your favorite word.

98
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,297
No, no...

99
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,549
"cruelty."

100
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,928
I always think that has a nobler ring to it.

101
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,731
- How is Belleroche?
- I'm very pleased with him.

102
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,233
And is he your only lover?

103
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,695
Yes.

104
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,325
I think you should take another.
I think it most unhealthy, this exclusivity.

105
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,577
- You're not jealous, are you?
- Of course I am.

106
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,495
Belleroche is completely undeserving.

107
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,581
I thought he was one of your friends.

108
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,208
Exactly, so I know what I'm talking about.

109
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,632
No, I think you should organize an infidelity.

110
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,968
With me, for example.

111
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,892
You refuse me a simple favor...

112
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,935
then you expect to be indulged?

113
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,898
It's only because it is so simple.
It wouldn't feel like a conquest.

114
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,525
I have to follow my destiny.

115
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,277
I have to be true...

116
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,780
to my profession.

117
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,287
All right, then.

118
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,583
Come back when you've succeeded
with Madame de Tourvel.

119
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,004
- Yes.
- And I will offer you...

120
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,215
a reward.

121
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,883
My love.

122
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,636
But I shall require proof.

123
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,471
Certainly.

124
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,431
Written proof.

125
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,561
Not negotiable.

126
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,489
I don't suppose there's
any possibility of an advance?

127
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,537
Goodnight, Vicomte.

128
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,560
Oh, where have you been?

129
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,274
Time has no logic when I'm not with you.

130
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,276
An hour is like a century.

131
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,530
I've told you before,
we shall get on a great deal better...

132
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:06,034
if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel.

133
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,053
It's such a beautiful day,
I believe we'll walk.

134
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,930
Yes, my lady.

135
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,852
You didn't take the sacrament today.

136
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,270
No.

137
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,439
May I ask why?

138
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,444
I have this appalling reputation,
as you may know.

139
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,738
Yes, I have been warned about you.

140
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,782
You have? By whom?

141
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,952
A friend.

142
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,417
The fact is I've spent my life
surrounded by immoral people.

143
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,962
I've allowed myself to be influenced by them...

144
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,298
and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them.

145
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,300
- And now?
- Now...

146
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,804
what I most often feel is unworthiness.

147
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,684
But it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy.

148
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:03,735
I certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself.

149
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,520
Chevalier...

150
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,524
I don't believe you know my cousin,
Madame de Volanges.

151
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,151
This is Chevalier Danceny.

152
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,654
And Madame's daughter, Cécile.

153
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,948
Tell us what we should think of the opera.

154
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,994
It's sublime, don't you find?

155
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,039
Monsieur Danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics...

156
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,750
who come here to listen to the music.

157
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,423
I do look forward to our next meeting.

158
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,975
Charming young man...

159
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,936
penniless, regrettably.

160
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,107
He's one of the finest music teachers in the city.

161
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,028
Perhaps you should employ him.

162
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,656
How are you getting on
with Madame de Tourvel's maid?

163
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,325
To tell you the truth,
it's been a bit boring.

164
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,121
If I wasn't so anxious to keep Your Lordship abreast,
I'd have only bothered the once.

165
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,082
Still, what else is there to do
in the country?

166
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,170
It wasn't so much the details
of your intimacy I was after...

167
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,174
it's whether or not she's agreed
to bring me Madame de Tourvel's letters.

168
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,010
- She won't steal the letters, sir.
- She won't?

169
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,180
You know better than me.
It's easy making them do what they want.

170
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,308
It's getting them to do what you want
that gives you a headache.

171
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,018
And them, as often as not.

172
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,270
I need to know who's writing to her about me.

173
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,522
I shouldn't worry if I was you, sir.

174
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,318
She told Julie she didn't believe
you went hunting in the mornings.

175
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,029
She said she was gonna have you followed.

176
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,032
So I'd say it was only a matter of time.

177
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,212
That is a terrible noise he's making.

178
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,881
He should get the news back to her
twice as quickly.

179
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,467
I don't think we should make it
too easy for him.

180
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,445
What exactly do you think you're doing?

181
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,823
I am impounding these effects, sir.

182
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,451
Has it not been explained to you?
Monsieur Armand is not well.

183
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,579
I don't make the laws, sir.
I just do what I'm told.

184
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,373
Everybody has to pay his taxes.

185
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,041
How much does he owe?

186
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,043
- Well, uh....
- How much?

187
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,419
Fifty-six livres.

188
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,922
- Pay him.
- Yes, my lord.

189
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,598
Monsieur Armand....

190
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,892
Excuse me, you don't know me.

191
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,395
Of course I do, Monsieur le Vicomte.

192
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,604
Please, don't get up.

193
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,858
- I have to. They're taking the bed.
- No, not at all.

194
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,610
No one's taking anything.

195
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,453
Please, please, please....

196
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,171
Me! Please. Please, sir. Please....

197
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,134
Just to tide you over. I insist.

198
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
Me, sir....

199
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,141
Fifty-six livres to save
an entire family from ruin.

200
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,143
That seems a genuine bargain.

201
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,478
These days, you can find
half a dozen like that...

202
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,981
- any village in the country.
- Really?

203
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,275
I must say the family was very well chosen.

204
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,985
Solidly respectable...

205
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,989
gratifyingly tearful,
no suspiciously pretty girls. Well done.

206
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,616
I do my best for you, sir.

207
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,826
That humble gratitude.
It was most affecting.

208
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,661
Certainly brought a tear to my eye.

209
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,830
Dijon? That's from her husband.

210
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,505
This must be from that
officious friend of hers.

211
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,597
Tell me, where do you and Julie meet?

212
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,349
Oh, in my room, sir.

213
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,602
- And is she coming tonight?
- Afraid so.

214
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,688
I think I may be forced
to burst in on you.

215
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,900
See if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery.

216
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,568
About 2:00 suit you?

217
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,863
I don't want to embarrass you.
Will that give you enough time?

218
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,657
Ample, sir.

219
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,081
Is this true about Monsieur Armand?

220
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,084
I don't believe I know anyone of that name.

221
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,712
You may as well own up.
My footman happened to be passing...

222
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,923
when you were in the village this morning.

223
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,218
I don't think you should pay
too much attention to servants' gossip.

224
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,387
It is true, isn't it?

225
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,890
Well...

226
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,726
yes. It is.

227
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,689
You dear boy,
come and let me give you a hug.

228
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,095
I can't understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous...

229
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,097
could lead such a dissolute life.

230
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,892
I'm afraid you have an exaggerated idea...

231
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,271
both of my generosity
and of my depravity.

232
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,733
If I knew who'd given you
such a dire account of me....

233
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,779
Since I don't...

234
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,533
let me make a confession.

235
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:53,788
I'm afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character.

236
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:58,293
I can't see how so thoughtful an act of charity
could be described as weak.

237
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,128
Because it was simply a response...

238
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,630
to a strong new influence in my life.

239
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,132
Yours.

240
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,185
You see how weak I am?

241
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,064
I promised myself
I was never going to tell you.

242
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,316
It's just that looking at you....

243
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,736
You needn't worry.
I have no illicit intentions.

244
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,572
I would not dream of insulting you.

245
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,660
But I do love you.

246
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,455
I adore you.

247
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,459
Please, help me.

248
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,393
- I rang a number of times.
- Didn't hear, sir.

249
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,521
- I require some hot water.
- Right away, sir.

250
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,565
Don't move.

251
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,863
- Azolan....
- Sir?

252
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,906
Wait for me in my room.

253
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,911
You know I can't condone
this sort of behavior.

254
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,079
I know, sir.

255
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,166
- But you may rely on my discretion.
- Thank you, sir.

256
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,752
Providing, of course,
that you agree to my price.

257
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,683
No, no. Nothing like that.

258
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,936
No, all I want is
to get to see every letter...

259
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,106
that Madame de Tourvel
has received since her arrival here...

260
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,234
and every letter she writes
from now on.

261
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,071
- But sir, I can't--
- Deliver them to Azolan by midnight.

262
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,783
For your trouble.

263
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,311
Would it be very wrong of me
to answer Monsieur Danceny's letters?

264
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,690
- In the circumstances, yes.
- In what circumstances?

265
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,359
It's not my place to tell you this, my dear...

266
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,820
if I hadn't become so fond of you....

267
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,154
Go on, please.

268
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,365
Your marriage has been arranged.

269
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,535
- Who is it?
- Oh, someone I know slightly.

270
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,203
Monsieur le Comte de Bastide.

271
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,080
- What's he like?
- Well....

272
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,290
You don't like him?

273
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,376
Oh, it's not that.
He's a man of somewhat erratic judgment.

274
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,420
- And rather serious.
- How old is he?

275
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,383
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-six! He's an old man.

276
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,677
Do you know when?

277
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,305
In the new year, I believe.

278
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,892
Maybe there's a way to let you
write to Monsieur Danceny.

279
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,728
Oh, madame.

280
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,609
If you were to let me see
both sides of the correspondence...

281
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,570
I could reassure myself.

282
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,073
But I can't show you the letters
I've already sent him.

283
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,308
I trust you slept well, madame.
I wish I could say that I had.

284
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,561
I thought the least I could hope for
was that you would respect me.

285
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,771
But I do, of course!

286
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,023
You've offended me deeply.
It's unforgivable.

287
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,234
This confirms everything
I've been told about you.

288
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm beginning to think
you may have planned the whole exercise.

289
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,407
I had no idea you were staying here.

290
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,911
Not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if I had known.

291
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,956
You see, until I met you,
I had only ever experienced desire.

292
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,125
Love, never.

293
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,545
- That's enough.
- No, no. You've made an accusation.

294
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,298
You must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself.

295
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,093
I'm not going to deny
that I was aware of your beauty...

296
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,472
but the point is,
this has nothing to do with your beauty.

297
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,641
As I got to know you,
I began to realize...

298
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,976
that beauty was the least
of your qualities.

299
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,312
I became fascinated by your goodness.

300
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,147
I was drawn in by it.

301
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,483
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

302
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,153
It was only when I began to feel
actual physical pain...

303
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,905
every time you left the room...

304
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,491
that it finally dawned on me.
I was in love.

305
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,160
For the first time in my life
I knew it was hopeless...

306
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,829
but that didn't matter to me.

307
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,959
It's not that I want to have you,
all I want is to deserve you.

308
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,794
Tell me what to do.

309
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,463
Show me how to behave.
I'll do anything you say.

310
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,885
Very well, then.
I would like you to leave this house.

311
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,515
I don't see why that should be necessary.

312
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,935
Let's just say you've spent
your whole life making it necessary.

313
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,147
And if you refuse,
I shall be forced to leave myself.

314
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,275
Well then, of course, whatever you say.

315
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,360
Thank you.

316
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,620
Perhaps I might be so bold
as to ask a favor in return?

317
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,956
I think it would only be
just to let me know...

318
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,250
which of your friends
has blackened my name.

319
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,627
If friends of mine
have warned me against you...

320
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,796
I could hardly reward them with betrayal.

321
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,048
I must say,
you devalue your generous offer...

322
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,760
- if you use it as a bargaining point.
- Very well, I withdraw the request.

323
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,389
I hope you won't think I'm bargaining
if I ask you to let me write to you.

324
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,809
And pray that you will do me
the kindness of answering my letters.

325
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,730
A correspondence with you is not something
a woman of honor could permit herself.

326
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,483
You're determined to refuse my suggestions.

327
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,902
- I didn't say that.
- And you'd rather be unjust...

328
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,070
than risk showing me a touch of kindness?

329
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,323
I would welcome the chance
to prove to you...

330
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,659
that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but--

331
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,328
But what?

332
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,192
Listen to this:

333
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,112
"He knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk...

334
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,240
and guarantees his own security...

335
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:12,620
by tormenting only
the safest kind of victim: women."

336
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,294
Madame de Volanges.

337
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,469
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye, dear boy.

338
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,644
- Monsieur, please....
- I'll write soon.

339
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,500
My dear Madame de Tourvel...

340
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,838
I have just come--

341
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,841
Don't move, I said.

342
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,512
--to my desk...

343
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,184
in the middle of a stormy night...

344
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,271
during which...

345
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,941
I have been...

346
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,527
tossed...

347
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,948
<i>from exultation...</i>

348
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,868
<i>to exhaustion...</i>

349
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,370
<i>and back again.</i>

350
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,540
<i>Yet, despite these torments...</i>

351
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,711
<i>I guarantee that at this moment...</i>

352
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:48,257
<i>I am far happier than you.</i>

353
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,809
We'll finish it later, shall we?

354
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,610
Your damned cousin, the Volanges bitch...

355
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,654
wanted me away from Madame de Tourvel.

356
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,907
Well, now I am, and I intend
to make her suffer for it.

357
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:18,579
Your plan, to ruin her daughter,
are you making any progress?

358
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,625
Is there anything I can do to help?

359
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,419
I'm entirely at your disposal.

360
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,799
Well, yes.

361
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,470
I told Danceny you would act
as his confidant and adviser.

362
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,641
I need you to stiffen his resolve,
if that's the phrase.

363
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,687
I thought if anyone could help him--

364
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,356
Help? He doesn't need help,
he needs hindrances.

365
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:49,485
If he has to climb over enough of them,
he might inadvertently fall on top of her.

366
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,155
I take it he hasn't been a great success.

367
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,074
He's been disastrous.

368
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,327
Like most intellectuals,
he's intensely stupid.

369
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,584
I often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself.

370
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,213
I had no choice, did I?
I'm a woman.

371
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,634
Women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men.

372
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,264
You can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few well-chosen words.

373
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:21,267
So, of course,
I had to invent not only myself...

374
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:25,312
but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before.

375
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,566
And I've succeeded because...

376
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:35,156
I've always known I was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own.

377
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,493
Yes, but what I ask was, how?

378
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,836
When I came out into society I was 15.

379
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,923
I already knew that the role
I was condemned to...

380
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,885
namely, to keep quiet
and do what I was told...

381
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,805
gave me the perfect opportunity
to listen and observe.

382
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,893
Not to what people told me,
which naturally was of no interest...

383
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,855
but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide.

384
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,025
I practiced detachment.

385
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,111
I learned how to look cheerful
while under the table...

386
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,281
I stuck a fork into the back of my hand.

387
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,326
I became...

388
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,537
a virtuoso of deceit.

389
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,415
It wasn't pleasure I was after,
it was knowledge.

390
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:31,253
I consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear.

391
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,506
Philosophers, to find out what to think.

392
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,967
And novelists, to see
what I could get away with.

393
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:42,598
And in the end I distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle...

394
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,435
win or die.

395
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,439
So you're infallible, are you?

396
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,859
If I want a man, I have him.

397
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,196
If he wants to tell,
he finds that he can't.

398
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,575
That's the whole story.

399
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,161
And was that our story?

400
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,377
I wanted you before we'd ever met.

401
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,338
My self-esteem demanded it.

402
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,092
Then when you began to pursue me...

403
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,678
I wanted you so badly.

404
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:27,434
It's the only time I have ever
been controlled by my desire.

405
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,730
Single combat.

406
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,754
Madame de Volanges.

407
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,224
Your note said it was urgent.

408
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,978
It's days now. I haven't been able
to think of anything else.

409
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,190
Please, sit down.
I have reason to believe...

410
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,861
that a--
Oh, how should I describe it?

411
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:24,700
That a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter...

412
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,369
and the Chevalier Danceny.

413
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,873
Oh, no, that's completely absurd.

414
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,461
Cécile is still a child.
She understands nothing of these things.

415
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:39,214
And Danceny is an entirely
respectable young man.

416
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,300
Tell me...

417
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,345
does Cécile have a great many correspondents?

418
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,846
Why do you ask?

419
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,349
I went to her room
at the beginning of this week.

420
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,684
I simply knocked on the door and entered.

421
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,311
She was stuffing an envelope...

422
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,272
into the top right-hand drawer
of her bureau...

423
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,274
in which I couldn't help noticing...

424
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,194
there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters.

425
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,951
I am most grateful to you.

426
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,333
Would you think it impertinent
if I were to make another suggestion?

427
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,751
No, no.

428
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,670
If my recollection is correct...

429
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,422
I overheard you saying
to the Vicomte de Valmont...

430
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,801
that his aunt invited you and Cécile
to stay at her château.

431
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,054
She has, yes, repeatedly.

432
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,561
A spell in the country
might be the very thing.

433
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,860
Thank you.

434
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,914
You asked for hindrances.

435
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,418
You are a genuinely wicked woman.

436
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,962
And you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer.

437
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,090
- I can't resist you.
- I made it easy for you.

438
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,677
But all this is most inconvenient.

439
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,807
The Comtesse de Beaulieu
has invited me to stay.

440
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,351
Well, you will just have to put her off.

441
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,939
Well, the Comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens.

442
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,776
It seems her husband's fingers
are not as green as they once were.

443
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,278
Maybe not.

444
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,781
But from what I hear,
all his friends are gardeners.

445
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,616
Is that so?

446
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,869
You want your revenge,
I want my revenge.

447
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,705
I'm afraid there's only one place
you can go.

448
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,916
- Back to Auntie, eh?
- Back to Auntie.

449
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,628
Where you can also pursue
that other matter.

450
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,465
You have some evidence to procure,
have you not?

451
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,598
Don't you think it would be
a generous gesture...

452
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:55,684
to show the proper confidence
in my abilities...

453
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,687
if we were to take
that evidence for granted?

454
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,899
I need it in writing, Vicomte.

455
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,696
- Now you must leave me.
- Must I? Why?

456
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,240
- Because I'm hungry.
- Yes?

457
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,493
I have quite an appetite myself.

458
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,246
Then go home and eat.

459
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,419
In writing.

460
00:41:56,973 --> 00:42:01,185
You'll be pleased to hear, my dear,
that Armand is on his feet again...

461
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,103
and back at work.

462
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,110
Who?

463
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,488
Monsieur Armand!

464
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,784
Whose family you helped so generously.

465
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,995
Oh, yes!

466
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:24,208
When my nephew was last here
we discovered, quite by chance...

467
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,420
- that he had gone into the village--
- Are you all right, madame?

468
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,590
I'm sorry to interrupt, Aunt.
It seemed to me, all of a sudden...

469
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,009
that Madame de Tourvel
didn't look at all well.

470
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,303
- I'm quite all right.
- Perhaps some fresh air.

471
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,888
Do you feel constricted?

472
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,557
I feel sure Madame de Volanges is right,
as usual.

473
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,017
A turn around the grounds.

474
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,688
Yes, a little walk in the garden.
It's not too cool, I think.

475
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,274
Fresh air will do you the world of good.

476
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,777
That meal was somewhat heavy, perhaps.

477
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,405
I can't believe that was the cause.

478
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,699
Come back for it.

479
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,423
Mademoiselle.

480
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,010
I've no wish to arouse suspicion,
so I'll be brief.

481
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,680
The letter is from the Chevalier Danceny.

482
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,183
- Yes, I thought--
- Now, the handing over of such letters...

483
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,228
is a far-from-easy matter to accomplish.

484
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:30,107
I cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day.

485
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,608
So....

486
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:37,155
This key resembles your bedroom key,
which is kept in your mother's room...

487
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,449
on the mantelpiece,
tied with a blue ribbon.

488
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,326
Take it, go attach the blue ribbon...

489
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,870
and put it in the place
of your bedroom key.

490
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,332
Bring it to me and I will get a copy
cut within two hours.

491
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,876
I can collect your letters
and deliver Danceny's...

492
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,254
without any complications.

493
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,257
Now, in the cupboard by your bed...

494
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,884
you'll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil...

495
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,930
so that you may oil the lock and hinges
on the ante-room door.

496
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,559
- Are you sure, monsieur?
- Trust me.

497
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,231
Believe me, mademoiselle...

498
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:16,153
if there's one thing I can't abide,
it's deceitfulness.

499
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,513
I trust you are feeling a little better, madame.

500
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:56,526
If I were ill, monsieur,
it would not be difficult to guess who was responsible.

501
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,823
You can't mean me, do you?

502
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,368
- You promised to leave here.
- And I did.

503
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,287
Would you excuse me, madame?

504
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,640
Quick, your mother.

505
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,778
What are you doing?

506
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,448
I just came up to fetch your shawl.

507
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,878
Why are you so angry with me?

508
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,548
All I can offer you is my friendship.
Can't you accept it?

509
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,885
I could pretend to,
but that would be dishonest.

510
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,513
The man I used to be
would have been content with friendship...

511
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,766
and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage.

512
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,144
But I have changed now.

513
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:59,024
I can't conceal from you that
I love you tenderly, passionately...

514
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,319
and above all, respectfully.

515
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,241
So how am I to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend?

516
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,828
Not that you're even pretending
to show friendship.

517
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,248
- What do you mean?
- Well, is this friendly?

518
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:21,046
Why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind?

519
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,805
You were wrong to feel threatened by me, madame.

520
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,976
Your happiness is far more important to me
than my own.

521
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:39,022
That is what I mean
when I say that I love you.

522
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,317
I think we should end this conversation.

523
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,445
I shall leave you in possession of the field.

524
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,660
But look....

525
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,288
We are to be living under the same roof,
at least for a few days.

526
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,250
Surely we don't have to try
to avoid each other?

527
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,044
Of course not.

528
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,297
Provided you adhere to my few simple rules.

529
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:08,301
I shall obey you in this as in everything.

530
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,435
Monsieur....

531
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,064
What?

532
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,733
Nothing.

533
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,601
Nothing to worry about.

534
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,772
- Have you brought a letter?
- No.

535
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,649
Then what...?

536
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,909
What are you going to tell your mother?

537
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:59,454
How will you explain the fact
that I have your key?

538
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,748
If I tell her I'm here at your invitation...

539
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,001
I have a feeling she'll believe me.

540
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,632
What do you want?

541
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,425
Well, I don't know.

542
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,389
- What do you think?
- No!

543
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,933
All right. All right.

544
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,477
I just want you to give me a kiss.

545
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,982
- A kiss?
- That's all.

546
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,985
- Then will you go?
- Then I'll go.

547
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,988
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

548
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,409
All right.

549
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,552
All right?

550
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,304
Very nice.

551
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,515
No, I mean, will you go now?

552
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,392
Oh, I don't think so.

553
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,605
- But you promised.
- I promised to go when you gave me a kiss.

554
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,567
You didn't give me a kiss.
I gave you a kiss.

555
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,569
Not the same thing at all.

556
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,363
And if I give you a kiss...?

557
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,701
Let's just get ourselves more comfortable,
shall we?

558
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,900
I better see what's wrong,
if you will excuse me.

559
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,860
Of course, my dear.

560
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,361
I shouldn't worry, madame.

561
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:59,032
The young have such
miraculous powers of recuperation.

562
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,702
I'm sure she'll soon
be back in the saddle.

563
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,241
<i>Who else can I turn to
in my desperation, madame?</i>

564
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,619
<i>And how can I write the necessary words?</i>

565
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,649
There's something going on,
and Cécile will not tell me.

566
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,985
You must speak to her at once.

567
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,153
Tell me...

568
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,322
you resisted him, did you?

569
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,491
Of course I did...

570
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,702
as much as I could.

571
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,329
- But he forced you?
- No...

572
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,624
not exactly.

573
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,753
But I found it almost impossible
to defend myself.

574
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,964
Why was that? Did he tie you up?

575
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:44,512
No. No, he just has a way
of putting things.

576
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,516
- You can't think of an answer.
- Not even "no"?

577
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,978
I kept on saying no all the time.

578
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,775
But somehow,
that wasn't what I was doing.

579
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,406
I am so ashamed.

580
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,165
You'll find the shame is like the pain.

581
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,170
You only feel it once.

582
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,221
You really want my advice?

583
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,231
Please.

584
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,194
Allow Monsieur de Valmont...

585
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:45,406
to continue your instruction.

586
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,953
Convince your mother you've forgotten Danceny.

587
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,457
- And raise no objection to the marriage.
- With Monsieur de Bastide?

588
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,002
When it comes to marriage,
one man is as good as the next.

589
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,090
And even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother.

590
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:08,054
Are you saying, I'm going to have to do that,
with three different men?

591
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,348
I'm saying, you stupid little girl...

592
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,309
that provided you take
a few elementary precautions...

593
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,228
you can do it, or not...

594
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,356
with as many men as you like,
as often as you like...

595
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,025
in as many different ways as you like.

596
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:26,906
Our sex has few enough advantages,
so make the best of those you have.

597
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,577
Now, here comes your <i>maman...</i>

598
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:35,915
so remember what I've said,
and above all, no sniveling.

599
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,050
How are you feeling now, my dear?

600
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,761
Oh, much better, thank you, <i>maman.</i>

601
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,431
I think you look tired.
I think you should go to bed.

602
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,100
- No, I--
- You should do as your mother suggests.

603
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,769
We can arrange to have
something brought to your room.

604
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,272
I'm sure it will do you good.

605
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,316
Well, perhaps you are right, madame.

606
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,282
You have such a very good influence on her.

607
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,184
I don't think I've congratulated you
on your revenge.

608
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,895
- So you know.
- Oh, yes.

609
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:43,357
And I believe from now on,
you'll find her door unbolted.

610
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,494
Where is she?

611
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,662
I can't see her at the moment.

612
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,836
Surely I have explained to you before
how much I enjoy watching the battle...

613
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,379
between love and virtue.

614
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,174
What concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it...

615
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,843
much more than you used to enjoy winning it.

616
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,012
All in good time.

617
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,432
The century is drawing to its close.

618
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,604
Isn't it a pity that our agreement...

619
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:25,024
does not relate to the task
you set me...

620
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,528
rather than the task I set myself?

621
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,322
I am grateful, of course.

622
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,159
But that would have been
almost insultingly simple.

623
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,538
One does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat.

624
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,806
As with every other science,
the first thing you must learn...

625
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:04,016
is to call everything
by its proper name.

626
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,310
I don't see why we have to talk at all.

627
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,396
Without the correct polite vocabulary...

628
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,107
how can you indicate
what you would like me to do...

629
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,859
or make an offer of something
I might find agreeable?

630
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,154
- Surely you just--
- You see, if I do my work adequately...

631
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,365
I would like to think
you'll be able to...

632
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,660
surprise Monsieur de Bastide
on his wedding night.

633
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,121
- Would he be pleased?
- Of course.

634
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:29,166
He'll merely assume your <i>maman</i>
has done her duty and fully briefed you.

635
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,336
<i>Maman</i> couldn't possibly talk
of anything of that sort.

636
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,921
I can't think why.

637
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:38,384
She was, after all, one of the most
notorious young women in Paris.

638
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,052
- <i>Maman?</i>
- Certainly.

639
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,805
More noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability...

640
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,057
if I remember rightly.

641
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,728
There was a famous occasion
before you were born....

642
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,522
This would have been...

643
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,572
when your mother went to stay
with the Comtesse de Beaulieu...

644
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,408
who tactfully gave her a room
between your father's...

645
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,410
and that of a Monsieur de Vressac...

646
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,038
who was her acknowledged lover at the time.

647
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,416
Yet, in spite of these careful arrangements...

648
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,252
she contrived to spend the night
with a third party.

649
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:18,632
- I can't believe that.
- No, no, I assure you, it's true.

650
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,760
How do you know?

651
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,554
The third party was myself.

652
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:41,113
You asked me if Monsieur de Bastide
would be pleased with your abilities.

653
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,449
And the answer is...

654
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:46,702
education is never a waste.

655
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,336
Now...

656
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,090
I think we might begin...

657
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,218
with one or two Latin terms.

658
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,923
<i>We go for a walk together
almost every day.</i>

659
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,551
<i>A little further every time down the path...</i>

660
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,177
<i>that has no turning.</i>

661
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,472
<i>She has accepted my love...</i>

662
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,225
<i>I have accepted her friendship.</i>

663
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,938
<i>We are both aware of how little there is
to choose between them.</i>

664
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,482
I wish you knew me well enough to recognize...

665
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,693
how much you have changed me.

666
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,864
My friends in Paris remarked on it at once.

667
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,741
I have become the soul of consideration...

668
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:11,078
conscientious, charitable...

669
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,847
more celibate than a monk.

670
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,498
More celibate?

671
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:18,711
Well, you know the stories one hears in Paris.

672
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,215
<i>I feel she is inches from surrender.</i>

673
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,885
<i>Her eyes are closing.</i>

674
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,234
Madame.

675
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,572
Where are you going, monsieur?

676
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,033
- To the salon.
- There is no one there.

677
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,785
The others have all decided
on an early night.

678
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,581
- I very much missed our walk today.
- Yes.

679
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:02,087
I fear with the weather as it is,
we can look forward to very few more of them.

680
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:07,092
- This heavy rain is surely exceptional.
- Yes. May I?

681
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,429
Of course.

682
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:20,189
But, you see, within a week
I shall have concluded my business.

683
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,737
- I see.
- Even so, I am not sure...

684
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,948
I'll be able to bring myself to leave.

685
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,157
Oh, please. You must.

686
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,994
- Are you still so anxious to be rid of me?
- You know the answer to that.

687
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,542
I rely on your integrity and generosity.

688
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,961
I want to able to be grateful to you.

689
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,296
Forgive me if I say
I don't want your gratitude.

690
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,758
What I want from you
is something altogether deeper.

691
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:53,347
I know God is punishing me for my pride.
I was so certain this could never happen.

692
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,140
- Nothing like what? Love?
- I can't.

693
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,351
- Is love what you mean?
- You promised not to.

694
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:58,978
Yes, of course, but I must know.

695
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,355
I can't, don't you understand?
It's impossible.

696
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,650
You don't have to speak.
Just look at me.

697
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,999
Yes.

698
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,320
For God's sake, you must leave me
if you don't want to kill me.

699
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,697
You must help.

700
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,785
Fetch Madame,
Madame de Tourvel has been taken ill.

701
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,807
I heard something as I was passing.

702
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,601
She seemed to be having difficulty breathing.

703
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,062
- Oh, my dear, whatever is it?
- I'm all right now.

704
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,567
I shall leave her in your capable hands, Aunt.

705
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,111
We must send for a doctor, my dear.

706
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:57,448
No, no, please.
I don't need a doctor. I just....

707
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,994
Sit with me for a moment.

708
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,495
I must leave this house.

709
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,207
I am most desperately in love.

710
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,377
To leave is the last thing in the world
I want to do, but...

711
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,464
I'd rather die
than have to live with the guilt.

712
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,927
My dear girl,
none of this is any surprise to me.

713
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:04,973
The only thing that might surprise one
is how little the world changes.

714
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,559
What should I do?
What's your advice?

715
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,187
If I remember rightly in such matters...

716
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,065
all advice is useless.

717
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,235
I have never been so unhappy.

718
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,570
I'm sorry to say this but...

719
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:24,117
those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it.

720
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,286
But why? Why should that be?

721
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:31,416
Do you still think
men love the way we do?

722
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,043
No.

723
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:36,713
Men enjoy the happiness they feel.

724
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:40,300
We can only enjoy the happiness we give.

725
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,597
They are not capable...

726
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:50,310
of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person.

727
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:54,106
So to hope to be made happy by love...

728
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,818
is a certain cause of grief.

729
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,614
I am devoted to my nephew.

730
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,450
But what is true of most men...

731
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,537
is doubly so of him.

732
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,290
And yet...

733
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,251
he could have, just now....

734
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,714
He took pity on me.

735
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,551
If he has released you...

736
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,346
my dear child, you must go.

737
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,440
Get up, sir, quick.

738
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,151
Sir!

739
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,946
What is it?

740
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:44,907
Over here.

741
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,496
- What is it?
- Madame de Tourvel.

742
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,998
What?

743
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:58,503
I want you to follow her, right now.
Stay close to her.

744
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,547
I want to know everything.

745
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,761
Where she goes. Who she sees.
What she eats. If she sleeps.

746
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,137
Everything.

747
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,062
That's for bribes. Yours will come later.

748
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,688
- Yes, sir.
- Now, go.

749
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,315
Go!

750
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,372
<i>Dear Father Anselme...</i>

751
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,540
<i>try as I may, I cannot see...</i>

752
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,418
<i>the necessity for the interview you suggest.</i>

753
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:43,382
<i>However, since you insist,
I propose you bring him to see me...</i>

754
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:47,970
<i>on Thursday, the 28th at 6:00 p.m.</i>

755
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,561
This is excellent.
Make sure Father Anselme receives it.

756
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,689
What news?

757
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,441
No visitors.

758
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,736
There still hasn't been a single visitor
since she got back.

759
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,406
A bit of soup last night,
didn't touch the pheasant.

760
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,324
<i>Afterwards, a cup of tea.</i>

761
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,410
<i>Nothing else to report.</i>

762
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,079
<i>Oh yes, sir, there is.</i>

763
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,123
<i>You wanted to know what she was reading.</i>

764
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,961
The book by her bed is
<i>Christian Thoughts...</i>

765
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,671
<i>Volume Two.</i>

766
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,720
How is Julie?

767
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:34,016
She seems a bit keener
than she was in the country.

768
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,642
And yourself?

769
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,729
Talk about devotion to duty.

770
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,732
Off you go.

771
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,650
Keep it up.

772
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,279
- Madame.
- Vicomte.

773
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,660
Well...

774
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,416
what a pleasant surprise.

775
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,670
Danceny.

776
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,173
Thank you, monsieur, for everything.

777
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,843
Well, I was afraid I'd been
a sad disappointment to you.

778
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,219
On the contrary.

779
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,639
It's you I have to thank
for keeping our love alive.

780
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,975
Well, as to love,
Cécile thinks of little else.

781
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,853
She and her mother are coming back to Paris
in two weeks...

782
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,563
and she is longing to see you.

783
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,024
I have had the most wonderful letter from her.

784
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:25,233
Really?

785
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,528
Not like any of her other letters, somehow...

786
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,824
quite a different tone of voice.

787
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,620
<i>My dearest...</i>

788
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,498
Danceny...

789
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,918
I swear to you....

790
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,836
"--on my chastity...

791
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:49,841
that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage"...

792
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:55,430
comma, "I shall be yours completely."

793
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,850
Your friend, the Vicomte de Valmont...

794
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,978
has been very active on your behalf.

795
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:05,023
<i>I doubt if you could do more yourself.</i>

796
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,445
I don't know how I could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her.

797
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:14,574
We shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you.

798
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,369
If you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage.

799
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:20,372
There's a matter I must discuss
with the Vicomte in private.

800
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,457
Of course.

801
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,168
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

802
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,838
Don't give it another thought.

803
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,925
It's been delightful.

804
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,099
Poor boy, he's quite harmless.

805
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,686
Sometimes, Vicomte,
I can't help but adore you.

806
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,356
I have a piece of news I hope
you might find entertaining.

807
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:50,735
I have reason to believe
the next head of the house of Bastide...

808
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,320
may be a Valmont.

809
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,030
What can you mean?

810
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,117
Cécile is two weeks late.

811
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,414
- Aren't you pleased?
- I'm not sure.

812
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:05,167
Your aim was to revenge yourself on Bastide.

813
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:08,920
I have provided him with a wife trained by me
to perform, quite naturally...

814
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,048
services one would hesitate
to request from a professional...

815
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,427
and very likely pregnant as well.

816
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,721
What more do you want?

817
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:22,100
All right, Vicomte, I agree.
You have more than done your duty.

818
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,604
Shame you let the other one
slip through your fingers.

819
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,360
- I let her go.
- But why?

820
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,154
I was moved.

821
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,948
Oh, well then, no wonder you bungled it.

822
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,367
I have an appointment
to visit her on Thursday...

823
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,286
and this time I shall be merciless.

824
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,455
I am pleased to hear it.

825
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,587
Why do you suppose we...

826
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,840
only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away?

827
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:55,717
Immaturity?

828
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:59,304
I shan't have a moment's peace
until it's over.

829
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:03,308
I love her, I hate her...

830
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,143
my life is misery.

831
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,734
Well, I think I may have kept our young friend
waiting long enough.

832
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,820
I shall call on you
sometime soon after Thursday.

833
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,364
Only if you succeed, Vicomte.

834
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,075
I can't face another catalogue of incompetence.

835
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,953
- I shall succeed.
- I hope so.

836
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,248
Once upon a time you were a man
to be reckoned with.

837
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,809
I understand Father Anselme...

838
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,270
has explained to you
the reason for my visit.

839
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,564
He said you wished
to be reconciled with me...

840
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,066
before beginning instruction with him.

841
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,860
That's correct.

842
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:41,698
But I see no need
for formal reconciliation, monsieur.

843
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,701
No. When I have, as you said,
insulted you...

844
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,662
and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt.

845
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:50,999
Contempt?

846
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,586
You run away from my aunt's house
in the middle of the night.

847
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:57,088
You refuse to answer
or even receive my letters.

848
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,591
And all this,
after I have shown a restraint...

849
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:01,885
of which I think we are both aware.

850
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:04,596
I would call that,
at the very least, contempt.

851
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:07,599
You understand me better
than you pretend to, monsieur.

852
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,642
It was me you ran away from, wasn't it?

853
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,439
- I had to leave.
- And do you have to keep away from me?

854
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:25,784
I am as unhappy as you could
have ever wanted me to be.

855
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,579
I've only ever wanted your happiness.

856
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,457
How can I be happy without you?

857
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,627
I must have you or die.

858
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,472
Death it is.

859
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,896
I'm sorry, madame.

860
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,982
All I wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness...

861
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,819
for the wrongs that you think
that I've done you.

862
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,822
So that I may end my days
in some peace of mind.

863
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:07,992
I understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make.

864
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,746
Yes. And your choice has determined mine.

865
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:12,997
Which is what?

866
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,000
The only choice capable
of putting an end to my suffering.

867
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,087
- What do you mean?
- I love you.

868
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,630
You have no idea how much.

869
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:24,092
Just remember I have made
far more difficult sacrifices...

870
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,387
than the one I'm about to make.
Now...

871
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,766
- goodbye.
- No.

872
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:35,186
You must listen to me! No!

873
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:02,297
Why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy?

874
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:07,969
You're right. I cannot live either
unless I make you happy.

875
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,014
So I promise...

876
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,391
no more refusals...

877
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,352
and no more regrets.

878
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:36,789
Success!

879
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,626
Well...

880
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:42,045
I arrived at about 6.

881
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:45,131
Yes, I think you may omit
the details of the seduction.

882
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,091
They're never very enlivening.

883
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,052
Just describe the event itself.

884
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,597
- It was unprecedented.
- Really?

885
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:59,187
It had a kind of charm that I don't think
I have experienced before.

886
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:04,275
Once she'd surrendered,
she behaved with perfect candor.

887
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,569
Total mutual delirium.

888
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:11,658
Which, for the first time ever with me,
outlasted the pleasure itself.

889
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,118
She was astonishing.

890
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:19,707
So much so, that I ended by falling on my knees
and pledging her eternal love.

891
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,127
<i>And do you know that at that time...</i>

892
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:27,882
and for several hours afterwards,
I actually meant it.

893
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,177
I see.

894
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,722
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

895
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,808
Is it?

896
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:40,144
- It sounds to me perfectly commonplace.
- Oh, no...

897
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,896
I assure you.

898
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:45,441
But, of course,
the best thing about it is...

899
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:50,280
I am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward.

900
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:01,291
You mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well...

901
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,960
in the course of this awesome encounter?

902
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:09,090
I didn't necessarily think you were going
to be a stickler for formalities.

903
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:15,179
In any case, I may have to declare
our arrangement null and void.

904
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,352
What do you mean?

905
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,814
I'm not accustomed
to be taken for granted.

906
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,983
But there's no question of that.

907
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,943
You're misunderstanding me.

908
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:32,447
I have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing.

909
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,490
We've always been frank with one another.

910
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,743
As a matter of fact,
I've taken a new lover...

911
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,953
who is proving more than satisfactory.

912
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,456
- Who is that?
- I'm not in the mood for confidences.

913
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:43,207
Don't let me keep you.

914
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:48,546
You can't seriously imagine
I prefer her to you?

915
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,548
You may genuinely be unaware of this...

916
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:54,010
but I can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman.

917
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,429
No.

918
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,307
Not at all.

919
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,435
Have you forgotten what it's like
to make a woman happy?

920
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:05,688
- And to be made happy yourself?
- I?

921
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,609
- Of course not.
- We loved each other once, didn't we?

922
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,320
I think it was love.

923
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,739
And you made me very happy.

924
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,367
And we could again.
We just untied the knot.

925
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,826
It was never broken.

926
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,913
Illusions, of course,
are by their nature sweet.

927
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:25,833
I have no illusions.
I lost them on my travels.

928
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:31,714
Now...

929
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,467
I want to come home.

930
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,939
As for this present infatuation,
it won't last...

931
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:51,401
but for the moment,
it is beyond my control.

932
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,532
<i>My dear Vicomte, I'm obliged to go away
for a couple of weeks...</i>

933
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,035
<i>but I'm well aware of our arrangement.</i>

934
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:50,042
<i>On my return you and I
will spend a single night together.</i>

935
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:54,172
<i>We shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last.</i>

936
01:24:54,381 --> 01:25:00,887
<i>But then we shall remember that regret
is an essential component of happiness.</i>

937
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,180
<i>All this, of course...</i>

938
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:07,351
<i>providing you are able
to procure this famous letter.</i>

939
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,484
<i>It shall be done.</i>

940
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>But Paris is so tedious without you.</i>

941
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,909
<i>And I am living like a medieval hermit.</i>

942
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,750
All right, give me a moment.

943
01:25:31,018 --> 01:25:32,251
Drink up.

944
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:33,544
What is it?

945
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:36,589
Someone who may well
not appreciate your presence.

946
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,051
- Do you mean a woman?
- A lady, we might even say.

947
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,054
Oh, it's not the one
we wrote that letter to?

948
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,431
- The very one.
- I enjoyed that.

949
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:48,226
You proved a most talented desk.

950
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:52,480
- I'd like to see what she looks like.
- Well, you can't.

951
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:04,700
On second thought,
I don't see why you shouldn't.

952
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:16,087
- Do you have plans for this evening?
- A few friends round for dinner.

953
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:19,465
- And after dinner?
- Nothing firm.

954
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,679
Well....

955
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,706
I'll be there.

956
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,851
This is an unexpected pleasure.

957
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:15,146
- I know that woman.
- Are you sure? I'd be surprised.

958
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:17,356
She's been pointed out to me at the opera.

959
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,650
Yes, well, she's striking.

960
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,819
She's a courtesan, isn't she?

961
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,243
Yes, I suppose, in a manner of speaking.

962
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,829
Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

963
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:34,373
You haven't disturbed me.
I'm overjoyed to see you.

964
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,584
You'll never be received
at my house again.

965
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,502
I don't want your lies and excuses.

966
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,297
Sit down. Just hear me out.
That's all I ask.

967
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,090
Then you can judge.

968
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:01,859
Unfortunately, I cannot unlive
the years I lived before I met you.

969
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,403
During those years
I had a wide acquaintance...

970
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:09,033
the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another.

971
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:12,411
Now, it may surprise you
to know that Emilie...

972
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:16,165
in common with many others
of her character and profession...

973
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,876
is kind-hearted enough
to take an interest...

974
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,212
in those less fortunate than herself.

975
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,922
In short...

976
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:29,220
she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work.

977
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,641
Donations to hospitals,
soup for the poor...

978
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,230
protection for animals...

979
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:43,109
anything which touches
her sentimental heart.

980
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:49,115
From time to time, I make a small contribution
to her purse. That's all.

981
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,078
Is that true?

982
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,330
My relations with Emilie...

983
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:59,417
have been, for some years now,
quite blameless.

984
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:04,005
I mean, she's even done
a little secretarial work for me on occasion.

985
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,967
- Why did she laugh?
- I have no idea.

986
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:10,928
Does she know about me?

987
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,390
No doubt she made what,
in view of my past...

988
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:17,935
must be regarded as a fair assumption.

989
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,526
I want to believe you.

990
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:28,320
I knew you were coming up.

991
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,780
You were announced.

992
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:39,999
I'm sorry.

993
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,634
But, no.

994
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,473
No, it's I who must apologize.

995
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:59,727
It was most insensitive of me.

996
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,819
I didn't think it was possible for me
to love you more.

997
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,323
But your jealousy....

998
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,080
I love you so much.

999
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:37,598
When will you start writing to me again?

1000
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,446
<i>My dear Vicomte...</i>

1001
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:57,368
<i>I don't believe this self-denial
can be good for you.</i>

1002
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,540
<i>I hope it doesn't mean
you're neglecting your little pupil.</i>

1003
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,088
But where can Danceny be?

1004
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,885
I told you, I have all my people out
looking for him.

1005
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,387
There's no trace of him.

1006
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,903
It is only the wind.

1007
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,317
Where are you?

1008
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,036
There's nothing to be frightened about.

1009
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,414
Yes, there is.

1010
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,042
I'm bleeding.

1011
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,610
Your porter seems to be
under the impression...

1012
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,904
that you're still out of town.

1013
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,491
I have in fact only just returned.

1014
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,244
Without attracting the attention
of your porter?

1015
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,080
It may be time to review
your domestic arrangements.

1016
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,749
I am exhausted.
Naturally, I instructed the porter...

1017
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:12,336
to inform any casual callers
that I was out.

1018
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,756
And you here as well...

1019
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,217
my dear young friend.

1020
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:23,889
The porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening.

1021
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,683
Oh, well....

1022
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,102
Yes.

1023
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,854
As a matter of fact,
it's you that I'm looking for.

1024
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,314
Is it?

1025
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:37,278
Mademoiselle Cécile returns to Paris
after an absence of over two months.

1026
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,239
Now, what do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind?

1027
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:44,994
Answer, of course: the longed-for reunion
with her beloved Chevalier.

1028
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,746
Vicomte, this is no time
to make mischief.

1029
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:50,791
Nothing could be further from my mind, madame.

1030
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,251
Go on.

1031
01:33:52,419 --> 01:33:56,463
Imagine her distress and alarm
when her loved one is nowhere to be found.

1032
01:33:56,923 --> 01:34:00,843
I've had to do more improvising
than an Italian actor.

1033
01:34:01,011 --> 01:34:02,636
How is she? Is she all right?

1034
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:05,681
Oh, yes. Well, no, to be quite frank.

1035
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,058
I'm sorry to tell you she's been ill.

1036
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,728
- Ill?
- Calm yourself, my friend.

1037
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,647
The surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery.

1038
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:17,443
But you can well imagine how desperate
I've been to find you.

1039
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,278
Of course, I....

1040
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:22,281
My God, how could I have been away
at such a time?

1041
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,450
How can I ever forgive myself?

1042
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,956
But look, all is well now with Cécile,
I assure you.

1043
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:33,876
And I shan't disturb you further.

1044
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,256
It's only that I have a little something
to show the marquise.

1045
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,436
Wait in my dressing room.

1046
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,272
- It's through there.
- I know where it is.

1047
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:08,452
I see she writes as badly as she dresses.

1048
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:11,705
Is it really true the little one's been ill?

1049
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:14,166
Not so much an illness,
more a refurbishment.

1050
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:16,668
- What do you mean?
- Miscarriage.

1051
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:20,130
Oh, Vicomte, I am so sorry.

1052
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,633
Your son and Bastide's heir.

1053
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,641
Isn't there something else
that we should be discussing?

1054
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:33,310
I do hope you're not gonna be difficult
about Danceny.

1055
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,145
I know Belleroche was pretty limp...

1056
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:38,023
but I think you could've found
a livelier replacement...

1057
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,944
- than that mawkish schoolboy.
- Mawkish or not, he's completely devoted.

1058
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:45,489
And, I suspect,
better equipped to provide me with...

1059
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,367
happiness and pleasure than you are...

1060
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,494
in your present mood.

1061
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,371
I see.

1062
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:59,044
If I thought you would be
your old charming self...

1063
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:03,382
I might invite you to visit me
one evening next week.

1064
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:04,842
Really?

1065
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:07,845
I still love you, you see...

1066
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,599
in spite of all your faults
and my complaints.

1067
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:25,279
Are you sure you're not going to impose
some new condition...

1068
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:28,740
before you agree to honor your obligation?

1069
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,963
I have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman.

1070
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,508
Whenever any of us pointed this out to him...

1071
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:50,721
he invariably made
the same feeble reply:

1072
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:54,433
"It's beyond my control," he would say.

1073
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:58,103
He was on the verge
of becoming a laughing stock.

1074
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:02,441
At which point, another friend of mine,
a woman...

1075
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:05,319
decided to speak to him seriously.

1076
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,572
She explained to him
that his name was in danger...

1077
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,993
of being ludicrously associated with this phrase
for the rest of his life.

1078
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,745
So do you know what he did?

1079
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:17,956
I feel sure you're about to tell me.

1080
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:23,545
He went round to see his mistress
and bluntly announced he was leaving her.

1081
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:26,882
Well, as you can expect,
she protested vociferously.

1082
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,426
But to everything she said...

1083
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,970
to every objection she made...

1084
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:34,014
he simply replied:

1085
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:37,809
"It's beyond my control."

1086
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,525
Good night.

1087
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,720
You're only five minutes late,
but I get so frightened.

1088
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,306
I become convinced
I'm never going to see you again.

1089
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:19,643
- My angel.
- Is it like that for you too?

1090
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:23,981
Yes.

1091
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,359
At this moment, for example,
I'm quite convinced...

1092
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,319
I'm never going to see you again.

1093
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,322
What?

1094
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,575
I'm so bored, you see.

1095
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:37,160
It's beyond my control.

1096
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:40,831
What do you mean?

1097
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,294
Well, after all, it's been four months.

1098
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:46,837
So, what I said:

1099
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:50,090
It's beyond my control.

1100
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,345
Do you mean you don't love me anymore?

1101
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,890
My love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue.

1102
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,059
It's beyond my control.

1103
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,980
- It's that woman, isn't it?
- You're quite right.

1104
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:08,233
I have been deceiving you with Emilie,
among others.

1105
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,528
It's beyond my control.

1106
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,532
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:20,370
There's a woman.
Not Emilie, another woman.

1108
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,873
A woman I adore.

1109
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:25,876
And I'm afraid she's insisting
that I give you up.

1110
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,424
It's beyond my control.

1111
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:37,888
Liar! Liar!

1112
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,848
You're quite right, I am a liar.

1113
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:44,394
And it's like your fidelity, a fact of life.
No more nor less irritating.

1114
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,230
- Certainly beyond my control.
- Stop it!

1115
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,482
Don't keep saying that.

1116
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:53,570
Sorry. Beyond my control.

1117
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,950
Why don't you take another lover?

1118
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,747
Whatever you like.

1119
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:06,375
It's beyond my control.

1120
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,298
Do you want to kill me?

1121
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,386
Listen. Listen to me.

1122
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:20,263
You have given me great pleasure.

1123
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:24,142
But I simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you.

1124
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,395
It's the way of the world.

1125
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:29,439
Quite beyond my control.

1126
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:14,317
Tomorrow morning, early.

1127
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,569
Yes, my lord.

1128
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:23,493
This is not your appointed night.

1129
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:27,539
- That story you told me, how did it end?
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.

1130
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:31,752
Once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his lady-friend...

1131
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,170
did she take him back?

1132
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:35,547
Am I to understand?

1133
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:39,843
The day after our last meeting,
I broke with Madame de Tourvel...

1134
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:43,263
on the grounds that it was
beyond my control.

1135
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:46,349
- You didn't.
- I certainly did.

1136
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,728
But how wonderful of you.

1137
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,898
You kept telling me
my reputation was in danger...

1138
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:56,860
but I think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit.

1139
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,738
I believe it sets a new standard.

1140
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:05,368
Only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory.

1141
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,370
What's that?

1142
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:10,874
To win her back.

1143
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:15,545
- You think you could?
- I don't see why not.

1144
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:18,089
I'll tell you why not.

1145
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:23,220
Because when one woman strikes
at the heart of another, she seldom misses...

1146
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,472
and the wound is invariably fatal.

1147
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,974
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

1148
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:32,896
I'm also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs.

1149
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:36,733
There's nothing a woman enjoys so much
as victory over another woman.

1150
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,486
Except, you see, Vicomte,
my victory wasn't over her.

1151
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:42,739
- Of course it was, what do you mean?
- It was over you.

1152
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,993
You loved that woman, Vicomte.

1153
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:51,373
What's more, you still do.
Quite desperately.

1154
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,708
If you hadn't been so ashamed of it...

1155
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,795
how could you have treated her so viciously?

1156
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:02,259
You couldn't bear even the vague possibility
of being laughed at.

1157
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:06,596
And this has proved something
I've always suspected.

1158
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:10,308
That vanity and happiness...

1159
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,769
are incompatible.

1160
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:20,235
Whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations...

1161
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:24,239
the fact remains, it is now your turn
to make a sacrifice.

1162
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,448
Is that so?

1163
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,410
- Danceny must go!
- Where?

1164
01:43:28,578 --> 01:43:33,790
I have been more than patient
with this little whim of yours. Enough is enough.

1165
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:37,502
One reason I never remarried,
despite a quite bewildering range of offers...

1166
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:41,298
was the determination never again
to be ordered around!

1167
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:45,802
I must therefore ask you to adopt
a less marital tone of voice.

1168
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:50,557
She is ill, you know.
I have made her ill for your sake.

1169
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:55,520
So the least you can do is
get rid of that colorless youth.

1170
01:43:56,814 --> 01:44:00,108
Haven't you had enough of bullying women
for the time being?

1171
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,570
I see I shall have to make myself very plain.

1172
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,323
I have come to spend the night.

1173
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:09,743
I shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away.

1174
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:14,873
I am sorry.
I've made other arrangements.

1175
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,168
Yes, I knew there was something.

1176
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:20,754
What?

1177
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,428
Danceny isn't coming. Not tonight.

1178
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,222
What do you mean.
How do you know?

1179
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:38,188
I know, because I have arranged for him
to spend the night with Cécile.

1180
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:46,404
Come to think of it,
he mentioned he was expected here.

1181
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:50,951
But when I put it to him
that he would really have to make a choice...

1182
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,370
I must say, he didn't hesitate.

1183
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:57,415
He's coming to see you tomorrow to explain.

1184
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,960
And to offer you--

1185
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,754
Do I have this right?
Yes, I think I do.

1186
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:05,423
--his eternal friendship.

1187
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:09,302
As you said,
he is entirely devoted to you.

1188
01:45:11,097 --> 01:45:15,558
- That's enough, Vicomte.
- You're absolutely right.

1189
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:18,186
Shall we go up?

1190
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:21,231
Shall we what?

1191
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:22,565
Go up.

1192
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:26,778
Unless you prefer this,
if memory serves, rather purgatorial sofa.

1193
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:29,823
- I think it's time you were leaving.
- No, I don't think so.

1194
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:33,076
We made an arrangement.
I really don't think I can allow myself...

1195
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:36,204
to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer.

1196
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:38,748
Remember, I'm better at this
than you are.

1197
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,793
Perhaps. But it is always the best swimmers
who drown.

1198
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:44,421
Now, yes or no?

1199
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,797
It's up to you, of course.

1200
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:49,175
I will merely confine myself to remarking...

1201
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,762
that a no will be regarded
as a declaration of war.

1202
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,894
A single word is all that's required.

1203
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,649
All right.

1204
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,405
War.

1205
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,140
<i>My dear Chevalier Danceny...</i>

1206
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:42,312
<i>I understand you spent last night
with Cécile Volanges.</i>

1207
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:47,150
<i>I learned this from her
more regular lover...</i>

1208
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:50,236
<i>the Vicomte de Valmont.</i>

1209
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:09,607
I'm dying because
I wouldn't believe you.

1210
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,508
Fetch the surgeon!

1211
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,385
No, no.

1212
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:02,553
Do as I say!

1213
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,563
A moment of your time.

1214
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:20,780
Two things: A word of advice,
which of course you may ignore, but...

1215
01:50:21,282 --> 01:50:24,158
it is honestly intended...

1216
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,202
and a request.

1217
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:28,830
Go on.

1218
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:33,042
The advice is:
Be careful of the Marquise de Merteuil.

1219
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:36,838
You must permit me to treat with skepticism...

1220
01:50:37,006 --> 01:50:39,173
anything you have to say about her.

1221
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,718
Nevertheless, I must tell you...

1222
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:45,471
in this affair,
we are both her creatures...

1223
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:54,188
as I believe
her letters to me will prove.

1224
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:01,612
When you have read them,
you may decide to circulate them.

1225
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:06,784
And the request?

1226
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:11,956
I want you somehow...

1227
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,125
somehow...

1228
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:17,795
to get to see Madame de Tourvel.

1229
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:22,592
I understand she's very ill.

1230
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:26,137
That is why this is most important to me.

1231
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:31,434
I want you to tell her
that I cannot explain...

1232
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,771
why I broke with her as I did.

1233
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:40,443
But that since then,
my life has been worth nothing.

1234
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,948
I pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have, my boy...

1235
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:49,827
and now I need you
to help me withdraw it.

1236
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:55,708
Tell her it is lucky for her
that I have gone...

1237
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:59,837
and I'm glad not to have
to live without her.

1238
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:07,387
Tell her, her love was the only real happiness
that I have ever known.

1239
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,768
Will you do that for me?

1240
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:16,062
I will.

1241
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,485
It's all very well feeling sorry now.

1242
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,695
Let him be.

1243
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:29,325
He had good cause.

1244
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:38,668
I don't believe that's something anyone
has ever been able to say about me.

1245
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:16,706
Enough.

1246
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:22,545
Draw the curtains.

1247
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,856
Get out! Get out!

1248
01:59:47,848 --> 01:59:49,849
