1
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,432
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,686
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,439
...and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,483
Do you maggots understand that?

5
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,859
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,363
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,906
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,411
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,912
...you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,124
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,085
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,629
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,173
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,220
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,265
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,143
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,395
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,856
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,152
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,821
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,949
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,952
...who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,121
Do you maggots understand that?

24
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,539
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,458
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,585
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,047
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,758
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,302
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,138
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,768
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,436
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,148
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

35
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,025
Who said that?

36
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,152
Who the fuck said that?

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,781
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,617
...who just signed
his own death warrant?

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,994
Nobody, huh?

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,831
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,626
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,545
I'll P. T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,590
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,968
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,472
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,351
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,896
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,940
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,568
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,449
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,660
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,079
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,790
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,712
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,215
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

56
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,467
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

57
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,512
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,056
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,103
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,774
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,569
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,320
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,780
What's your excuse?

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,282
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

65
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,285
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

66
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,495
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,248
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,543
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,795
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

70
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,631
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,134
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

72
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,802
Sir, 5'9", sir.

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,764
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,224
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,394
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,315
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,816
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,069
Where the hell are you from, private?

79
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,738
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

80
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,991
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,661
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,830
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,291
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,877
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,673
...and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,966
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,720
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

88
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,139
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,226
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,020
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,897
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,693
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

93
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,820
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

94
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,906
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,033
-...through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,660
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,954
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,748
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,584
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

100
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,879
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,923
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,259
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,096
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,390
...exactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,101
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,272
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,983
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,779
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,491
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,746
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,958
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,961
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,967
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,677
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,055
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,059
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,019
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,105
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,654
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,449
...or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,576
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,164
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,708
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,502
Left, right, left, right, left...

125
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,296
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,716
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,512
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,515
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,434
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,437
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,981
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,068
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,569
- P. T.
- P. T.

134
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,071
- P. T.
- P. T.

135
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,572
- Good for you
- Good for you

136
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,199
- And good for me
- And good for me

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,659
- Good
- Good

138
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,578
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,206
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,167
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,462
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,465
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,051
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,138
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,391
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,103
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,189
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,235
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,198
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,916
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

152
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,627
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,048
...but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

154
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,592
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,636
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,723
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,435
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,147
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,691
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,485
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,903
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,906
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,160
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,206
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,669
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,841
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,762
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,473
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,230
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,900
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:14,280
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,910
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,248
...through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,500
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,336
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,715
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,259
Arms.

178
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,638
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,144
Mount.

180
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,525
Port.

181
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,614
Pray.

182
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,325
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,996
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,832
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,667
It is my life.

186
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,130
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,300
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,303
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,348
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,560
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,688
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,398
I will.

193
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,234
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,113
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,532
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,202
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,581
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,458
Amen.

199
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,794
Arm.

200
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,257
At ease.

201
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,677
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,471
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,432
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,769
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,527
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,948
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:27,580
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,292
Port.

209
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:38,091
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,261
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,930
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,516
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,102
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,771
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,357
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,943
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,571
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,115
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,035
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,958
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,017
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:34,022
It should take you no less than 10
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,690
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,527
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:43,948
...until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,432
Next two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,394
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,604
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,147
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,025
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,069
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,948
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,242
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,248
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,919
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

237
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,797
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,174
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?

239
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,554
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,431
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,810
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

242
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,395
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,150
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,319
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,282
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:11,161
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,331
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,042
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,837
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,674
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

251
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:29,179
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,348
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,184
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,604
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,983
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

256
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,445
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,157
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,534
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,163
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,875
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

261
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,754
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,465
Are you quitting on me?

263
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,676
Well, are you?

264
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,138
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,808
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,727
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,105
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,446
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:33,201
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,788
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,040
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,795
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

274
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,297
Or did you have to work on it?

275
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,093
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,806
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

277
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,558
Move it.

278
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,895
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

279
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,106
Do it now.

280
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,735
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,363
Do you feel dizzy?

282
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,866
Do you feel faint?

283
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:18,580
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:24,210
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,920
Get up here.

286
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,758
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,885
Quickly.

288
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,847
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,113
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,157
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,202
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,788
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,874
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,459
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,211
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,923
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,176
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:17,430
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,932
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,351
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

301
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,311
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,193
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,570
Sir, the private said, " No, sir," sir.

304
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,907
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:40,245
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,622
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,125
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

308
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,543
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,212
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

310
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,714
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,967
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:58,013
...and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,764
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

314
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,767
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,811
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,647
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,484
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,112
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,032
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

320
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,118
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on...

321
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,580
...Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,040
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,417
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,671
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,590
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,967
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,935
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,691
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,361
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,989
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,241
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,913
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,374
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,171
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,678
Attaboy.

336
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:25,725
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,269
Ready?

338
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,276
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,910
Attaboy.

340
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,037
Set it down.

341
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,375
All right?

342
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,420
There you go.

343
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,215
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,967
You did it.

345
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,804
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,306
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,143
Okay? Got it?

348
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,228
You do it.

349
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,107
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,359
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,531
Port.

352
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,871
Order.

353
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,396
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,402
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,405
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the...

356
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,869
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,873
...is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,585
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,798
...if you expect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,510
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,262
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:31,893
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,105
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,273
You will not kill.

365
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,818
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,321
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,198
Because Marines...

368
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,952
...are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,829
Do you maggots understand?

370
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,497
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,876
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,838
I love working for Uncle Sam

373
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,757
Lets me know just who I am

00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,719

386
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,749

Trim them.

396
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,728
T oe jam.

397
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,441
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,036
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,207
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

400
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,541
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,170
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,632
...it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

403
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,385
- Sir, yes, sir.
- lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,096
...there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

405
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,264
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

406
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:41,439
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,236
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,196
What is that?

409
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,991
What the fuck is that?

410
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,826
What is that, Private Pyle?

411
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,285
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,830
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:00,041
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,335
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

415
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,256
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

416
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,800
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

417
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,635
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:15,849
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,561
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

420
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,688
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,983
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,157
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,993
...and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,122
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:44,210
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,423
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,800
...the proper motivation.

428
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:56,473
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,933
...I will not punish him.

430
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,561
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,813
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,067
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,944
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,073
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,742
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,286
Ready, exercise.

437
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,081
One, two, three, four

438
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,750
I love the Marine Corps

439
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,294
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,838
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,424
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,968
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,596
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,140
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,643
One, two, three, four...

446
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,855
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,947
Joker.

448
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,119
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,498
Even you.

450
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,878
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,548
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,009
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,514
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,935
I need help.

455
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,816
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,695
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,991
Tuck your shirt in.

458
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,372
One, two, three, 19.

459
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,583
One, two, three, 20.

460
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,835
One, two, three, 21.

461
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,046
One, two, three, 22.

462
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,131
One, two, three, 23.

463
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,342
One, two, three, 24.

464
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,510
One, two, three, 25.

465
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,554
One, two, three, 26.

466
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,765
One, two, three, 27.

467
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,933
One, two, three, 28.

468
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,061
One, two, three, 29.

469
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,730
One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,026
Do it.

471
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,402
Do it.

472
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,873
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,986
Port.

474
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,240
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,245
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,417
Port.

477
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,382
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

478
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:44,886
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,180
What makes the grass grow?

480
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,349
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,227
What do we do for a living, ladies?

482
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,104
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,855
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,732
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,985
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,779
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:07,492
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

488
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,496
None of you dumb-asses knows?

489
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,832
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,336
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

491
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,381
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

492
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:25,719
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

493
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,805
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,809
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

495
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,019
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,563
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,566
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

498
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:44,029
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,197
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,241
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,620
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:58,418
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

503
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:02,047
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:06,384
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

505
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,928
Private Joker.

506
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,014
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,725
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:18,855
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,608
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,111
...you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,841
Today...

512
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,177
...is Christmas.

513
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:54,557
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,478
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:03,233
...about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,029
...with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:12,492
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:17,372
...because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,916
He plays his games...

520
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,794
...we play ours.

521
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:27,841
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:33,346
...we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:38,101
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,271
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,150
...but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:47,277
Do you ladies understand?

527
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:50,447
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

528
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,449
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:01,541
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,711
Everything...

531
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,464
...is clean.

532
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,136
Beautiful.

533
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,349
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:20,935
Nice.

535
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,440
Everything clean.

536
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,859
Oiled.

537
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,114
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,329
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,062
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:07,941
Yeah.

541
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,368
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,330
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,836
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,766
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,022
What will you take in trade?

546
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,151
What do you got?

547
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,417
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,295
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,297
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,469
What's your sixth general order?

551
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,138
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,724
...and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,642
...all orders...

554
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,603
Sir, the private's sixth general...

555
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,189
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,650
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,903
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,493
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

559
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,829
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

560
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:49,250
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,919
What's your fifth general order?

562
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:55,131
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,092
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

564
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:00,095
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,014
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:06,810
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,062
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:14,192
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,945
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,781
I just want my M14

571
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:22,534
I just want my M14

572
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:25,412
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:28,164
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,875
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,712
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,506
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,259
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:44,347
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:49,477
Graduation is only a few days away...

580
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:54,190
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

581
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,320
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

582
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:04,326
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

583
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:08,121
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

584
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,249
The Marine Corps wants killers.

585
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:15,211
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

586
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,173
Men without fear.

587
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:24,721
T oday, you people are
no longer maggots.

588
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,851
T oday, you are Marines.

589
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,229
You 're part of a brotherhood.

590
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:37,525
From now on, until the day you die...

591
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:39,986
...wherever you are...

592
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:43,657
...every Marine is your brother.

593
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,869
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

594
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:51,247
Some of you will not come back.

595
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,625
But always remember this:

596
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,669
Marines die.

597
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,380
That's what we're here for.

598
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:01,633
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

599
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,554
...and that means you live forever.

600
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,102
- Peckett.
- Sir, yes, sir.

601
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,937
0300, lnfantry.

602
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,689
- T oe Jam.
- Sir, yes, sir.

603
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,732
0300, lnfantry.

604
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:19,609
- Adams.
- Sir, yes, sir.

605
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:21,486
1800, Engineers.

606
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,154
You go out and find mines.

607
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,156
- Cowboy.
- Sir, yes, sir.

608
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:27,158
0300, lnfantry.

609
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:28,743
- Taylor.
- Sir, yes, sir.

610
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,704
0300, lnfantry.

611
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,455
- Joker.
- Sir, yes, sir.

612
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,792
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

613
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,003
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

614
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,713
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

615
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,923
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

616
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,509
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

617
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:48,346
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

618
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,764
A killer, yes, sir.

619
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,474
Gomer Pyle.

620
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,269
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

621
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:58,356
You forget your fucking name?
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

622
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,692
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

623
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,699
Our last night on the island.

624
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,368
I draw fire watch.

625
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:16,309
Hi, Joker.

626
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,835
Are those live rounds?

627
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:51,678
Seven-six-two millimeter.

628
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:56,725
Full metal jacket.

629
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,235
Leonard...

630
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:11,281
...if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

631
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,535
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

632
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:21,082
I am...

633
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,836
...in a world...

634
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:28,882
...of shit.

635
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,386
Left shoulder.

636
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,349
Right shoulder.

637
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:41,728
Lock and load.

638
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:47,901
Order.

639
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,530
This is my rifle.

640
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:55,450
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

641
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,038
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

642
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,707
Get back in your bunks.

643
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,043
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

644
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,090
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

645
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:13,593
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

646
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,596
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

647
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:20,100
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

648
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:23,478
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

649
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:28,400
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

650
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:39,703
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

651
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:42,664
...and you listen good.

652
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,333
I want that weapon...

653
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,169
...and I want it now.

654
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,924
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

655
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,927
...and step back away from it.

656
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:06,855
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

657
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:11,318
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

658
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,928
Easy, Leonard.

659
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,476
Go easy, man.

660
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:11,419
No!

661
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,565
Hey, baby.

662
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,776
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

663
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:19,571
Not just this minute.

664
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:23,074
Well, baby, me so horny.

665
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:25,410
Me so horny.

666
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,121
Me love you long time.

667
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:29,914
You party?

668
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,208
Yeah, we might party.

669
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,170
- How much?
- Fifteen dollar.

670
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:39,382
- Fifteen dollars for both of us.
- No. Each you $15.

671
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:41,468
Me love you long time.

672
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,262
Me so horny.

673
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,765
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

674
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:50,185
- Five dollars each.
- Me sucky-sucky.

675
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,937
Me love you too much.

676
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,651
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

677
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:00,737
Okay. Ten dollar each.

678
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,448
What do we get for $10?

679
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,409
Everything you want.

680
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:09,746
- Everything?
- Everything.

681
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:14,876
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

682
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:16,920
Just a minute.

683
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:21,424
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

684
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,343
The other half have got TB.

685
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:27,055
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

686
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:18,732
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

687
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:20,567
Yeah.

688
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,946
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

689
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,448
What?

690
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:30,493
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

691
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,620
I just can't feature that.

692
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:36,249
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

693
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:41,421
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

694
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:43,548
I've been in country
almost three months...

695
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,509
...and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

696
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:49,721
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

697
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,182
A high school girl could do my job.

698
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,142
I wanna get out into the shit.

699
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,936
I wanna get some trigger time.

700
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:01,316
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

701
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,276
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

702
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,945
That's a negative, Rafterman.

703
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:12,619
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

704
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:18,625
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

705
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:20,585
Rear-echelon paranoia.

706
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:25,048
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

707
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,717
They say the same thing every year.

708
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:29,678
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

709
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:31,638
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

710
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,975
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

711
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:39,479
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

712
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:42,524
...barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

713
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,319
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

714
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:49,739
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

715
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,409
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

716
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,244
And get some good low-angle stuff.

717
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:58,498
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

718
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,917
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

719
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:04,796
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

720
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:08,258
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

721
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:11,553
...if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

722
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,471
I'll make a note of it, sir.

723
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,683
"NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

724
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,895
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

725
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:23,857
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

726
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:27,110
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

727
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:31,031
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

728
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:32,240
I'll fix it up, sir.

729
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,743
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

730
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,077
Dave, do 100 words on it.

731
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:38,747
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.

732
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:40,707
" Not while we're eating.

733
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,418
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

734
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,920
...don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow."

735
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:49,966
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

736
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:54,763
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

737
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:58,224
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

738
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,311
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

739
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,438
Sir?

740
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:07,567
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

741
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:08,985
Didn't see them.

742
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:13,448
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

743
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:17,077
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

744
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:19,496
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

745
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:23,291
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

746
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:27,170
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

747
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,005
It was raining, sir.

748
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,342
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

749
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,595
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

750
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,139
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

751
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,974
Whichever you say.

752
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:42,644
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

753
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:46,022
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

754
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,774
Joker...

755
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:51,319
...maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

756
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:54,656
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

757
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,950
Now, it is our job to report the news...

758
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,203
...that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

759
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:04,541
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

760
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:08,461
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

761
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,047
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

762
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,216
Can't say I liked it much.

763
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:16,386
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

764
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,556
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

765
00:52:19,764 --> 00:52:21,933
...in the rear with the gear.

766
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,444
Tet. The year of the monkey.

767
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,739
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

768
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:41,036
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

769
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:53,423
I am fucking bored to death, man.

770
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,509
I gotta get back in the shit.

771
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:59,763
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

772
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:01,931
Joker's so tough...

773
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,560
...he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

774
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:07,604
...then ask for seconds.

775
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,190
Listen up, pilgrim.

776
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:14,861
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

777
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,655
Shit.

778
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:20,700
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

779
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,786
He's never been in the shit.

780
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:25,705
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

781
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:28,416
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

782
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:31,252
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...

783
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:34,297
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

784
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,882
I was there, man.

785
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,759
I was in the shit with the grunts.

786
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:41,721
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

787
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:45,308
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

788
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:47,519
You listen to Joker, new guy.

789
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,270
He knows ti ti.

790
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:50,981
Very little.

791
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:53,942
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

792
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:57,654
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

793
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,824
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

794
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,534
It's like-

795
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,828
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

796
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:06,788
I got it.

797
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:08,790
All field Marines got it.

798
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,458
And you'll have it too.

799
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:11,918
I will?

800
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,670
Hey, Payback...

801
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,923
...how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

802
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,427
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

803
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,559
- lncoming.
- Oh, shit.

804
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:31,104
Them are outgoing.

805
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:35,275
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

806
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,068
Now, what did I just say?

807
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,443
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

808
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,863
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

809
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,710
Cease fire.

810
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:22,882
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

811
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,555
Cease fire.

812
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:41,526
The enemy...

813
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:44,195
...has very deceitfully...

814
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:47,240
...taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

815
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:50,744
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

816
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:54,748
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

817
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:57,125
But we seem to be the exception.

818
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:02,589
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

819
00:57:02,797 --> 00:57:08,636
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

820
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,764
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

821
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,476
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

822
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,313
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

823
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,401
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

824
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:26,655
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

825
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,574
...the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

826
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:34,663
...and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

827
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:36,998
In other words...

828
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:42,003
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

829
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:46,675
Sir.

830
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,844
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

831
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:59,020
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

832
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:02,691
Captain January will need all his people.

833
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:05,110
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...

834
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:08,279
...you will take off that damn button.

835
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:11,866
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

836
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,535
Sir.

837
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:15,912
Permission to go with Joker?

838
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,540
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

839
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:21,668
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

840
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:23,920
You still here?

841
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:27,757
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

842
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:30,260
You're responsible for him.

843
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:07,714
Get some.

844
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:10,300
Get some.

845
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:15,805
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:20,518
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

847
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:26,149
Get some.

848
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:35,825
Get some, baby.

849
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,578
Get some. Get some. Get some.

850
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,207
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

851
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,876
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,253
I've got you, mother.

853
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:55,220
Anyone who runs is a VC.

854
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,348
Anyone who stands still...

855
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:01,434
...is a well-disciplined VC.

856
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:07,023
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

857
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:11,236
Why should we do a story about you?

858
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,738
Because I'm so fucking good.

859
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:16,032
That ain't no shit neither.

860
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:20,662
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

861
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,581
And 50 water buffaloes too.

862
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,584
Them are all certified.

863
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,587
Any women or children?

864
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,756
Sometimes.

865
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:36,594
How can you shoot women and children?

866
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:38,471
Easy.

867
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,057
You just don't lead them so much.

868
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,561
Ain't war hell?

869
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,266
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

870
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:24,934
Down the road. Two-Five.

871
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,854
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

872
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:54,255
Excuse me.

873
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:55,799
Sir.

874
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:59,052
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

875
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,679
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

876
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:02,222
You people one-one?

877
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,724
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

878
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:06,726
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.

879
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:08,895
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

880
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,898
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

881
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:15,735
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

882
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:19,114
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

883
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,533
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

884
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,201
I played ball for Notre Dame.

885
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:24,661
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

886
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:27,539
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

887
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:29,290
Never happen, sir.

888
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:33,753
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

889
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,090
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

890
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:40,010
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

891
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:41,678
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

892
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:44,389
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

893
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,766
...street by street and house by house.

894
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,935
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

895
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,354
...but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

896
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:55,734
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

897
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,319
That's affirmative.

898
01:02:57,485 --> 01:03:01,114
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

899
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:03,491
Will you show me where, sir?

900
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,412
Here's the canal.

901
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:33,563
The dead have been covered with lime.

902
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,651
The dead know only one thing:

903
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,820
It is better to be alive.

904
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,745
Excuse me?

905
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,206
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

906
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:54,918
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

907
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:56,544
What outfit are you men with?

908
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:58,838
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

909
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,632
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...

910
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,093
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

911
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:05,887
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

912
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,974
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

913
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,226
Do you know how it happened, sir?

914
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:15,397
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

915
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:20,110
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

916
01:04:20,276 --> 01:04:22,278
They went around
to their houses real polite...

917
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,782
...and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

918
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,576
Everybody who turned up got shot.

919
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:30,370
Some they buried alive.

920
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,913
Ready.

921
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:34,958
Colonel.

922
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,170
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

923
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:40,630
A peace symbol, sir.

924
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,383
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

925
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,677
What is that written on your helmet?

926
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:47,345
Born to kill, sir.

927
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,515
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

928
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,018
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

929
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,770
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

930
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:57,314
I don't know, sir.

931
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,940
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

932
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:02,360
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

933
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:04,279
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...

934
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,823
...or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

935
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,951
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

936
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:13,705
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

937
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:17,167
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

938
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,960
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

939
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:20,712
How about getting with the program.

940
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:23,298
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

941
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:24,507
Yes, sir.

942
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:29,137
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

943
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:31,056
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

944
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:35,143
...because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

945
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,020
It's a hardball world, son.

946
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:40,815
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

947
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:42,025
Aye, aye, sir.

948
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:56,206
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

949
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:58,166
Around the back.

950
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:09,886
- First Platoon?
- Yeah, through there.

951
01:06:33,576 --> 01:06:35,620
Hey, Lone Ranger.

952
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:43,336
- Holy shit. It's the Joker.
- You old motherfucker.

953
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:49,426
What's happening?

954
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:53,430
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

955
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,432
What's happening, man?

956
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,019
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big Px.

957
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:01,146
Yeah? Well, why go back?

958
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,856
Here or there, samey-same.

959
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:04,733
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.

960
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:08,987
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

961
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:12,198
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

962
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:15,535
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?

963
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,662
- Rafterman.
- Rafterman.

964
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:20,707
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

965
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,167
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.

966
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:24,252
We're the Lusthog Squad.

967
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,005
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

968
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:30,675
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

969
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:37,807
You a photographer?

970
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:41,811
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

971
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:45,315
Oh, you seen much combat?

972
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,403
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

973
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,535
You're a real comedian.

974
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:01,539
Well, they call me the Joker.

975
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,293
Well, I got a joke for you.

976
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:08,713
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

977
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,760
Well, pilgrim...

978
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:19,099
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

979
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,606
You talk the talk.

980
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:30,610
Do you walk the walk?

981
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:36,533
Now, you might not believe it...

982
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,955
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

983
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:46,292
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

984
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:50,630
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

985
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,635
Hey, jungle-bunny.

986
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:58,596
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

987
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:00,598
Yeah, Mother.

988
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,643
Hey, photographer.

989
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:07,105
You wanna take a good picture?

990
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:09,816
Here, man.

991
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,651
Take this.

992
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:23,330
This is my bro.

993
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:35,008
This is his party.

994
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,344
He's the guest of honor.

995
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:40,972
Today is his birthday.

996
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:44,392
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

997
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:47,771
I will never forget this day.

998
01:09:47,937 --> 01:09:53,234
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

999
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:57,030
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1000
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:00,742
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1001
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:05,664
These are great days we're living, bros.

1002
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,835
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1003
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:13,963
These people we wasted here today...

1004
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:17,384
...are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1005
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:20,845
After we rotate back to the world...

1006
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:24,307
...we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1007
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,460
- Stay put, keep your heads down.
- Stay put.

1008
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:35,253
Stay put.

1009
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,479
Shit.

1010
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:03,865
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1011
01:12:05,575 --> 01:12:09,245
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,748
Delta Six.

1013
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:15,043
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1014
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,087
The lieutenant is down.

1015
01:12:17,295 --> 01:12:20,256
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1016
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:28,390
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1017
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:31,142
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1018
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:33,687
I want the third team up this road here.

1019
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:37,774
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1020
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:41,069
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1021
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:10,797
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1022
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:14,134
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1023
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,678
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1024
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:19,514
- T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
- I'll be Ann-Margret.

1025
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:21,599
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1026
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:24,269
- I'll be General Custer.
- Who'll be the lndian?

1027
01:17:24,477 --> 01:17:27,480
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1028
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:07,646
You're going home now.

1029
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,526
Semper fi.

1030
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:19,074
We're mean Marines, sir.

1031
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:24,579
Go easy, bros.

1032
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,794
Better you than me.

1033
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:37,175
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1034
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:40,220
What cause was that?

1035
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,264
Freedom.

1036
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:47,018
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1037
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:51,564
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1038
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:54,901
This is a slaughter.

1039
01:18:56,152 --> 01:18:59,698
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1040
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:03,660
...my word is poon tang.

1041
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,124
Tough break for Hand Job.

1042
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,503
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1043
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,007
What was the matter with him?

1044
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:22,554
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

1045
01:19:23,638 --> 01:19:27,267
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

1046
01:19:29,185 --> 01:19:34,524
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1047
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:38,987
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1048
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:42,115
Instant Section Eight.

1049
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:46,202
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1050
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:51,583
You ready? Turn over.

1051
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:55,420
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1052
01:19:57,505 --> 01:20:01,509
Well, like- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1053
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:05,221
...so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1054
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,807
So they send us in first to squat...

1055
01:20:07,974 --> 01:20:11,686
...make sure that there are no little...

1056
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:16,066
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1057
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:18,735
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1058
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:21,237
...and basically blow the place to hell.

1059
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:25,450
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1060
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:27,577
...it's like a war, you know...

1061
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:29,663
...Iike what- What-

1062
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:32,832
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was-

1063
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:35,502
You know, was supposed to be.

1064
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,880
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1065
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:42,592
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1066
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,886
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav...

1067
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,222
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1068
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:50,725
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1069
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:53,895
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1070
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:58,483
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1071
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,902
Can I quote LBJ?

1072
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:05,907
" I will not send American boys...

1073
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:08,368
...8 or 10,000 miles
around the world...

1074
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:12,747
...to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves."

1075
01:21:14,624 --> 01:21:18,962
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1076
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:22,924
...you know, I mean, like they-
It's sort of like...

1077
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:26,845
...they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1078
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,596
But they don't want it.

1079
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:31,182
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1080
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:33,351
Poor, dumb bastards.

1081
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:38,982
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty- Pretty bad boys.

1082
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:40,900
I'm not real...

1083
01:21:42,068 --> 01:21:44,904
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1084
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:48,491
...that are supposedly on our side.

1085
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,494
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1086
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,622
Yeah.

1087
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,375
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1088
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,711
...and they don't even appreciate it.

1089
01:22:00,378 --> 01:22:02,297
They think it's a big joke.

1090
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:04,966
Well, if you ask me...

1091
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,469
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1092
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:11,473
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1093
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,185
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1094
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:18,980
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1095
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:20,899
Well, I think we should win.

1096
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:23,526
I hate Vietnam.

1097
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:25,737
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1098
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:28,031
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1099
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,825
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1100
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,162
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1101
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:38,375
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1102
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:44,714
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1103
01:22:45,298 --> 01:22:49,678
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1104
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:51,137
...and kill them.

1105
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:56,393
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1106
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,247
Ten-hut.

1107
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:20,583
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

1108
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,670
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

1109
01:23:23,837 --> 01:23:25,922
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1110
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:27,632
My, my, my.

1111
01:23:28,174 --> 01:23:31,469
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?

1112
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:35,473
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1113
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:38,059
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1114
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:41,438
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1115
01:23:41,604 --> 01:23:44,149
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1116
01:23:44,357 --> 01:23:48,278
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1117
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:50,739
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

1118
01:23:53,074 --> 01:23:55,744
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1119
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,162
Five dollar each.

1120
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,164
Come on, she love you good.

1121
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:00,832
Boom-boom long time.

1122
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,709
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.

1123
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:04,377
No. Ten dollars.

1124
01:24:04,544 --> 01:24:06,713
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1125
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,716
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1126
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,385
Okay, $5. You give me.

1127
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:14,888
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1128
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,557
Let's get mounted.

1129
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:24,522
Something wrong there, chief?

1130
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:26,650
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1131
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:28,360
What the motherfuck?

1132
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:31,071
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1133
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:32,572
What is this, man?

1134
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:37,827
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1135
01:24:38,828 --> 01:24:41,539
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1136
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:43,375
Oh, shit.

1137
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:47,212
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1138
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,465
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1139
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:52,550
Excuse me, ma'am.

1140
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:55,261
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1141
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:59,891
...is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1142
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,644
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1143
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:05,605
Okay, okay.

1144
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:08,274
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:11,903
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1146
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,280
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

1147
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:17,826
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1148
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:21,287
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1149
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,624
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a-

1150
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,920
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1151
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:31,381
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.

1152
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,875
Intelligence passed the word down...

1153
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,628
...that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1154
01:26:10,795 --> 01:26:13,757
...to positions across the Perfume River.

1155
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:18,345
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1156
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,587
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1157
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:07,560
Shit.

1158
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:18,071
He ain't gonna make it.

1159
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:22,617
Shit.

1160
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,377
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1161
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:37,299
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:39,676
Hotel One. Over.

1163
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,886
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1164
01:27:42,053 --> 01:27:45,390
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1165
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:48,310
Wait, One.

1166
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:53,940
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1167
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:55,817
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.

1168
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:58,320
-...and call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.

1169
01:27:58,486 --> 01:28:01,197
Roger. Out.

1170
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,497
I ' m squad leader.

1171
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,878
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1172
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:17,547
All right.

1173
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:19,924
He's dead.

1174
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,592
Cowboy.

1175
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,642
What's up?

1176
01:29:10,934 --> 01:29:14,145
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1177
01:29:14,312 --> 01:29:16,731
Here, see what you think.

1178
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:21,861
I think we're here...

1179
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:25,323
...and we should be here.

1180
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,077
- We're here?
- Yeah.

1181
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:32,497
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1182
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,380
Fuck.

1183
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:47,345
What do you think?

1184
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:51,766
Well, I think we should change direction.

1185
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:07,282
Okay.

1186
01:30:07,907 --> 01:30:09,951
We'll change direction.

1187
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:22,172
What's up?

1188
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,257
Changing direction.

1189
01:30:24,966 --> 01:30:26,217
What are we, lost?

1190
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:29,471
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1191
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,890
Okay, listen up.

1192
01:30:32,098 --> 01:30:34,184
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1193
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:36,186
Okay, we're changing direction.

1194
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:38,063
We're heading over that way.

1195
01:30:38,271 --> 01:30:41,441
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1196
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:44,361
- Got it?
- Got it.

1197
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:48,073
Eightball, let's dance.

1198
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:50,909
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1199
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:53,555
Fuck.

1200
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:10,697
Cease fire.

1201
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:12,741
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1202
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:15,452
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1203
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:17,162
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

1204
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:18,538
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

1205
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:22,250
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1206
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,085
Anybody see a sniper?

1207
01:32:24,252 --> 01:32:25,754
- Nothing.
- Negative.

1208
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,841
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1209
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:31,926
Eightball.

1210
01:32:32,093 --> 01:32:34,721
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1211
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:36,556
Animal, cease fire.

1212
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,892
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1213
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:40,560
This is Cowboy. Over.

1214
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:44,147
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1215
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,608
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1216
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:48,068
Eightball is down.

1217
01:32:48,234 --> 01:32:51,112
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1218
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:54,991
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1219
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:58,662
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1220
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:00,580
Roger. Understand.

1221
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:03,249
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1222
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:05,794
Roger. Over and out.

1223
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,254
- Stay close.
- Got it.

1224
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,926
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1225
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:16,638
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1226
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:18,682
I've requested tank support.

1227
01:33:18,848 --> 01:33:22,143
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1228
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:26,314
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1229
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,110
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1230
01:33:30,276 --> 01:33:32,153
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

1231
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:34,114
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

1232
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,033
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1233
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,869
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1234
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:42,080
I seen this before.

1235
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:45,500
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1236
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:50,505
Goddamn it. No.

1237
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:53,633
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this-

1238
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,885
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1239
01:33:56,052 --> 01:33:59,639
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.

1240
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:20,035
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1241
01:34:20,243 --> 01:34:22,495
Cease fire.

1242
01:34:33,882 --> 01:34:35,175
Hold your fire.

1243
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:37,385
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:37,552 --> 01:34:40,055
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1245
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:44,559
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1246
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:51,816
Hold your fire.

1247
01:34:52,525 --> 01:34:55,028
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1248
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:58,239
Give me that fucking radio.

1249
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:05,080
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1250
01:35:05,246 --> 01:35:06,748
This is Murphy. Over.

1251
01:35:06,873 --> 01:35:09,250
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1252
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:12,337
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1253
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:16,883
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1254
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:19,302
Will advise. Over.

1255
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:22,263
Roger. Out.

1256
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:24,975
Numb-nut bastards.

1257
01:35:25,183 --> 01:35:28,269
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1258
01:35:29,145 --> 01:35:31,189
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1259
01:35:31,356 --> 01:35:33,274
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1260
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:35,652
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1261
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:38,780
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1262
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:41,241
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

1263
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:45,453
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1264
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,871
Back off, Mother.

1265
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1266
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,002
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1267
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:55,964
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1268
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:58,383
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1269
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,385
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1270
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:03,305
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1271
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:05,974
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1272
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:08,476
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1273
01:36:12,689 --> 01:36:16,818
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1274
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:21,948
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1275
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:24,826
You motherfucker.

1276
01:36:40,467 --> 01:36:43,219
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1277
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:46,973
Where's the sniper?

1278
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:53,104
Doc, where's the sniper?

1279
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:03,573
Shit.

1280
01:37:05,158 --> 01:37:07,702
Shit. Fuck.

1281
01:37:22,008 --> 01:37:23,635
Fuck.

1282
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:57,419
Hey, Cowboy.

1283
01:37:57,752 --> 01:37:59,504
Yeah?

1284
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:03,883
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1285
01:38:04,509 --> 01:38:08,013
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1286
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:12,225
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1287
01:38:13,059 --> 01:38:14,561
Come on.

1288
01:38:17,188 --> 01:38:19,399
Son of a bitch.

1289
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:25,697
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1290
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:30,994
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1291
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:33,830
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1292
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:36,791
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1293
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:40,003
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

1294
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,005
Okay.

1295
01:38:42,172 --> 01:38:43,840
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1296
01:38:44,007 --> 01:38:45,050
Let's move out.

1297
01:38:45,425 --> 01:38:46,468
Let's do it.

1298
01:39:24,673 --> 01:39:26,007
Hey, Cowboy.

1299
01:39:26,174 --> 01:39:28,677
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1300
01:39:48,446 --> 01:39:51,157
Donlon, give me that radio.

1301
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:55,412
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1302
01:40:05,922 --> 01:40:08,341
- Cowboy.
- Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1303
01:40:08,508 --> 01:40:10,385
Get him the fuck out of here.

1304
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:19,811
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

1305
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:22,105
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

1306
01:40:22,272 --> 01:40:23,857
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

1307
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:25,358
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

1308
01:40:25,525 --> 01:40:27,402
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

1309
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:30,405
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

1310
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:34,200
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1311
01:40:34,826 --> 01:40:36,036
Come on. Easy.

1312
01:40:36,453 --> 01:40:37,579
Here you go.

1313
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:43,168
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

1314
01:40:47,005 --> 01:40:50,050
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1315
01:40:56,139 --> 01:40:59,559
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

1316
01:41:55,615 --> 01:41:58,159
Let's go get some payback.

1317
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:05,667
Okay.

1318
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,550
Okay.

1319
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:23,101
Watch that fucking hole.

1320
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,603
Throw some smoke.

1321
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,913
Okay, ready?

1322
01:43:24,954 --> 01:43:28,667
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1323
01:43:33,755 --> 01:43:36,424
Joker, in there. New guy.

1324
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:43,343
We got the sniper.

1325
01:46:17,085 --> 01:46:18,586
Joker?

1326
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:20,630
Yo.

1327
01:46:20,964 --> 01:46:22,549
What's up?

1328
01:46:24,009 --> 01:46:26,177
We got the sniper.

1329
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:40,692
I saved Joker's ass.

1330
01:46:40,859 --> 01:46:42,652
I got the sniper.

1331
01:46:42,819 --> 01:46:45,488
I fucking blew her away.

1332
01:46:46,323 --> 01:46:48,283
Am I bad?

1333
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:52,912
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1334
01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:12,641
What's she saying?

1335
01:47:16,269 --> 01:47:18,104
She's praying.

1336
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:25,278
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1337
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:30,617
There's nothing we can do for her.

1338
01:47:32,202 --> 01:47:34,287
She's dead meat.

1339
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:40,210
Okay.

1340
01:47:41,503 --> 01:47:43,672
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1341
01:47:48,176 --> 01:47:50,053
What about her?

1342
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:55,475
Fuck her.

1343
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:58,520
Let her rot.

1344
01:48:14,828 --> 01:48:17,163
We can't just leave her here.

1345
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:22,252
Hey, asshole.

1346
01:48:22,752 --> 01:48:24,963
Cowboy's wasted.

1347
01:48:25,422 --> 01:48:28,008
You're fresh out of friends.

1348
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:30,927
I'm running this squad now...

1349
01:48:31,094 --> 01:48:35,390
...and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1350
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:42,272
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1351
01:48:44,107 --> 01:48:48,069
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1352
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,582
Shoot me.

1353
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,544
Shoot...

1354
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:06,630
...me.

1355
01:49:07,213 --> 01:49:09,299
Shoot...

1356
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:11,426
...me.

1357
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:13,887
Shoot.

1358
01:49:15,555 --> 01:49:17,265
Shoot.

1359
01:49:18,475 --> 01:49:21,770
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1360
01:49:23,647 --> 01:49:25,732
...waste her.

1361
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:27,525
Shoot...

1362
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:31,154
...me.

1363
01:49:35,241 --> 01:49:37,994
Shoot me.

1364
01:49:39,955 --> 01:49:41,164
Shoot...

1365
01:49:42,457 --> 01:49:44,167
...me.

1366
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:46,670
Shoot...

1367
01:49:47,379 --> 01:49:48,797
...me.

1368
01:49:49,381 --> 01:49:51,591
Shoot.

1369
01:49:53,218 --> 01:49:55,261
Shoot.

1370
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:00,433
Shoot.

1371
01:50:01,434 --> 01:50:03,019
Shoot.

1372
01:50:40,348 --> 01:50:42,183
Joker...

1373
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:47,105
...we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1374
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:53,028
Hard-core, man.

1375
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,574
Fucking hard-core.

1376
01:51:14,549 --> 01:51:19,638
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1377
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:24,893
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1378
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:07,644
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1379
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:13,942
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1380
01:52:14,609 --> 01:52:17,278
I am so happy that I am alive...

1381
01:52:17,445 --> 01:52:20,991
...in one piece and short.

1382
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:24,953
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1383
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,080
...but I am alive.

1384
01:52:27,497 --> 01:52:29,499
And I am not afraid.
