1
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,314
First time in India, Miss Quested?

2
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,592
- First time out of England.
- I envy you. New horizons.

3
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,798
Those are the Marabar Caves,
about 20 miles from you at Chandrapore.

4
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,592
I see.

5
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,953
Mrs Moore returns on the Rawalpindi
on May 12th and your return is open.

6
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,036
That is correct?

7
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,390
I'll be staying on... probably.

8
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,275
If you decide to return with Mrs Moore,
let us know as soon as possible.

9
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,317
I will.

10
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Now, labels, stickers,
your ticket, Mrs Moore's ticket.

11
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,435
You should have an interesting voyage.
The viceroy's on board.

12
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,312
Tends to liven things up.

13
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,750
(& military band plays)

14
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,996
(cheering)

15
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,676
Ugh.

16
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,558
I do think it's too bad of Ronny
not to be here to meet us.

17
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,593
- It is nearly a thousand miles.
- We've come 5,000 miles to meet him.

18
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,270
"No more than two annas each."

19
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,916
Thank you. Thank you.

20
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,395
Now... Victoria Station.

21
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,196
(knocking)

22
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,629
- Oh, dear.
- Don't worry.

23
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,992
- Mrs Moore?
- Yes.

24
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,510
I'm Mrs Turton.

25
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,596
My husband's the collector.

26
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,792
Oh... We gave our tickets
to the Indian gentleman.

27
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,791
The chief administrator of Chandrapore.
Ronny's "Burra Sahib".

28
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,911
You must be Adela.

29
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,712
Yes.

30
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,991
Please forgive us, Mrs Turton.
We've had a very trying day.

31
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,908
We just wanted to welcome you
to the fold and to say... We're off.

32
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,750
We must have a drink or something later,
when you've recovered. Goodbye.

33
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,989
I believe you and Ronny met
in the Lake District, Miss Quested?

34
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,509
- Yes, we did.
- You must forgive me.

35
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,236
We have very few secrets in Chandrapore.
And I'm an incurable romantic.

36
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,475
Miss Quested was with her aunt
and I was with Ronny.

37
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,992
You know, Mrs Moore, Ronny's
doing splendidly. You'll be proud of him.

38
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,793
I'll second that.
He's become a proper sahib.

39
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,195
Just the type we want, if I might say so.

40
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,276
(train rumbles)

41
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,274
You know, Mr Turton,
when we get settled in,

42
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,870
we look forward to meeting some of
the Indians you come across socially

43
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,956
as friends.

44
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,037
Well, as a matter of fact,
we don't come across them socially.

45
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,039
They're full of all the virtues,
no doubt, but we don't.

46
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,073
East is East, Mrs Moore.
It's a question of culture.

47
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,356
Could Ronny really have become a sahib?

48
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,716
He could.

49
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,875
But that's why you've come here.

50
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,389
You'll find out soon enough.

51
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,950
She's a dreadful woman.

52
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Yes.

53
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,235
We'd better go to sleep, my dear.

54
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,836
(coughing)

55
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,753
Hello, Mother! Where's Adela?

56
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,074
Here.

57
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,876
I can't believe it.

58
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,516
Antony!

59
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,031
(speaks Urdu)

60
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,109
Antony will see to the baggage. Forgive
me, I'm part of the reception committee.

61
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,398
Guards! Attention!

62
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,519
Sorry to desert you. We had to
welcome the great man back.

63
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,633
- I'd no idea he was so important.
- You hadn't?

64
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,716
(car horn)

65
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,595
(car horn)

66
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,675
(hoots repeatedly)

67
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,918
Look out!

68
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,351
(car horn)

69
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,636
- That was Turton.
- Turton?

70
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,716
(car horn)

71
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,233
McBryde. When he first came, Hamidullah
said he was quite a good fellow.

72
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,035
But they all become exactly the same.

73
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,389
I give any Englishman two years.

74
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,798
- The women are worse.
- I give them six months.

75
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,634
Ronny, is that a body?

76
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,793
Yes. I'm sorry.
We'll soon be out of this.

77
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,633
Why do we spend so much time
discussing the English?

78
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,796
Because we admire them, Doctor Sahib.

79
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,876
That is the trouble.

80
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,036
Tomorrow night!

81
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,268
English!

82
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,992
- Here we are, then.
- Very nice, dear.

83
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,911
- Are those the Marabar Hills?
- That's right.

84
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,600
- With the caves?
- I suppose so.

85
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,235
Look, you've got a busy day tomorrow.
Then we have a show at the club.

86
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,316
- Come on. Let's have tea.
- Yes.

87
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,754
(Ronny) Good night, Mother.

88
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,389
- (knocking)
- Yes?

89
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,318
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

90
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,956
Having listened to the evidence,
I find you guilty of cheating

91
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,719
under Section 415
of the Indian Penal Code

92
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,957
and sentence you
to two months' hard labour.

93
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,839
You may take the prisoner down.

94
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,955
- Well, how did it all go?
- We must have seen everything.

95
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,995
Yes, the church, the hospital,
the war memorial, the barracks.

96
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,272
- Mr Hadley was most thorough.
- Splendid. And now you're off to the club.

97
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,196
Cucumber.

98
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,873
My dear, life rarely gives us what we want
at the moment we consider appropriate.

99
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,912
Adventures do occur,
but not punctually.

100
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,192
Doctor Sahib, when are we
going to get you married?

101
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,073
I have enough responsibilities, Auntie.

102
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,193
We ask the poor fellow to dinner,
avail ourselves of his professional skills,

103
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,676
- and you always bring up this question.
- It is the least I can do.

104
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,756
This should put a stop to the trouble.

105
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,635
And, Begum Sahiba, I beg you once more
not to drink water out of a tap.

106
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,479
Please to boil it, boil it, boil it!

107
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,356
And now we can eat. Selim!

108
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,436
(both speak Urdu)

109
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,276
Why must you always bring up
this question of marriage?

110
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,109
He sends the children nearly all his salary
and lives like a low-grade clerk.

111
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,593
What more do you require?

112
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,588
This chitty has just arrived for you
from Major Callendar.

113
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,992
I am to report to his bungalow posthaste.

114
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,112
And my bicycle has a puncture.

115
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,274
The major sahib left half an hour ago.

116
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,473
- And left no message?
- No message.

117
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,473
Mrs Lesley, it is a tonga. Come!

118
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,556
Oh, how splendid.

119
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,191
I suppose this is all right?

120
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,677
My dear, never look a gift-horse in
the mouth, particularly in this country.

121
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,677
Club!

122
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,712
Club, tonga wallah! Club!
Why doesn't the fool move?

123
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,637
I pay you tomorrow.

124
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,399
(women giggle)

125
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,276
Will you please...

126
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,916
(rustling)

127
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,276
(leaves rustling)

128
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,675
Madam, this is a mosque.
You have no right here.

129
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,270
- You should have taken off your shoes.
- But I have taken off my shoes.

130
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,630
I left them outside.

131
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,192
Then I... I ask your pardon.

132
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,555
- Let me go.
- Madam.

133
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,270
I am right, am I not?

134
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,550
If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?

135
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,077
Of course.
But so few ladies take the trouble.

136
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,397
Especially if thinking
no one is here to see.

137
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,750
God is here.

138
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,916
God is here.

139
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,752
That is very fine.
May I know your name?

140
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,356
Mrs Moore.

141
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,036
Oh.

142
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,233
I came from the club.

143
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,352
They're doing a rather tiresome
musical play I'd seen in London.

144
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,314
- It was very hot.
- I think you ought not to walk alone.

145
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,876
There are bad characters about,
and leopards may come from the hills.

146
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,560
- Snakes also.
- But you walk alone.

147
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,558
- I come here quite often. I'm used to it.
- Used to snakes?

148
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,476
I'm a doctor, you see.
Snakes don't dare bite me.

149
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,836
Please.

150
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,674
Mrs Moore, I think you are
newly arrived in India.

151
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,155
Yes. How did you know?

152
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,475
By the way you address me.

153
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,999
Look.

154
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,272
Sometimes I have seen a dead body
float past from Benares.

155
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,990
But not very often.

156
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,315
- There are crocodiles.
- Crocodiles?

157
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,751
How terrible.

158
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,595
What a terrible river.

159
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,195
What a wonderful river.

160
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,559
Please may I ask you a question now?
Why do you come to India?

161
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,752
I come to visit my son.
He's the city magistrate.

162
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,395
Oh, no. Excuse me.
Our city magistrate is Mr Heaslop.

163
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,229
He is my son all the same.
I was married twice.

164
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,070
And your first husband died?

165
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,112
He did. And so did my second.

166
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,196
Then we are in the same box.

167
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,992
And is the city magistrate
the entire of your family now?

168
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,795
No. I have a daughter in England by my
second husband. Stella. She's an artist.

169
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,039
Ah.

170
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,994
Mrs Moore, like yourself,
I have also a son and a daughter.

171
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,075
Is not this the same box
with a vengeance?

172
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,909
But not called Ronny and Stella, surely?

173
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,079
No indeed. Akbar and Jamila.
They live with my wife's mother.

174
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,156
And your wife?

175
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,754
In giving me a son, she died.

176
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,156
You have the most kind face
of any English lady I have met.

177
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,315
I think I'd better go back now.

178
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,678
& I've got this strange feeling
I've fallen in love

179
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,150
- & She's fallen in love?
- & While I was freewheeling

180
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,436
And...

181
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,636
& Hooray, hooray, hooray

182
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,035
& It's a wonderful day today

183
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,230
& But I know that at this juncture

184
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,396
& I can't afford a puncture

185
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,829
& And here is my Michael...

186
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,435
I wish I were a member.
I could have asked you in.

187
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,554
Indians are not allowed.

188
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,678
Oh.

189
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,756
Good night.

190
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,069
There you are.
What have you been up to?

191
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,270
I'll tell you about it later.

192
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,951
I had a small adventure,
and saw the moon in the Ganges.

193
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,716
Ah, Mrs Moore, Miss Quested,
have a drink. Have two drinks.

194
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,274
- It's very kind.
- My wife's on stage,

195
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,188
and Ronny's still holding
the fort for Major Callendar.

196
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,110
His wretched Indian assistant didn't
turn up in time, but I got my own back.

197
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,233
I'm sorry about the show.
But what else can we do for you ladies?

198
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,158
Mr Turton, I'm longing to see
something of the real India.

199
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,797
Fielding, how is one to see the real India?

200
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,115
Try seeing Indians.

201
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,992
- Who was that?
- Our schoolmaster. Government College.

202
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,076
As if one could avoid seeing them.

203
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,998
Well, I've scarcely spoken to
an Indian since we landed.

204
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,396
Lucky you!

205
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,876
If you really want to meet
some of our Aryan brothers,

206
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,468
how about a bridge party?

207
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,795
- Not the game.
- Oh...

208
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,673
No. A party to bridge the gulf
between East and West.

209
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,352
We can produce almost any type you like:
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, even a Parsee.

210
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,953
(drum roll)

211
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,712
& God save our gracious king

212
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,272
& Long live our noble king

213
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,029
& God save the king

214
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,194
& Send him victorious

215
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,711
& Happy and glorious...

216
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,480
(& band plays "Tea for Two")

217
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,235
To work, Molly. To work.

218
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,393
I never thought so many would turn up.
They hate it as much as we do.

219
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,992
Ronny.

220
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,516
(speaks Urdu)

221
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,389
Very nice of you to come.

222
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,990
Would you please tell these ladies
I wish we could speak their language?

223
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,398
- Perhaps we speak yours a little.
- Why, fancy, she understands!

224
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,155
- Piccadilly, Hyde Park Corner.
- Yes, indeed.

225
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,078
- Rotten Row.
- Marble Arch.

226
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,113
- She knows Paris also.
- They pass Paris on the way, no doubt.

227
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,720
(& "Roses of Picardy")

228
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,236
My only consolation

229
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,673
is that Mrs Turton will soon be retired
to a villa in Tunbridge Wells.

230
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,828
Who is that man talking to Adela?

231
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,918
Oh, that's Fielding.
Runs Government College.

232
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,556
I don't understand people inviting guests
and not treating them properly.

233
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,991
You and Mr Turton are the only people
who've made any attempt to be friendly.

234
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,236
It makes me quite ashamed.

235
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,954
It's awkward, I agree, here at the club.

236
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,674
I envy you being with Indians.

237
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,349
If you and Mrs Moore would care
to meet one or two, it's easily arranged.

238
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,552
I'd love to. I'm sure she would too.

239
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,633
We've an old Hindu professor who'll tell
you all about reincarnation and destiny.

240
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,275
- He might even be persuaded to sing.
- I'd like that.

241
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,632
- Tell me, do you know a Dr Aziz?
- I know of him. I've never actually met.

242
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,149
Mrs Moore says he's charming.

243
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,510
- Good. We'll invite him too.
- Good.

244
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,548
Oh, dear. This is for Mrs Turton.

(& "In a Monastery Garden"

246

This is one of the most unnatural affairs
I have ever attended.

247
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,108
Of course it's unnatural.
Now you see.

248
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,279
I do not see why you all behave
so unpleasantly to these people.

249
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,916
- We're not out here to be pleasant.
- Ronny, what do you mean?

250
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,439
India isn't a drawing room. We're out here
to do justice and to keep the peace.

251
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,915
I'm not a missionary
or a sentimental socialist.

252
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,828
- I'm just a member of the civil service.
- As simple as that.

253
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,035
What do you and Adela want me to do?
Sacrifice my career?

254
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,833
Lose the power I have
for doing good in this country?

255
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,589
Good? You're speaking about power.

256
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,076
The whole of this entertainment
is an exercise in power,

257
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,795
and the subtle pleasures
of personal superiority.

263
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,719
- Mr Fielding.
- Oh, hello. Is that Dr Aziz?

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,279
Yes. I'm afraid I am early.

265

That's fine. I won't be a jiffy.
Please make yourself at home.

May I really, Mr Fielding?
It's very good of you.

- Mr Fielding!
- Yes?

268

I have long been wanting to meet you.

269
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,711
I have heard many times about
your kind heart and your sociability.

My dear fellow!

271
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,790
And I have seen you in the bazaar.

272

Ah.

- I say, Mr Fielding.
- Yes?

277
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,593
Before you come out,
guess what I look like.

278
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,955
Well, let's see.
You're about 5ft 9in tall.

279
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,993
- Jolly good!
- I can see that much through the glass.

280
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,196
Blast!

281
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,870
- Anything wrong?
- I've just broken my back collar stud.

282
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,275
Oh. Take mine.

283
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,476
Have you a spare one?

284
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,556
Yes. Yes, one minute.

285
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,911
- Not if you're wearing it.
- No, no. Here in my pocket.

286
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,114
But nobody carries
a spare stud in his pocket.

287
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,194
I always, in case of emergency.

288
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,196
Here it is.

289
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,868
Many thanks.
Oh, and how do you do?

290
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,199
Sit down while I finish dressing,
if you don't mind the unconventionality.

291
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,436
I always thought Englishmen
kept their rooms so tidy.

292
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,109
Everything arranged coldly
on shelves is what I thought.

293
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,632
There are two English ladies
coming to tea to meet you.

294
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,354
- Oh.
- Oh, I think you know one of them.

295
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,029
- I know no English ladies.
- Not Mrs Moore?

296
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,152
- Mrs Moore?
- And Miss Quested, her companion.

297
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
Oh. Is she an old lady?

298
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
She's a young lady,
and she wants to see India.

299
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,395
(both speak Urdu)

300
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,988
They're here,
or will be in a few seconds.

301
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,391
I've also asked our professor
of philosophy, Narayan Godbole.

302
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,432
Oh, the inscrutable Brahmin.

303
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,870
I hope to goodness his food'll be
all right. He's orthodox, you know.

304
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,950
(Fielding) Good afternoon. Welcome.

305
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,596
- (Mrs Moore) How kind of you to ask us.
- (Miss Quested) Nice to meet you.

306
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,948
Oh.

307
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,275
It must have been a small audience hall.

308
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,153
Mrs Moore, do you remember
the tank in our mosque?

309
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,033
- I do indeed.
- Please come and see.

310
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,030
By a skilful arrangement of our emperors,
the same water comes and fills this tank.

311
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,470
My ancestors loved water.
We came out of the desert.

312
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,114
We came over from
Persia and Afghanistan.

313
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,676
And wherever we went, we created
fountains and gardens and...

314
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,355
Ah, Godbole! You know Dr Aziz,
and here are our new visitors.

315
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,758
Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Professor
Godbole. We didn't realise you were here.

316
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,713
The sun will soon be driving us
all into the shade.

317
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,149
And I was enjoying the water.

318
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,993
Now, Mrs Moore, would you like
to have our tea served inside or out?

319
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,191
Dr Aziz, I wonder if you could explain
a disappointment we had this morning.

320
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,596
Ah, yes. I'm afraid we may have
given some offence.

321
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,188
That is impossible. May I know the facts?

322
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,950
Yes. An Indian lady and gentleman, whom
we met at the club party the other day,

323
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,197
were to collect us in their carriage
this morning at nine.

324
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,278
We waited and waited.
They never came.

325
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,789
They even put off
going to Delhi to entertain us.

326
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,753
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- Well, it is very worrying.

327
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,997
I think perhaps, young lady,
they grew ashamed of their house

328
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,954
- and that is why they did not send.
- That's very possible.

329
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,516
- I do so hate mysteries.
- We English do.

330
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,713
I rather like mysteries,
but I do dislike muddles.

331
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,037
I think a mystery is only
a high-sounding term for a muddle.

332
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
The professor, Aziz and I
know that India's a muddle.

333
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,354
Agreed, I'm sorry to say.

334
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,438
There will be no muddle
when you come to visit me at my house.

335
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,551
That would be very nice. Yes, Adela?

336
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,229
Yes, indeed. Do please give me
your address, Doctor Aziz.

337
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,112
- Yes?
- One moment. I have a better idea.

338
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,073
Let me invite you all
to a picnic at the Marabar Caves.

339
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,988
Ladies, this will be
a most magnificent outing.

340
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,908
One is transported by mountain railway
2,000 feet above the plain.

341
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,237
And the caves, Mrs Moore,
are a wonder of India.

342
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,511
- Yes, Professor?
- They have a reputation.

343
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,229
Doctor, how many caves are there?

344
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,512
I'm not exactly sure. Unfortunately,
I've never been there myself.

345
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,829
My dear chap!

346
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,872
Professor Godbole,
have you seen the caves?

347
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,797
Oh, yes.

348
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,192
Well, could you tell us
something about them?

349
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,276
With pleasure.

350
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,151
Only a few have been opened.
Perhaps seven or eight.

351
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,555
And?

352
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
There is an entrance which you enter,

353
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,593
and through this entrance, manmade,
there is a circular chamber.

354
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,758
- Big?
- Not big.

355
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,117
- Immensely holy, no doubt?
- Oh, no, no.

356
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,834
Ornamented in some way?

357
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,192
They are all the same. Empty and dark.

358
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,199
Well, there must be something
to account for their reputation.

359
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,276
Indeed.

360
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,272
Well, well.

361
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,552
Mr Fielding, I should like
to see something of the college.

362
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,229
Don't you come, Adela.
I know you hate institutions.

363
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,317
You know, Miss Quested, when I first
saw Mrs Moore it was in the moonlight.

364
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,556
I thought she was a ghost.

365
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,278
- A very old soul.
- An old soul?

366
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,358
The professor is using
the expression in its Hindu sense.

367
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,869
Someone who has been here
many times before.

368
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,072
- Mrs Moore - a reincarnation?
- Quite so.

369
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,273
- Please go on, Professor.
- Ah, yes.

370
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,279
- It is philosophy of some complication.
- But in simple terms...

371
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,518
In simple terms, Miss Quested,
life is a wheel with many spokes.

372
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,397
A continuous cycle of life:
birth, death and rebirth

373
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,034
until we attain nirvana.

374
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,159
I have contrived a dance
based on this philosophy.

375
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,236
Do you dance, Professor?

376
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,477
- Adela.
- Oh, Ronny, you're early.

377
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,398
Let me introduce to you
Professor Godbole and this...

378
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,513
What's happened to Fielding?
And what on earth are you doing?

379
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,269
They're seeing the college and
we're eating water chestnuts. Have one.

380
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,675
No, thank you. We're leaving at once.

381
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,918
- But we can't leave like this.
- It's perfectly all right.

382
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,600
Bearer! Bearer!

383
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,156
(train whistle)

384
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,035
You can take it from me
that picnic will never come off.

385
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,470
Just like that fiasco this morning.
He'll forget he invited you.

386
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,637
- You're wrong.
- Notice the collar climbing up his neck?

387
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,513
I like Dr Aziz.

388
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,236
Aziz was dressed in his Sunday best,
but he'd forgotten his back collar stud.

389
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,396
And there you have the Indian all over.

390
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,034
I bet he forgot the caves
are miles from the station.

391
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,799
- Have you been to them?
- I know all about them, naturally.

392
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,435
- Naturally.
- I really cannot have this quarrelling.

393
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,629
Sorry.

394
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,554
I don't know why I get so het up.

395
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,468
Actually, I was taking us all
to see a game of polo. Should be good.

396
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,353
Not for me, dear. I'm going to rest.

397
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,153
You and Adela can watch the polo.

398
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,836
- Ronny.
- Yes?

399
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,396
- I want to say something.
- Yes?

400
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,476
Something important.

401
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,236
Ronny...

402
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,353
I've finally decided...

403
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,914
we're not going to be married.

404
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,198
You never said we would be married.

405
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,194
But you were quite right to come out.
It was a good idea.

406
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,997
We're being awfully English
about this, aren't we?

407
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,634
I suppose that's all right.

408
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,877
As we are English, yes, I suppose it is.

409
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,755
Let's go for a little drive.

410
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,190
- Oughtn't we get back to the bungalow?
- Why?

411
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,710
I think we should tell your mother,
talk about what we're going to do.

412
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,956
If you don't mind,
let's leave it a day or two.

413
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,230
I don't want to upset her
any more than I have.

414
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,238
And besides,
you're going on that expedition.

415
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,954
And why did you undertake
such an extravagance?

416
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,036
To avoid asking them to my house.

417
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,152
Which you had already done.

418
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,431
Now we must all put
our shoulders to the wheel.

419
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,870
My wife will supply plates,
knives and forks.

420
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,549
And then there is the question of alcohol.

421
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,592
Whisky-sodas for Mr Fielding,
ports for the ladies.

422
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,916
And food. The English are big eaters.

423
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,952
- And Professor Godbole?
- He eats more than the English.

424
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,039
- Nothing but vegetables, fruits and rice.
- And only if cooked by a Brahmin.

425
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,470
And if there is a slice of beef
in the vicinity, he will throw up.

426
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,068
The English can eat mutton.

427
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,479
- Even ham.
- Ham? Are you suggesting I offer ham?

428
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,909
Enough, enough.

429
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,669
English ladies cannot sit upon the ground.
Not even on a Persian carpet.

430
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,270
- You must take chairs and tables.
- So you will need servants.

431
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,075
Then there is also the question
of transport after the train journey.

432
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,476
The caves are a considerable
distance from the station.

433
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,910
I've just been to the station.
The train leaves before dawn.

434
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,589
Then you must take precaution
against lack of punctuality.

435
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,075
Better spend the night there.

436
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,237
- What was that?
- Nothing.

437
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,150
It always happens before the hot weather,
generally with dust and thunder. Coffee?

438
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,875
No, thank you. I'm off to bed.

439
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,753
I know I made myself
rather ridiculous this afternoon.

440
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,839
But the truth is, I wasn't
quite sure of myself, and I'm sorry.

441
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,353
Very nicely said. Thank you, dear.

442
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,314
Of course, I have no earthly right to tell
either of you what you can or cannot do.

443
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,432
See India if you like and as you like.

444
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,076
Sometimes I think too much fuss
is made about marriage.

445
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,478
Century after century
of carnal embracement,

446
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,592
and we're still no nearer
understanding one another.

447
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,956
Good night.

448
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,275
(dogs barking)

449
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,391
(bicycle bell)

450
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,592
Adela, are you all right?

451
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,396
Yes, of course.

452
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,874
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing.

453
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,749
I want to take back what I said at the polo.

454
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,997
Oh, Ronny... I'm such a fool.

455
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,160
(& orchestra plays "Oh, Lady Be Good")

456
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,112
It's a funny thing,
but I don't feel a bit excited.

457
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,638
Well, nothing's really changed, has it?
I feel perfectly ordinary.

458
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,797
It's much the best feeling to have.

459
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,236
I suppose so.

460
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,750
I'm sorry to have been so difficult.

461
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,030
Oh, I shouldn't worry.

462
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,429
It's partly to do with this country
and the odd surroundings.

463
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,076
Do you mean that my bothers
are to do with India?

464
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,236
India forces one to come
face to face with oneself.

465
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,393
It can be rather disturbing.

466
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,030
Odd.

467
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,958
It must be very cold in England.

468
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,471
Now we must go back
and you must dance with Ronny.

469
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,275
Apart from anything else,
it will serve as a notice of intent.

470
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,836
Hello.

471
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,072
(rumble of thunder)

472
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,519
(groans)

473
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,316
Hassan.

474
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,237
(both speak Urdu)

475
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,559
- It's going to be hot.
- Your famous hot weather.

476
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,035
- Mother?
- You two go ahead.

477
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,999
Ah!

478
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,554
Congratulations.
We've just heard the good news.

479
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,830
Allow me to shake your hand.

480
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,035
Mr Fielding, I'm Dr Lal.

481
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,755
- Ah, yes. How do you do?
- Just making check on doctor sahib.

482
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,314
- Major Callendar's orders.
- And?

483
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,159
A slight fever, perhaps.
Change of season.

484
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,840
- You must get well quickly.
- Yes. There is talk of cholera in the city.

485
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,349
There is always talk of cholera in the city.

486
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,715
Hello! Can I come in?

487
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,590
Mr Fielding. Yes, please come in.

488
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,396
Ah.

489
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,191
- Hamidullah.
- Mr Fielding, how nice of you to come.

490
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,756
- And how's the patient?
- It is very good of Mr Fielding

491
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,633
to condescend to visit our friend.
We're deeply touched.

492
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,638
Don't talk to him like that.
He does not want it.

493
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,394
And he does not need three chairs.
He's not three Englishmen!

494
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,759
Well, are you ill or aren't you?

495
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,235
No doubt Major Callendar
told you I'm shamming.

496
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,316
Well, are you?

497
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,633
The hot weather is coming.
I have a fever.

498
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,114
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, all of you!

499
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,396
Mr Fielding, excuse. A question, please.

500
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,159
- Carry on.
- Nothing personal.

501
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,477
Personally, we're all delighted
that you should be here.

502
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,398
But how is England
justified in holding India?

503
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,875
- Unfair political question.
- No, no.

504
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,913
- I'm out here because I need a job.
- Qualified Indians also need a job.

505
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,190
I got in first.

506
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,668
And I'm delighted to be here. That's
my answer and that's my only excuse.

507
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,190
- And those who are not delighted?
- Chuck 'em out.

508
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,880
Indians are also saying that.

509
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,030
- (speaks Urdu)
- Mr Fielding...

510
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,196
What are you doing out here?

511
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,754
Please come back.

512
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,836
Of course.

513
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,594
Here you see the celebrated
hospitality of the East.

514
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,233
Look... look at the mess.
Look at the flies.

515
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,909
- Look at the plaster coming off the wall.
- Oh, please.

516
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,590
Here is my home,

517
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,280
where you come to be insulted
by my friends.

518
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,915
That was fair enough.
And you'd better get back into bed.

519
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,114
- And then you'll have to be off.
- You should rest.

520
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,836
I can rest all day thanks to Dr Lal,
Major Callendar's spy.

521
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,552
I suppose you know that.

522
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,595
Major Callendar doesn't trust anyone,
English or Indian. That's his character.

523
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,269
I wish you weren't under him.
But you are, and that's that.

524
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,875
There we are. Try sleeping for a bit.

525
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,516
Before you go, will you please open
that drawer under the clock?

526
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,634
There's a grey cardboard folder.

527
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,751
That's right. Open it.

528
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,236
She was my wife.

529
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,228
You are the first Englishman
she has ever come before.

530
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,319
Now put her away.

531
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,069
I don't know why you pay me this
great compliment, but I do appreciate it.

532
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,759
Oh, it is nothing. She was not a highly
educated woman, or even beautiful.

533
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,756
But I loved her.

534
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,792
Now put her away.
You would have seen her anyhow.

535
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,119
- Would you have allowed me to see her?
- Why not?

536
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,949
I believe in the purdah, but I would
have told her you were my brother.

537
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,878
- Would she have believed you?
- Of course not.

538
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,276
Put her away. She is dead.

539
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,632
I showed her to you because
I have nothing else to show.

540
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,157
Mr Fielding, why are you not married?

541
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,189
The lady I liked wouldn't marry me.
That's the main point.

542
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,879
That was a long time ago.
Before the war.

543
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,040
- You haven't any children?
- None.

544
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,236
Excuse the following question.
Have you any illegitimate children?

545
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,191
No.

546
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,993
- Then your name will die entirely out?
- Right.

547
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,352
This is what an Oriental
will never understand.

548
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,634
- There are far too many children anyway.
- Why don't you marry Miss Quested?

549
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,990
- Good Lord!
- But she's very nice.

550
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,511
I can't marry her even if I wanted to.
She's engaged to the city magistrate.

551
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,949
Oh.

552
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,389
So no Miss Quested for Mr Fielding.

553
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,075
However, she is not beautiful,
and she has practically no breasts.

554
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,156
For a magistrate they may be sufficient.

555
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,272
For you I'll arrange a lady
with breasts like Bombay mangoes!

556
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,470
No, you won't.

557
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,912
You must not tell Callendar, but last year
I took sick leave and I went to Calcutta.

558
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,953
- There are girls there with breasts...
- You've made a remarkable recovery.

559
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,311
- I have, I have.
- Please tell your chap to bring my horse.

560
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,433
- He doesn't seem to understand my Urdu.
- I told him not to.

561
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,473
But now I will release you. Hassan!

562
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,034
(both speak Urdu)

563
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,955
By the way, about this Marabar
expedition. It's going to cost an awful lot.

564
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,038
Would you like me to help you call it off?

565
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,594
No, no. Arrangements
are almost complete.

566
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,836
I shall know exact date tomorrow.

567
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,394
Well, good. Don't leave it too long.

568
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,756
Phew.

569
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,555
Hassan?

570
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,797
(both speak Urdu)

571
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,356
(train whistle)

572
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,835
You've come after all! I was afraid...
How kind, how very kind!

573
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,112
I'm sorry, Dr Aziz, but I've never been
at my best at this time of the morning.

574
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,312
- We're here anyway.
- Yes. Excuse me. Please come.

575
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,915
(speaks Urdu)

576
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,275
- This isn't all for us?
- For this great occasion

577
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,709
I've had help from all my friends.

578
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,877
I think you will not need your servant.

579
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,915
- No, indeed.
- Then we shall all be Muslims together.

580
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,634
Antony...
I don't like him at all.

581
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,230
Antony, you can go now.
We won't need you any more.

582
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,999
Master told me to stay.

583
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,429
Mistress tells you to go.

584
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,916
Master says
"Keep near ladies all morning."

585
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,350
Please go.

586
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,710
- What's that for?
- A surprise. You will see.

587
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,748
Come, come, come. Please, come.

588
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,149
You are travelling purdah.
You will like that?

589
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,431
- It will certainly be a new experience.
- Yes.

590
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,270
Where's Mr Fielding?

591
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,439
He'll be here.
Englishmen never miss a train.

592
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,995
Mr Fielding! Mr Fielding!

593
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,076
I'm most awfully sorry, Aziz.

594
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,839
Oh, Mr Fielding, you have destroyed me.

595
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,872
It was Godbole's prayers.
They went on for ever.

596
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,435
- Jump on! Jump!
- No, no.

597
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,870
- I must have you.
- I'm sorry, Aziz, but it really is no good.

598
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,315
We'll join you... somehow.

599
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,035
Mrs Moore, our expedition is a ruin.

600
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,277
Nonsense.
We shall now all be Muslims together.

601
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,630
- Dear, dear Mrs Moore.
- Go back to you carriage, Dr Aziz.

602
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,716
You make me quite giddy.

603
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,798
Poor Aziz.
We must try and get hold of a car.

604
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,832
Can you think of anyone?

605
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,757
Is anything the matter?

606
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,792
- You saw the gates shut against us?
- Yes.

607
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,310
- Today is Tuesday.
- Go on.

608
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,000
Not a wise day
to undertake such a journey.

609
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,793
Extremely inauspicious, Mr Fielding.

610
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,876
Godbole.

611
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,240
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

612
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,231
- Memsahib.
- Oh, thank you.

613
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,316
- Tea coming.
- Yes.

614
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,231
What a relief after Antony.

615
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,390
Rather a strange place to do the cooking.

616
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,790
I always feel rather embarrassed
when people I dislike are good to me.

617
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,593
And I really don't care for Mrs Callendar.

618
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,110
But she's visiting a clinic and
the road goes up to just below the caves.

619
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,550
We'd better leave in half an hour.
Would you care for a coffee?

620
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,909
- Miss Quested!
- Oh, no.

621
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,469
Is Mrs Moore awake?

622
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,831
Yes. But please... go in!

623
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,269
Don't worry, Miss Quested.
Look, I am Douglas Fairbanks.

624
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,878
Tell me, dear. What's going on out there?

625
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,196
Mrs Moore, we're almost there.

626
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,279
I will now explain to you about the ladder.
It is to be your big surprise.

627
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,273
You cannot imagine how you honour me.

628
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,033
I feel that I am journeying back into
my past, and that I'm a Mogul emperor.

629
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,159
Sometimes I shut my eyes and dream...
I have splendid clothes again.

630
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,196
And that I'm riding into battle
behind Alamgir. He too rode an elephant.

631
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,636
Horrid, stuffy place, really.

632
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,672
- Everything is very well arranged.
- And here, ladies, is your port.

633
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,517
The best caves are higher up,
under the Kawa Dol.

634
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,154
But we start in this one.

635
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,352
The guide says,
everyone to go in quietly.
