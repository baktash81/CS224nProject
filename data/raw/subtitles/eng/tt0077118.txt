160
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,840
the chief has congressman beulford in his office 
wayne beauford that's right congress wants to

161
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,840

dope yeah that's right it's election year isn't it

162
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,000
thank you ray finally i can get some straight 
answers around here well sir a lot of people

163
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,320
are getting very worried about these sea thefts 
and the dope that's coming through on these boats

164
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,800
apparently drug enforcement administration among 
them sir if i may say so if they're reusing these

165
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,640
boats to ship narcotics and drugs and marijuana 
and such you're the people to put a stop to it

166
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,560
well sir uh yeah it's impossible you see there's 
no way that we can actually patrol the entire

167
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,280
western coastline united states of america and 
keep our eye on every pleasure craft that's out

168
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,640
there in the pacific ocean so you just plan 
on letting go on well no congressman actually

169
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,720
what we're trying to do is stop the 
production of narcotics at its source

170
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,800
now once we do that we don't have to worry about 
any hijacking of pleasure craft or anything else

171
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,520
how do you plan to do that well the chief and i 
actually were thinking about bringing you to one

of these sites so you can get a first-hand point 
of view out there where the action is that's right
