00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,843
You gotta calm down, man.

183
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,720
Look, why don't we
just report it to the office

184
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,881
right after we eat, okay?

185
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:50,654
You got me to thank
for those brownies.

186
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,825
Why is that?
I don't see no apron on you.

187
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,935
Yeah, well, they realized
I'm a whiz with numbers.

188
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:58,570
So they got me checking over
the order

189
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,133
for the whole cafeteria.

190
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,801
Well, I spotted something.

191
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,574
A unit of brownies costs less
than a unit of beans.

192
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,846
So what?

193
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,748
"So what?"
So I switched a few numbers

194
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,146
on the weekly ordering sheet.

195
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:11,916
And under my new
cost-cutting plans,

196
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,646
we got a whole lot
more brownies.

197
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,390

That was federal property
you destroyed back there.

217
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,013
Now I only got two choices.

218
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,416
Either I send you to prison,
or I send you home.

219
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,621
That boy stole my shoes.

220
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:03,929
My mama worked hard
to give me those.

221
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,237
Where's all that rage
coming from?

222
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,528
I don't have any rage.

223
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,031
Get in the car.

224
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:16,767
In the time you've been here,

225
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,778
you punched out
three corpsmen...

226
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,537
And one innocent door.

227
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,911
They disrespected me.

228
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,084
The door too?

229
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,125
You got money for a bus ticket?

230
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:36,890
No.

231
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,131
Hm.

I can't.

I'm talking about boxing,
not fighting.

244
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,148
It's a sport.

He's gonna be
your opponent today.

Don't worry, big man.
I'll be gentle.

256
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,498
That's just a sign of
sportsmanship before you fight.

257

To show that you're not here
to kill each other.

258
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,269
You're just two athletes

259

who's best at the sport.

wasn't you?

He was showing off.
No, he wasn't.

311

He was trying to force you
to go where he needed you to go,

312
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:35,651
so he could deliver that punch
that he was setting up.

313
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:37,213

the ring too,

01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,671
My choice was made for me.

1241
01:16:44,065 --> 01:16:45,235
So was mine.

1242
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,406
I don't believe you, George.

1243
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:06,388
George:
<i>For 28 years, I used

1244
01:17:08,327 --> 01:17:10,524
<i>I knew I had to start
using my heart.</i>

1245
01:17:13,438 --> 01:17:14,528
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

1246
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:19,235
Muhammed:
<i>She told me big George foreman

1247
01:17:19,371 --> 01:17:22,701
And I said,
"Beatrice, you are crazy.

1248
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,879
George foreman ain't coming
to see the champ

1249
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:27,315
unless he's looking
for another whupping."

1251
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:42,028
So I've come here...

1252
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:46,762
To tell you that I found Jesus.

1253
01:17:46,897 --> 01:17:48,597
You found Jesus?

1254
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:51,701
Congratulations, George.
I did not know he was lost.

[Chuckles]

1256
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
I came here...

1257
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:59,580
To ask for your forgiveness.

1258
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,714
For my forgiveness?
Yes.

1259
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,713
I'm the one who knocked you out.

1260
01:18:03,848 --> 01:18:04,853
You know...

1261
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,922
After Zaire...

1262
01:18:09,724 --> 01:18:12,190
I hated you, Muhammad.

1263
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
I did.

1264
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:18,058
And I wanted to kill you...

1265
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,526
With these hands.

1266
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:23,064
Come on, man.
You want a rematch. I know.

1267
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,933
Just come out and say it.

1268
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,906
I don't want no rematch.

1269
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:28,611
They told me
you retired to preach,

1270
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,346
but I didn't believe it.
Well, I...

1271
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:32,909
I wanna help people.

1272
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,676
Well, George, help me, okay?

1273
01:18:34,812 --> 01:18:36,824
All you got to do is fight
Kenny Norton one more time.

1274
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:37,848
Knock him out.

1275
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:39,355
Please, George, knock him out.

1276
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,056
Because I sure can't.

1277
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:43,166
You knock him out, he won't be
a top-ranked contender.

1278
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,750
I'll give you another shot
at the title.

1279
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,522
And then we'll both get paid,
huh? Praise Jesus.

1280
01:18:51,197 --> 01:18:55,728
[Sighs]
I can't help you that way.

1281
01:19:01,776 --> 01:19:02,812
All right, brother.

1282
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:05,105
Fine.

1283
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,275
I forgive you.

George foreman, a preacher.

1285
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,949
Now I have seen it all.

1287
01:19:23,994 --> 01:19:25,692
Hi! Ha, ha!

1288
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,171
What are you doing here?
Hey, michi.

1289
01:19:30,306 --> 01:19:33,803
I love you. Mwah, mwah!
Michi, take your brother inside.

1290
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:35,141
Go inside, George.

1291
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:40,949
What are you doing here?

1292
01:19:47,018 --> 01:19:48,022
I came here...

1293
01:19:49,627 --> 01:19:51,991
To tell you how sorry I am

1294
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:53,687
for the way that I treated you.

1295
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:57,999
It wasn't right.

Hi.

1299
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,530
I'm George.

Mary Joan martelly.

1301
01:20:31,968 --> 01:20:33,536
You were sitting
in that same seat

1302
01:20:33,671 --> 01:20:35,630
the day I gave my testimony.

1303
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,339
You always sat up front?

1304
01:20:43,474 --> 01:20:46,344
Yes. Helps me
stay focused on god.

1305
01:20:53,848 --> 01:20:56,083
How's being a preacher
going for you?

1306
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,652
It's hard.

1307
01:20:58,693 --> 01:20:59,994
Real hard.

1308
01:21:00,129 --> 01:21:02,822
Harder than getting punched
in the face?

1309
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,362
[Chuckles]
Uh...

1310
01:21:06,497 --> 01:21:09,367
Sometimes it feels
about the same.

1311
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:13,503
Blessed is the man
who remains steadfast.

1312
01:21:21,349 --> 01:21:24,883
Brothers and sisters,
I am out here today,

1313
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:26,746
not to lift myself up,

1314
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:29,892
but to lift up
the name of Jesus Christ.

1315
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:33,321
See, I was a man
who rejected all religion.

1316
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:35,125
"Jesus" was a cussword to me,

1317
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:37,590
but the lord changed my life.

1318
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:39,391
Wasn't the lord who changed you.

1319
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:40,727
It was Jimmy young.

1320
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,770
I seen him
beat the hell out of you.

1321
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:44,404
Did you at least pinch him?

1322
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,502
[Laughs]

1323
01:21:46,637 --> 01:21:49,605
Don't you miss
being in that ring, big fella?

[Scoffs]

1325
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,817
I'll die...

1326
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:57,085
Before I get back in
that ring again.

1327
01:21:58,422 --> 01:21:59,279
Now...

[♪]

1329
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,961
Now, you could take
all of the rockefellers' money

1330
01:22:08,096 --> 01:22:09,961
and all of the Kennedys' money,

1331
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:11,592
and you put that together,

1332
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:13,133
it wouldn't come
to a down payment

1333
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:14,865
on my getting back
in that ring again.

1334

1335
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,301
Praise god.
Thank you, Jesus.

Jesus is alive today.

1337

I, uh...

1338
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,510
I felt bad
for how I acted last Sunday.

1339
01:22:28,646 --> 01:22:31,317
Well, how did you act?
Kind of cold.

1340
01:22:32,783 --> 01:22:35,656
Heh. Yes.
Well, you had a reputation.

1341
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,521
And not a godly one.

1342
01:22:39,323 --> 01:22:41,491
Well, I'm different now.

1343

learnt the secret

for itself.

of each day as it comes.

01:22:54,776 --> 01:22:55,776
Heh. Yes.

1349

They don't live with me
full-time,

you know, which is hard,

1351
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,052

a whole lot more of them now.

Yeah. Yeah.

going to a movie.

I wanna show you something.

What's that look like to you?

01:23:58,602 --> 01:24:00,538

that's run out of faith.

1361
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:03,978
No.

And be the best I can be.

1365
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:15,289
And I'm gonna spread his word.

1366

Do you believe I can do that?

1367
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:25,398
Yes. I do.

"the beach is waiting, baby!"

you say:

"Huh? Is missing one little
service really gonna hurt me?"

shoes, do they get shined?

Don't wash your clothes,

Would you train my grandson,

to train with Ali
