00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,052
(A Team theme music)

12
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,052
(tracking device beeping)

13
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:18,232
(engine revving)

14
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,232
(police sirens wailing)

15
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,600
(Bosco laughing)

16
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,999
Where's my girl?
Fool

17
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Oh she's cool man
She in there

18
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,400
She's still fine as hell
So that's it?

00:03:58,401 --> 00:03:59,232
Badda Bing
You out of the game

20
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,168
Done with the whole trade?
- Yeah

21
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,300
Well that's the whole problem Bosco.
You either keep doing that.

22
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,469
Or you can do a fifteen year bid
In the Mexican prison

23
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,400
With Chito's cousin and them.
Same old shit

24
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,062
You choose how to flush the toilet brother.
That's right.

25
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:14,221
Easy way or the hard way
(knuckles cracking)

26
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,650
(glass smashing)

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,050
(kung fu noise)

28
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,005
(glass smashing)

29
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:46,369
Watch yourself B.A now.
You gonna lose your order of spin here

30
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:49,202
(knuckles cracking)

31
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:54,800
What's up girl?
You miss me?

32
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,858
'Cause I missed you
I did.

33
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:01,266
It's been too long baby.
Way too long

34
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,063
Heck of a place
Just a heck of a beautiful place

35
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,397
Is this a time share?
I'd love to get in on this

36
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,760
I like this whole Santa Fe motif
You've got going here Rico

37
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,249
Very Arizona, very Tex Mex
It's good

38
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,930
Maybe we can get the guy in my six
To whip up a couple quesadillas you lnow

00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:36,055
Americano, Gringo
Army intelligence

00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,457
Hmmm Who's that?
- You man.

41
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,400
Not so intelligent because you're stuck in some tires man.
- I'm happy. I'm happy.

42
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,116
It doesn't get any better than this right?

43
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,322
I'm living the dream.
(laughter)

44
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:53,962
You're think you're going to come here...
(starts speaking Mexican)

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,734
Well fist of all
She's so hot and uh...

46
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,600
We both hate you
So that's just sort of how...

47
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:01,651
(punch landing)

48
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:05,172
Good Morning!

49
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:08,296
Now it's a party!
Is that your best shot?

50
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,862
Now it's a party!

51
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:41,936
(rap music playing on stereo)

52
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,936
Whoa!

53
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:58,049
Oh, Hell no

54
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:01,159
You jackin' me?
What is this?

55
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,159
Opposite day?

56
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm not a thief
But if i don't reach my friend in time

57
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,172
Then he dies

58
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:09,669
If you aint a thief
I guarantee you aint a killer

59
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,604
(gun cocks)

60
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:14,099
Take your left hand off the wheel
And your right hand off the shifter

61
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,145
Now.
-You aint gonna shoot me in the head Pops

62
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,633
You know that aint happenin'

63
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:22,226
(gun fires)
(Bosco yells in pain)

64
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:24,890
What the hell's wrong with you man?
You shoot a total stranger?

65
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,433
I don't even know you fool
Damn!

66
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:28,370
Oh it will heal
I promise

67
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,200
Here
Wrap it in this.

68
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,881
I know how to make a tourniquet fool

69
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,746
I know it hurts
But I had to make a point with you

70
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:33,430
That aint what's pissin me off

71
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,361
You shooting my van
That's what's pissing me off man

72
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:41,447
What's wrong with you?
(Bosco wincing in pain)

73
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,638
You Army Ranger son?
- Be real careful what you say next Pops

74
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,903
You be ready to empty that burner
If you start shit talkin my battalion

75
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:04,934
Colonel Hanibal Smith. 75th Ranger Regiment.
- 4th Battallion. Fort Bean, Georgia.

76
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:08,143
I know who you are sir
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

77
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:12,639
I mean the words out. Dishonourable discharge
For some bullshit

78
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:16,589
I dont subscribe to coincidence Corporal

79
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,110
I believe that no matter how random
Things might appear

80
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:22,109
There still a plan

81
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:30,453
Out here in the middle of the Mexican desert
When I need it the most

82
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,300
I find a fellow Ranger

83
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,155
Now I need your help
To save another

84
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,881
(pda beeps)
(over pda) Your rescue is on the way

85
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:44,830
Your rescue is coming?
We fed him to the rotweillers

86
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,303
About an hour ago

87
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,800
Do you realize that you actually believe
That you got me

88
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,062
You actually think you're going to kill me

89
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,061
Can you drive?
- Better than anybody you've ever seen sir.

90
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:05,033
In two minutes
I'm going to be having a cold beer

91
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,900
And you will be on fire
Take care my friend

92
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,654
Alpha, Mike...

93
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,919
Foxtrot.

94
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,699
Think about it

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,801
Adios!
Mother Fu...

96
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:28,000
(engine revving)
(gate smashing)

97
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,673
(choking) Hannibal.
(gunfire)

98
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,976
What are you doing?

99
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,834
Get in

100
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:56,296
B.A
Move!

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,738
(Faceman) This is bullshiiiit!

102
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:14,863
(screaming in Mexican)

103
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,953
Please stop, please stop, owwww!
Please stop

104
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,003
(crash)

105
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,286
How's your day going?

106
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,000
This is not gonna taste good

107
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,056
(vomits)

108
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,056
(passionate maoaning)

109
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:43,489
Oh baby, I just threw up
Let me get some gum

110
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,932
Did you see that?
Did you see Tuco's face?

111
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,700
When you came over that was unbelievable!

112
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,506
How many times did I say it?
- I mean your timing was perfect

113
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:52,094
How many times did I say it Face?

114
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:55,690
I told you
To take down Tuco alone

115
00:10:55,691 --> 00:11:01,191
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
Have the Hannibal Smith "How To" manual

116
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:04,107
I had to move
- That move snowballed, Face.

117
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,347
You almost got yourself killed

118
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,950
You almost got me killed

119
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,211
You almost got him killed

120
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,500
Thank you
Peck

121
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,100
Baracus
It's all good

122
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,520
I was trying to save her

123
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,601
Save her?

124
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:22,092
Yeah

125
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:23,214
Save her?

126
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah

127
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:24,350
How?

128
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,973
Please do share with us your plan face

129
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:30,984
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

130
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,725
Exactly
I had to

131
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,845
Pike.
- Boss

132
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:00,835
Still trampling the same dirt?
- I am unfortunately

133
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,218
So what have you got for me?
- I've got a fast bird doin pizza runs

134
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:05,299
Call sign it hatchet
- Hatchet?

135
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,266
This is yours. And your pilot, if you
want to call him that Is somewhere inside

136
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,219
Be careful boss
- I owe you one

137
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,592
Okay, let's not wait to brag though
- (Baracus) Three years

138
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:17,012
How am I going to leave my girl like this?
After all that I had to fight to get her back

139
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:19,123
Leave the keys
And we'll come back for her

140
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,691
Find a treatment room Corporal
Make it quick

141
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,111
I'm going to find our pilot

142
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,576
Oh hey doc
You got a second for a wounded vet?

143
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,613
Hardly that great of a combat pilot
You ask him, he thinks he's the best in the world

144
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,271
He's a functioning lunatic

145
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:02,422
Last week he tried to escape
By jump starting an ambulance

146
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,805
My kind of guy

147
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:11,266
It almost hit your tattoo there
- (nurse) Has anybody seen Mr. Murdock?

148
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,741
The old Ranger tatt

149
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:17,301
Would you think I was crazy
If I told you I had one of these?

150
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:20,800
Stuck on two eyes man
- Mr. Murdock?

151
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,755
Not while I'm operating nurse

152
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,543
Not now
- Why are you off the ward?

153
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,647
Is that gas?
Is that you?

154
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,660
I smell gas
- What do you mean ward?

155
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,251
This man is a patient here
- Don't listen to her, she's crazy

156
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:35,436
Honestly, I am practicing doctor at John Hopkins...
- Is he actuually working on you?

157
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,876
You asked him to do a lightning bolt?
- I didn't ask for no lightning bolt

158
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,779
What's wrong with this fool?

159
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,237
You're on fire man
-What? what's that?

160
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,063
(laughter) You Rangers are awesome
-Are you crazy?!

161
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,087
Hey!...Hey!
Come on!

162
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,623
Back off!

163
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,707
Back off!
This is a hospital

164
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:05,625
Everybody's met Mr Murdock
-Met him? He lit my arm on fire

165
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,501
He stitched a lightning bolt in mine man
-Look at me son

166
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,925
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot

167
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,694
The best sir
-I'm not getting on a chopper with this nut job

168
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:19,023
That's a good... Is he another one of your projects?
-I'm a real soldier

169
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,512
I'm a Ranger baby!
-I'm worried!

170
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,551
I'm a Ranger sir
-That's good enough for me

171
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:30,199
You've been released into our care
and reinstated...Captain

172
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
Thank you sir

173
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,003
Let's get the hell out of here

174
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,370
You gorgeous old rust bucket you
Did you miss your daddy?

175
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:50,515
Face, what's the most important part
of a well oiled plan?

176
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,936
To be one step ahead of the enemy
Not be running away from him

177
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:58,066
Who say's we're running away?
- What. We're going to go in this dinosaur with this freak show?

178
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,112
(Murdock singing) You spin me right
round baby right round...

179
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:04,743
Rotors are good sir
-Who is this guy?

180
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,271
Come on let's go
- Murdock, get this thing in the air

181
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,736
Hold on boys! I'm goin to try something
I saw in a cartoon once

182
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,121
What are you talking about cartoons for?
Get us the hell out of here!

183
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,788
We got a hot chopper to the six!

184
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:23,839
(gunfire)

185
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,048
I'm awesome boys!
I'm awesome!

186
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,420
Oh heads up!

187
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,043
(soft music playing)

188
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:37,600
(loud crash)
-Ahhhhhhhhh!!

189
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,166
(Tuco) I see you gringo
- You pankaked my van!

190
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,718
I'm going to kill you fool
-You, you can't park there that's a handicapped zone

191
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,752
I knew you were crazy! I knew you were crazy!
-This is a mistake

192
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,803
(machine gun)

193
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,681
Fire Fire Fire!!

194
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:58,000
(machine gun)

195
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,077
Low man's cut!

196
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,366
(all yelling)

197
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,286
I've never done this before

198
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:15,413
Did you see that?!
- Did you see how he turned the helicopter?

199
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,681
(rocket's firing)

200
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:23,567
You got to love some good air to air combat hey boys?
- Don't look at me look out there!

201
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:27,307
He's only got heat seekers left!
-Captain, get us out of here!

202
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:30,737
Hold on this could get ugly
Here we go

203
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:33,762
Come on...come on baby
Climb

204
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:37,161
(all yelling)
-Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

205
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:43,450
Fire the missles!
-Whoah! missles

206
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,759
Come on
That's how we deal with heat seekers chaps!

207
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,587
We go cold
(explosion)

208
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,988
(all yelling)

209
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:57,758
Face, get him in here!

210
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,224
Ahhhhh!!!!
-Oh shit!...Oh shit!!

211
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:03,271
Get a hold!!
-Restart...restart...

212
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,534
(helicopter starts)
-Whoo hooo!!!

213
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:12,062
Close the door! I know you're Airborn Rangers
but that was ridiculous!

214
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,520
You're going to be okay

215
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,437
Boss, the idea's to kill Tuco
Not the other way around!

216
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,349
One step ahead of the game
isn't the plan kid

217
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,396
Two to three steps ahead

218
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:29,609
Beating an enemies move before it's even made
That's a plan

219
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,773
Hatchet, Hatchet
Lock on my LC

220
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:36,710
General Tuco, you are currently
engaged in unauthorized

221
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,636
warfare on United States
military personnel

222
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:41,418
No no no no no no
You engaged me!

223
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,609
Repeat! You are engaged
in unauthorized warfare

224
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,941
on United States military personnel

225
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,056
Over United States air space

226
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:55,101
What?
- Alpha, Mike...

227
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:58,596
Foxtrot!!

228
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,145
In other words...
Adios! Mother Fu...!!

229
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,339
(missles firing)
(explosion)

230
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,339
(all cheering)

231
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,249
Well done Captain
-That was awesome!

232
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,232
That wasn't awesome!
-You are a genius!

233
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,459
I'm never flying again that's it
-Oh! I never should have doubted you boss!

234
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,286
There's a plan in everything kid

235
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:25,222
And I love it when
a plan comes together

236

Dung batter cooking
nothing like it

(flame bursting)

240
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,975
Face, you want it
napalmed or nuked?

241
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:01,819
Oh nuke it...
Nuke ittt!

242
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,976
Murdock, burn the hell out of that thing
(flame bursts)

243
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:12,679
Like it was damned
-Burn the whole place down buddy

244
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,711
You want secret sauce?
-No no no no no not antifreeze

245
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:22,378
The secret sauce?
You crazy, everybody knows

246
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,333
No one can do an antifreeze
marinade like you can Murdock

247
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:28,280
But, I got a little bells palsy
the last time i ate that

248
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:31,397
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man

249
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,651
Yes sir, having that conversation right now
I've got it well in hand sir

250
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,865
I don't think you want me to be
in the field partially paralyzed bud

251
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:41,151
Visitors...

252
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:49,045
Yeah...

253
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,275
Wow. I'm a liitle taken back
I'm not going to lie

254
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,755
Lieutenant...
-Oh I'm sorry am I supposed to call you Lieutenant back?

255
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:02,114
No, you're supposed to call me Captain
-Captain...Captain?

256
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:05,752
That's right
-Captain Crust. Look at you

257
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:10,268
Wow! So I guess you said no
to the kids, no to the family

258
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,696
Just no ladder you can't climb huh?
-No honey, I just said no to you

259
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:20,791
Hello my name's Percy
Would you like some pork?

260
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,620
If I broke every bone in your hand
could you still do that?

261
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:29,274
This is crazy, three years. We haven't seen each other
for three years.. this is what we're going to talk about?

262
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:36,242
What would you like to discuss?

263
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,528
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?
-I'm not even going to respond to that

264
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,440
We listened to it like nine times in a row

265
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,340
we were drinking that crappy cabernet
remember that?

266
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,770
We were doing something else...
What were we doing?

267
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:51,048
Do you remember what
it was we were doing?

268
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,991
It was in a bedroom...
You don't remember?

269
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,036
The only thing I remember is leaving

270
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:04,567
Which is...my fondest memory of you

271
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:07,948
You guys are the best
Stay out of trouble

272
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:10,976
You hear me?
-Take care

273
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,170
Keep that on
(slapping helmet)

274
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,000
(helicopter overhead)

275
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,912
Colonel, my name is Lynch
I'm with Central Intelligence

276
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,756
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm

277
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,709
Yeah, I come from a long line of Lynches

278
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,900
You ever stop to consider maybe the reason
nobody trusts the CIA

279
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:39,503
is because nobody knows your real names?

280
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,962
What can i do for you Mr Lynch?

281
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,410
I need you to help me stop
Saddam's former flunkies

282
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:47,221
from stealing over a billion dollars
in the next thirty hours

283
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:51,014
Now the only Mint outside of the US
capable of printing our money

284
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:54,502
belonged to the Sjah of Iran
During the Iran/Iraq war, it went missing

285
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,365
Rumor was Saddam had stolen it

286
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:58,351
And we stole it back during Desert Storm

287
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,916
Well we didn't get the engravement plates

288
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,827
That didn't matter. They would have had to
rebuild the mint just to print those bills

289
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:10,102
Well sir, that's happening as we speak

290
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:16,008
Thadine thugs have seized what's left

291
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,984
of the Iraqi national mint
to run off billions of dollars

292
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,680
in unbacked American currency

293
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,924
How are they planning on moving the plates
and a billion dollars out of Baghdad?

294
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:28,087
Armored convoy, manned
with former... Iraqi spec ops

295
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah
-High speed shoot to kill types

296
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,862
So how do you plan on stopping them?

297
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:42,236
Listen...there's some rumors
about some top secret plates

298
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,696
being smuggled out of the city
by Saddam loyalists

299
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,462
Do you know anything about this?

300
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:51,108
Seriously, if you're going to make a play for these plates
I'm waving you off right now

301
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,783
because it's my responsibility
And it's my ass

302
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:58,902
I'm serious...Face?
I'm court marshalling you

303
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,925
Oooh...okay

304
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,957
Hey!
get the memo

305
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,002
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith

306
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:09,360
and stay the hell out of Baghdad

307
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:12,630
You know, you never came back
I thought you were going to come back

308
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:15,015
Well, this is me...
coming back

309
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:22,895
(strums guitar)
(both sing El Diablo)

310
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,650
You think those clowns could really pull this off?

311
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:27,120
Listen, listen I would never tell him this

312
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,013
but they are the best damn
section unit in the four branches

313
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:32,429
And they specialize in the ridiculous
(singing) Diablo!

314
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm getting the rest of them. Do not
let them out of your sight!

315
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:43,310
Doesn't Diablo mean devil?
-Yeah man!

316
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,258
God damn it Hannibal
what do you want me to do?

317
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,751
If this were my operation and you
wanted it, you'd  have the mission

318
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:53,183
You let Black Forest deploy on this
and it's an international incident

319
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:57,586
I promise you. They're not soldiers...
They're frat boys with trigger fingers

320
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,743
Who's running the ground team?
- Brad Pike.

321
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:08,140
Pike? He's a thug...
he's a cartoon character

322
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:11,560
Hannibal we have been ordered
Ordered! mind you

323
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:15,222
To stay out of Baghdad
Cut, dried, the end

324
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:19,308
General, we should find him a little
wiggle room. Don't you think?

325
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,592
You know, I knew another Lynch
CIA stooge

326
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:26,256
Stationed in Laos
'68

327
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:27,660
No relation

328
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:32,078
Are you sure?
Because you remind me of him

329
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,777
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours

330
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:37,919
Back here in 48
assuming we're green and go

331
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,792
Notify me otherwise

332
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:42,458
He's wearing body armour in th HQ

333
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:47,809
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA

334
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:55,800
(helicopter overhead)
(indistinct address over pa)

335
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,134
I want you to know this is
not about you losing a step Hal

336
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:04,937
Hey, hey! I'm ten times the man
I was when you met me

337
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,276
And twice as fast
-Uh huh

338
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:12,089
Russ, the boys and I can
get this done minus the bloodshed

339
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,166
those plates can do all kinds of damage

340
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,319
Don't make me beg
-I'd hate to se you beg Hal

341
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:23,620
You've been my friend
for a long time

342
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,025
More importantly
you and those boys have

343
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,181
possibly been the most
valuable military asset

344
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,731
I have ever had
at my disposal

345
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,860
Now...you asked me
not to make you beg

346
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,000
Right now I'm begging you

347
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:41,000
Hannibal...please...

348
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,000
Let this one go

349
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:50,747
Listen BA, we're extending
our stay a little bit

350
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:51,640
We're going back into Baghdad

351
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,975
I thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad?

352
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:56,557
That's true but I'm...
- Smith

353
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,204
Pike

354
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:01,761
I understand you and your grunts are now
stealing my gigs. I don't like that

355
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:06,084
I figured you Black Forest guys would
be busy installing a dictatorship or

356
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:08,915
overthrowing a democracy somewhere
(pike laughing)

357
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:13,659
It's still the weekend yet
That's nine to five stuff...Pops

358
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:17,243
Look at you clowns
you're not soldiers

359
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,013
You're assassins in polo shirts
(BA laughing)

360
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:25,092
We make in a week
what you guys make in a year

361
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:27,000
Cash don't buy guts kid

362
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,117
or brains

363
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,635
And you're short on both

364
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,483
This is Morrison's base
Bug out of my op

365
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:42,275
(indistinct chatter)
-I'm telling you, there's a reason she came back

366
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,155
Face, I told you
forget about her

367
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,487
The level of ambition on this woman...
-I aint stepping foot in any type of aircraft Hannibal

368
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:50,699
No gliders...paper planes
ultralights

369
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,819
Are you ever going to let me live that down?
-No

370
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,401
Mexico was a looong time ago
and I saved your life

371
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,428
How about thanking me for not
whooping your ass at that hospital

372
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,970
I was an Airborn Ranger
Untill I met you

373
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:01,862
And you chickened out just like (imitates chicken)
- 263 jumps

374
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:05,001
Just a thank you would have been nice
-And one helicopter ride with you screws it up

375
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:09,068
Airborn Ranger with a fear of flying...like a punk
- B.A., for the last time

376
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,113
Nobody leaves the truck
once we take it over

377
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,566
Okay?

378
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,606
Staging, movement, action plan

379
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,666
and here's a nice read for you

380
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:25,382
Aw hell yeah Hannibal
this is it right here

381
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,335
This is bat shit insane

382
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:32,416
It's perfect
-I don't man...this is beyond nuts boss

383
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,000
It gets better

384
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,272
(Hannibal narrating)

385
00:27:39,273 --> 00:27:42,854
BA, you'll need a piece of countoured
metal to make a skid plate

386
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:46,090
Let's go fool
- Murdock, we'll need a car battery too

387
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:49,422
See if the boys at Black Forest
can help us out

388
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,584
Press credentials...
we need them

389
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,093
Hit the media tent
see what's lying around

390
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:58,168
Oy, my friend. I see you've put the
South African microphone at the bottom

391
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,187
You can't always put the CNN on top

392
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:03,444
There's two mike stands
you gotta make sure there's someone...

393
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:09,740
Murdock, we need a news camera

394
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:12,046
See what you can do

395
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:16,375
Hi sorry, uh...sorry

396
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:20,284

(laughing)

399
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,008
We're going to need airbags
Lots of them

400
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,419
(speaking arabic)
- Le Monde.

401
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,166
Oh, you're French...

402
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:36,148
(whispering in French)

403
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,591
(over radio) Hello this is General Parker I need
- It's for you

404
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:44,059
You can call an air strike on yourself

405
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:47,625
We're good mate...meet you back there
-No,okay I think we need to get back to the...

406
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,041
I think you need to understand
what I'm telling you right now

407
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,529
BA we're going to need a magnet

408
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,055
Yeahhh!!

409
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:58,838
A powerful one

410
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,738
Have you ever seen Blue Man group?

411
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:05,185
I'll pick up the rest

412
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,848
(grinding)

413
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,848
(various pick up lines in French)

414
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,382
I'm just going to go for it

415
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,327
Ooh La La

416
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,764
(as William Wallace) What would
you give for one chance

417
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:26,241
to come back here
and tell our enemies

418
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:30,120
that they may take our lives
but they'll never take...

419
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:40,277
our Freeeeedommmm!!!
(all laughing)

420
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,212
Ready to go downtown?
Good luck

421
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,647
Give 'em hell

422
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,263
General Morrison...
where is Hannibal Smith?

423
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:57,549
They go mobile in three hours

424
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,888
The plates and over a billion dollars
will be loaded in the

425
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,541
back of a semi
at the mint

426
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,557
They're over land for exactly 4.6 miles
before they reach the bridge

427
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
(radio chatter)

428
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:16,627
That's our window
and it closes fast

429
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:22,437
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble

430
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:26,935
(machine gun fire)

431
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:31,260
Face, your point of entry
is under the hotel

432
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,740
It will be packed with foreign press
and private security

433
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,912
BA, you're in this alleyway
with a stopwatch

434
00:30:56,012 --> 00:31:00,455
make sure the bike is V twins or better
-I got something a whole lot better

435
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:04,264
What about me boss man?

436
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:08,667
I had a little helicopter here someplace
(BA crushing toy helicopter)

437
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:11,946
You got some battle rolls...
some mid air stalls?

438
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:16,123
I'm looking for my next
near death experience

439
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,636
Only on support this time Captain
but I'll get you in on th next one...I promise

440
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:25,529
BA, I need you to pop
that clutch at 06:30

441
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:31,944
Is that me? Oh no I forgot
I'm in an Iraqi sewer. Thanks boss!

442
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:40,161
Timing...is everything Face

443
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:43,882
This is all about the bullseyes

444
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,728
(magnet fastens)

445
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,184
Why not?

446
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,971
Under the semi, you will take
out the truck directly behind you

447
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:59,935
(tire spikes grinding)

448
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:04,090
(men yelling)

449
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:08,935
(explosion)

450
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:13,621
Now these guys are going to be on to you Face
BA that's your cue for throttle

451
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:16,000
be sure to look both
ways before crossing

452
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,400
and have a nice full tank of gas

453
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,208
(explosion)

454
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:32,346
There will be multiple
hostiles on board BA

455
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,282
Escort them from the premises

456
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:58,131
If any stragglers sneak up behind
don't worry, I got your back

457
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:11,651
Got ya kid!

458
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:17,066
That's all fine in theory but I still don't
see how we get out of Baghdad

459
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,375
I do

460
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,569
BA! hang a right
-All right, hang on!

461
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,772
Watch out, watch out
-Heads down

462
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,891
Nice one BA!
(BA laughing)

463
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,530
Face, get the airbags!

464
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:42,363
Got to make sure this thing
stays locked for later

465
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:43,400
Beautiful

466
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:46,608
One...two...three

467
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:54,326
Hey boss! the airbags
do deploy on impact right?

468
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,525
BA get in the container!

469
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:02,303
Contact rear!
(gunfire)

470
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,500
(tire explodes)

471
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:21,390
Okay this is the part of
the plan I don't trust

472
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,848
Don't worry Face
the ropes will hold

473
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:26,979
I was worried I's be nailing
myself to the container right now

474
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,994
Hang on boys!

475
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,976
(Face screaming)

476
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,976
(large splash)

477
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,976
(minigun firing)

478
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:50,990
Come on I smoked you!
Did you boys see that down there?

479
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:54,836
Colonel! what is that fooll doing here?
Don't lock me in here

480
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:59,219
Hey boss you ever play that game at the fun fair
where you try to pick up a stuffed animal with the claw?

481
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,683
This is a lot like that
-Taking!

482
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:08,745
Did you lock this?!
You locked me in here!

483
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:14,210
Would you...are you listening?!
- I got you

484
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,709
I'm going to kill you fool!
- Boss... is that Bosco?

485
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:23,835
Get me out of here!!!
-Oh that's not good...he is not happy

486
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,668
Boss... we are in the net
-Copy that

487
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:52,709
I will be there in five I've got a
big bottle of blue label waiting

488
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,837
A bottle? ...Make it a case
See you in a few

489
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,753
Who's going to let him out?
(both) you!

490
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:04,233
What you don't realize is...
now I got to kill all y'all

491
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,714
I'll Kill All Y'all!!!
(pounding on container)

492
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:10,621
Boss, maybe...
Let me try something

493
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:11,460
Go for it

494
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,271
Is it weird that I'm more scared now
than what we just did?

495
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,992
Bosco...It's Murdock
-Murdock open this door!! (pounding)

496
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,296
I'll make you some of that coconut
curry tapenade that you love

497
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,763
Ooh that might work

498
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:27,164
With toast points?
-Well hell yeah with toast points

499
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,999
You thought we were going to
have that with plain old chips?

500
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:33,426
You tricked me!
-There he is...

501
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,810
Come on!
-Get away from me man!

502
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:40,052
My arteries just about ... You should know
better! you know I hate flying

503
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:44,097
I'm sweating! I stink!
And I can't spend none of that money

504
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,780
Money can't buy happiness
-Damn man!

505
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:49,404
Hey Murdock, you cook it tonight!
You better get your apron on

506
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,537
I love it when a plan comes together

507
00:36:54,538 --> 00:37:00,628
(explosion)

508
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:04,152
Hannibal, who was that?!
- Was that the General?!

509
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:08,156
General!
Ross?!

510
00:37:09,534 --> 00:37:12,340
My God

511
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,260
Pike

512
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,464
Contact rear!
(gunfire)

513
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,999
(container explodes)

514
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,741
After conferring, we've decided to demote
you to the rank of first lieutenant

515
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:18,858
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing personal
but you lost those plates

516
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:22,545
those were your responsibility
-Consider yourself lucky, others are going to

517
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:27,553
prison over this. - Good day Director MacReady
-Lieutenant, you're dismissed

518
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:32,990
Colonel Smith, this court has been unable to
recover any direct order from General Morrison

519
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:37,252
for you to conduct the mission
for which you're being tried

520
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:43,196
Your honour this was a covert operation
and no official orders were given

521
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:49,203
So the one individual who could verify the legitimacy
of this operation is deceased. Is that correct Colonel?

522
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:51,189
No your honour
not deceased

523
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:56,210
General Morrison was murdered
-Colonel, I've been on a long time

524
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,311
seen units like yours
they're outlaws

525
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:04,942
units like that pose a direct threat
to the fabric and fundamentals of our military

526
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,836
Your honour, why hasn't
Black Forest been brought to trial?

527
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:15,155
Black Forrest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction

528
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,824
Where's the plan boss?
Where's the escape package?

529
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:22,555
This mission isn't over Lieutenant

530
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,239
I'll clear your names
We find Pike and the plates

531
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:29,889
No matter what

532
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,256
Your honours, these men were
acting under my command

533
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:35,766
Any judgement should be levied
against me and me alone

534
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:39,998
Absolutely not sir, we were all
participating in this operation willingly

535
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:42,746
I don't want to be tried separately
I refuse to be tried separately sir

536
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:45,296
In accordance with the uniform
code of military justice

537
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:48,815
this court is rendering guilty verdicts
for each member of this Alpha unit

538
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:49,792
or 'A-Team'

539
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:54,379
and mandating incarceration in
separate maximum security facilities

540
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:59,575
for a period of up to ten years
You are all hereby stripped of formal rank

541
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:02,412
and dishonourably discharged

542
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:09,006
This is bullshit man
-This session is adjourned

543
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:19,864
At Black Forest what...?
- You disgraced me

544
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:23,610
Absolute disgrace!
-Are you happy?

545
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:28,760
Colonel, control your men!
-Get your hands off me!

546
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:52,311
Well hello Mr Lynch
Long time

547
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,008
You look very relaxed Lynch
A lot of cameras in here

548
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:02,712
Yeah there are. Yeah well they seem to be
having some technical issues at the moment

549
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:07,478
I may not show up until playback
Hannibal, can I call you Hannibal?

550
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,439
can't call you Colonel any more

551
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:14,754
Six months
been waiting for you

552
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:19,815
Bust out of here and round up the rest of the
backstreet boys and lead me to those plates

553
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,813
Six months and not a peep

554
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:26,828
Everybody thought you and your
team were working with Pike

555
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:32,420
Everybody except you
Pike murdered Morrrison

556
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:36,089
Set me and my boys up
and stole those plates

557
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:43,156
And I know where he is

558
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,779
Nobody knows where he is

559
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:55,248
There's a single image of him taken
about a month ago somewhere in Europe

560
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,293
We think it's a grab from the CCTV camera

561
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:03,234
Frankfurt, Germany

562
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:08,551
(snickering) How did you get that in here?
-Time, Lynch

563
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,867
Give me a minute, I'm good
If I've got an hour, I'm great

564
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:15,725
You give me six months
I'm unbeatable

565
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:18,605
I know Pike, who's the Arab?

566
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:20,360
We don't know

567
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,482
We think he's the 'deep dark'.
Hidden hand in this whole thing

568
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:26,457
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer

569
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:31,390
Lynch, we have common enemies
and you have limited choices

570
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,829
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back

571
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,049
I wouldn't be so sure?
-Then why did you make the long drive out here?

572
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,822
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press

573
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,716
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes

574
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:46,436
So what would you need from me?

575
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:49,427
I swore to my team that
I would clear our names

576
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:52,039
You of all people must
understand the value of a name

577
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:04,110
Listen, I want full reinstatement and
clean records for myself, and my team

578
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:08,601
I can't get you out here
Not legally at least

579
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:13,225
This is something the boys
in Langley do very very well

580
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:17,000
'5cc's Tetrodotoxin infused cuban cigar'
Make sure the dosage is right

581
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:20,185
And when I say right
I mean perfect

582
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:30,875
Cuban...
what a shame

583
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:44,649
John H. Smith
COD heart attack after seizure

584
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:25,293
You are not... permitted...
in ...my...Dojo!!!

585
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,970
So, Satan walks into this bar

586
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,387
Wait a minute what's this?
A lap pool? a dry steam room?

587
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:39,911
Yeah it will go a long way with the boys

588
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,766
How in the hell do you pull this off?

589
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:47,606
It's not who you know Bob, it's how you know them
Oh, did your boy get back from Afghanistan?

590
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah thanks for getting him home
His mother and I are real grateful

591
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,381
Captain...
-Hey

592
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:56,974
(whispering) You left
something on the bed

593
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:01,974
You could have hid those
-Why would I want to do that?

594
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:04,161
(whispering) drive me crazy
I'lll see you at eight

595
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:08,253
Hey LT thanks for the boots
- Ahh come on, it's my pleasure baby

596
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,429
Smith has escaped Lieutenant

597
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:18,533
Let me go after him

598
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:21,527
Smith and his team are working with
Brock Pike and Black Forest

599
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:24,067
I can get those plates back for you sir

600
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:27,027
You know I can

601
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:29,402
Holler what?
Holler who?

602
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:30,890
(door closes)

603
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:39,273
Hey, hey
Let me out!

604
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,600
Hey, hey heyyyyy!!!

605
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:57,497
You are...really tanned

606
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:02,130
Seal that up
nobody goes in there

607
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:06,414
Log in pages from day
in question have been removed

608
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:08,710
Why does that not surprise me?
-Torn out

609
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:12,440
The cigar was in the spine of that book

610
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:14,710
Wow, subtle
-Now, get this

611
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:18,004
Now, this is surveillance
from all around the prisoner right?

612
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:21,389
Now what you're wathching is a signal jammer
this is high tech stuff

613
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,193
It sends a jamming signal in front of every
camera every time we might get a glimpse of him

614
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:27,689
We see nothing.
Nobody lnows who he is

615
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,330
Which begs a bigger question
Did the CIA visit Smith in prison?

616
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,539
it sounds kind of crazy but
I think the CIA broke him out

617
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,449
Who put us on?
-The same guy who put us on in Baghdad

618
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:40,798
Lynch, CIA.

619
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:43,805
What are we talking about?
Clean records? reinstatements?

620
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:48,409
All of the above
-What about Pike? and the plates

621
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,596
Payback

622
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:56,606
I take it you didn't get religion inside
-No, I got revenge

623
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:59,349
Good

624
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:03,282
I know a couple guys that
will feel the exact same way

625
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,983
I'm counting on it

626
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,527
EMERGENCY

627
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,527
XITNOW

628
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:34,725
Emergency exit now...
Hannibal.

629
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:49,125
Baracus!
Don't do it!

630
00:47:49,295 --> 00:47:52,028
Where's he going?

631
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:55,452
Baracus, god damn it!
(gunfire)

632
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:04,265
Sosa.
- Baracus and Peck are already gone

633
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:08,336
Murdock is the only one left
and he's in Germany

634
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,679
(clippers buzzing)

635
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,730
How did you know that once that door
was extracted that it would take his weight

636
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:25,323
I just did, he's you know he's what 225...230lbs?
-230 yeah

637
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:27,361
Do you remember the gag we did in

638
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,857
Venezuela seven years ago?
-Venezuela yeah, yeah yes

639
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,404
But that was a midget

640
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,245
There he is
-He's back

641
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,639
It's good to be back man
-My man

642
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:41,609
It's good to see you brother
-You too bro, you too

643
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:44,131
Thanks man
-You're welcome

644
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,010
Good to see you guys

645
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,217
What?
-Where's the mohawk?

646
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,711
What? you don't like my new doo man?

647
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,905
Do I like it?
We got you the clippers, I thought...

648
00:48:57,906 --> 00:49:00,371
Yeah I used them

649
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:04,772
Hey, what's up big guy?

650
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:08,669
Come on, you can speak to us

651
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,336
You guy's umm

652
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:15,067
I can't kill anybody

653
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:19,908
What do you mean?
-I've taken a vow

654
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:25,795
Vow?
- I'll still do things with you guys. You know that

655
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:31,322
But I just can't kill man
Old habits may die hard but

656
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:34,622
they still gotta die

657
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:38,648
When I was a kid
all you'd hear in the 'hood was

658
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:43,141
Bosco's a bad ass
out collecting scalps

659
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,726
That's where the mohawk came from

660
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:51,288
I was always at war
-That's what warriors are for

661
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,903
I don't know man
I don't miss that life

662
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:56,680
I'll help you get Murdock
right there aint a problem

663
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:01,254
I can't kill
-even Pike?

664
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:06,920
Even if killing him would clear your name?
-My conscience is the only thing I need

665
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,893
Now, where is that crazy ass fool?

666
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,804
Hey Murdock, you got a package
from Annabelle Smith

667
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,195
Wow it's so real

668
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:40,973
I now knight you.. Sir you have to put your
head down.Stand up and do it again

669
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,880
When you kneel put your
head down straight away

670
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,000
Looking me in the eye is
disrespectful you understand?

671
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:47,260
movie, movie,

672
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,600
You're looking me in the
eye now, that's wrong

673
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:56,558
(all chanting) movie, movie, movie
-Movie, movie, movie

674
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,558
moviieeeeee
shit

675
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,466
Excuse me, can I help you with something?
-Yes, Captain Murdock. Where is he?

676
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:08,270
Right through there
-Thank you

677
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,172
El Diablo...

678
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,583
Okay, (hushing), settle down
No talking during the movie

679
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:19,583
(silencing)

680
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,667
Captain Murdock
You remember me? from Baghdad

681
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:33,855
(incoherent babbling)

682
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:41,351
Okay this is pointless, this guy is fried
-Yeah, there's a reason why he's here

683
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:44,700
And his entire team has
escaped except for him

684
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,367
(original theme from the A-Team)
-Movie!

685
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:50,930
take a look around anyway
just to make sure he's alone

686
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,832
The Greater Escape

687
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:12,623
(crashing)

688
00:52:15,914 --> 00:52:18,623
(all cheering)

689
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:22,087
Oh Captain! your chariot awaits
-Sorry boys, gotta run

690
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:24,264
can't finish the movie
do let me know how it ends

691
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:27,231
Krista where are you hiding?
Stay beautiful baby

692
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:34,126
Get the truck!
(gunfire)

693
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:37,559
These guys are shooting at us!
-I can see these bullets in 3D!

694
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:40,129
Get in here!
-It's like we're actually being shot at!

695
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:42,687
You are getting shot at
you crazy ass fool

696
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,689
Stop right there!
-Ram it!

697
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,873
Hey! I said halt!
(crashing)

698
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,235
Yaa whoo hoo hoo!
(all cheering)

699
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:52,132
Damn! sorry dude

700
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:55,511
It looks like they're heading for the tarmac
-Lets go, let's go, let's go

701
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:03,367
Gentlemen
-Holy shit!

702
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,472
Are any of you armed and/or
wanted federal fugitives?

703
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:11,359
No
-Well we're both, which means

704
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,390
Dit is een slecht idee.

705
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:18,123
You're taking the plane?
-And that's why I joined the army

706
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:23,250
Man up and get in there!
-Best and brightest, appreciate it boys that will be all

707
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:25,526
Anyone got the keys? I just need the keys
-What! What? what you talking about keys?

708
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,160
I do need keys
-For what?, this is a bad idea

709
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:30,243
We just broke this
guy out of the psyc ward

710
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:33,854
Hannibal, you let the real pilots go?
-BA relax, you're going to be fine

711
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:36,543
Here take one of these
-Will they knock me out?

712
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:37,943
They better knock me out

713
00:53:37,944 --> 00:53:40,854
Cause if they don't I'm gonna knock you out
-Bosco, the buttons are confusing me I don't...

714
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:43,996
Shut up Murdock!
-Come on Murdock, let's go

715
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:47,389
I'm turning myself in
-Come on, come on Murdock

716
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,188
I got lucky

717
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,905
Hang on boys

718
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:58,921
Stop.

719
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:05,107
Face, your girlfriends back
-Reverse now

720
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,412
Move your ass!

721
00:54:08,471 --> 00:54:11,630
The C130 vs. the Mercedes Benz
-Takeoff Murdock

722
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:15,728
Faster!
-I've got it pinned!

723
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:24,443
(Murdock singing El Diablo)

724
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:29,443
Holy!
(all screaming)

725
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,443
Whoo hoo...whooooo

726
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:40,722
Get us to flight control

727
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:45,957
Ladies and Gentlemen we are expecting
slight turbulence, please remain in your seats

728
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:48,481
untill the captain has turned
off the fasten seatbelt sign

729
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:53,320
Don't worry boys! Turbulence
has never brought down a plane!

730
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:59,312
What the hell is that?
That...

731
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:01,699
We've got sub swirling UAV's
and missle lock!

732
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,737
And they bring down planes
all the time

733
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:10,075
Okay they're coming in
launching counter measures!

734
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,208
(flares bursting)

735
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:23,610
Did you see that?
That's my dialed vision

736
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:32,666
Hang on, Hold on!
We`re going over!

737
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:35,846
Murdock, what the hell are you doing?

738
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:41,394
Whooo hoo hoo!
You boys remember Mexico?!

739
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:45,100
Ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck
if you look out of the right hand side of

740
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:50,935
the aircraft you'll notice that
the right wing is on fire

741
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:53,773
Tango, re-aquired
Missle lock pending sir

742
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:56,904
This is a DCIS Major
do not shoot that aircraft down

743
00:55:56,905 --> 00:56:00,281
Scramble fighters and force them to land
There are federal fugitives on that plane

744
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:01,952
They've also stolen property
from the US Army

745
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,297
Billy, Billy I need to get the O scan
view off my monitor right now

746
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,030
Missle away sir

747
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:17,488
We have shoot down
Hercules has been intercepted and destroyed

748
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:19,689
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

749
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:32,889
I don't believe it
-Sir we have chute deployment on the beauford

750
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,283
What?

751
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:39,876
I want these drones taken off line right now!
Whoever's running these drones...!

752
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:43,178
Get me the direct line! whoever...
-We gotta get these drone down, I'm gonna be on bitch duty

753
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,744
We need to get those men alive!

754
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:54,400
Everybody okay?
-What are the chances they think we're dead?

755
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:57,406
(gunfire)

756
00:56:57,407 --> 00:56:59,733
Not great!
tell me we aint still on that plane

757
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:01,654
We ain't on that plane

758
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:04,691
Hannibal if we're under 20,000 feet
we can still breathe right

759
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:09,426
What you talking about 20,000 feet!?
-Let's fire up the old weapon system

760
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:12,209
Hey Bosco! it's a little stuffy
I'm going to pop a window!

761
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:16,263
(gunfire)

762
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:21,641
Yeah! what you got bitches!!
What you got!!

763
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:25,855
(machine gun firing)
Yeah!! (laughing)

764
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Let me at them too Face, come on!
-Why are we in a falling can?!!

765
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,729
Because the plane exploded!!

766
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,721
What? What?!! When?
-Recently, the Reaper shot it down

767
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:36,581
What Reaper?!

768
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:38,671
(gunfire)

769
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:42,492
The flying ones that are still trying to kill us!
-I blame you Hannibal!

770
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,142
Technically, we're not flying
- I know, we falling fool!

771
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:49,411
(gunfire)

772
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,356
(explosion)

773
00:57:52,857 --> 00:57:54,906
(Face screaming)
Oh Jesus!

774
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:57,756
UAV2 has splashed down
we just lost one of the drones

775
00:57:57,757 --> 00:58:00,376
Hannibal, we're in trouble!!

776
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:05,858
Awesome!

777
00:58:06,404 --> 00:58:10,749
Face, get onto the main gun
There's a lake a half mile away from this position

778
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:15,060
What the hell am I trying to hit?!!
- Trust me!  rotate the turret at 82 degrees!

779
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,400
Fire in the hole!

780
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:20,578
Yeah!
Boom!

781
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:23,250
Fire!

782
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:31,119
Is he trying to shoot down that other drone?
- No, they're trying to fly that tank

783
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:33,804
(laughing maniacally)  He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank fool!

784
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:37,224
Rotate 16 degrees
Fire!

785
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:44,607
Rotate 34 degrees Now!
- Hannibal!!

786
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,302
Wait...
Fire!!

787
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:52,448
Control, we have lost UAV
- Is that a confirmed hit?

788
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,438
Right turn full front
and wait!!

789
00:58:57,415 --> 00:59:00,637
Murdock, close the hatch!
- Hatch! Okay!

790
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,786
Come on baby

791
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:09,720
I'm too young to die!!
- Boss! I'm aiming at nothing

792
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:13,295
Come on
- It's been an honour gentlemen

793
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:16,853
Come on baby
- The greatest ride is the last ride Colonel

794
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:19,602
Fire everything!!
- Come on baby!!

795
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:23,602
(tank firing)

796
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,090
How's my driving?
for questions or concerns call 555-7264

797
00:59:25,091 --> 00:59:29,090
(all screaming)
-Come on!!

798
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,634
(polka music)
(water spalshing)

799
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,575
(dynamite explodes)

800
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:50,575
(tank fires above)
(water splashing)

801
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:57,575
(tank firing)

802
00:59:57,576 --> 01:00:00,000
(tank splashing)

803
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:03,575
(laughing)

804
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:11,222
All right
busy bees, busy bees

805
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:13,337
Guys you can take your coats off

806
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:16,409
It's hot as hell in here
Sweating like a whore in church

807
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,806
Sir?
- Yeah

808
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:20,860
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C130 over Mannheim, Germany

809
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:22,663
by two Reaper drones

810
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:25,100
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch

811
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:28,085
but it says that they
were shot down in a tank

812
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:31,597
NORAD's calling it an exhale
but there's an afflicting report

813
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:35,044
I'm sure there is

814
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:37,430
We got a German housebrau
who says she saw a tank

815
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:40,369
driving up and out of lake Volgelstein
with a guy resembeling Murdock

816
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,912
Excuse me! which way to Berlin?
- Asking for directions to Berlin

817
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:48,557
That's impossible
- Well this will be the second time

818
01:00:48,657 --> 01:00:52,343
Smith has died this week
Is that possible?

819
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,266
What have you got for me?

820
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:04,330
We just got the unscrambled
composite of Smith's visitor in prison

821
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,936
But with no ID
on the subject yet

822
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:09,442
Hello handsome

823
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:12,217
Wait, I've seen this person before

824
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,813
I know this guy

825
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:19,148
Baghdad

826
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:22,669
Get me a clean patch to Langley
we're going fishing

827
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:26,499
I heard bits and pieces but...
- Sir?

828
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:28,124
I have...
-I was talking

829
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:31,848
Can you stop?
I have a D.O.D hardline from Lieutenant Sosa

830
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,901
She's looking for agent Lynch

831
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,737
Yeah, he's not available...ever

832
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,436
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

833
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:42,001
General Morrison's tent?

834
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:45,724
Out

835
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:48,317
Why do we have her?

836
01:01:48,457 --> 01:01:51,814
She's got a fantastic
personality, that's why

837
01:01:52,236 --> 01:01:53,871
With whom am I speaking?

838
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:57,999
This is Capt... uh Lieutenant Sosa
Is this agent Lynch?

839
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,668
Sorry, I don't have a first name
- Neither do I

840
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:03,303
So what can I do you for Lieutenant?

841
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:07,674
I'm looking at an image of you from
the diciplinary barracks of Fort Carson

842
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:09,833
She's hot

843
01:02:09,856 --> 01:02:13,466
Did you visit former Colonel
Hannibal Smith in prison?

844
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:19,972
I don't know what you're
talking about former Captain

845
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:23,000
Agent Lynch, if you facilitated
Smith's escape and are

846
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,277
currently aiding and abetting him

847
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:28,983
oooh buddy...

848
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:30,178
If you could make
something like that stick

849
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,685
your next promotion
should be in the five star range

850
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:36,216
And if you're helping
to retrieve those engraving plates

851
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:41,685
I'm going to have to go out
of my way to dissapoint you

852
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:53,573
I want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates

853
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:57,055
I want to know everything. I want
active intercept ops on everything she's got

854
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,950
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward

855
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:04,111
You realize she's D.O.D?
- I don't care if she's G.O.D, do it

856
01:03:05,012 --> 01:03:07,833
Boss, check this out

857
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:11,679
We've tracked this photograph of Pike
to the Konigsbank in Frankfurt.

858
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,700
Our surveillance has him and
an unknown Arab making regular

859
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,107
trips from the train
station to the bank

860
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:19,694
all over the last month
- Pikes getting sloppy

861
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah but if we're on to him what are
the odds that Smith and his team

862
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:22,641
are on to Pike and the Arab too?

863
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:25,413
This is a direct pulldown
from the Pentagon's database

864
01:03:25,414 --> 01:03:28,260
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff

865
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:32,535
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times

866
01:03:32,772 --> 01:03:35,000
Pike has been moving the stolen
engraving plates to the

867
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:37,724
Konigsbank tower in Frankfurt
over the past month

868
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:40,800
Tomorrow the last of the cases
containing these plates will be

869
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,689
transferred to the Arab

870
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,000
This will mark the only time
in the last six months

871
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:47,363
that all the plates have
been in one location

872
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:50,314
It's our best and only shot
at getting them back

873
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:54,042
They leave the Konigsbank tower
for the 7:15 train to Zurich

874
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:58,872
Gentlemen, we're going to make
sure they miss that train

875
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:00,810
Face
- Yeah

876
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:03,033
Time to bring in
your former flame

877
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:05,742
If she's as good as I think then
she'll be on her way to Frankfurt

878
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:09,509
to intercept those plates

879
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,310
Why would you tip her off?

880
01:04:11,372 --> 01:04:14,616
She's a crusader and we're going
to need her at some point

881
01:04:14,716 --> 01:04:16,786
Keep your eyes and ears open boys
(Sosa's named called over pa)

882
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:24,033
Now the wrinkle
If Sosa's on to us

883
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,609
we can assume
that Lynch is on to her

884
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:30,530
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates

885
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,490
he won't hesitate to kill her
Face, get to the train station

886
01:04:37,822 --> 01:04:40,435
This is Sosa
(static)

887
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:43,076
If there's a threat from Lynch
deal with it

888
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:44,770
Hello?

889
01:04:44,771 --> 01:04:47,770
Shooter's green, say again...
shooter's green

890
01:04:48,695 --> 01:04:52,653
Hello?

891
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:56,063
(disconnect signal)

892
01:04:56,064 --> 01:04:58,597
Something's wrong

893
01:05:00,618 --> 01:05:03,628
We're marked guys, pull back
I don't like this at all

894
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:07,220
See, don't be seen
(phone rings)

895
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:11,782
Hello beautiful...   -You've got some
balls you put a drop phone on me?

896
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:15,382
I had to baby, it's the only way I could
talk to you. Lynch has all your comm lines

897
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,680
I want you to pull your team now
- I'm going to find you face

898
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,533
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly

899
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,828
Not if I find you first

900
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:36,826
Oww!!! Jesus

901
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:41,344
What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to save you

902
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:48,784
Clarissa, come on
you know we're innocent

903
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:51,188
You know this
- You're lying

904
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:55,360
Like you lied in Baghdad
- I did not, no I knew nothing about the plates

905
01:05:55,483 --> 01:05:57,930
At that...
at that time

906
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:00,813
You are completely full of shit!

907
01:06:00,848 --> 01:06:03,434
Would you stop selling yourself on that
voiding the fact that you lied to me

908
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:05,642
When?
- Oh come on, you want to go there?

909
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,624
Okay you heard I was in play
and you wanted to play

910
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:11,842
Then I got serious, and you freaked!
- Oh I freaked?

911
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:16,433
I did not freak!
- You panicked, and you ran

912
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:27,232
Clarissa, come on, I am a federal fugitive
you know exactly how wanted I am

913
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:31,030
You think I came to Frankfurt to
hash out some old heart break, No.

914
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:34,537
I'm here because we didn't do this
I'm here because we were set up

915
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:37,930
I'm here because in the end
the truth is worth the risk

916
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:44,619
And I believe in you even
if you don't believe in me

917
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:51,322
God, I forgot how beautiful you are

918
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:58,859
Hold on to that phone

919
01:07:08,103 --> 01:07:09,734
(gunshots)
(screaming)

920
01:07:09,735 --> 01:07:11,692
(speaking German)

921
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:17,449
Sucker

922
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:23,435
Oh shit, where's Peck
- Excellent question, find him!

923
01:08:19,436 --> 01:08:22,529
(BA humming)

924
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:36,272
Okay, let's dance...coming down
positions, prepare to move

925
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:39,827
As always, stay close to me sir

926
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,500
(smoke gun)

927
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:03,754
I can't see anything
- How we doing there big man?

928
01:09:04,035 --> 01:09:09,043
Murdock, here comes the Arab
- It's a long drive deep into left center field

929
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:13,806
Murdock is back, he's at the wall
and he makes the catch!

930
01:09:14,669 --> 01:09:16,626
(coughing)

931
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,626
(gun fires)

932
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,626
(gunfire)

933
01:09:35,627 --> 01:09:40,034
BA, I lost the case. I'm
taking fire, I'm out of here

934
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:52,141
BA, get to those plates

935
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:56,692
(gunfire)

936
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:11,692
(cable snapping)
(BA screaming)

937
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,692
(glass shattering)

938
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,303
A bunch of federals responding to explosions
and shots fired at the Konigsbank building

939
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:50,042
All right get us out of this place and
to that building as soon as possible

940
01:10:50,982 --> 01:10:53,825
(gunfire)

941
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
(Ba screams)

942
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,825
(exhasperated) Whooo

943
01:11:07,826 --> 01:11:11,817
You made me work for this one Baracus
I didn't think I was this out of shape

944
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:16,621
I am unfortunately
Where's the rest of the team huh?

945
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:22,371
Smith, Peck that idiot pilot
the asshole. What's his name?

946
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,000
(BA groans)

947
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:30,985
I'm gonna take this one out on your
ass Baracus, let's see what you got

948
01:11:34,387 --> 01:11:37,629
Come on, what are you doing? Are you tired?
- I'm not going to hurt you man

949
01:11:37,638 --> 01:11:41,358
No you're not going to hurt me
I'm going to hurt you

950
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,200
I don't want to kill you man
- Maar ik jou wel, Baracus.

951
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,233
You don't want to kill me, you're not going
to kill me. I'm going to kill you Baracus

952
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:52,978
I'm not playing with you Pike
-Here we go I got gun's on my right and on my left

953
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:55,415
So as soon as that
hammer goes back, it's on

954
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:59,305
I swear to god I'll do it
You're not a killer, are you?

955
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,461
Ben je dat?

956
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,802
Whoopsie
- Damn!

957
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,000
You all right big fellow?
- You're a lifesaver man I couldn't shoot him

958
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:14,422
(tires squealing)
(gunfire)

959
01:12:18,423 --> 01:12:21,606
Get out of the way!

960
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,514
US Military, we got him
- Yeah, this is about the right amount of cops

961
01:12:54,549 --> 01:12:57,469
That's cute
You're lucky there are people around

962
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,856
No sweetheart, you're lucky

963
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,911
All right, not a peep out of the Arab

964
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,734
Sosa was at the train station

965
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,929
You saw her?
- Yeah

966
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:16,477
Did you talk to her?
- I had no choice okay just

967
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:19,165
trust me on that
- Oh I trust you...

968
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:22,215
to make historically bad decisions
where women are concerned

969
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:24,623
What part of you is
thinking at the moment?

970
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:26,263
Well Lynch's men moved in
on her and I had to react

971
01:13:26,264 --> 01:13:31,559
Please, somehow I doubt that
- Hey, what are you so pissed about?

972
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,579
We got the plates, you wanted
her teed up, she's teed up

973
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,886
She knows we didn't steal them

974
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,492
She'll be thrilled to
find out who did

975
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:45,740
What?
- He had to know

976
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:50,378
You had to know

977
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:54,605
You had to know if you left
me alive that this was coming

978
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:02,241
How could you not?

979
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,669
Hannibal?

980
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,467
Do you know who this is?

981
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:20,617
We all do

982
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:26,751
Morrison?
- Oh, hell no

983
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:28,750
Jesus Christ

984
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:35,815
Not so sure that it is a blessing
but, good hunting my friend

985
01:14:35,879 --> 01:14:40,762
Thank you
- You son of a bitch

986
01:14:45,226 --> 01:14:48,540
Morrison, holy shit

987
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:54,118
Outside, all of you
Outside now!

988
01:14:54,947 --> 01:14:59,487
I knew if Lynch helped me
escape, you had to be part of it

989
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:06,237
You and Pike were making a play on those
plates with Lynch, and you turned on him

990
01:15:06,598 --> 01:15:11,303
The way you turned of us
- Lynch was never going to cut us in

991
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:17,255
He was going to use us
he brought you on as insurance

992
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:21,458
You never thought you'd
betrayed your oldest living friend?

993
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:24,960
I just hit first Hannibal
I'm a fighting man

994
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:28,092
You're a liar
and a traitor

995
01:15:28,093 --> 01:15:31,719
You knew Morrison was masquerading
as the Arab. Why not share that?

996
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,299
I wasn't one hundred percent sure
- How about ninety nine percent?

997
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:37,212
Would you think it was
worth mentioning then?

998
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:41,473
Lynch, what did you think?
Did you think I would just kill him on the spot?

999
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:43,568
Well I was certain of it
I still am

1000
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:47,368
Do you have the plates?
- I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't

1001
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:52,383
Smith, return the plates, kill
Morrison and reclaim your lives

1002
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:56,162
I want signed and authorized
Amnesty agreements for myself

1003
01:15:56,163 --> 01:15:57,979
and for each of my men

1004
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,972
from the White House, the State
Department and the joint Chiefs of Staff

1005
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,120
You hear me?

1006
01:16:05,252 --> 01:16:09,923
Well I'm going to need a little more time
- How much?

1007
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:19,396
Give me five minutes
- I'm waiting

1008
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,046
I saw your tomb at Arlington

1009
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:44,140
You died a National hero

1010
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:57,087
Death is too easy

1011
01:16:57,187 --> 01:17:01,141
And the last thing we need is another lie
- Don't do this, Hannibal please

1012
01:17:01,142 --> 01:17:04,951
you owe me that much
- You owe me!

1013
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:09,400
You're going to tell them we're innocent
(whispering) you owe me

1014
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:15,210
Hannibal, it's meaningless
what are you fighting for now?

1015
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:16,805
you and those boys

1016
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:20,667
Your rank, your reputation
They're shit!

1017
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:26,205
You're convicts, plates or no plates
you're federal fugitives

1018
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:29,988
And when they're done with you
Hannibal, they'll just burn you

1019
01:17:30,885 --> 01:17:34,719
Zulu 1 Zulu 1 this is broadsword
you are clear to engage

1020
01:17:34,772 --> 01:17:38,324
Broadsword? did you come
up with that? That's awesome

1021
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:45,040
Boss could you do that?

1022
01:17:47,217 --> 01:17:50,439
To us
What Morrison did?

1023
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:55,377
No, I'd rather face a firing
squad than betray you boys

1024
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:57,670
Yeah but you didn't see it coming though

1025
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:03,913
No I...
I didn't see it coming

1026
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:10,986
Move!

1027
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,226
(explosion)

1028
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:24,696
Wow, that's awesome

1029
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:27,207
That looks exactly like
Call of Duty doesn't it

1030
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:31,594
All right here's the deal, no press release
keep local law enforcement and media off site

1031
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,052
Get a three mile quarrantine
dead over the no fly zone

1032
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:38,991
Get me an agency scrub team out there and
(singing) get me the god damn plates back

1033
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,528
The German police have your entire team
in custody in Konigsbank Tower

1034
01:18:44,905 --> 01:18:49,822
I don't do teams babe, that's
Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act

1035
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:05,106
I like to travel light. Stuff like uh...
loyalty doesn't fit in the overhead bins

1036
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,552
I thought you and Smith
were working together

1037
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:11,522
You thought wrong

1038
01:19:11,557 --> 01:19:14,327
Yes we have weapons
No, you may not wand us

1039
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:18,787
You want a deal?
I'll make you a deal

1040
01:19:18,856 --> 01:19:23,330
How about I dedicate
my immediate future

1041
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:28,265
to destroying yours?
- How about you get smart

1042
01:19:28,423 --> 01:19:32,162
and start dealing
before somebody else does

1043
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:37,233
Former Captain
whoa, whoa whoa

1044
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,523
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one.

1045
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:43,481
then this troubled young
loner belongs to me

1046
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:45,526
Let's go

1047
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:47,391
How the hell did
thay get an extradition order?

1048
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:49,692
Sorry Pike, at least
with me there are rules

1049
01:19:49,982 --> 01:19:53,474
The CIA's got rules. Our
rules are just cooler than yours

1050
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,099
Go

1051
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,300
You know Lynch, if I could seal
this room with you inside

1052
01:19:57,301 --> 01:19:59,350
I'd be doing the
world a big favor

1053
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,459
That's not nice

1054
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:06,178
Answer me
- Stay close to the fires boys

1055
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,052
If that gun ship is still around
it won't read our body heat

1056
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:14,061
Idiot Lynch, was so quick to kill us
didn't bother locating the plates

1057
01:20:14,062 --> 01:20:17,171
Where do we stand in
non violence now BA?

1058
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:19,462
Are you pissed?
you should be

1059
01:20:19,463 --> 01:20:22,526
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us

1060
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:25,428
and without Morrison, we got nothing

1061
01:20:25,948 --> 01:20:28,771
What do we do boss?
- I don't know Murdock

1062
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:31,877
I don't know
- I do

1063
01:20:32,267 --> 01:20:36,447
This guy Lynch, I think
I`ve got him figured out

1064
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:39,901
You got a plan kid?
- How do we get out of here?

1065
01:20:40,057 --> 01:20:42,785
Give me twenty minutes

1066
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:49,017
So Morrison's dead
Smith and his team are dead

1067
01:20:49,765 --> 01:20:52,950
Another fifteen minutes or so
we'll locate those engraving plates

1068
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:55,546
This is you gloating?
- No this is me beating you

1069
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:59,107
After you burned me.
We had a deal, remember?

1070
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:01,109
Not you and me
- You, me and Morrison

1071
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:04,606
Not you and me directly
- And you two collude and cut me out?

1072
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:09,585
Hey, what are you doing?
- Are we going to do this in the car?

1073
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:13,711
He's going to do it?
- Way to go, that's brilliant right there

1074
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:18,096
What are you doing? What is he doing?
- How's it going Kyle, are you all right?

1075
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:21,166
I'm good
- Brother you are far from good

1076
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,499
What are you doing?

1077
01:21:24,599 --> 01:21:26,649
It's a suppressor
counter clockwise

1078
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:28,466
You're holding a gun like that?
You've held a gun like that before

1079
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,152
and you're still here?
That's amazing

1080
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:34,633
Jesus, hey, final request
don't let this guy shoot me please

1081
01:21:40,336 --> 01:21:44,885
So if Sosa knows we're alive
-She'll think Morrison's alive too

1082
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:48,531
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm line

1083
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:55,642
This is Sosa
- General Morrison is in my posession

1084
01:21:55,764 --> 01:21:58,260
What? I'm sorry I can't hear you
who is this?

1085
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,807
Okay this was not well thought out
- No shit?

1086
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:04,386
I mean I gotta teach you how to kill me
hey, do me a favor all right?

1087
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:07,032
Put the barrel, put the gun flush to my head
- Are you sure?

1088
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:11,502
There you go, right there
- Is that going to go right through?

1089
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:14,064
We're okay

1090
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:16,645
Never cuff a man ia a seated position
with his hands behind his back

1091
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:18,659
makes it impossibe
to see the hands

1092
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,455
That was cool
- You liked that?

1093
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:25,346
Oh I liked that, I liked that a lot
Are you all right, you idiot?

1094
01:22:25,476 --> 01:22:27,963
Yeah it was a good hit
- Please handcuff him

1095
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:30,221
We don't need to use them again
we don't need the cuffs

1096
01:22:30,222 --> 01:22:31,442
Who are you talking to?

1097
01:22:31,443 --> 01:22:34,746
Brad,  phone or gun
phone or gun, pick

1098
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:38,734
Put the gun down
- Hey, I didn't burn you, Morrison did

1099
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:42,099
I really want to shoot you
- You've got to hear this sir

1100
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:46,014
Is this Smith?
- I'm a former Colonel to a former Captain

1101
01:22:46,015 --> 01:22:49,223
I know I've got about thirty seconds
before you lock this signal

1102
01:22:49,224 --> 01:22:52,451
so listen, we can
prove our innocence

1103
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:57,261
Okay now go back to.. did you say you
have Morrison? You have General Morrisson

1104
01:22:57,481 --> 01:22:59,390
Correct
- You have him alive?

1105
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,392
And well

1106
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,919
That's why Lynch is trying
to wipe us out wholesale

1107
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:07,243
Too much to explain now,
but Morrison's testimony frees us

1108
01:23:07,773 --> 01:23:09,982
and fries Lynch

1109
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,164
Uh Oh

1110
01:23:12,165 --> 01:23:16,346
Well not without the plates
- Also in my possesion

1111
01:23:16,446 --> 01:23:18,904
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead

1112
01:23:18,938 --> 01:23:23,017
and I want to keep it that way
- Give me a pen

1113
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,715
You still use a pen?

1114
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:28,435
LA docks, 48 hours, Dawn
If i deliver Morrison and the plates

1115
01:23:28,516 --> 01:23:33,107
in return, I want a re-trial
in front of a civilian court

1116
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:38,188
All right we'll deal. LA docks
48 hours from now

1117
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:42,087
any bullshit from your end
and that's it, deals off

1118
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:47,006
Did we get him?
- No

1119
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:52,714
Pike, do you believe in second chances?

1120
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:56,427
Ahhh... I do now

1121
01:23:56,685 --> 01:24:00,621
Too much?
- I thought you were spot on

1122
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:04,525
My turn

1123
01:24:04,775 --> 01:24:07,571
(Steely Dan ringtone)

1124
01:24:13,572 --> 01:24:15,834
Hold on to that phone

1125
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:26,854
This is Sosa
- Hello, beautiful

1126
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:29,572
Thank you

1127
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:38,702
Well they got the raw
end of the deal, didn't they?

1128
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:42,128
Look at BA
He looks like a huge banana

1129
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:45,391
(in accent) Good morning my friend
- Good morning

1130
01:24:49,473 --> 01:24:52,859
Rabbi Binky Rabinowits?

1131
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:57,201
What passport did I give you?
- You are from Tanzania?

1132
01:24:57,202 --> 01:25:00,746
My mother is from Tanzania
- Oh shit, what the hell happened?

1133
01:25:00,747 --> 01:25:05,755
(speaking Swahili)

1134
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:12,775
(Hannibal) Converting

1135
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:15,347
Let's go right into move
There's three to my right

1136
01:25:15,348 --> 01:25:18,058
There's two behind me and
one at the northeast exit

1137
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:23,098
(spaking fluent Swahili)

1138
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:29,015
Shalom

1139
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:39,904
There is a god
- You speak Swahili?

1140
01:25:40,003 --> 01:25:41,496
You don't?

1141
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,455
You got enough to work with kid?

1142
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:46,490
We will, you and I have some
major favors moving across

1143
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:47,595
the Atlantic right now

1144
01:25:47,596 --> 01:25:50,729
Some deep sea freighters with
some strictly black market merch

1145
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,133
How do we get out to her?

1146
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,933
A boat, a plain old boat
That's what I'm talking about Murdock

1147
01:25:54,034 --> 01:25:58,500
I'm talking overseas in style
That's how I  like to travel, classy like

1148
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:01,433
These things are safe
we don't need planes

1149
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:05,154
You know Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying

1150
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:11,616
Hey, that aint no boat!
- That did it

1151
01:26:11,716 --> 01:26:15,570
Murdock just remember what I said
I said you have to catch him

1152
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:20,253
after you inject him

1153
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:22,165
My bad

1154
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,236
(plane taking off)

1155
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,945
Oh dammit!
my head man

1156
01:26:53,705 --> 01:26:56,715
Coconut curry tapenade, your favorite
- Give me that fool

1157
01:26:57,393 --> 01:27:00,157
You got them toast points?

1158
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:03,486
Voila!
toast points

1159
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:07,084
You had to knock me out again huh?

1160
01:27:07,142 --> 01:27:13,164
Okay now, the whole injection
knocking out, Hannibal and Face

1161
01:27:13,443 --> 01:27:16,667
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1162
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:21,981
Why do I feel like I fell on
my face huh? tell me that

1163
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,968
Lynch's paradox..
Murdock, are you done with that?

1164
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:33,298
This a guy who needs anonymity
But he love the attricountaby

1165
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:37,522
He's an administrator
he's not an operator

1166
01:27:39,257 --> 01:27:41,868
Where is it?

1167
01:27:42,959 --> 01:27:47,218
Very nice. So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible

1168
01:27:47,318 --> 01:27:49,956
and never gets his hands
dirty if he can help it

1169
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:51,793
but we're going to change all of that

1170
01:27:51,794 --> 01:27:54,567
You can't hustle a hustler fool

1171
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:59,674
No sparks, no flames not even
a flashlight near this stuff

1172
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:06,037
This guy's never at
the flashpoint of everything

1173
01:28:07,394 --> 01:28:11,474
He's safe and sound
somewhere pulling the strings

1174
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,583
(doll) Mama mama

1175
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:15,631
Hey boss, why so many of
these damn things anyway?

1176
01:28:15,632 --> 01:28:20,240
Because overkill is
underrated my friend

1177
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:24,034
So we're going to bring this
guy down to ground level

1178
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:28,262
(recording) Mama.
Lynch. (recording fades)

1179
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:32,041
The last place he'd
 ever want to be

1180
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,516
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see

1181
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,481
Any questions?

1182
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:45,108
What's up boss man?
- Hey, BA

1183
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:51,573
This is going to get heavy isn't it?
- Well, I can't promise you it won't

1184
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:53,792
I'm going to read you
something real quick

1185
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:57,190
Victory attained by violence

1186
01:28:57,191 --> 01:29:02,358
is tantamount to defeat
for it is momentary

1187
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:04,887
Ghandi.

1188
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:08,385
It is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts

1189
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:13,486
than to put on the cloak
of non-violence to cover impotence

1190
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,868
Who said that?
- Same guy

1191
01:29:18,258 --> 01:29:22,447
Ghandi wasn't afraid to
fight for the things he believed in

1192
01:29:23,127 --> 01:29:26,181
What is it you 
believe in BA?

1193
01:29:47,266 --> 01:29:48,775
What's wrong?

1194
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:53,461
I don't know man, 
just thinking about this

1195
01:29:53,462 --> 01:29:57,180
We've always come back alive
the four of us

1196
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,000
because of the old man

1197
01:09:59,500 --> 01:30:01,495
I know
- I'm not him

1198
01:30:01,595 --> 01:30:05,873
Face, I know this
- Murdock, I'm not Hannibal

1199
01:30:06,385 --> 01:30:13,450
Who has the most to lose on this Face?
Me, and I trust you

1200
01:30:14,973 --> 01:30:20,151
Yeah I know but that...
You're crazy

1201
01:30:24,147 --> 01:30:27,113
Not that crazy

1202
01:30:43,393 --> 01:30:45,819
All eagles may have landed
evrybody ready to roll?

1203
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,856
Copy, team one on the move

1204
01:30:47,857 --> 01:30:50,402
Acknowledged, team two en route

1205
01:30:55,923 --> 01:31:00,862
All right guys, everybody ready?
The curtains about to come up

1206
01:31:00,863 --> 01:31:03,900
(machine whirring)
-Showtime

1207
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:12,493
That's Smith right there, watch him

1208
01:31:13,346 --> 01:31:17,286
All teams in position?
- Standing by

1209
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,190
In position

1210
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:24,652
Shoot team one affirmitave
- Spotter 1, 10-8.

1211
01:31:25,078 --> 01:31:28,395
Less chatter, mark on comms now
Morrison's the primary tango,

1212
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:32,210
the plates are the package
(cell phone rings) -Yeah?

1213
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:35,924
Okay, okay, he's talking to
Sosa, I want this call

1214
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,000
You lied to us
we had a deal!

1215
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:40,610
I want that god damn
call in my...thank you

1216
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:44,574
We had a deal but I'm changing the deal
- Are you kidding me Sosa!

1217
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:47,458
This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here

1218
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:50,952
Listen, or remain at large fugitives
for the forseeable future

1219
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,798
No, no no no
- I've got Morrison here with the plates!

1220
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:55,994
I'm exposed Sosa, exposed!

1221
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:57,550
We're not doing this on the docks

1222
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:00,154
Now listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in

1223
01:32:00,155 --> 01:32:01,860
Now you listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in

1224
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:04,146
I need you to do it on 
my terms, or nothing at all

1225
01:32:04,147 --> 01:32:06,177
To hell with that,
to hell with you Sosa!

1226
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:07,622
Ahh.......
she burned him

1227
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:10,873
Face, B.A we're booking out
Sosa shafted us

1228
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:14,682
Murdock, get the
chopper down here in ten

1229
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,932
Okay, he's moving him
you got him, he's moving him

1230
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:20,064
For the love of god, relax

1231
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:21,790
I am relaxed, he's moving him

1232
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:24,432
(recording) 
Don't do this Hannibal, please

1233
01:32:24,433 --> 01:32:25,350
There, that's Morrison
right there. Take him!

1234
01:32:25,351 --> 01:32:27,200
Vance!, does he have the plates?

1235
01:32:27,201 --> 01:32:28,350
Smith has the plates go now!

1236
01:32:28,351 --> 01:32:29,630
I've got Morrison
taking the shot

1237
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:33,243
(gunfire)
(bullet riccochets)

1238
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:37,281
A little too close for comfort kid
- What just happened?

1239
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:39,487
What the hell is he doing?

1240
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:40,727
Where are they?
Somebody talk to me.

1241
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:44,313
Come on, did that
thing crush them or what?

1242
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:48,104
Oh, this was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups

1243
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:54,907
Everybody just be cool, pay
attention, no hasty moves

1244
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:59,436
So you beat a guy like Lynch by
drawing him in with three things

1245
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:00,860
What the hell are they doing?

1246
01:33:00,861 --> 01:33:04,722
Distraction
(explosion)

1247
01:33:04,723 --> 01:33:05,722
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1248
01:33:05,723 --> 01:33:08,037
What is happening?

1249
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,607
Diversion

1250
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,165
This is a diversion
stay eagle on those containers

1251
01:33:18,166 --> 01:33:19,384
They're making for
the exits, open fire!

1252
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:22,660
Do not engage! Back off!
- All teams engage

1253
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:26,600
(gunfire)

1254
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,448
Holy shit!

1255
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:33,448
(gunfire)

1256
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:36,000
You are being played
by Smith. He's trying to

1257
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:38,691
draw your eye line Lynch
Come on, be smart

1258
01:33:38,692 --> 01:33:40,984
Take him, take him, take him!

1259
01:33:42,553 --> 01:33:47,323
Contact! Tower house and bow
It's Peck and Baracus!

1260
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,425
(flare gun firing)

1261
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:55,075
And evasion

1262
01:33:55,575 --> 01:33:59,400
It's a trap! Pull back! Fall back!
Get the hell out of there!

1263
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:00,657
No, no, no

1264
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:01,689
(explosion)

1265
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,687
(vehicle explodes)

1266
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:08,216
What is happening?
What is going on?

1267
01:34:08,217 --> 01:34:09,993
Nice one kid

1268
01:34:09,994 --> 01:34:12,796
It's Peck and Baracus
- Shoot the...

1269
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:16,055
Shut up I know what I'm doing
- Okay paintballers, time to go pro

1270
01:34:16,056 --> 01:34:19,149
(gunfire)

1271
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:22,140
BA, get to your secondary position

1272
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:26,800
Okay, gamechanger... Here's what 
I think of your best laid plans

1273
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,702
(rocket launcher beeps)
(fires)

1274
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:34,000
(massive explosion)
-Shit

1275
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,839
Jesus Christ!!

1276
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,612
So much for the grand scheme Smith
- What the hell was that?

1277
01:34:39,712 --> 01:34:42,965
Face, what the hell was that?
- I think this ships going to blow

1278
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:45,551
He punched a hole in the hull!
- What about the plan?

1279
01:34:45,552 --> 01:34:48,139
Pike just blew up the plan
we are ad libbing!

1280
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,245
Bosco, get out of there!
- I'm going for Hannibal!

1281
01:34:51,263 --> 01:34:54,420
Cover me, I'm going for those plates
- Yes sir

1282
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:02,435
The boat's going over get out of there!
- Face hang on!

1283
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:08,914
(explosions)

1284
01:35:15,915 --> 01:35:18,914
(metal scraping)

1285
01:35:22,618 --> 01:35:26,914
(containers crashing)

1286
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,914
(rocket launcher beeps)
(fires)

1287
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,914
(gunfire)

1288
01:36:11,915 --> 01:36:13,914
(large explosion)

1289
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,914
(gunfire)

1290
01:36:46,915 --> 01:36:51,954
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground
I'm running low on ammo man

1291
01:36:51,955 --> 01:36:54,137
(gunfire)

1292
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,500
(motorcycle revving)

1293
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:04,137
Shit!

1294
01:37:04,138 --> 01:37:09,503
How are you doing handsome?
Shit can you cycle that weapon, nice work

1295
01:37:09,504 --> 01:37:12,650
Geez, close friends and bullets
Where are they when you need them?

1296
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:15,944
(motorcycle accelerating)

1297
01:37:15,945 --> 01:37:21,486
Don't take this too personally but uh...
look here, smile, and wait for the flash

1298
01:37:21,487 --> 01:37:24,037
(motorcycle revving)

1299
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:26,146
Baracus!

1300
01:37:33,026 --> 01:37:35,722
Whoa Ho Ho Ho Ho Hooooo!!!!!!

1301
01:37:35,723 --> 01:37:38,659
Bosco!

1302
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,890
(A-Team theme)

1303
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,890
(Hannibal whispering throughout)
-Lynch

1304
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,890
Lynch

1305
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:05,038
Come on Lynch

1306
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,529
Lynch

1307
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:16,509
Come on Smith, stop bullshitting
- Come on Lynch

1308
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,221
Lynch... where am I?

1309
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:29,753
Come on Lynch

1310
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,753
Lynch

1311
01:38:32,754 --> 01:38:34,753
Where am I Lynch!

1312
01:38:37,754 --> 01:38:40,753
Lynch...Lynch...Lynch
Lynch...Lynch

1313
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,753
Lynch!!

1314
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,753
(gunfire)

1315
01:38:57,754 --> 01:39:02,264
There you are Hannibal
I've been looking all over for you

1316
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:05,229
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you
My Muay Thai is pretty good

1317
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:08,961
Jujitsu's a liitle better
but I got this whole

1318
01:39:09,281 --> 01:39:13,420
slight of hand thing going with 
the containers and the cars...

1319
01:39:13,421 --> 01:39:16,033
and the fireworks
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch

1320
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:21,530
God that's annoying
But you give Pike a rocket

1321
01:39:21,531 --> 01:39:25,170
there's your monkey wrench

1322
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:26,967
(recording)
Hannibal don't do this

1323
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,236
You know Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world

1324
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:33,719
(recording) You owe me that much
- but you drop a few bullets in the batter

1325
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,800
(recording) Hannibal don't do this
- Lynch, no!

1326
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:39,057
(gunfire)

1327
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:41,824
And that cake don't bake

1328
01:39:42,275 --> 01:39:46,216
Uh oh, your witness, your gun
...your problem

1329
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:53,601
You served your country well
Excuse me

1330
01:39:55,426 --> 01:39:59,417
Ahh hello Ben. Where
have you been all my life

1331
01:40:01,606 --> 01:40:04,793
Hannibal, you're slowing down

1332
01:40:04,794 --> 01:40:09,068
and bleeding, you're bleeding?
Da da da don't get up

1333
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,140
God damn it!

1334
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:20,828
Your Muay Thai is as
bad as your Jujitsu Lynch

1335
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:24,394
You better stick with a gun

1336
01:40:24,429 --> 01:40:28,339
You put a loaded weapon in my hand
I'm going to put a bullet in your head

1337
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
(gun fires)

1338
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:45,201
I told you I would shoot you

1339
01:40:45,912 --> 01:40:48,566
Kevlar saved your life
The thing is...

1340
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:50,746
doesn't do much good
if I pop you in the head

1341
01:40:50,747 --> 01:40:54,538
It does if you melt it down

1342
01:40:54,756 --> 01:40:57,742
(recording) Hannibal don't do this
(recording) Hannibal please

1343
01:40:57,903 --> 01:41:00,860
See you beat a guy like that 
by drawing him in with three things

1344
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,274
Distraction
- Whoa whoa what is happening?

1345
01:41:03,374 --> 01:41:07,348
Diversion
- Diversion

1346
01:41:10,869 --> 01:41:14,998
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see

1347
01:41:31,929 --> 01:41:34,256
That's good

1348
01:41:34,997 --> 01:41:38,268
Surprise

1349
01:41:38,463 --> 01:41:41,933
Agent Burris
- What did you call me?

1350
01:41:42,883 --> 01:41:44,369
Agent Vance Burris isn't that your name?

1351
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:47,957
at least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here. Unless you have

1352
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:52,572
a piece of paper that
looks exactly like...

1353
01:41:52,582 --> 01:41:55,330
No, that wouldn't help you either

1354
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:57,567
Easy, easy

1355
01:41:58,758 --> 01:42:02,494
You're under arrest for attempted murder
violations of the civil false claims act

1356
01:42:02,594 --> 01:42:06,977
and theft of top secret
government engraving plates

1357
01:42:09,808 --> 01:42:13,700
Well I guess the plan went okay
considering Pike didn't blow up the boat

1358
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:15,870
which I didn't account for at all

1359
01:42:15,871 --> 01:42:18,158
The bullets didn't go through

1360
01:42:19,977 --> 01:42:25,556
How are you feeling man?
- Not...not good... not good

1361
01:42:25,918 --> 01:42:27,579
I feel sane

1362
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,685
(BA laughing) I should have
shot you in the head a long time ago

1363
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:34,808
Okay Agent Burris, that will be all
Take him out of here guys

1364
01:42:38,963 --> 01:42:44,139
What's the difference between
a concussion, and a contusion?

1365
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:49,458
Murdock that was beautiul, you were right
The helmet worked, ketchup worked great

1366
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:52,609
You did a great job
are you okay?

1367
01:42:52,643 --> 01:42:57,786
Got your bell rung?
Just let Hannibal make the plans next time

1368
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:02,237
Oh...Okay
- How's the conscience big guy?

1369
01:43:02,311 --> 01:43:06,501
At peace

1370
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:22,162
Which one of you is Sosa?
- I am

1371
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:25,412
As of right now, your prisoner is
to be remanded into federal custody

1372
01:43:25,445 --> 01:43:27,776
I have a warrant for this man's arrest
- As of right now...

1373
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:30,989
I'm a doctor, I'm going to help you out
Hey you need stitches?

1374
01:43:31,477 --> 01:43:33,557
Please tell me you need stitches
I could stitch you up really good

1375
01:43:33,558 --> 01:43:35,537
(laughter)

1376
01:43:35,538 --> 01:43:37,672
Gentlemen

1377
01:43:38,602 --> 01:43:42,270
Central Intelligence Agency believes 
in and invensys a crown moral ethic

1378
01:43:42,271 --> 01:43:44,551
as well as an unshakable
professional standard

1379
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:50,645
As such, we would like to extend our most
sincere apologies for what's happened here

1380
01:43:51,134 --> 01:43:54,995
Good day and god bless
- Where are you taking him?

1381
01:43:57,104 --> 01:43:59,615
Who?

1382
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:05,659
I never got your name

1383
01:44:06,601 --> 01:44:12,183
My name in Lynch
- Of course it is

1384
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:16,918
Did he just say Lynch

1385
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,725
Easy guys
- Everybody, stand down

1386
01:44:33,048 --> 01:44:35,939
Control this place

1387
01:44:38,892 --> 01:44:42,156
When did you arrive
I had no idea...

1388
01:44:42,176 --> 01:44:44,080
Yes sir

1389
01:44:44,506 --> 01:44:47,640
Get your hands off me tough guy

1390
01:44:49,244 --> 01:44:53,517
Well that's one hell of a mess
But we did get the plates

1391
01:44:53,844 --> 01:44:58,189
But unfortunately, I'm going to have to 
charge you all with escaping lawful custody

1392
01:44:58,224 --> 01:45:00,115
What?! Hannibal what
is this guy talking about?

1393
01:45:00,215 --> 01:45:03,225
We were wrongly convicted but it's
still illegal to break out of jail

1394
01:45:03,226 --> 01:45:06,239
Director, Smithand his men were 
instrumental in recovering the plates

1395
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:10,161
They're still level ten fugitives
and I need that off my desk

1396
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:12,090
This is chicken shit sir

1397
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:15,306
Well perhaps for them, it is chicken shit
But for you... Captain...

1398
01:45:15,307 --> 01:45:17,889
we're re-promoting you
to your former rank

1399
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:20,960
So look, they're going to be delivered
to the US Marshalls here in Long Beach

1400
01:45:20,984 --> 01:45:26,869
I understand sir but...
- This needs to be done!

1401
01:45:27,092 --> 01:45:29,575
I'm a Harry Houdini

1402
01:45:33,352 --> 01:45:35,833
Let's go keep moving
- Stop, wait

1403
01:45:37,096 --> 01:45:40,486
This is so wrong
- Don't worry about it

1404
01:45:40,647 --> 01:45:42,778
I'm going to do everything
I can to fix it

1405
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:47,124
I know you will
- I'm so sorry Face

1406
01:46:18,336 --> 01:46:22,218
Nice plan Face

1407
01:46:22,321 --> 01:46:26,275
Yeah, we just traded Lynches
and we're going back to prison

1408
01:46:26,276 --> 01:46:29,288
We returned the plates, we can hold
our heads high, we did the right thing

1409
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:32,829
Yeah after what they did to us
This is bullshit

1410
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:37,228
They burned us again Hannibal, we
trusted the system and it turned on us

1411
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:41,132
Remember boys, no matter how random
things might appear, there is still a plan

1412
01:46:41,133 --> 01:46:45,208
Kid...

1413
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:48,537
Well, I don't mean to steal
your line boss, but uh...

1414
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:58,647
I love it when a plan comes together

1415
01:47:04,849 --> 01:47:08,389
They survived as soldiers of fortune

1416
01:47:09,318 --> 01:47:11,602
If you have a problem

1417
01:47:12,475 --> 01:47:14,520
If no one else can help

1418
01:47:15,074 --> 01:47:18,859
And if you can find them
Maybe you can hire

1419
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:24,215
The A-Team

1420
01:47:24,216 --> 01:47:44,217
