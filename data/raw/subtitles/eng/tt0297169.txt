1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,949
And where does the hydrogen come from?

2
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,751
Carbon dioxide, or the hydrogen dioxide?

3
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,797
It comes from the water. H2O.

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,877
It is an oxidation-reduction reaction,
and we breathe it in and reduce it...

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,073
oxidizing sugar and forming water.

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,193
Photosynthesis is what?

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,313
It is the reverse.

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,796
Respiration is energy releasing.

9
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,629
Alex...

10
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,552
are you dreaming what I was dreaming?

11
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,199
Winter break in Hawaii.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,590
Hanging out with the cutest guys
in the world?

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,115
Dead on. This is gonna be awesome.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,993
Our first chance at independence.

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,992
Away from the parents.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,196
<i>Alex and Madison Stewart,
please report to the principal's office.</i>

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,430
Okay, ladies, off you go.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,879
- Katherine!
- Hey, guys.

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,749
- We're going to the principal's office.
- No, you're not. You're coming with me.

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,479
- Is Dad okay?
- Dad's fine.

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,916
He asked me to pick you up
from school early.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,196
You've finished your finals, right?

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,350
Right.

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,113
And you've aced them?

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,237
- Hopefully.
- Then let's go.

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,990
'Bye.

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,351
- Surprise!
- Hi, Dad! How are you?

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,432
Come on, guys. We gotta go.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,079
Hurry up. Buckle up.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,750
Hey, buckle up because
we're next for takeoff, okay?

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,278
So, Dad, where are we going? Hawaii?

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,273
Are you sending us there
to hook up with our friends?

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,359
No, we're not going
to Hawaii today, girls. We're going...

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,999
somewhere much better.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,871
I'm taking you to Atlantis.

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,749
Atlantis?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,037
As in the Lost Continent?

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,631
No. The Atlantis Resort...

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,074
in the Bahamas.

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,310
The Bahamas?

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
But we really wanted to go
on a school trip to Hawaii.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,397
- We have no friends in the Bahamas.
- There are no luaus in the Bahamas.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,437
There are no lifeguards in the Bahamas.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,434
We're just saying, what do
the Bahamas have that Hawaii doesn't?

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,670
Well...

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,036
me and your mother...

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,394
and I need the beach...

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,073
and I need a martini.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,277
Stat! Okay.

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,236
You ready?

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,710
'Cause I gotta get in there
and make this thing fly.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,918
You guys are gonna get hungry,
aren't you?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,515
I wonder if I have anything for you.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,594
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,357
- Did Dad come through?
- Thank you.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,272
Did Dad come through? That's nice.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, buckle up. Seriously. We gotta go.

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
How sweet.
Dad remembered our security blankets.

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,598
All glazed.

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,633
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,076
Welcome. I missed you.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,355
I missed you.

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,635
We missed you, too.

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,790
Hello. Hello.

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,590
- This place is just as beautiful as Hawaii.
- I'm so excited.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,319
- How was your flight?
- Smooth.

67
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,720
Did the Graysons arrive?

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,714
I don't know. We'll check at the hotel.
You have to see it. It's a blast.

69
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,155
Not bad.

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,473
We have a surprise for you.

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,559
You worked very hard at school.
We're very proud of you.

72
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,714
And so we thought it was time
you had your own suite.

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,874
Thank you!

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,953
Why don't you check the front desk
and see if the Graysons have made it yet.

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,315
Sure, Mom.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,320
Excuse me.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,233
Were you in line?

78
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,990
Brianna Wallace. Messages, please.

79
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,993
Certainly, Miss Wallace.
And how is your father today?

80
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,391
In the casino, wondering
why this is taking so long.

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,516
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
Thank you.

83
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,356
And thank you.

84
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,432
Next time, take a number.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,912
Welcome to Atlantis. How are you today?

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,151
Good. Have the Graysons checked in yet?

87
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,469
- We're here!
- Come on.

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,710
Hey, everybody.

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,870
Hey.

90
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,280
Good to see you.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,596
Lovely. Lovely.

92
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,399
Hey, Griffen. Hey, Keegan.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,880
Hi, Madison.

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,555
And...

95
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,710
And Alex.

96
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,870
Hi.

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,950
Hi.

98
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,999
Listen, Harr. I've been thinking
about the Frankfort acquisition.

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
I'd like to run some numbers by you.
Over drinks, of course.

100
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Chad. As your CEO and your friend...

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,594
I direct you to stop all business
for five days.

102
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,276
- It's really difficult.
- I understand.

103
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,510
What's that sound?

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,910
That's the sound of the beach
calling our name.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,037
Go ahead. We'll see you later.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,759
Don't forget to put on sun block.

107
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,399
Dad, I'm heading to the pool.

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,470
Go.

109
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,596
Me, too.

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,160
- Bye-bye.
- Watch her.

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,592
These family vacations are great...

112
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,356
but we're old enough to be on our
own now. I mean, we're turning 18.

113
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,676
What?

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,189
In three years.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,879
He's a good one.

116
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,234
Computer-gaming magnate waiting
for technology to catch up with him.

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,477
Please don't tell me you're up
for hanging out with Chad and Jill...

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,553
and their bratty daughter Keegan,
and their nerdy son Griffen?

119
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,157
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Griffen isn't so nerdy anymore.

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,870
Shut up!

121
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,633
This one's ready for marriage.

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,949
How do you know?

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,315
Pierced ear.

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,869
He knows pain and he's bought jewelry.

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,320
"I feel the need.

126
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,073
"The need for speed."

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,630
Look.

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,716
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,269
They look like they're having so much fun.

130
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,389
Look how much fun they are having.

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,679
- To family.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,191
- To family.
- To family.

133
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,319
Hot enough for you?

134
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,949
Smokin'.

135
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
Hey, runt, don't sneak up on me like that.

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,152
I wasn't watching Madison. I was...

137
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,993
scanning the horizon for ships.

138
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,595
Yeah. That's why
your deeply repressed feelings...

139
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,592
are written all over your face.

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,679
- What do you know?
- Everything, I have a stunning IQ.

141
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,756
You know, I've made a decision.

142
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,594
I'm going to enjoy all aspects
of this vacation.

143
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,958
I'm officially letting go
of this whole Hawaiian vaca-thing...

144
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,315
with our friends.

145
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,516
It's gone.

146
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,953
Maybe not gone gone,
but I'm trying hard to work through it.

147
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,076
Strong move. Very empowering.

148
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,510
- Do you see?
- I'm all over that.

149
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,910
Impressive.

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,031
Hey, girls. Do you party?

151
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,916
Sure.

152
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,033
Very impressive.

153
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,474
Thank you. Now it says here...

154
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,839
the Caribbean has long been
a stronghold for smugglers and pirates.

155
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,591
Mom, please, we have nothing they want.

156
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,760
Keegan, did you make
that beautiful necklace?

157
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,880
It's nothing. Just a typical string
of mollusk-less cohabitations.

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,469
Exactly.

159
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,196
Okay.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
Puka shells.

161
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,550
Right.

162
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,709
Griffen will be in college next year.

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,792
Any idea what you want to study?

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,796
I've always been interested in
flying insects, like bees, wasps, hornets...

165
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,351
So you're gonna study entomology?

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
No. I was actually thinking
aeronautical engineering.

167
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
A good choice.

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,874
Wow! Would you look at the time.
May we be excused?

169
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,156
This guy Scott invited us to a party.

170
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,357
A party? Well, I don't know.

171
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,476
Where is it?

172
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,199
Right here at the hotel.

173
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,990
Okay. But I want you back by 11:00, okay?

174
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,356
Okay.

175
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,920
Dad, is it cool if I go, too?

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,516
Yeah. Sure. Just remember
you've got a curfew, too, buddy.

177
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,716
Okay.

178
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,953
Well, I guess they're on their way
to not needing us.

179
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,072
The onset of adolescence among offspring
is frequently difficult to accept.

180
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,839
Perhaps my mom can help you
work through some issues.

181
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,633
She's a professional.

182
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,029
My card.

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,715
I'll get the drinks.

184
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,713
Pineapple smoothies for us
will be just fine. Thanks.

185
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
Hottie at 10:00.

186
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,194
He's smiling at you.

187
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,953
I'm not blind. I saw that.

188
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,558
Now he knows I saw that.

189
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,151
Hey. I'm gonna dance.

190
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,716
Good for you.

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,792
So, do you want to join me?

192
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,590
Sure.

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,078
- What's your name?
- Alex.

194
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,873
That's it, just one name?

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400
It's one more than you.

196
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,552
Jordan. Are you here
on vacation with the fam?

197
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,434
Yeah. You?

198
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,196
Oh, I live here. I take care
of the marine habitats at the Atlantis.

199
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,077
It's enormous. Some people say
it's the largest in the world.

200
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,674
It's amazing.

201
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,030
We're staying here.

202
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

203
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,115
I'm so tired of these lavish winter parties.

204
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,874
Hanging out at the beach
getting tans, pedicures...

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,111
enjoying the good grace
of my excellent father.

206
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,510
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

207
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,598
- I live for it.
- For real.

208
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,990
So, Brianna, it just wouldn't be
winter vaca...

209
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,790
if you didn't hook up with the cutest boy
on the beach. So who's it gonna be?

210
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,395
Let's start our screening process,
shall we?

211
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,398
- Hi.
- 'Bye.

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,070
Hey. What's up?

213
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,833
Not my temperature.

214
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,838
- Say?
- Nothing. And, keep moving.

215
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,312
Ladies, we have a winner.

216
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,314
Looks like you're not the only one
who thinks so.

217
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,477
Now, he's what time it is.

218
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,516
I'll bet money on Brianna any day.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,674
Excuse me. My name is Brianna Wallace...

220
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,956
as in the Wallace Department Store
Wallaces.

221
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,599
What's your name?

222
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,276
Jordan Landers, as in
the Landers Hardware Store Landers.

223
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,832
A sense of humor. Cute.

224
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,831
Sorry. I don't believe I know you.

225
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,957
Yeah. We met in the lobby.

226
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,074
"Take a number"?

227
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,914
No. I'm sorry.
I don't ever remember seeing you.

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,832
I guess you get that a lot.

229
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,877
Can you excuse me, ladies?

230
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,396
Now that we've met, I just want to get
a few things straight around here.

231
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,997
I get what I want.
And this winter break, I want Jordan.

232
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,312
Brianna Wallace, let the games begin.

233
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,479
This can't be good.

234
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,876
It's Dad. He wants us to call him
the instant we come in.

235
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,593
Too late. He's here.

236
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,796
It is 12:15 a.m.

237
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,359
How late does that make them?

238
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,114
Precisely 75 minutes past curfew.

239
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,040
If we were back home,
we'd be 45 minutes early.

240
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,355
Nice try.

241
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,636
We voted on it. And it was unanimous.

242
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,394
We decided it was okay
if we were a little late...

243
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,200
because we are
in the Bahamas on vacation.

244
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,679
You took a vote?

245
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Well, it was your loss.
We had a great time tonight.

246
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,354
It would have been nice
to share it with you as a family.

247
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,160
I recommend that
for the rest of this holiday...

248
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,716
you respect your curfews, okay?

249
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,309
Now, get to bed because we have
a full day planned for tomorrow.

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,232
But I have a day date.

251
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,269
A day date?

252
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,511
Yeah. A date during the day.

253
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,476
I've accepted an invitation to go
horseback riding on the beach with Scott.

254
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
Who's Scott?

255
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,958
A nice guy that I met on the beach.

256
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,112
And I was gonna concentrate
on chilling by the pool.

257
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
I like the sound of that.

258
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,515
Why don't we all concentrate
on chilling by the pool together.

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,631
But what about my day date?

260
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,350
We'll see.

261
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,790
Go to bed.

262
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,310
How great was that?

263
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,312
- I made it.
- That was great.

264
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,551
I haven't had this much fun since...

265
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,279
last year with the family.

266
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Yeah, okay.

267
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,997
Who's up for another run? Let's go.

268
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,837
All right. Go ahead.

269
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,077
Go have fun without us.

270
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,799
I'll read a book or...

271
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,870
Let's go again.

272
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,996
No!

273
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,916
Hi. Nice shell. Want some help?

274
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,553
I think I got it covered.

275
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,080
My name's Jeffrey.

276
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,118
I'm kind of busy, Jeffrey.

277
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,919
You want to play Frisbee?

278
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,277
A plastic, spinning dog toy? No thanks.

279
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,551
You want to check out my warts?

280
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,792
Tempting, but no.

281
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,872
You want to build a sandcastle?

282
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,119
I got a better idea.

283
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,916
I'm never going to get out of here.

284
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,440
Precisely.

285
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,676
Help!

286
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,236
Hi, Jordan.

287
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,596
Hey, Alex. This is my friend Champlaine.

288
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,672
- He runs the Sea-Doo Shack.
- Nice to meet you.

289
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,035
Very nice to meet you.

290
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,919
And you will get that package to me
that we talked about?

291
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
You bet.

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,957
I'm making my rounds.
You want to give me a hand?

293
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,554
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

294
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,438
So what kind of fish are these?

295
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,160
These are actually spotted eagle rays.

296
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,033
And they're cousins to the stingray
and the manta ray.

297
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,716
Dangerous?

298
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,792
No. I mean, they're harmless.

299
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,360
Unless they feel threatened.

300
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,116
See, they're hungry.
You know, they eat four, five times a day.

301
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,791
They dig in the sand for crabs, right?

302
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,599
Yeah, they do. You know about fish?

303
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,875
I love sushi.

304
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,556
You do? Do you want to feed them?
'Cause they'll eat right out of your hand.

305
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,199
I don't know. You do it first.

306
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,396
Okay.

307
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,474
Oh, my God.

308
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
Just like that.

309
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,635
- They don't have teeth or anything, right?
- No teeth.

310
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,279
They just suck on you?

311
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,477
- It's okay, just feed them.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,631
- Good job.
- It's sucking on me.

313
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,714
It's okay.

314
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,040
Jordan, you're wanted at the mine pool.

315
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,995
Can't you get Roger to cover it?
I'm a little busy.

316
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,037
She specifically asked for you.

317
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,236
Who?

318
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,555
Miss Wallace's father
is a very, very important client of ours.

319
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,270
He spends a lot of money here.
So, please, don't keep her waiting.

320
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,272
So I guess I'll see you later?

321
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,914
Hopefully sooner.

322
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,833
Look. I do this to the cards and
one card jumps to the top.

323
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,754
- Your card is the Ace of Clubs.
- Nope.

324
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,071
- What was it?
- King of Hearts.

325
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,314
Man, I do that and look what happens.
It becomes the King of Hearts.

326
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,517
You know what I think of this music?

327
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,478
You don't understand what the big deal is?

328
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,074
- I like it.
- Really?

329
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,230
Yes.

330
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,398
I find it kind of angry.
Are you angry, Harrison?

331
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,073
No, I'm open-minded.

332
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,511
All right. But if you start listening...

333
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,160
to rap music in the car, I'm taking the bus.

334
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,636
- Oh, really?
- I'm kidding!

335
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,189
You know, maybe I'll start rapping myself.

336
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,480
Brianna, I really should get back to work.

337
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,153
Is it important?

338
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
It's my job.

339
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,391
Look, as long as you're with me,
you won't get into trouble.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,514
Jordan.

341
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,479
Excuse me, Miss Wallace.

342
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,392
Jordan, I need your help right away.

343
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,631
There's been a P.I. over at the shark pool.

344
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,710
P.I.?

345
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,235
Puking incident.
Some kid puked all in the shark pool.

346
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,030
Anyway, I need you to clean it up
for me right away. ASAP.

347
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
Trolling for barf?

348
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,040
How did you know?

349
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,880
I made the call.

350
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,794
Then there isn't any?

351
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,877
Isn't it about break time?

352
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,474
I guess so.

353
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
Can I help? Yeah?

354
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,435
You ride well.

355
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,194
Thanks. Summer camp.

356
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,354
Why are we stopping?

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,672
- I think my horse has sand in his shoe.
- That's funny. Let's go.

358
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
- I'll race you back to the barn.
- I was serious.

359
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,997
Did you know that a lot of scholars
think that Atlantis, the Lost Continent...

360
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,037
was originally right here in the Caribbean?

361
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,794
Others think it was in the Mediterranean.

362
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,190
That's nice, but do you mind if we talk...

363
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,840
about something a little more personal?

364
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,594
Sure. I don't mind.

365
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,750
Great.

366
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,910
What I'm gonna say
might seem a little forward...

367
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,196
but we've known each other
for a long time...

368
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,920
so I feel comfortable
expressing myself to you.

369
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
Express away.

370
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,600
Okay. Well, I really like this guy,
and I think he likes me, too, but...

371
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,560
you know, I think he's shy
and afraid to tell me.

372
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,198
Maybe this guy needs you
to make the first move.

373
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,555
Well, that's why I'm talking to you.

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,229
It's Scott.

375
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,592
Right. I mean, who else could it be.

376
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,959
Right. And he's so sweet and nice.
I just think he needs a little encouraging.

377
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,872
So I guess you want my help.

378
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,475
Thanks.

379
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,309
Hey, Scott.

380
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,834
What's up, dude?

381
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,795
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Madison.

382
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,759
- Are you going with her, man?
- No, give me a break.

383
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,071
Good. Because I'm into her, dude.

384
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,479
But I have a real hard time
talking to her, you know?

385
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,479
I think she thinks I'm an idiot.

386
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,040
No, I doubt it.

387
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,114
No, it's like when I'm with her I freeze,
you know?

388
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,751
It's not like "We're getting cold"
type of freeze. It's like...

389
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,516
I think I know what you mean.
Here, go with me on this, okay?

390
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,230
Okay. Let me tell you
a little something about our girl.

391
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,310
Sweet.

392
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,471
She loves astronomy. And when she was...

393
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,870
growing up she loved Judy Blume books.

394
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,630
Have you ever read
any Judy Blume books?

395
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,511
Have you ever read any books?

396
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,512
Does <i>Sports Illustrated</i> count?

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,956
- Okay, that's a magazine.
- Oh, right.

398
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,997
- So try to remember these titles.
- Okay.

399
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,719
<i>- Blubber.
- Blubber.</i>

400
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,950
<i>Forever.</i>

401
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,156
<i>Forever.</i>

402
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,993
She loves that book.

403
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,440
If she loves it, I love it.

404
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,877
Good. So, I've given you
a number of topics to discuss with her...

405
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,158
guaranteed to break the ice.
Are you ready?

406
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,350
I got it all here in a nutshell.

407
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,315
Right. All right. See you later, man.

408
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,993
<i>Blubber. Forever.</i>

409
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,553
- Thanks, Ziggy, man.
- Another beer?

410
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,632
Yeah. Heavy on the root.

411
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,832
Hey, Keegan. What's up?

412
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,829
This kid doesn't know when to quit.

413
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,111
Hey, Jeffrey. I was thinking
of going digging for sea gophers.

414
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,318
I can do that. What's a sea gopher?

415
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,556
- I still haven't found anything.
- Keep digging.

416
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,437
I had a great time
horseback riding today, did you?

417
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,000
Are you okay?

418
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
So, when are we gonna start talking
about books?

419
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,472
What? Oh, well,
we can talk about books anytime.

420
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,040
I love books.

421
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,639
So, tell me, Madison, do you like to read?

422
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,750
Well, yeah. That's usually what I do
with books, read them.

423
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,513
I love Judy Blume.

424
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,151
Oh, really? Oh, she's my favorite.
What have you read by her?

425
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,600
<i>Flubber.</i>

426
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,796
<i>"Flubber."</i>

427
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,554
Was that wrong?

428
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,236
Yeah, but only by one letter.

429
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,757
The title is <i>Blubber.</i>

430
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,158
It's a great book.
You read <i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

431
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,798
Hi. What are you up to?

432
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,432
- Working.
- Can I help?

433
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,876
Sure.

434
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,716
This is where it all happens.

435
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,715
This is where I come every day.
This is what I do.

436
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,917
- Here, put on these gloves.
- No.

437
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,834
Come on, just put them on.
You're gonna help me out.

438
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,230
Is this a test of my affection?

439
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,472
No. You haven't seen anything yet.

440
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,519
You want to try?

441
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,000
Smoothie.

442
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,960
See, the consistency isn't that bad.

443
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,151
I figure after all that fish guts you'd like
to do something a little more fun.

444
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,199
So, you're not only the chef,
but you're the waiter.

445
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,714
Something like that.

446
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,713
Just think, you could've been forced
to listen to Brianna...

447
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,315
tell you about
her Parisian shopping spree...

448
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,359
as you rub her down
with imported tanning oil.

449
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,636
Hey, that doesn't sound half bad.

450
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,791
- Hey.
- I'm kidding. Come on.

451
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,791
- So, how did it go with Madison?
- I think it went really great.

452
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,271
Except, I found out something about me
I really didn't know.

453
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,353
- Yeah, what's that?
- My memory sucks.

454
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,154
So, what do you have planned after lunch?

455
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,356
First, we'll probably hit the beach.
And then we'll check out another beach.

456
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,759
- Then, we'll have smoothies.
- We can't forget smoothies.

457
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,672
Light and nourishing.

458
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,400
Good plan. What about after smoothies?

459
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,435
Well, we'll probably hit the beach.

460
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,634
What about you?

461
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,032
I'm going with Keegan.
We're hunting sea gophers.

462
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,353
Sounds fun. I'm going into town.
You girls want to come?

463
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,998
- Town?
- What's in town?

464
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,440
Shopping.

465
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,754
"Shopping." What a beautiful word.

466
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,832
Mom, you're inspired.

467
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,159
That's not fair.

468
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,197
But, you can come with us if you want.

469
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,557
We know how you love shopping
with us. You can hold our bags.

470
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,111
You can stand and watch us
try things on for hours...

471
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,272
- On second thought, I'll stay here.
- Wouldn't that be redundant...

472
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,037
Maybe I'll dive into the shark tank
to avoid shopping. How's that?

473
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,193
- What do you think of this? It's cute, right?
- For Dad, yeah.

474
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,273
- What about this? Scary, right?
- Is that real?

475
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,397
No. It's illegal to sell the real stuff.

476
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,793
They're considered national treasures.
All the native artifacts here are replicas.

477
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,118
So, what did you get?

478
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,717
I've been crunching some numbers here.

479
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,759
And I think if we acquire that
German manufacturing company...

480
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,115
we're gonna...

481
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,272
- Are we talking business?
- It just slipped out.

482
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,355
You know what your problem is?
You don't know how to have fun.

483
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,560
Follow me.

484
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,035
I won!

485
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,236
So, how is the vacation going?

486
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,631
I'm having the best time with Jordan.
He's so cute.

487
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,110
I mean, first I got a hickey from a stingray.

488
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,759
And then I got to gut a fish.

489
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,560
Fish gutting. That does sound like fun.

490
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,794
I'm having an awful time with Scott.
I mean, I feel like we have a connection.

491
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,349
It's just, he gets so tongue-tied.

492
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,794
You know what your problem is? You
want to have your cake and eat it, too.

493
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,389
Alex, you know that makes no sense.

494
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,200
I mean, I have some cake, and then I eat it.

495
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,273
- You're trying to tell me I can't do that?
- It's just a saying.

496
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,000
Everyone knows you can't
have your cake and eat it, too.

497
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,514
Sure you can.

498
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,237
Okay. Why are you saying you can?
You can't. Everyone knows you can't.

499
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,313
I'm saying I can,
because everybody gets it wrong.

500
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,076
What you mean to say is,
"You can't eat your cake and have it, too."

501
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,152
Now that, you can't have.

502
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,319
I never thought of it like that. Good point.

503
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,917
"You can't eat your cake and
have it, too." Except...

504
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,356
What do you mean "except"?
There is no "except."

505
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,114
Okay. Just hear me out for a sec, okay?

506
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,193
If I eat my cake, it's in my stomach, right?

507
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,671
Unless it's on your blouse. Yes.

508
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,037
And if it's in my stomach,
isn't that the same as having it?

509
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,077
In a manner of speaking.

510
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,195
I want to talk to you more about this later.
But, right now...

511
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,753
What's Jordan doing here?

512
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,719
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him when you see him?

513
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,952
- Why don't I ask him now?
- Everything all right?

514
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,193
Yeah, Mom, everything's fine.

515
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,115
All right then, drink up.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

516
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,477
- So, what's the rush?
- I got something important to talk about.

517
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,632
- Important is good.
- Yeah. Okay. Sit right here.

518
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,520
So, what's up?

519
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,070
"The soul selects her own society

520
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,958
"Then shuts the door

521
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,318
"On her divine majority

522
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,837
"Obtrude no more"

523
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,234
Emily Dickinson. She's my favorite.

524
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,834
Mine, too.

525
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,751
So, do you like astronomy?

526
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,196
- I love astronomy.
- Me, too.

527
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,832
So, what's your sign?

528
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,719
That's astrology.

529
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,750
Yeah.

530
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,871
I have to go to the bathroom.

531
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,030
Right.

532
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,639
You going to sleep?

533
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,756
No, just thinking.
I don't know what to do about Scott.

534
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,358
I mean, I like him a lot,
but every time we're together...

535
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,909
it's just so awkward.

536
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,879
Well, why don't you come
with Jordan and me.

537
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,993
- Why? What's up?
- Everything.

538
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,317
You know what? Why don't you go
catch the elevator and I'll be right there.

539
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,873
- Hey.
- Busy right now?

540
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,030
No.

541
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,316
Okay, good. We're gonna go
get a little wet and wild.

542
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,391
Yes, Security, this is Brianna Wallace...

543
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,676
calling from Room 107
in the Royal Towers.

544
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,399
I'm trying to get some sleep...

545
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,120
and there's some deafening noise
coming from the pool area.

546
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,876
Be a love and do something about it,
would you? Thank you.

547
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,276
Okay, everybody, get out of the pool now!
Out! Out of the pool.

548
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,396
- Dude.
- What?

549
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,597
- Out! Get out!
- I work here, man...

550
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,273
Out! Get out of the pool.

551
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,149
Hey, call Miss Wallace and tell her we
found the source of the excessive noise.

552
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,754
- Who?
- Brianna.

553
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,714
Okay. 'Bye.

554
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,990
Jordan Landers, you can go.

555
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,750
I can?

556
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,358
Miss Wallace doesn't want
to press any charges.

557
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,997
What about my friends?

558
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,759
- Man, she didn't say anything about them.
- Then I'm staying, too.

559
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,838
- Out.
- Jordan, just go.

560
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,433
Terry, old buddy.

561
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,919
What do you say? Can you hook us up
and look the other way?

562
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,753
- Sure.
- Very nice.

563
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,833
I take that back.

564
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,075
- But, Dad, we can explain.
- No. No, you can't.

565
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,119
Good night, girls.

566
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,190
That's weird.

567
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,194
We didn't get the usual 8:30 a.m.
wakeup call from Mom and Dad.

568
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,237
Hey. Personal wakeup call.

569
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,480
- Hey.
- Hi.

570
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,996
I guess you didn't see this.
I got the same one.

571
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,310
"Went to have fun. Love, Mom and Dad."
Where are they?

572
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,390
- I don't know. They're not in their room.
- What's the deal?

573
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,512
Mom and Dad ditched us.

574
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,080
Excuse me, but are parents supposed
to be having this much fun?

575
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,757
They've completely lost it.

576
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,275
Come on.

577
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,753
- Hey!
- Hey. How're you guys doing?

578
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,990
Good, I guess.

579
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,311
We didn't hear from you guys
this morning.

580
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,359
- We wanted to get an early start.
- Snorkeling in 10 minutes.

581
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,476
Got to go.

582
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,440
- Can you girls get lunch on your own?
- You, too. Right, Griffen?

583
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,274
- Sure.
- Yeah.

584
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,155
Are they trying to get back at us?

585
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,277
Our parents ditched us.

586
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,235
Hey, Griffen, wait up.

587
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,916
What's up, man, you got a hot date
and need my coaching skills?

588
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,112
Not yet. But I got a volleyball game
and Madison wants me...

589
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,750
to meet Flipper, and I hate fish.
Will you cover for me?

590
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,559
- No problem.
- Sweet.

591
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,630
All I ask is,
I got my three friends over there.

592
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,872
All I want is just four Sea-Doos
and that's cool.

593
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,837
- All right, $40 for all of us.
- How did you pull that off?

594
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,151
I told you, I got connections.

595
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,949
Which is why I have to ask you.

596
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,880
What were you doing in town yesterday?

597
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,474
You were there?

598
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,270
We were shopping and
we saw you, talking to him.

599
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,590
Oh, Champlaine?

600
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,070
I was just delivering him a package,
doing him a favor.

601
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,117
Now he's doing us a solid back.

602
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,398
Okay. Let's go.

603
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,880
- Best kiwi smoothies in the tropics.
- This place is off the hook.

604
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,196
This place is off the hook.

605
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,789
- Hey, Alex, you want to dance?
- Sure.

606
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,395
Hey, Jordan. Do you want to dance?

607
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,157
Yeah, with Alex.

608
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,280
Oh, my God. Our parents are here.

609
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,674
- It's okay.
- Okay.

610
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,595
Just, they're like the sun. Just don't look
directly at them and we'll be okay.

611
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,036
So, playing the ignoring card
is very strong.

612
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,079
- We're ignoring.
- And we're ignoring some more.

613
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,598
And we're taking a sip of our drink.
I do not acknowledge their presence.

614
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,030
- Anybody else feel out of place?
- What'd you say, sonny?

615
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,798
- Stay right here.
- Okay.

616
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,760
Honey, I've had enough crowds,
enough kids and not enough of you.

617
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,718
Can we please go?

618
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,480
Oh, absolutely.

619
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,836
- Hey.
- Hi.

620
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,832
- You want to dance?
- Sure.

621
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,840
Has anyone seen Jordan?
I was just dancing with him.

622
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,151
At least I thought
I was just dancing with him.

623
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,677
<i>I'd like to dedicate this song to Alex.</i>

624
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,551
So, how did you get away from your folks?

625
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,678
I didn't. I'm in my room watching the WB.

626
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,312
Has anyone ever told you
that you're incredible?

627
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,720
Not today.

628
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,190
Has anyone ever told you that...

629
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,637
I am going to kiss you?

630
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,711
Thanks for covering for me
with Madison and the dolphins.

631
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,029
No problem, man.

632
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,794
She wants to meet me
at the cove in an hour.

633
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,113
- Oh, no, not again. No more plans.
- No, dude. But this is foolproof.

634
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,793
See? You're not the only one
with good ideas around here. Walkies.

635
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,633
Okay, but you have to do
exactly as I tell you.

636
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,313
Totally. Yeah.

637
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,594
All right.

638
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,114
Thank you.

639
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,596
- Don't let her sit there.
- No.

640
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,440
What's wrong?

641
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,556
Tell her:

642
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,917
<i>"I wanted you to have
a better view of the aquarium."</i>

643
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,792
I wanted you to have the
better view of the aquarium.

644
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,473
You're so sweet.

645
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,275
I know.

646
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,718
<i>Okay. Tell her,
"I read a really great book the other day."</i>

647
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,316
So, I read a really great book
the other day.

648
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,792
Really? What's it called?

649
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,040
The jerk chicken.

650
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,474
<i>The Jerk Chicken.</i>

651
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,478
<i>Never heard of that.</i>

652
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,279
What's it about?

653
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,239
It's a mystery.

654
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,875
It's a series, actually. <i>The Jerk Chicken...</i>

655
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,915
<i>The Fried Sparrow,</i> you know,
<i>The Cooked Goose.</i>

656
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,632
You're kidding, right?

657
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,429
<i>I mean, a mystery series about...</i>

658
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,116
different ways to cook a bird?

659
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,711
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah.

660
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,473
<i>Okay. Scott, relax. We're cool.</i>

661
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,038
Tell her, "I couldn't sleep...

662
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,875
"as the mere thought of spending
the day with you made me...

663
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,519
<i>"twitch in anticipation."</i>

664
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,753
I didn't sleep. I mean, the mere thought
of spending the day with you...

665
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,911
made me itch in anticipation.

666
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,595
- Not "itch," you idiot!
- Not "itch," you idiot!

667
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,399
- What?
- "Twitch."

668
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,119
"Twitch."

669
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,032
You are so out of it.

670
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,512
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

671
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,200
You know what, Scott, I don't know...

672
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,877
what your problem is, but I think,
it's time for me to go to the bathroom.

673
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,278
Scott told me everything.

674
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,352
I don't know what you're talking about.

675
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,797
I'm straight up with you,
you be straight up with me.

676
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,592
- Okay?
- Okay, you got me.

677
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,556
You are amazing, but this is my bad.

678
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,794
I asked you to encourage him.
I didn't expect you to be him.

679
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,760
I guess I got a little carried away.

680
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,232
But, all I wanted to do
was make you happy.

681
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,398
- You did.
- I did?

682
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,830
How do you know so much about me?

683
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,079
I guess we have known each other
for a long time.

684
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,800
True. But that goes both ways, and...

685
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,990
I don't know that much about you.

686
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,156
Everybody's got a hobby, right?

687
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,480
You're mine.

688
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,274
Judy Blume?

689
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,671
Let's just say I've had a crush on you
a long time.

690
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,319
Did you know Antares is in the
southern sky all night this summer?

691
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,477
Really? That's fantastic.

692
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,712
It's the second largest red giant
in the galaxy.

693
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,116
Second largest? No.
I'm pretty sure it's the largest.

694
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,638
I think you're right.

695
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,590
Running up Dad's room service tab alone
just doesn't quite carry the same allure.

696
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,910
I miss Mom and Dad telling us what to do.

697
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,232
We deserve this. I mean,
we brushed them off this whole trip.

698
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,233
And now look at us.
We're going out and they don't even care.

699
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,358
We made our bed and
now we have to sleep in it.

700
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,398
We made our bed and
now we have to sleep in it.

701
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,234
If we made our bed,
why do we want to sleep in it?

702
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,676
Do you make your bed
and then want to sleep in it?

703
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,194
- No.
- Exactly.

704
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,038
When I make my bed, I'm up for the day.
What about you?

705
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,750
- I'm ready for breakfast.
- I'm ready to go shopping, to the beach...

706
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,992
I'm ready to do anything but sleep
in that just-made bed.

707
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,992
Okay, you have a point.

708
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,036
Let's say, I make my bed and go out,
do a little shopping...

709
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,397
but in the middle of the day,
I want to take a little nap.

710
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,075
So I come home. Can I sleep in it?

711
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,910
Yes.

712
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,960
But would you fold it down
before you went to sleep?

713
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,599
I wouldn't sleep on top of it.

714
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,479
Then technically,
the bed would be unmade.

715
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,994
All right.

716
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,551
- Okay. Fine. You win.
- Yes!

717
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,920
You're amazing. I can't wait to see how
the island looks from offshore at night.

718
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,279
- It's our first moonlight cruise.
- But first, we got to make one little stop.

719
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,750
Champlaine wants me
to pick something up for him.

720
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,035
Okay.

721
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,800
Wow! This is amazing.

722
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,835
- Very nice.
- Have you ever seen such a...

723
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,070
Never.

724
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,993
Anybody notice anything weird
about this boat?

725
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,560
- You know what it's missing?
- A party?

726
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,394
No. People.

727
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,591
You're right. It's deserted.

728
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,313
Why don't you guys hang out here
for a little bit and I'll be right back, okay?

729
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,880
Let's explore.

730
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,271
I wonder what this is for.

731
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,556
Hey!

732
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,470
Sorry.

733
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,916
- I wonder who owns this tub?
- Some rich guy.

734
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,913
I thought you were here to pick up
something, not go fishing.

735
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,438
This is it. He's probably stuck in the casino
and needs his rig in the morning. Let's go.

736
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,110
Okay.

737
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,439
Hey, you guys,
there's this really cool little island...

738
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,274
It's a little private island
I want to take you guys to.

739
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,114
This is my favorite time of the evening.

740
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,952
It's gorgeous out here.

741
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,598
- Watch your step.
- Be careful.

742
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,074
I'm sorry.

743
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,991
- You okay? You need help?
- Are you okay?

744
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,719
- That was great.
- That was cool.

745
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,234
That was so much fun.

746
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,677
Before we do anything else,
I just have to drop this off for Champlaine.

747
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,876
Okay.

748
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,076
You will all stand perfectly still.

749
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,719
- What?
- What?

750
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,079
Wait a minute! This doesn't belong to you.
What are you doing?

751
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,994
Quite correct.
It belongs to the people of the Bahamas.

752
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,231
- What?
- And you're all under arrest.

753
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,515
- What?
- Jordan?

754
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,557
- For smuggling antiquities.
- For what?

755
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,676
Antiquities?

756
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,356
These are national treasures
that must not leave this country.

757
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,636
- Take them away. Let's go.
- Wait a second.

758
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,757
- We didn't do anything.
- All of you.

759
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,719
- Come on! What is this?
- I want my stuff back, man.

760
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,480
We're sitting here in jail
and it's all your fault.

761
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,553
- I swear I didn't know what was going on.
- You set us up.

762
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,917
Lay off. If he says he didn't know,
he didn't know.

763
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,753
Alex, do you realize where we are?
This isn't detention. It's jail.

764
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,593
In a foreign country.

765
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,832
It's not American Express,
it's <i>Midnight Express.</i>

766
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,680
And you're expecting us to believe him?

767
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,356
Yeah.

768
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,880
Excuse me.

769
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,911
Thank you for your understanding, Officer.

770
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,994
We're satisfied the children
had no prior knowledge of the crime.

771
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,150
But you should learn
to choose your companions better.

772
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,994
We do and that's why
we know Jordan isn't guilty.

773
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,833
At least we hope so.

774
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,073
Well, good day.

775
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,953
We need to have a meeting.

776
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,360
You better believe it.

777
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,353
But don't you see, they're blaming Jordan
and it wasn't his fault.

778
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,511
Alex, honey, he was caught red-handed.

779
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,353
He didn't know what was in the box.

780
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,558
We told the police we went to this
humungous yacht in the bay.

781
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,915
They didn't want to listen.

782
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,074
Why aren't they looking there instead
of blaming this whole thing on Jordan?

783
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,633
Okay. Where was this yacht?

784
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,634
But it was right here last night.
We were on it.

785
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,871
- Champlaine, the white-haired guy.
- Right!

786
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,920
We know who will clear up all of this.
Jordan did a favor for him last night.

787
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,276
He owns the Sea-Doo Shack on the beach.

788
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,960
All right.

789
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,675
Where to?

790
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,272
The shack was right here.

791
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,990
Champlaine must be behind this.
He's the one who should be in jail.

792
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,676
We trust you. You're good girls.
We let you run around on your own.

793
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,671
But we just bailed you out of jail and...

794
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,434
that's not a typical vacation activity.

795
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,195
So, for the duration
you're gonna be sticking with us.

796
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,920
- But, Dad, can we...
- No, there's no discussion.

797
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,551
So, let's order our lunches
and just have fun together.

798
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,679
I can't believe it.
We just got turned into leash babies.

799
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,400
How are we gonna clear Jordan
if we're stuck with our parents?

800
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,039
So you believe that Jordan didn't do it?

801
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,591
The graffiti is on the wall.
This is a major cover-up.

802
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,240
We have to find Champlaine
and that yacht.

803
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,191
What about the folks?
They'll be watching everything we do.

804
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,351
If we always know
where our parents are...

805
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,911
we'll never miss an opportunity to escape.
Let's do it!

806
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,275
You got transpo all set?

807
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,430
Right out front.

808
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,273
Okay, there can't be any slip-ups.

809
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,556
It's not rocket science, bro.

810
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,200
All right, you know what to do.

811
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,832
<i>Quit it! Hey, Alex, stop!</i>

812
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,514
What's wrong?

813
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,831
I think it might be time to go home.

814
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,154
Well, you can't just get over
something that upsets you.

815
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,357
- You have to work through it.
- Jill?

816
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,715
Do me a favor and take off your lab coat.

817
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,560
I need a mother right now, not a shrink.

818
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,550
Sure.

819
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,558
It's about the girls.

820
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,999
It's just they're 15,
and after last night my head says:

821
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,231
"Pull in the reins." You know?

822
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,475
But then I look at them,
they're growing up so fast.

823
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,876
My heart says, "Let them go."

824
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,514
I know I need to be
in the middle somewhere...

825
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,670
I just...

826
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,229
I don't know exactly where that is.

827
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,559
You've been there.

828
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,758
Griffen is 16.
I know you've thought about this.

829
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,351
Only every day of my life.

830
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,953
Good. Then I'm not crazy.

831
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,069
Well, if you are, then we all are.

832
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,834
- Well, they seem to be doing good now.
- Yeah.

833
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,474
<i>Griffen, stop!</i>

834
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,550
<i>Don't splash!</i>

835
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,276
He's not here. Let's go.

836
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,998
Have you seen this white-haired guy?

837
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,912
He runs the Wave Runners Shack.

838
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,276
I saw a guy at the straw market.

839
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,113
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

840
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,556
There he is.

841
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,109
- There he is.
- Let's go after him. Come on!

842
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,670
Let's go. I think he went to the right.

843
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,274
Come on, he's over there!

844
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,953
- There he is!
- I see him.

845
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,759
- Upstairs!
- Come on.

846
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,355
Where is he?

847
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,760
Over there, to the right.

848
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,797
Get after him. Let's go!

849
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,680
- Come on!
- Where'd he go?

850
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,955
Come on! There he is!

851
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,633
Where'd he go?

852
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,798
- All right, let's go. I see him.
- Oh, there he is.

853
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,231
He's down there. Faster!

854
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,159
- We're gonna lose him.
- This way. Come on!

855
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,031
- Over here!
- He went inside.

856
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,518
- No, this way! Come on!
- There he is! I see him!

857
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,110
Yes?

858
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,710
Oh. Sorry. Let's go!

859
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,200
There he goes.

860
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,151
- Run faster!
- This way. Over here!

861
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,113
- There he is! Come on!
- Let's go!

862
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,711
Come on guys! I see him.

863
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,473
Get out of our way!

864
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,840
Watch out!

865
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,074
Let's go!

866
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,640
Where'd he go?

867
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,150
- There he is!
- Faster!

868
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,560
Catch him!

869
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,394
He went to the left.

870
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,154
We lost him!

871
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,200
Let's go.

872
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,436
<i>Come on.</i>

873
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,952
Come on, you guys. Yeah.

874
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,674
Don't splash!

875
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,195
- Mom. Dad. Is it time for lunch?
- Good idea.

876
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,876
Why don't you kids dry off
and we'll meet in the restaurant in, say...

877
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,872
- five minutes?
- Okay.

878
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,919
And, girls, that's five minutes, okay?

879
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,835
- All right, Dad.
- Hear you, Dad. Okay.

880
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,640
- You know, lay down the rules.
- They'll be there. Relax.

881
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,549
The guy on the boat is filthy rich.
He can't be doing it for the money.

882
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,438
So he must be a collector.

883
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,836
So, if there's one antiquity,
there'll be more.

884
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,435
And that's all we need
to get Jordan out of the slammer.

885
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,239
We've gotta find the boat.

886
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,359
I'm gonna have some conch salad.

887
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,796
I know I've had it two days in a row.
I love it.

888
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,954
They, like, jump off the side,
get conch, and bring it right up fresh.

889
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,360
Yum!

890
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,360
Where's Keegan?

891
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,638
There's a <i>Teletubbies</i> marathon
on channel six.

892
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,914
<i>Teletubbies?</i> Isn't that a bit juvenile?

893
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,231
She says it reminds her of her youth.

894
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,034
Are you okay?

895
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,278
I think I swallowed too much water.
I don't feel so well.

896
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,319
- Do you want to go to the ladies' room?
- Do you mind?

897
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,273
We'll be right back.

898
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,716
Why don't you go to the gift shop
and see...

899
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,031
if they have any Pepto-Bismol.

900
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,198
Sure. Good idea.

901
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,998
That's really sweet, don't you think?
They're working together as a team.

902
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,591
I'm just glad to see they've all
become such good friends.

903
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,116
Come on, guys, we have to go.

904
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,277
Wow. What was that for?

905
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,955
Just in case I don't get another chance.

906
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,469
Come on.

907
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,676
Maybe we should check
with the harbor master.

908
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,150
No. He'll ask too many questions.

909
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,719
Let's keep looking.

910
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,272
Look, this one has a dark hull
like the other one.

911
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,558
No, it just looks the same.
See, it's got a different name.

912
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,712
The boat we boarded was
the <i>Saxson Explorer.</i> This is <i>Shalimar.</i>

913
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,473
It's got a different color flag.

914
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,870
I guess they must make
a bunch of these giant yachts.

915
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,158
No, I'm telling you, this is the yacht.
There's only one way to find out.

916
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,280
Check this out.

917
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,231
I told you it was the same boat.

918
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,272
Let's go. She's right.

919
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,231
That was the best meal yet.

920
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,399
- Great, right?
- Thanks.

921
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,837
Hi. Sorry it took so long.

922
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,800
- I was in the bathroom and it just...
- Alex, spare us the gory details.

923
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,197
But you're feeling better, right?

924
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,590
- Not really.
- No?

925
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,519
Why don't you just go upstairs
and rest for a bit.

926
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,035
- Maybe you got a little too much sun.
- Okay, Dad.

927
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,679
- I'm gonna go with her.
- Okay.

928
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,275
- All right, take care of your sister.
- 'Bye.

929
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,873
Do you believe them?

930
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,236
No.

931
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,356
No.

932
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,920
No? Wait a minute.

933
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,118
After all that's happened,
you still trust them?

934
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,914
Yeah, I do.

935
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,279
What do you mean you can't go?

936
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,990
We just told you this is the same yacht
where we picked up the tackle box.

937
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,757
The yacht belongs to Mark Saxson,
a very powerful man in these waters.

938
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,080
We have search and seizure laws
in this country just like in yours.

939
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,035
Without hard evidence
we cannot board without a reason.

940
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,318
I'll give you a good reason.
It's filled with smuggled antiquities.

941
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,869
You saw these antiquities yourself?

942
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,440
Well, no, not exactly...

943
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,480
I'm sorry.
Without hard evidence my hands are tied.

944
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,394
The police won't board this ship
without a good reason.

945
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,756
So, we'll give them a good reason.

946
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,834
- You have a plan?
- The mother of all plans.

947
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,719
How's it going?

948
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,911
It's okay so far.

949
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,115
- Did you guys see anything?
- No.

950
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,519
- Are we being followed yet?
- I don't know. Do you guys see anything?

951
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,196
Check the rear. I think we've got company.

952
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,194
Let them catch us. They'll come aboard,
they'll find the evidence and...

953
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,275
- What evidence?
- Exactly. If they come aboard...

954
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,717
and we don't have any evidence
they'll bust us for borrowing this tub.

955
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,111
<i>Attention,</i> Shalimar, <i>cut
your engines immediately.</i>

956
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,354
<i>Attention,</i> Shalimar, <i>cut your engines
or we will be forced to take action.</i>

957
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,000
- Okay, let's go. We'll be downstairs.
- Hurry.

958
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,117
Hurry. I can't outrun them.

959
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,118
They're gaining on us!

960
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,317
Sorry, girls, the party's over.

961
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,632
<i>Attention,</i> Shalimar, <i>cut your engines
immediately.</i>

962
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,515
Oh, my God. He's stopped the boat.

963
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,154
You want evidence?

964
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,833
We got evidence.

965
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,358
You should be very proud.

966
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,239
Your daughters and their friends,
they're heroes.

967
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,398
Dad, we were wondering if next year...

968
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,870
What?

969
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,477
Well, I guess this won't be
the last family vacation.

970
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,150
Mary-Kate, there was a rewrite.

971
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,676
- Can I have a script, please?
- Here you go.

972
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,912
- Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
- Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

973
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,798
Sorry, everyone.

974
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,034
Everybody settle, please.
Let's go, Mary-Kate. And, action!

975
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,431
We hope next year's trip is as
good as the last family vacation.

976
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,960
And that's a cut. Very nice.
Check the camera.

977
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,439
Thanks, everyone.

978
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,237
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

979
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,557
- Hi, Megan.
- Oh, hi.

980
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,155
- It was great, wasn't it? You were good.
- Thanks.

981
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,835
- It was kind of a stretch for me.
- No, you were good.

982
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,799
- You did a great job.
- Hi, Chris? It's Jamie.

983
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,315
You've been my agent for what,
10 or 11 years now?

984
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,800
And I've never complained once.

985
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,031
- That's great. You live in the Valley?
- Yeah.

986
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,589
We should go out some time.
My number's on the call sheet.

987
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,034
- Okay.
- It was great meeting you.

988
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,760
It was a lot of fun making this movie.
It was very cute.

989
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,399
It's pretty cool, actually.

990
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,473
But see, it's 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley.

991
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,115
Props, do you want
these glasses and rings?

992
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,035
I mean, let's face it. They, produced it,
starred in it, they cast it.

993
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,955
- They hired the director and the writers.
- Nice working with you, sweetie.

994
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,920
And who got all the close-ups? Not me.
Who got all the great wardrobe?

995
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,277
Not me. Who got all the juicy scenes?
Not me.

996
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,876
I got a paper. I got a watch. I got glasses.
The paper's from last Friday.

997
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,270
Who were asked for autographs
for hours a day...

998
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,080
while people just completely ignored me?
Not me!

999
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,514
'Bye, Chris.

1000
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,316
'Bye.

1001
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,394
- Hey, where's Cliff?
- He went straight to the airport.

1002
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,917
- He wanted to get back to his family.
- Seven come 11. Here we go.

1003
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,196
We only have a few minutes
to get to the airport.

1004
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,956
Would you relax? I'm making money here.
Here we go. Come on now, guys.

1005
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,271
Working with you guys is so much fun.

1006
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,194
I really hope we get to shoot
another picture together.

1007
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,999
- Great.
- Thank you.

1008
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,193
- We have to get rid of him.
- Why? He was so nice.

1009
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,476
I know, but the director
was furious with him.

1010
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,279
He missed at least a dozen shots.

1011
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,149
Big question now is,
where are we gonna shoot our next film?

1012
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,269
The map.

1013
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,758
London, Paris, Sydney, the Bahamas.
Now where can we go?

1014
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,355
Some place that we love.
Some place that the audience will love.

1015
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:12,038
Wait a minute.
You always get to pick the location.

1016
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,070
In fact, you always get to pick the
stories, the cast, and the crew, too.

1017
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,478
This time, I'm putting my foot down.
It's my turn.

1018
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,157
- Do not take this responsibility lightly.
- I will cherish this moment forever.

1019
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,840
Don't tell me you're down for hanging
with Keegan, the bratty daughter...

1020
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,596
And Chad and Jill and
their bratty daughter Keegan...

1021
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,399
and their nerdy son, Griffen.

1022
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,678
Your daughters and their friends,
they're, they are...

1023
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,275
Just a typical string of...
Can we start over again?

1024
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,070
- I never liked you.
- So, when should I start my line?

1025
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,516
- I think, you can go ahead and start.
- Right now?

1026
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,478
- Yeah.
- What's my line?

1027
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,640
What is it?

1028
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,955
Good day. Sorry. Good day.

1029
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,552
So, what kind of fish is this?

1030
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,438
This is a spotted...

1031
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,074
- I'm on it.
- How late does that make them, Judy?

1032
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,389
Tight.

1033
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,398
If we were at home,
it would have been 45 minutes.

1034
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,914
I would've...

1035
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,390
So tell me, Mary-Kate, I mean...

1036
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,914
So tell me, Mary-Kate... Madison!

1037
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,752
But don't you see it?

1038
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,520
I'm sorry.

1039
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,310
I'm sorry.
