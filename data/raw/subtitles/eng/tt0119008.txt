1
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,025
You're not saying things
that mean anything.

2
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,239
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

3
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,707
Ain't no way you can say to me
a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.

4
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,841
- A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile.
- Forget about it.

5
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:39,748
A Cadillac's got more acceleration.
It's got more power.

6
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,285
It's got better handling.

7
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,823
It's got more legroom for your legs.
It's got more power.

8
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,152
- You just said that.
- Bingo.

9
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,749
- What?
- You just said, "More power. "

10
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,589
- You're starting to repeat yourself.
- I said that?

11
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,425
- You're getting senile.
- He got me so fucking aggravated.

12
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll tell you one thing,
Mercedes got it all over both of them.

13
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,257
A Mercedes?

14
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,338
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking
water bed, for Christ's sakes.

15
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,737
- A Mercedes.
- Yeah. It's a good car.

16
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,683
I'll tell you one thing, my friend.
Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.

17
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:16,046
It's longer? Longer like what?
Longer like my dick is longer?

18
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,986
No, no, no. We're not talking about
a Volkswagen.

19
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,819
What do you mean? Yeah, Volkswagen.

20
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,861
Longer. Like longer.
Like in inches it's longer.

21
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,520
- You don't make no fucking sense.
- It's a longer car.

22
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,190
Two fucking cars, right?
This is a car, this is a car, right?

23
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,324
Right here, okay?

24
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,564
All things being equal,
the one's longer gonna get there first.

25
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,162
You don't have to be fucking Einstein
to understand this.

26
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,002
You know what happens
when you get there, don't you?

27
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,303
- No.
- You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.

28
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,847
I'll show you a fucking picture.
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.

29
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,246
That's a scientific fact. It's a longer car.

30
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,250
- Can I ask you guys something?
- What?

31
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,344
Are you guys, you know, wise guys?

32
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:53,056
Wise guys? What are wise guys?

33
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,959
- You know...
- What makes you think we're wise guys?

34
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,694
We could be cops.

35
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,499
Yeah.

36
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,934
- You believed me. Undercover what?
- No, I didn't.

37
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,502
- You believed me.
- No, it's just...

38
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,907
- Who's that over there?
- Who?

39
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,676
The guy by the bar with the mustache.

40
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,276
That's Don, Don the Jeweler.
Jilly brought him here.

41
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,216
What Jilly? Jilly "Four-eyes"?

42
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,256
Not that fucking hump Jilly "Four-eyes. "
Jilly, you know, from Queens.

43
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,383
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.

44
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,292
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off,
he could lay it off for me?

45
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,401
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

46
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,527
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

47
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,698
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay it off. That's all.

48
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:46,437
All that fucking money you owe downtown,
you'd have to lay off a fucking Brink's truck.

49
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,247
- Sonny's in love.
- I think fucking Lefty's in love.

50
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,011
I'll see you.

51
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,752
Were you asleep?

52
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,124
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

53
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,665
Go back to sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.

54
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,766
That's good, babe.

55
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,129
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go back to sleep.
I'm so tired.

56
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,798
- All right.
- All right.

57
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,808
- Hey.
- Yeah.

58
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,068
What?

59
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,142
Put the phone on your pillow.

60
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,378
I want to listen to you breathe.

61
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,040
You Don the Jeweler?

62
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,639
There. That's some beautiful thing.

63
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,085
Why don't you give it to your wife?

64
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,627
My wife? How am I gonna give it to my wife?

65
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,856
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?

66
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,329
- Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.

67
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,670
Hey, you for real?

68
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,667
I'm asking you
to middle a diamond for me here.

69
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,074
- All I want from my end is $8,000.
- And I'm saying to you

70
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,476
is you should give it to somebody that
don't know better, because that's a fugazy.

71
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,915
All right?

72
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,116
That's a fugazy?
How do you know it's a fugazy?

73
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:14,351
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- What? It's a fake.

74
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,492
I know what a fugazy is.

75
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,160
Hey, pal, you want to see something?

76
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,601
I'm gonna show you something.

77
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,905
There you go. Ain't that something?
That's a beautiful thing.

78
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,867
Yeah, that is a beautiful thing,
but it's not my thing.

79
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,309
What about this?

80
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,477
What do you want me to say?
Go ahead, try and sell it,

81
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,778
you want to be a dumbsky. Give it a shot.

82
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,911
Dumbsky? You calling me a dumbsky?

83
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:44,945
You know who you're talking to, my friend?

84
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,218
Hey, Left. Come on, have a spritzer.

85
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,861
You want to go embarrass yourself
with this thing...

86
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,898
Embarrass myself? My family, my children...

87
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,093
My mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city

88
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,830
when she walks down the block, see?

89
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,237
In all the five boroughs, I'm known.
Forget about it.

90
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,341
I'm known all over the fucking world.

91
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,948
Anybody, ask anybody about Lefty
from Mulberry Street.

92
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,982
- You're pissing up the wrong fucking tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.

93
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,320
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going? Sit down there.

94
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,330
You're gonna walk out on me?

95
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,796
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

96
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,530
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

97
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,038
Let's go get your car. Come on.

98
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:39,837
Take care.

99
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,026
Put that window up.
I'm gonna catch a draft.

100
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,357
I'm getting fucking cancer over here.

101
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,661
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?

102
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,667
You a cop?
Don't ask so many fucking questions.

103
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,335
Well, well, I've got to school you,
my friend. I've got to school you.

104
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,634
What's the matter? You work for Jilly,
he never school you?

105
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,076
School me in what?

106
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,779
You don't talk until I talk to you.

107
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,455
Fugazy.

108
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,189
You call that ring a fugazy. You don't know
word fucking one, my friend.

109
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,524
I know. I look at you and I know.

110
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,792
You a guy
can't keep his fucking mouth shut.

111
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,431
Hey, I'm talking to you now.

112
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,698
Look, I've been in jewels five years.

113
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,898
How do you figure
I'm gonna earn the kind of money I do

114
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,804
if I can't tell a fucking zircon?

115
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,900
- There's good money in it?
- What?

116
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,472
What?

117
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,712
- What, jewels?
- Thank you.

118
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,345
Yeah. If you know what you're doing,
there is.

119
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,349
Let's go to 23rd and 8th. Then we'll find
out if you know what you're doing.

120
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,398
You owe me $8,000.

121
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,633
No, hold on. Wait. I gave you the diamond.

122
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,929
Left, who's this guy?

123
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,634
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?

124
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,845
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?

125
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,772
- Come on, you know.
- Don't you tell me what I know.

126
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:28,216
- You know what you did, pal.
- One of you has got to be wrong.

127
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,082
That's a Tiffany fucking diamond.

128
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,951
Left, that is my wife's
fucking diamond ring.

129
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,219
It's a fugazy, Left.

130
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,420
You took away your wife's ring?

131
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,054
Look, you bring that ring to any kike
on 47th Street,

132
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,928
he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

133
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,198
You took away your wife's ring
to go bet on the Giants?

134
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,707
Hey, look, you don't want it.
Give it back to me, okay?

135
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,175
- Hey, Left, come on...
- $8,000.

136
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,873
Let me talk to this fucking guy for a second.
Just give me half a second, would you?

137
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,382
$8,000.

138
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,385
Why don't you go to the bar
and have a drink?

139
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,012
Let me talk to the guy for a minute.
Come on.

140
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,622
Hey, I got a fucking
black belt, pal. So you...

141
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,853
Shit!

142
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,566
This guy is going to fucking kill you.
You understand what I'm saying?

143
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,799
We got about two minutes
to figure a way out of this thing.

144
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,809
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

145
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,436
- Sorry ain't gonna do it.
- I don't want to die.

146
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,946
Yeah?

147
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,244
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.

148
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,784
Give me the keys.

149
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,281
All right.

150
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,951
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.

151
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,029
Lefty's stuff. All right, good.

152
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,630
That's for the fucking drinks, pal.

153
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,577
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.

154
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,018
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.

155
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,245
All right.

156
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,322
You scared that guy, though.

157
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,024
That cracks me up.

158
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,557
I got 26 fucking hits under my belt,
and you're the one he's scared of. Fuck.

159
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,998
- Pull over.
- What?

160
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,464
Pull over. I've got to do something.

161
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,969
- Right here?
- Yeah. Right here, pull over.

162
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,561
All right. I'm cool.

163
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,100
Come on, give me a hand with this.
Pull this out, pull it.

164
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,409
- You're taking the whole fucking thing apart.
- You didn't hear nothing under the dash?

165
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,541
- No, I didn't hear a fucking thing.
- There it is.

166
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,977
I can go right up the back.

167
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,612
What the fuck are you doing down there?

168
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,124
- Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?

169
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,286
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

170
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,590
Did I say that? Did I say you got a wire?

171
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,666
Say it to my face, if you're gonna do this.

172
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,394
Nothing for nothing,
but I think you owe me an apology.

173
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,597
Ain't the question.
I lost a screwdriver here.

174
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,370
- You lost a what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.

175
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,103
Come on. You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?

176
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,145
You'll find it again. It's down there.

177
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,778
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.

178
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,716
Yeah. I got the Fleetwood Brougham.

179
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,654
- Is that right? With the velour?
- Forget about it.

180
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,254
- Are you married?
- No.

181
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,929
- I got a girl out there in California.
- That's good.

182
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,866
She should stay in California.

183
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,728
Keep your eye out for your balls.

184
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,631
- Yeah, you're right.
- I'm always right.

185
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,540
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.

186
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,643
All the way up the line, connected guy
to wise guy to skipper to boss.

187
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,315
- Yeah, I know that.
- You know?

188
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,250
- Yeah.
- What do you know?

189
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,323
It's kind of like the army,
like a chain of command.

190
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,417
The army? It ain't nothing like the army.

191
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,194
The army is some guy you don't know

192
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,756
sends you out to whack
some other guy you don't know. Army.

193
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,698
- You want to check in with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.

194
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,015
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.

195
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,385
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, so long.

196
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,624
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.

197
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,697
He keeps to himself. He's a jewel guy.

198
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,734
- Where's he from, Jilly?
- Florida.

199
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,328
- Florida.
- He's a jewel guy.

200
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,569
- But Florida where? The beach?
- No, not the beach.

201
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,208
I don't know.

202
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,510
Wherever the fuck
the Dodgers have spring training.

203
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,641
He's a stand-up guy?

204
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,687
I said I knew him, Left.
I didn't say I fucked him.

205
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,519
Hey, you. Come here!

206
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,787
Come here.

207
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,193
What do you say, Jilly? How you doing?

208
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,762
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me, capisce?

209
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,864
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that, Jilly.

210
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,637
Because if you do,
one of us is gonna whack you out.

211
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,211
That's not good.

212
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,611
All right, Jilly. Go back to your bath.

213
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,908
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.

214
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,086
When I introduce you, I'm gonna say,

215
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:13,128
"This is a friend of mine. "
That means you're a connected guy.

216
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:18,059
If I said instead, "This is a friend of ours,"
that would mean you're a made guy.

217
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,262
Capisce?

218
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,839
Yeah, "friend of mine. " "Friend of ours. "

219
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,171
- What do I call you? "Friend of ours," or...
- You keep your mouth shut about me.

220
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,404
Know what I'm saying? Hey, Don.

221
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,477
You got a couple of fazools?

222
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,444
- I got some things I got to take care of.
- Yeah.

223
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,144
What do you want? $100?

224
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,079
What are you doing?

225
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,556
A wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.

226
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,719
A wise guy carries money in a roll.
Like this. See?

227
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,627
Beaner on the outside. Like that. Come on.

228
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,097
That mustache.

229
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:54,431
You got to get rid of that mustache,
'cause that's against the rules.

230
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,667
And get a pair of pants, will you?
This ain't a fucking rodeo.

231
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,143
Dress like I dress. This is my family.

232
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,147
- More even than my own family.
- Is that right?

233
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,749
- I don't got a family.
- You don't got a family?

234
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,380
No, I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

235
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,452
Ain't the question,
even if you had a family.

236
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,559
If this is your family,
then this is your family.

237
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,689
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,962
I'm freezing my balls off.

239
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:28,197
What do we got to be standing outside
all day in the cold for?

240
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:31,332
- Got to show the flag.
- The flag of fucking Antarctica.

241
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,201
- What's going on?
- Hey, Lefty.

242
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,144
- Lefty, what do you say?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

243
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,408
How you doing?

244
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,984
The good news is
my dick is now a popsicle.

245
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,357
- Hi, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

246
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:49,821
Sonny Red.

247
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,930
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

248
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,760
Just stand there and look dangerous, friend.

249
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,896
He does look dangerous, don't he?

250
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,601
You gonna make this week's vig? I hope so.

251
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,670
'Cause I don't want to have to come
looking for you. You hear me?

252
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,883
- Come on, Bruno.
- I just shit in my pants, right?

253
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,123
It's the boss, Donnie.

254
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,027
Okay, Joe,
the Bureau wants your autograph.

255
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,461
- What's that, you want me to sign it?
- Forget about it.

256
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:01,827
"Forget about it" is right.

257
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:06,165
Listen, by the way, they want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.

258
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,705
How did they even know
about the mustache?

259
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,639
- Did you rat me out?
- I didn't rat you out.

260
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,842
- Show and tell.
- Yeah. Nice.

261
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,618
- What?
- So does he. He wants me to shave.

262
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,450
- Who? Ruggiero?
- Yeah.

263
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,717
Regulations. Here.

264
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,757
You know something?

265
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,833
I got him. I got my hooks in the guy.

266
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,399
Cloaked by the high grasses
of the African Savannah,

267
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,941
the stalking cheetah moves stealthily
towards his prey.

268
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,817
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?

269
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,256
Yeah. I'm Donnie.

270
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,088
- Tommy. How are you?
- Good.

271
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,458
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.
- Thanks.

272
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,897
- Benny's watching TV. You met Tommy?
- Yes, we met. Thank you.

273
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,832
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.

274
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,495
Benny, Donnie's here.

275
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,973
Too late. The cheetah springs.

276
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,642
Benny loves animals.

277
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,807
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

278
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,314
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.

279
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,981
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.

280
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,025
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.

281
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:37,117
Yeah, wait a minute. Here.

282
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:48,304
I'm sorry, Left, but I'm in
a little bit of a rush here, you know? So...

283
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,031
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

284
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,973
That's really nice of you.

285
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,874
Wow. Look at this.

286
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,119
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.

287
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,985
- All right. So, happy holidays.
- Where you going?

288
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,459
- I thought you was an orphan.
- Yeah.

289
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,394
- So what are you gonna do?
- Left, I don't want to spoil your day.

290
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,691
Come on.

291
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,425
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.

292
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:18,502
Come on.

293
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,700
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?

294
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:25,672
All they know is manicotti. A
hundred years, they'll be eating manicotti.

295
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,972
- You never ate coq au vin?
- No.

296
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,047
There we are.

297
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,141
Can of collagen, can of tomatoes.

298
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,653
- Punch of salt.
- "Punch"?

299
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,624
- Punch. Punch of salt?
- "Punch" or "pinch"?

300
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,695
"Punch," not "pinch. "

301
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,492
- Did I say "pinch"?
- No, you said "punch. "

302
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,764
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense, Donnie.

303
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,965
- You got all this, Annette?
- I can't cook special like Benny.

304
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,167
Shut up, Annette. Forget about it.

305
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,776
Wherever you go, the best cooks are men.

306
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,974
On Mars, the best cooks are gonna be men.
That's a fact.

307
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,179
Wait till you taste this coq au vin.

308
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,456
It's gonna melt in your mouth,
like Holy Communion.

309
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:16,253
What the fuck is that? Annette, get that.

310
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,265
- Thank you.
- Sure.

311
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,268
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure, Benny.

312
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,167
She's a good woman, Annette.

313
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,900
One broad, that's enough for anyone.

314
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,571
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple of hours, okay?

315
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,275
Merry Christmas. Donnie, take care.

316
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,215
Yeah, you, too. Take it easy.

317
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,455
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?

318
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,518
What are you gonna do?

319
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,724
Give him a smack in the mouth
once in a while.

320
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,560
I got bruises on my hands.

321
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,869
You don't know the worries I got, Donnie.

322
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:04,098
A woman like Annette, I can't do right
by her. I ain't got $3 in my pocket.

323
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,472
I put a bet on a horse, that horse don't do
what it's supposed to do,

324
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,276
like every fucking thing else in my life.
I got cancer of the prick.

325
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,484
My ex-wife lives in this building.

326
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,111
Can you believe it?
I run into her in the elevator.

327
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,248
I got to have three spritzers afterward
just to calm down after I see her.

328
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,054
What are you talking about,
cancer of the prick?

329
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:26,192
It's cancer of the prick.
You didn't know that?

330
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,692
I'm in the medical books for that.

331
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:34,871
I got this boat, too, this Bertram.
50-foot Bertram with twin Chryslers.

332
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,407
I had to get rid of it
for money I owe Sonny Red.

333
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,704
The vig alone is $3,000 a week.

334
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,008
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno? That's his son.

335
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:47,141
- I'd like to put a dent in that guy's head.
- No, you don't do that, Donnie.

336
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:50,651
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I'm saying I wish I could.

337
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,286
You wish?

338
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,357
A guy like you doesn't touch a made guy.

339
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,063
You know what I did yesterday?

340
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,161
I went in front of all the skippers.
That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.

341
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,936
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?

342
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,002
I think I do.

343
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,875
You do? You ain't got no fucking idea,
my friend.

344
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,182
Nobody can touch you now. I'm your man.

345
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,150
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.

346
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:28,118
So keep your nose clean, be a good earner,

347
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,151
follow the rules, and who knows,

348
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:34,959
maybe one day when they open the books,
you get straightened out.

349
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,297
Become a wise guy.

350
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:42,598
A made guy. Come on, lift your glass.

351
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,180
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.

352
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:52,506
- All right?
- All right.

353
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,709
- Salute.
- Salute.

354
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,810
All right, Don.

355
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,617
- Thanks a lot. It was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple hundred?

356
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,421
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll get it back to you. You got it here.

357
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,159
Here you go.

358
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:08,658
- I'll get back to you on this.
- Yeah.

359
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,394
- Believe me. Call me tomorrow.
- All right.

360
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,896
Hello.

361
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:02,752
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.

362
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,459
I was working. Nothing I could do.

363
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,157
Working?

364
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:14,724
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.

365
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,565
- Where's the kids?
- They couldn't wait anymore.

366
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,005
Well, that's nice.

367
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,707
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.

368
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,177
- Is that your way of saying you're sorry?
- You know I'm sorry.

369
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,914
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.

370
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,143
Only be sure to introduce yourself.

371
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,147
They might think
you're the Fuller brush man.

372
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:40,122
- If you knew what I was doing today...
- I don't have an idea

373
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,487
- because you don't tell me, remember?
- Because it's for your own protection.

374
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,497
As if any of this is for me.

375
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,397
You're getting the checks, right?

376
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:58,674
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Then don't say it like it's nothing.

377
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:01,336
- 'Cause it's not nothing.
- It's not nothing, but it's not a husband.

378
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,778
A lot of women would disagree with you.

379
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,050
Is that what you do with all your time?

380
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,314
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.

381
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:16,450
Seven days a week, I'm out there busting
my ass, and this is the shit I come home to.

382
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,155
You said it was gonna be three months.
It's going on two years.

383
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,562
How do you find anything in here?
You got cereal on three shelves.

384
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,726
You got cereals over here.

385
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,271
Put stuff away for once. It's my job.

386
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,739
- Quit my job?
- What about my job, Joe?

387
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,777
Christmas Day you don't show up,
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.

388
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.

389
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,608
- You just leave it alone.
- Joseph.

390
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,752
- It would be easier if you tell me...
- Just give me a break.

391
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,117
...what goes on with these guys,
what you do.

392
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,555
Just shut up, please. Leave me alone.

393
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,866
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don't you go pick them up?

394
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:02,934
Where's Sherry?

395
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,403
Sherry is with her boyfriend.

396
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,373
- What?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

397
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,782
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 12, Joe.

398
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,447
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- Okay it? What do you think?

399
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,024
You can drop out of the sky like God
and bark orders?

400
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,355
I am the husband and the father!
I put food on that table!

401
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,019
- Undercover husband!
- What do I get for Christmas?

402
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,063
Empty fucking house!

403
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,095
I'm here.

404
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:34,964
I wanted to be alone with you.

405
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,201
Oh, God.

406
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,766
What happened to your 'stache?

407
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,835
The B, they made me shave it off.
Can you believe that?

408
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,338
- They didn't.
- Yeah.

409
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:13,235
It was the only thing
I liked about this job.

410
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,804
- So, Sherry got a boyfriend?
- Yeah, she does.

411
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,380
Nice kid. He's so nice.

412
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,550
He's on the wrestling team.

413
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,054
I'll bet he's on the wrestling team.

414
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,889
Kerry's doing the catechism. So sweet.

415
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,064
And they're swimming.

416
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,923
Coach says he's never seen nothing like it.

417
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,232
There's a meet Saturday.

418
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,710
What am I gonna do? We'll see.

419
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,962
You know that I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.

420
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,205
I'm not worried about me, Joe.

421
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,240
All right, what's going on, kids?

422
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,712
Am I getting the silent treatment?

423
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,387
I'll make a bet with you.

424
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,427
I'll bet you $20

425
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,032
that you can't get through this entire meal
without saying three words.

426
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,630
All right?

427
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,302
You lose.

428
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,344
What did she say?

429
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,182
What did she say?

430
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,154
Girls, come here a second.
Come here, Terry, Kerry.

431
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:51,623
Come on. Sorry, sweetie.
Come on. Let's go see your sister.

432
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,353
Come on upstairs.

433
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,999
Let's just, let's read a book.

434
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,190
Do what you're told.

435
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,934
Left, it's Donnie. I'm checking in.

436
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,776
Yeah, that's what I said. I'm checking in.

437
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,536
No. I've been out all day. What's going on?

438
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,920
All right. So long.

439
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:17,308
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?

440
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,442
Every morning you're reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?

441
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,143
Look at this.

442
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:28,219
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked. The fucking boss.

443
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,427
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked

444
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,623
- and then your life gets turned around.
- Want to tell me where we're going?

445
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,292
- I got sent for.
- So what does that mean?

446
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,733
- You got sent for.
- What does that mean?

447
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:41,727
What do you think it means?

448
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,501
You don't wanna go? You want me
to turn around? I'll turn around.

449
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:47,076
What are you gonna do?
Take a left off the fucking bridge?

450
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,772
- Not here, I'm saying after the bridge.
- No, I gotta go.

451
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,849
You get sent for, you go. Sonny sent for me.

452
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,915
I'm sick of this.

453
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,046
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?

454
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,182
Not Sonny Red. Sonny Black.

455
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,290
Donnie, what are you doing? Put the fuck...

456
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,830
Donnie, you wanna kill me
with that draft?

457
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,262
Left, Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?

458
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,430
Right. We're friendly.
Ain't the question, "friend. "

459
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,177
The whole time Sonny Black's in the can,
the whole time...

460
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:23,041
He's got a family, he's got a mistress.

461
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,377
He's got a mistress for the mistress.

462
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,610
I watched out for them, all of them.
Me, I was the only one.

463
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,380
Nobody else gave a fuck.

464
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,649
Two hundred fazools, week in, week out.

465
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,885
So you took care of Sonny Black.
What are you worried about, then?

466
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,090
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your fucking head.

467
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,995
How am I supposed to know
if you don't explain it?

468
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,227
You think I don't know
how a hit gets set up?

469
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,325
You think I don't know that?

470
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,302
You know, what I know.

471
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:51,704
How many times have I been
on the other end of that fucking phone?

472
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,299
- Twenty-six times.
- Great.

473
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,469
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends.

474
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,706
Donnie, I got sent for.

475
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:02,252
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead

476
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,082
and it's your best friend that does it.

477
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,142
Anything should happen to me,
make sure Annette gets the car.

478
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,590
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.

479
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,225
Look at this hand. This ain't a hand.

480
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,739
This is a fucking deformed Creature
from the Black Lagoon's claw I got here.

481
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,468
Hey, Left.

482
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,530
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.

483
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,597
Gin.

484
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,942
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise

485
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,642
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise, neither.

486
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,772
It's gin.

487
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,349
What are you talking? You got two sevens.

488
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,816
I had three sevens.

489
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,410
- Paulie.
- Nicky, I had three sevens.

490
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:46,853
I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.

491
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,448
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.

492
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,788
I had three sevens.

493
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:54,796
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

494
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:58,664
Fucking booths. $200 in action
and what we have we got, five?

495
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,169
We're taking a beating again
this week, Sonny.

496
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,206
Let's go for a ride. I got a new car.

497
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,545
Can you believe the ride on this car?

498
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,819
I can't understand how they lost a war,
them Germans.

499
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,184
- I got a date out in Jersey tonight.
- Which broad is this?

500
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:22,816
The one from the calendar.
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.

501
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,455
- What's he doing looking in the mirror?
- What're you doing over there, Left?

502
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,464
What's it look like I'm doing?

503
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,829
I'm checking my lipstick.

504
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,269
What would I do without you, Left?
What would I do?

505
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,833
What about you, Donnie?
What would you do?

506
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:42,201
Have to find yourself a new goombah,
wouldn't you?

507
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:46,045
That was something about the boss, huh?

508
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,084
We all gotta go sometime.

509
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,291
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something, or what?

510
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,296
- No.
- You, wait in the car.

511
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,332
- What?
- Watch the car.

512
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,418
Oh, fuck!

513
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:30,018
Shit!

514
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,595
Christ, I think I shit
my pants. What is this?

515
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:38,732
He's supposed to go
to an animal trainer somewhere.

516
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,333
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.

517
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:45,170
- Either that or he's just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?

518
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,937
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.

519
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,273
For me?

520
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,941
I know how you feel about animals.

521
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,846
It's a gift from me.

522
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,183
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

523
00:40:58,188 --> 00:41:00,622
I got the power. Now you're under me.

524
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:05,025
- What do you mean, you got the power?
- Sonny got upped.

525
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:08,061
What, you got upped?

526
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,833
Rusty's gonna run the whole thing
from the can.

527
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,767
Sonny Red's got Little Italy.
I got Brooklyn.

528
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,602
That's why you sent for me?

529
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,407
Yeah, why? What did you think,
you was gonna get whacked?

530
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,349
Lefty thought he was gonna get whacked.

531
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,309
Congratulations. Come here.

532
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,089
Good stuff.

533
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,793
Grab the pussy. Let's go.

534
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,265
What am I gonna do with this?

535
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,734
He thinks they smell fear.

536
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,135
I'm sick of this.

537
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,804
You and Sonny Black are friends.

538
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,934
I got told to shut my mouth
about Sonny Black.

539
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,675
How many times I stood up
to the boss himself, that cocksucker.

540
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,940
May he rest in peace.

541
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,561
You're gonna have to...
You're gonna have to...

542
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:47,263
I got...

543
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,725
I'm gonna need 40 of those burgers.

544
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,196
Hold the onions.

545
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:58,666
Sonny Black, they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.

546
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:02,144
Thirty years busting my hump. For what?

547
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,802
A lion.

548
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,781
Five hours ago, you thought
you was gonna get whacked.

549
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,980
- Donnie, did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.

550
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,548
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?

551
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,393
You're right. I misunderstood.

552
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,764
Thirty years I'm earning.
Any work to be done, call Lefty.

553
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,928
I never complained.
Twenty-six guys I clipped.

554
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,468
Do I get upped? No, they pass me by.

555
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:36,377
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.

556
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,080
Sonny was probably in
on whacking the boss.

557
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,810
Of course he was in on whacking the boss.

558
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,415
Whacking the boss.
Another thing I get left out of.

559
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,292
It's like one of those, whatchamacallit,
you know, bureaucracy.

560
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,595
What bureaucracy? Ain't no bureaucracy.
What you talking about, bureaucracy?

561
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,168
Where the fuck do you get your ideas?
Bureaucracy.

562
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,568
All I'm saying, I'm saying they
don't appreciate you, is what I'm saying.

563
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,800
Appreciate? They appreciate you?

564
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:08,441
- Come on, Left, I'm on your side.
- You're on my side?

565
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,274
You're on my side
because I say you're on my side.

566
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,506
Hey, look. Donnie!

567
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,140
Don't get
on your fucking high horse, Donnie.

568
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:16,449
I don't like that.

569
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:29,564
But tell you what.

570
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:32,095
Look at that.

571
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,761
I wish I had that boat again, that Bertram.

572
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,034
I wish I had that boat.

573
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:44,244
I'd get in my car with Annette,
I'd drive down to the pier

574
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,441
I'd get on that boat and I'd go.

575
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,539
I'd go.

576
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:51,109
East, west, north, south,
nobody'd ever find me.

577
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,091
Look at this thing. It's a fucking insult.

578
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,350
Let's go! Come on.

579
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,495
I gave it to him!

580
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,736
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus!

581
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,367
- No, Sonny! Please.
- He's got the money.

582
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,700
- He was a friend of mine.
- Broad daylight. I can't believe it.

583
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,576
What kind of people are gonna take
another man's property right off the street?

584
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,342
Forget about it.

585
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:09,144
The whole society's going down the tubes.

586
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:11,516
We never had this kind of a problem
when Nixon was around.

587
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:15,148
Nixon? Nixon? Forget about Nixon. Nixon.

588
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:17,886
We had respect all over the world.

589
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:19,325
We stood for something.

590
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,420
We had law and order in the street.

591
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,761
We had a little different story.

592
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,334
Too bad he wasn't Sicilian.

593
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,095
He was Sicilian.

594
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,230
You know, last night
I'm watching Roger Grimsby on the news

595
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,934
and those Ayatollah cockamamie people
are marching through the streets,

596
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,908
and they're whipping each other on the back
with whips.

597
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:36,410
Get out of here. I never heard of that.

598
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,741
- Donnie, am I right?
- What?

599
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:38,937
Fucking fanatics over there.

600
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,041
What're you asking him for?
What're you asking him for?

601
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,450
What was it, a ventriloquist act?
I asked him a question...

602
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,146
But you're talking to me. You're asking him.

603
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,281
He reads... What do you mean,
why am I asking him?

604
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,188
Fuck if he reads. You ask me.
What're you asking him?

605
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:53,057
- Did you see it?
- I'm here. You're talking to me.

606
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,728
You're talking to me.
What are you talking to him for?

607
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,596
I talk to you, then I talk to him.
I talk to everybody.

608
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,930
All right, all right, all right.

609
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,787
Sonny, come here. Bobby.

610
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,687
Good seeing you.

611
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:36,760
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best, on me.

612
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,163
Why don't you get him a tailor
while you're at it?

613
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,299
- What do you say, Curley?
- How's it going?

614
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,136
This is Dean Blanford,
he's from Washington.

615
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,735
- Joe.
- Donnie.

616
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,145
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.

617
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:29,743
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy,

618
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,617
- even I forget my own name.
- Yeah, is that right?

619
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,815
Is it hard to cash checks?

620
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,922
Dean's up from Washington.

621
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,364
Yeah, you said that part already.
What's next?

622
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:47,594
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit

623
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:52,037
headquarters decided to transfer me
up to Sin City here.

624
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,370
- What for? You want to keep an eye on me?
- No.

625
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,877
To make sure you receive
the proper support.

626
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:00,949
- The proper support.
- And to make sure, in all the hubbub,

627
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,514
- there are no missed opportunities.
- Missed opportunities? Like what?

628
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,056
We have an agent in Miami,
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.

629
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:12,059
- Miami?
- His operation is potentially very sweet.

630
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,687
Problem is, it's starting to languish
right now and needs jump-starting.

631
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,198
The Bureau would like you
to go down there

632
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:21,360
and see if you could interest
some of your mob friends.

633
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:25,498
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo...
- I ain't vouching for nobody I don't know.

634
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,403
I was hoping
we'd get off on the right foot here.

635
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,673
What's the big deal?
You just go down and vouch for the guy.

636
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,007
Sit in the sun for a week.

637
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:36,085
- If I vouch for the guy, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.

638
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,450
You're not the only one out there
risking your life, bud.

639
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,052
I'll let you know.

640
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,053
I'll get back to you.

641
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,400
He'll let us know?

642
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:57,873
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.

643
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,900
My wife says it's very in, Japanese.
She read about it in Parade magazine.

644
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:03,911
Very big now.

645
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,445
Have seat. Take off shoes. Please.

646
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:13,021
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.

647
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,321
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding me?

648
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,155
Take off your pants. What's that?

649
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,263
I'm afraid it's necessary.

650
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,094
- It's Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?

651
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:27,427
- Forget about it, I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.

652
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,335
Forget it, I ain't taking
my fucking shoes off.

653
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,034
- Hey, Donnie.
- What?

654
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,972
When in Rome...

655
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,645
Nicky, who won the fucking war?

656
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,413
- War? What war?
- We did. Do you want to fight it again?

657
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:46,146
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.

658
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,055
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.

659
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,319
I want to eat sometime tonight.

660
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,929
Take off your shoes,
or I'm gonna chop off your fucking feet.

661
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,827
What do you want me to do?

662
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,026
You want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?

663
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:03,600
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.

664
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,504
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this fucking prick?

665
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:08,509
No, I ain't doing it.

666
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,016
I'm afraid it's necessary.

667
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,520
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take off his shoes there, Mr. Moto.

668
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,181
I'm afraid it's necessary.

669
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,728
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.

670
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:27,921
You must take off your shoes.

671
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,275
- You like shoes, you fuck?
- Get him down!

672
00:54:41,377 --> 00:54:42,935
You like shoes?

673
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:45,407
Let me get in there.

674
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:58,323
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

675
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,161
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

676
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:12,440
- Watch him, Donnie!
- Stupid fuck!

677
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,008
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

678
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:18,907
Use those fucking boots!

679
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,744
Don't you move, you fuck.
Don't you fucking move.

680
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,574
You like shoes, you fuck?

681
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,310
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

682
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,854
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

683
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,749
Watch him, Donnie!

684
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,989
Stupid fuck!

685
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:10,455
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

686
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,600
Mind your own business.

687
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,507
Just go home! Go home!

688
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:31,513
Go home, you miserable bitch.

689
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:34,886
What you doing?
Sonny's ready to start.

690
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,289
He's not done yet. You want him to piss
all over the fucking floor?

691
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,374
...not sharing the cigars.
Up the block, they sell for $50 a box.

692
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:55,944
We could sell them for $25.

693
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,811
You give two or three of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.

694
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,214
Give three Quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.

695
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,410
I doubt it.

696
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:06,079
I got a guy that's in the middle
of this load of Sergio Valentes.

697
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,851
A dime on the vig.

698
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,586
- So, what do you got on the street?
- $100,000.

699
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,219
That should be $250,000
by the end of the year.

700
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,001
I can get these real cheap
and I got a guy who can move them.

701
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:21,232
Will you fucking stop that?

702
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:25,235
How else am I supposed to open this?

703
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,936
Open sesame!

704
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:29,235
A score's a score.

705
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,813
Boss, look what I got here. It's 100 pairs.

706
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:37,582
Sonny Red's got $1 million a month
with his trucks in Jersey.

707
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,087
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.

708
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:43,352
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.

709
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,892
You know something?

710
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:49,127
There's a guy I know down in Florida.
He says it's wide open down there.

711
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:53,831
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.

712
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,130
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.

713
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,539
The economy's got to be good
for us to make any real money.

714
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,803
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?

715
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,109
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.

716
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:09,548
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.

717
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,821
Problem up here, you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same fucking nickel.

718
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,386
You're from down there, Florida, Donnie?

719
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,326
Lot of parking meters down in Florida.

720
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,266
You guys think this is funny?

721
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:37,437
I'm the skipper now. I gotta answer!

722
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:42,712
$50,000 a month, I kick up to Rusty.
Every month!

723
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,016
One day, I'm gonna die.

724
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:50,218
I'm gonna be here in this same room
with all these same fucking guys

725
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,853
talking about the same fucking scams

726
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,464
that never amount to nothing!

727
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:05,897
That's how I'll know
that I've been sent to fucking hell.

728
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:09,635
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.

729
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:22,288
I tell you right now, we better start
earning or somebody's gonna get clipped.

730
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,827
Why did you inject that, Donnie,
with Florida?

731
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,161
What are you talking about?
I didn't inject nothing.

732
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,168
You injected that. Don't tell me no.

733
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,371
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason for it.

734
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,442
Now, who is this fucking guy in Florida?

735
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,440
Nobody. He's a guy I knew
when I lived down there, that's all.

736
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,510
You vouch for this guy?

737
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,585
Hey, come on. That was bullshitting around.

738
00:59:49,685 --> 00:59:52,654
Bullshitting around? What, you think
Sonny Black is just bullshitting around?

739
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,020
What do I know? I don't... You know...
You think he wasn't?

740
00:59:56,125 --> 01:00:00,459
Yeah, well... Listen to me, Donnie,
I don't know what to swear on.

741
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,259
My dead father, my mother who I love,
my children.

742
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:08,429
I swear to you, Donnie, something
is going on you don't know about.

743
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:11,665
- I was making conversation with the guy.
- Mr. Smart Conversation,

744
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,640
you tell me what happens

745
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,577
if Sonny Black decides
he wants to go to Florida?

746
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,607
Who said he's going to go to Florida?

747
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:24,812
Donnie, don't think
you can pull the wool over my eyes.

748
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,481
I see you siding up to Sonny Black.

749
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,888
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it.

750
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:33,427
- Come on.
- I ain't siding up to Sonny Black.

751
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:36,588
He goes to Florida, you're responsible.

752
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,996
And I'm responsible
because I represent you.

753
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:40,898
Come on. I was just bullshitting around.

754
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,234
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.

755
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:48,434
Sonny Black is one big, fat,
fucking snake in the...

756
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,004
- Grass. Snake in the grass.
- You can't say that now.

757
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:55,183
Sonny Black is a skipper.
You don't open your mouth about him.

758
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,186
Lefty, this fucking guy Richie calls me up.
He says,

759
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,550
"I'm getting hassled
by a couple of half-assed wise guys. "

760
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,958
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.

761
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,326
- He's got this nightclub to run down there.
- A nightclub?

762
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,990
Got a singles bar. It's near the beach.

763
01:01:12,134 --> 01:01:14,125
I got two grenades in my house.

764
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,636
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up. You understand?

765
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:20,333
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.

766
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,606
You understand? I'd die with you.

767
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,484
Come on!

768
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,018
Come on, Four!

769
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,357
Four!

770
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,068
- Shit.
- That was in.

771
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,204
Bullshit. Knocked me so far...

772
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,636
Don't push me!

773
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,974
I'll break your fucking head.

774
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:41,315
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you...

775
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:44,883
Fuck!

776
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,562
Jesus Christ.

777
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:53,999
Half hour.

778
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,430
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know, Left.

779
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,447
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

780
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,849
Don, you brought the cavalry.

781
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,321
Richie Gazzo.

782
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:21,525
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

783
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,558
I'm late!

784
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,027
You guys got a chance
to work on your suntans out here.

785
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,706
Kings Court. Where every man is a king.

786
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,252
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz.

787
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:52,658
Ask him why this place
is such a fucking dump.

788
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,925
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.

789
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,095
I had to shut the doors.

790
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,461
The way these bums had their hands
in my pockets.

791
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,267
You know, $200 for this, $300 for that.

792
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:08,069
I got a wife who does that,
you know what I mean?

793
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,208
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

794
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:17,279
- Richie, step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.

795
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,989
What kind of a man has a Malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.

796
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:27,625
- I'm telling you, this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?

797
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,024
- When I knew him before, he was all right...
- You vouch for the guy?

798
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,161
I'm just making an introduction. You got
to make the decision about the joint.

799
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,973
This would be something, you know,

800
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,979
if we had my own lounge down here,
me and you.

801
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,779
- You know?
- What about Sonny?

802
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,721
Donnie, don't tell me what to do, Donnie.

803
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:55,653
I'm asking a question.

804
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,557
Donnie, Sonny's down here for a vacation.

805
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,629
He ain't once gotten out
of that chaise longue.

806
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,924
He lies there like he's in fucking traction.

807
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,934
Yeah, I know, but he did mention
that he might wanna get something going.

808
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,932
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?

809
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,641
Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

810
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,838
I guess if everything worked out

811
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,079
we could send a few fazools up there, no?

812
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:30,020
Thirty years I'm busting my hump.
What do I got?

813
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,490
Even a dog
gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.

814
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,126
I ought to show something for what I did.

815
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,362
- You know what I mean?
- Definitely.

816
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,339
This ain't New York down here.

817
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,966
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.

818
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:55,148
Down here, a guy like me could sit down
with the boss.

819
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,982
You know what I'm saying?

820
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,488
Get out from under, be a free agent again.

821
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:07,395
I'm telling you, Donnie, nothing but right.

822
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,033
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.

823
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,005
- You got to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that kind of money.

824
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,804
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

825
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,608
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe.

826
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,013
Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida.

827
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,711
- He sits on the Commission. Did you know?
- I knew that.

828
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:07,287
- A 70-foot boat?
- It's up to 80, actually.

829
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:10,483
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

830
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:14,153
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.

831
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,854
This is important!

832
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:17,726
Ninety, actually.

833
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,528
I did what you asked.
I came here and vouched for this guy.

834
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,797
So what, I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante
out in a rubber ducky or what?

835
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,840
We're gonna have to
wash your mouth out, bud.

836
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,933
Does Sally Paintglass report to Nicky
or Nicky Cigars?

837
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:31,239
- Nicky Glasses.
- Nicky Glasses?

838
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:36,446
As I was saying,
we've got to fold Sonny into the RICO...

839
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:40,783
- I need a boat for this fucking sit-down!
- I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up.

840
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,481
Joe, I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.

841
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:45,025
Get me a fucking boat, would you? What?

842
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,095
I'm not getting anything here.

843
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,153
I'm worried. He's getting strung-out.

844
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:20,523
We're getting what we want. Fuck him.

845
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:23,824
There it is.

846
01:08:27,836 --> 01:08:30,498
Just moving behind, nice and slow.

847
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,109
Why don't you count it, my friend?
Go ahead.

848
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,375
It's all there. No bullshit.

849
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,113
We're bueno?

850
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,511
Pleasure doing business
with you caballeros.

851
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,990
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean

852
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,822
The home of the brave and the free

853
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,501
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

854
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:08,070
What are you doing? You want to
throw me in the pool? You got the balls?

855
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,311
He hasn't made a pick yet.

856
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,403
Forget those dogs.

857
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:15,941
Hey, you know,
if you took my blood pressure right now,

858
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:19,018
it'd be down 100%.

859
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,955
Rusty's locked up in the can
with his fucking sinuses.

860
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:25,253
He finds out you're down in Florida...

861
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:30,358
I don't punch a clock for Rusty.

862
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,957
Live your life like a man down here.

863
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,763
Forget about it, Sonny. By tomorrow,

864
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,361
you're gonna be crying
you miss the New York bread.

865
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,566
New York bread is like cake.

866
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,641
Hey, two weeks you're wearing
the same fucking shirt.

867
01:09:43,745 --> 01:09:45,269
What does that mean?

868
01:09:48,016 --> 01:09:49,711
What does that mean?

869
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,818
I'm not in a big hurry
to go back to New York.

870
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,687
Yeah, don't worry about it. One more day,

871
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:00,859
that fucking shirt's gonna go back
to New York on its own.

872
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,590
That's why we don't
get service in this joint.

873
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,134
They see you in that fucking shirt, they say,
"There's Joe Faccia Di Culo, " in that shirt.

874
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,733
That's enough.

875
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,570
"That's enough?"
What does that mean, "that's enough"?

876
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,036
Look at him, look at him. He's mad.

877
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,949
- Hey, Donnie, let's go for a walk.
- Where?

878
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:26,111
- Come on, I'm gonna get a candy bar.
- All right.

879
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:29,347
Look at him, that was once yellow,
that shirt.

880
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,821
What are we supposed to call him now?
Sonny Florida.

881
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:39,045
Watch out, you're gonna put him
on the warpath again.

882
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,117
Yeah.

883
01:10:40,852 --> 01:10:44,845
That shirt. That's the shirt the barber
gives you to put over your shirt.

884
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:54,096
I want to know what you're up to.

885
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:56,924
- What do you mean?
- Yesterday.

886
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,635
Last night?

887
01:11:01,105 --> 01:11:03,096
What were you doing last night?

888
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:06,768
No, I'm saying, when yesterday?
What time yesterday?

889
01:11:06,878 --> 01:11:11,281
Come here. Don't mess around with me.
Yesterday fucking afternoon.

890
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,878
Nothing.

891
01:11:14,485 --> 01:11:16,851
Why has Lefty got such a hard-on
to send me back to New York?

892
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:19,788
Oh, come on, Sonny.
That guy's busting your balls down there.

893
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:21,381
I wanna know.

894
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:26,928
I wanna know what you got
going on down here.

895
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:28,089
I don't understand, Sonny.

896
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:30,429
You wanna know about every
half-assed scam that'll amount to nothing?

897
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:31,968
That's right.

898
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:36,199
Look.

899
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:39,540
I don't mean any disrespect.

900
01:11:39,644 --> 01:11:41,544
I mean, I know you're a skipper
and I'm a nobody,

901
01:11:41,646 --> 01:11:44,877
but I can't do that to Lefty.

902
01:11:44,983 --> 01:11:48,146
Listen to me, you cocksucker,
I'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.

903
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:51,120
You understand me?
Every fucking one of you.

904
01:11:52,123 --> 01:11:55,388
This is life or death.
Not a fucking game, Donnie.

905
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:59,356
This is my say-so. Now, you tell me.

906
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:03,760
I can't do it, Sonny.

907
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:07,133
How about if I fucking whack you
right here and now?

908
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:11,769
Do what you have to do, Sonny.

909
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:14,011
I can't do that to Lefty.

910
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:48,535
- Mommy, I need some help.
- Hello?

911
01:12:48,713 --> 01:12:49,702
- Hey.
- Hey.

912
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:51,838
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.

913
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:54,515
- I'm in Florida.
- What are you doing in Florida?

914
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,917
I don't know. I'm hunting for turtles.

915
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:59,717
What do you think I'm doing in Florida?
Honey, I'm working.

916
01:12:59,824 --> 01:13:03,123
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

917
01:13:03,928 --> 01:13:06,453
Young lady, you are wearing this coat.

918
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:08,360
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?

919
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,127
- Is everything all right?
- What did you...

920
01:13:10,268 --> 01:13:12,293
What if I said no, Joe?
Would it make any difference?

921
01:13:12,437 --> 01:13:15,065
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

922
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,234
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns. "

923
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:25,783
How can John Wayne die?

924
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:29,544
The fucking Indians got him.

925
01:13:30,855 --> 01:13:34,951
"Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand. "

926
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,620
Look at that.

927
01:13:45,503 --> 01:13:47,994
Let me talk to Kerry.
I want to talk about the Communion.

928
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:50,466
My God, Joe. She doesn't want to do it.

929
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:52,805
What do you mean? She ain't got no choice.

930
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,504
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone, Maggie.

931
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:59,207
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?

932
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:01,318
I don't know. She's acting out or something.

933
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:03,319
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.

934
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,946
Maggie, I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.

935
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:09,318
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start it with your sister.

936
01:14:09,427 --> 01:14:11,361
- Joe, I got to go.
- What?

937
01:14:11,896 --> 01:14:13,363
I love you. Shit.

938
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:17,831
- Who's that on the phone? Richie?
- No. What did Sonny say?

939
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:23,405
- You told Sonny about the club?
- No, I thought you did.

940
01:14:23,574 --> 01:14:27,203
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.

941
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:45,429
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around

942
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,923
since the Mustache Petes.

943
01:14:48,132 --> 01:14:50,066
You gotta respect the man.

944
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:52,728
- Donnie, you get that boat yet?
- No, I'm working on it.

945
01:14:52,937 --> 01:14:55,531
Don't tell me no. You got to get that boat.

946
01:14:57,141 --> 01:15:00,941
I reached out already.
His man says, "Lefty, he loves boats. "

947
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:03,479
I told him a 100-foot boat.
I'm on the clothesline now.

948
01:15:03,614 --> 01:15:05,309
I told you, I'm working on it.

949
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:10,482
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Again? Since when did I disappoint you?

950
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:12,521
Forget about it. What's this?

951
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:15,525
Look at that. Same thing we call each other.

952
01:15:15,693 --> 01:15:18,355
Friend of mine, friend of ours. Good.

953
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:20,988
But there's the double meaning. You get it?

954
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,860
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

955
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,992
- A boss appreciates a thing like that.
- Yeah.

956
01:15:26,337 --> 01:15:29,033
- The irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.

957
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:32,375
Forget about it. Put a beaner inside here,

958
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:34,478
then he knows these are men of men.

959
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:37,173
You see, if I work out the strategy right,

960
01:15:37,482 --> 01:15:39,541
you got to hold up your end now.

961
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,379
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know.

962
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:44,181
You got to hold up your end now.
You know what I'm saying?

963
01:15:44,288 --> 01:15:47,257
How much is this?
Donnie, you got something on you?

964
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:50,321
- What are you doing there?
- How about here's $5?

965
01:15:52,563 --> 01:15:55,657
- You're doing an amazing job, you know.
- What?

966
01:15:56,267 --> 01:15:59,703
- I mean, we all think so.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

967
01:16:02,073 --> 01:16:04,166
For crying out loud. Fuck.

968
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,045
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

969
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:12,548
What's "forget about it"? What is that?

970
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,946
"Forget about it" is like

971
01:16:17,588 --> 01:16:19,453
if you agree with someone.

972
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:24,089
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great
piece of ass. " "Forget about it. "

973
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:27,923
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?

974
01:16:28,032 --> 01:16:29,465
"Forget about it. "

975
01:16:30,501 --> 01:16:33,402
It's also like if something
is the greatest thing in the world.

976
01:16:33,504 --> 01:16:36,473
Like "Minghia, those peppers!
Forget about it!" You know?

977
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:40,341
It's also like saying, "Go to hell," too.

978
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:46,081
Like, "Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker. "
And Paulie says, "Forget about it. "

979
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,442
Forget about it. "Paulie, forget about it. "

980
01:16:52,023 --> 01:16:55,959
Sometimes it just means, forget about it.

981
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:00,159
All right. Thank you very much. I got it.

982
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:03,967
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty...

983
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:07,629
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.

984
01:17:07,772 --> 01:17:11,674
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it?

985
01:17:12,577 --> 01:17:16,035
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?

986
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:20,479
- They got a boat down here.
- What?

987
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:23,520
- Abscam.
- That's right. It's Abscam.

988
01:17:24,121 --> 01:17:25,986
Yeah? Could we get it?

989
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:29,156
Forget about it.

990
01:17:36,601 --> 01:17:38,228
Son of a bitch!

991
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:40,660
Come on, son of...

992
01:17:41,038 --> 01:17:42,972
Fucking Donnie.

993
01:17:43,074 --> 01:17:46,771
Hey, Lefty,
you're not gonna fucking believe this.

994
01:17:46,944 --> 01:17:48,935
- You think this is some joke, huh?
- What?

995
01:17:49,046 --> 01:17:51,378
- You think this is funny, huh?
- What are you talking about?

996
01:17:51,482 --> 01:17:53,382
It's fucking cold.
Why is it so cold in here?

997
01:17:53,484 --> 01:17:57,887
Hey, Donnie. Listen to me, Donnie.
I know you know, all right?

998
01:17:58,122 --> 01:18:00,852
And I know you know I know you know.

999
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:02,654
- Right.
- Right.

1000
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,057
What the fuck are you talking about?

1001
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:07,460
I'm telling you, I'm freezing
to my fucking death, Donnie.

1002
01:18:07,565 --> 01:18:10,466
Yeah, fucking Greenland in here.

1003
01:18:10,735 --> 01:18:11,997
There's no knob. Where's the knob?

1004
01:18:12,103 --> 01:18:13,331
Thank you.

1005
01:18:13,938 --> 01:18:16,099
Well, did you call the maintenance guy?
They gotta have a...

1006
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:18,539
Maintenance. I'm not gonna call
a maintenance guy. What are you, crazy?

1007
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:21,305
Who knows a maintenance guy comes in,
what if he's an agent? Come on.

1008
01:18:21,412 --> 01:18:23,346
Come on, he's not an agent.
He's a fucking janitor.

1009
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:25,039
Janitor, come on.
I don't want him touching it.

1010
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:27,743
Put his hands on it. Who knows what
he puts in the goddamn air-conditioner.

1011
01:18:27,852 --> 01:18:30,946
Here, look at this. Here, look, look.
I got it up to 120, here. Come on.

1012
01:18:31,055 --> 01:18:34,183
Ain't no fucking...
I'm not gonna have anyone going in here.

1013
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:37,523
You know something?
That's a fucking practical joke.

1014
01:18:37,628 --> 01:18:39,027
- That's what that is.
- It's a joke?

1015
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,961
- Yeah.
- Where's the joke? I don't see the joke.

1016
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,556
Come on, you know Sonny's
sense of humor. It's Sonny fucking around.

1017
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:44,862
- You think this is Sonny?
- Yeah.

1018
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:46,402
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

1019
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:50,065
Sonny did this to me?
This is not Sonny Black, my friend.

1020
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:54,600
No. This is you, Donnie.
You fucking cocksucker, it's you!

1021
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:56,703
Whoa, you don't fucking call me that, Lefty.

1022
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:59,305
- Don't call you what?
- Don't you fucking call me cocksucker.

1023
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:01,783
Cocksucker. I'll call you anything I want.
I'll call you cocksucker.

1024
01:19:01,886 --> 01:19:03,877
Yeah, I'll call you cocksucker.
I'll call you motherfucker!

1025
01:19:03,988 --> 01:19:06,149
Yeah, you're a fucking cocksucker.

1026
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:10,483
- You calling me a cocksucker?
- Yeah, you like that?

1027
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:12,556
- I'm a what?
- Cocksucker.

1028
01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:14,927
- I'm a cocksucker?
- You're a cocksucker.

1029
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:20,803
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me over a fucking draft?

1030
01:19:20,905 --> 01:19:22,270
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you something.

1031
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:23,340
You'd better fucking kill me.

1032
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:25,375
Because you don't kill me tonight,
I'm gonna come in here,

1033
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:27,967
I'm gonna chop you up and then...
I'll sneak in here and fucking kill you.

1034
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:29,376
Oh yeah, you don't call me cocksucker.

1035
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,448
Here.

1036
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,879
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1037
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:37,712
- Cocksucker.
- Go ahead. Take it back.

1038
01:19:38,456 --> 01:19:39,821
- Kill me.
- Take it back, Donnie.

1039
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:41,755
Fuck you, I'm getting my own room.

1040
01:19:41,892 --> 01:19:43,587
I'll see you tomorrow.

1041
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:47,193
You're not gonna see me tomorrow,
for your information.

1042
01:19:47,298 --> 01:19:51,257
I got news for you, Donnie.
You won't see me tomorrow.

1043
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:54,160
Tomorrow is Mother's Day,

1044
01:19:54,271 --> 01:19:57,240
and wise guys don't work on Mother's Day!

1045
01:19:57,341 --> 01:19:58,968
You're a cocksucker.

1046
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:04,209
Go ahead!

1047
01:20:09,253 --> 01:20:10,379
No!

1048
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:14,223
Give me a break! No!

1049
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:17,657
Are you trying to get me killed
with that fucking suit?

1050
01:20:17,795 --> 01:20:20,059
Fucking car. That purple, fucking car.

1051
01:20:20,164 --> 01:20:22,792
Don't say the word "plotz. "
You understand?

1052
01:20:25,136 --> 01:20:26,763
Get in the back.

1053
01:20:38,883 --> 01:20:41,215
Wait a minute. I'll be there.

1054
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,724
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty,
a friend of ours.

1055
01:20:50,861 --> 01:20:52,556
I don't know what to say.

1056
01:20:52,897 --> 01:20:55,457
To me, this is like a
great moment in my life.

1057
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:58,024
It's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

1058
01:20:58,936 --> 01:21:01,336
That's the boat I arranged for you,
Mr. Trafficante.

1059
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,569
It's got everything.
Got a full bar, any kind of music you want.

1060
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:08,507
You want to make a telephone,
it's got telephones.

1061
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:11,512
- Any questions, you ask me.
- Where's Sonny Black?

1062
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,513
- Sonny Black?
- Yeah.

1063
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:18,220
Everybody, out. Come on, baby.

1064
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:20,620
- It's beautiful!
- What did I tell you?

1065
01:21:24,895 --> 01:21:28,296
You brought the family.
Hey, Paul, what do you know?

1066
01:21:28,432 --> 01:21:29,763
- Nice boat.
- What do you say, Paulie?

1067
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,595
Where's Gilligan?

1068
01:21:33,437 --> 01:21:35,098
Now, that's what I call a boat.

1069
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,230
Yeah, I would be... Yeah.

1070
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,636
Here.

1071
01:22:19,483 --> 01:22:23,180
Sure, you can operate here.
You got to show a little respect.

1072
01:22:47,912 --> 01:22:49,436
Hey! Over here.

1073
01:23:03,427 --> 01:23:05,418
I don't even want to look at you.

1074
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:09,360
- You know what the bow is?
- What did I do now?

1075
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,798
You stabbed the wrong guy
in the back, my friend.

1076
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:15,133
What are you talking about?
You think I said something to Sonny?

1077
01:23:15,272 --> 01:23:17,103
Go to the bow. I'm gonna stay in the stern.

1078
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:19,300
Go to the bow. Stay there.

1079
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:23,073
I'm so disgusted with you, you know that?

1080
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,115
- You just said it.
- Just so you know.

1081
01:23:39,063 --> 01:23:42,089
- How you doing?
- That Trafficante is something else.

1082
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:46,533
- Is that right? Is he a good old guy?
- Forget about it.

1083
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:49,969
That motherfucker had this all to himself
for 50 fucking years

1084
01:23:50,074 --> 01:23:52,167
and it's still a cow town.

1085
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:55,270
This could be like Vegas down here.

1086
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:59,115
Forget about Sonny Red
and his trucks in Jersey.

1087
01:23:59,216 --> 01:24:01,411
This is all I want. Florida.

1088
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:05,919
Tell you something. Sonny Red
is freezing his nuts off right now.

1089
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:10,423
That's for sure.

1090
01:24:11,895 --> 01:24:14,557
All I need is the start-up money from Rusty

1091
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:15,722
and then we all get rich.

1092
01:24:15,866 --> 01:24:17,925
Are we heading
back to New York pretty soon?

1093
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:21,595
Not you. I want you to represent me
down here, Donnie.

1094
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,764
I want you to be my man in Florida.

1095
01:24:25,142 --> 01:24:28,077
Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.

1096
01:24:37,454 --> 01:24:40,048
You didn't think I knew about that, did you?

1097
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:44,154
I think I'll send the
lion down here with you.

1098
01:24:44,361 --> 01:24:46,761
Keep that big pussy in the parking lot.

1099
01:24:48,799 --> 01:24:51,927
You know, Sonny, I really appreciate
the offer and everything,

1100
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:54,630
but I got a lot of things going on
in New York.

1101
01:24:54,772 --> 01:24:58,833
- I'd like to keep them...
- Lefty's a dynamite guy. No doubt about it.

1102
01:24:58,976 --> 01:25:01,444
He looked after me when I was in the can.

1103
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:03,737
That's something I don't forget,

1104
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:06,338
something that I will never ever forget.

1105
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:10,350
He's a stand-up guy.
He really cares about you, too.

1106
01:25:10,788 --> 01:25:12,688
Yeah, I know he does.

1107
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:17,321
The problem is that
you think that he's helping you,

1108
01:25:17,461 --> 01:25:19,292
but he's hurting you.

1109
01:25:20,464 --> 01:25:22,932
He gets those two or three wines in him...

1110
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,461
You know what I'm saying.

1111
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,831
I don't want to be
stepping on nobody's toes.

1112
01:25:31,942 --> 01:25:34,638
- If it wasn't for Left, I...
- That's it. Look.

1113
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:39,412
You belong to me now.

1114
01:25:41,919 --> 01:25:43,079
That's it.

1115
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:55,357
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

1116
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:01,364
- You believe that?
- Ulcers, Christ, they're killing me.

1117
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,837
Come here.

1118
01:26:03,941 --> 01:26:05,431
Santo, this is Donnie.

1119
01:26:05,576 --> 01:26:08,670
- He's a friend of ours.
- Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.

1120
01:26:10,614 --> 01:26:12,946
- This is Donnie.
- Hi, how you doing?

1121
01:26:24,161 --> 01:26:25,958
- Give my best to Joe, will you?
- I will.

1122
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:28,826
Snowed in. Can you believe him?

1123
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:33,159
Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he gets stuck at an airport.

1124
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:36,999
That's for his own protection.
I'll see you later. Okay?

1125
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:40,008
- I hate flying.
- I know you do. Be safe.

1126
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,438
Oh, sweetheart.

1127
01:26:49,653 --> 01:26:50,813
Honey.

1128
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:56,616
Your father is so proud of you.

1129
01:27:00,097 --> 01:27:01,860
I'm going upstairs.

1130
01:27:10,707 --> 01:27:12,334
God damn it, Joe.

1131
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:20,509
The number you have dialed
has been changed.

1132
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:24,152
The new number is unpublished
at the subscriber's request.

1133
01:27:50,347 --> 01:27:53,248
Hey, Left, get us checked in over there,
will you?

1134
01:27:58,956 --> 01:28:01,652
- Stick around. I'm going to get a paper.
- All right.

1135
01:28:07,097 --> 01:28:10,897
Jesus, Joe. That's Hollman, US Attorney,
coming at us.

1136
01:28:11,034 --> 01:28:14,060
The guy on the right.
Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?

1137
01:28:15,005 --> 01:28:17,565
Why don't you just shut the fuck up?
I'll take care of it.

1138
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,638
Anything goes wrong down there,

1139
01:28:25,749 --> 01:28:29,344
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?

1140
01:28:29,519 --> 01:28:32,352
I don't want to come down here
and iron anything out.

1141
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:34,980
- You got your plane tickets?
- Joe Pistone.

1142
01:28:37,194 --> 01:28:39,355
Remember me? Southern District...

1143
01:28:39,496 --> 01:28:41,987
What kind of fucking shit...

1144
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,295
- What are you doing?
- Grabbed my cock.

1145
01:28:45,402 --> 01:28:46,391
What the fuck!

1146
01:28:46,536 --> 01:28:49,972
Shut up. He's working.
Keep your mouth shut.

1147
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,466
Fucking degenerate bastard.
What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.

1148
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:56,842
I want that club up and running.
I don't care how long it takes.

1149
01:28:56,947 --> 01:28:59,211
Here comes a fucking cop.
Get the hell out of here.

1150
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:02,409
Have a safe trip.
You have the tickets and everything?

1151
01:29:04,855 --> 01:29:06,015
Listen to me.

1152
01:29:06,123 --> 01:29:09,581
Get on the phone.
Get me on the next flight back. Understand?

1153
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:13,058
Don't call me Joe again.
I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?

1154
01:29:13,163 --> 01:29:14,892
You piece of shit.

1155
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:51,868
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.

1156
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:00,034
- Who made you?
- God made me.

1157
01:30:00,744 --> 01:30:04,145
- Why did God make you?
- God made me to show his goodness

1158
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:06,442
to make me happy with him in heaven.

1159
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:09,144
- Where is God?
- God is everywhere.

1160
01:30:16,426 --> 01:30:17,950
Sweet dreams, angel.

1161
01:30:59,903 --> 01:31:01,564
I want a divorce.

1162
01:31:05,175 --> 01:31:06,870
He comes home at all hours of the night

1163
01:31:06,977 --> 01:31:10,640
without announcing when, why, or where
he's been for the last three months.

1164
01:31:12,482 --> 01:31:15,781
And you know what he does?
He rearranges the cabinets.

1165
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,284
He remakes the bed.
He vacuums the entire house.

1166
01:31:19,389 --> 01:31:22,517
Do you know another man that vacuums?
It's abnormal.

1167
01:31:22,659 --> 01:31:24,957
- It's abnormal behavior.
- Well, you know,

1168
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,361
changing the phone number and
not telling your husband is pretty normal.

1169
01:31:28,498 --> 01:31:31,592
- I don't exist, you don't exist.
- So now I know how it feels.

1170
01:31:31,802 --> 01:31:35,704
No, now I know how you feel.
I'll tell you something. It felt good.

1171
01:31:36,406 --> 01:31:39,534
Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.

1172
01:31:40,177 --> 01:31:42,475
Now I know how it feels to be strong.

1173
01:31:44,648 --> 01:31:46,639
- You love control, don't you?
- Oh, my God.

1174
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,149
Please, Joe, just listen.

1175
01:31:48,251 --> 01:31:51,448
Otherwise you just play out
the old pathology.

1176
01:31:53,557 --> 01:31:55,684
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.

1177
01:31:56,693 --> 01:31:58,217
Yes, he leaves.

1178
01:31:59,796 --> 01:32:02,993
He leaves me with the house

1179
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,661
and the kids and the bills,
but not a husband.

1180
01:32:09,406 --> 01:32:11,101
I want my husband.

1181
01:32:16,379 --> 01:32:19,075
What do you think you're running from?

1182
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:26,856
- I ain't running from nothing.
- "I ain't running from nothing. "

1183
01:32:26,957 --> 01:32:30,085
You hear yourself?
The man I married was a college man.

1184
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:34,888
Being the distancer
forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.

1185
01:32:35,332 --> 01:32:37,857
This gives you a feeling of power.

1186
01:32:38,235 --> 01:32:41,102
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie

1187
01:32:41,338 --> 01:32:45,832
- for fulfilling her intimacy needs...
- I'm an undercover agent for the FBl, Doctor.

1188
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:49,510
You and your Mafia faggots
can go screw each other.

1189
01:32:49,646 --> 01:32:51,273
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1190
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:52,939
I really hope that you can help her out

1191
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:55,074
because obviously she's very sick.
You can see that.

1192
01:32:55,185 --> 01:32:58,018
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

1193
01:32:58,688 --> 01:33:00,451
- You.
- Now,

1194
01:33:00,857 --> 01:33:05,419
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
are Joe's intimacy days.

1195
01:33:06,062 --> 01:33:09,088
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
are Maggie's.

1196
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:12,961
Now, on your day,
you make an intimacy request.

1197
01:33:13,537 --> 01:33:15,334
"Rub my back," or

1198
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:19,302
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"

1199
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:23,108
You sit around in
your safe little fucking house

1200
01:33:23,213 --> 01:33:27,149
with your safe little fucking station wagon,
and your safe little friends.

1201
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:29,741
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.

1202
01:33:29,886 --> 01:33:33,322
- "Will you rub my back?"
- You're an animal, do you know that?

1203
01:33:33,456 --> 01:33:36,755
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?

1204
01:33:37,794 --> 01:33:40,354
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?

1205
01:33:40,463 --> 01:33:41,657
It's very intimate.

1206
01:33:41,765 --> 01:33:44,495
He can take the bill he's gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.

1207
01:33:44,601 --> 01:33:46,501
You want to know why we went to him?

1208
01:33:46,603 --> 01:33:50,164
I was hoping he could come up with
one good reason for me not to leave you

1209
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:52,400
because I don't have one anymore.

1210
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:58,343
What? You gonna leave me?

1211
01:33:58,448 --> 01:34:02,282
You gonna leave me, Maggie?
You don't leave me.

1212
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:10,992
- Hello.
- Hey, Annette.

1213
01:34:11,127 --> 01:34:12,822
Donnie.

1214
01:34:12,996 --> 01:34:15,123
- What's the matter?
- Where are you?

1215
01:34:19,803 --> 01:34:22,636
I'm in New York. I had to come back. Why?

1216
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,507
- It's Tommy.
- Why, what's going on? What happened?

1217
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:29,976
Can you give your sister
some vegetables, honey? Thank you.

1218
01:34:30,113 --> 01:34:33,844
Not with your fingers, sweetie.
What else do you need?

1219
01:34:39,022 --> 01:34:41,923
We did fractions with Miss Greenberg today
in class, you know?

1220
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:44,293
Did you? Fractions?

1221
01:34:44,394 --> 01:34:48,660
- I got my test back and I got a 95.
- Of course you did.

1222
01:34:56,106 --> 01:34:59,166
- What's going on?
- Donnie, what are you doing here?

1223
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,005
You belong in Florida.

1224
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:03,477
I checked in with Annette
and she said something...

1225
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:07,175
- You called her from Florida?
- I was up here. I had a few things to care of.

1226
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:09,711
You got to go back. Come on.

1227
01:35:09,853 --> 01:35:12,515
What happened to him?
Is he gonna be all right?

1228
01:35:12,622 --> 01:35:13,987
Do I know?

1229
01:35:14,524 --> 01:35:18,927
They got 12 fucking diplomas on the wall,
and they can't tell you a fucking thing.

1230
01:35:19,596 --> 01:35:22,190
Forget about it.
Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue,

1231
01:35:22,299 --> 01:35:24,324
he's going right back to fucking up.

1232
01:35:24,434 --> 01:35:27,767
- What did he do? Did he overdose?
- That ain't the question.

1233
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:30,933
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

1234
01:35:32,575 --> 01:35:36,773
About five million tubes.
They have a machine breathing for him.

1235
01:35:36,913 --> 01:35:40,781
Where's the fucking doctor?
You want me to go talk to this guy for you?

1236
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:43,078
Talk to the doctor?
You gonna break his legs?

1237
01:35:43,186 --> 01:35:45,780
I'm saying, you want me to do something?
I'm here.

1238
01:35:45,922 --> 01:35:48,618
I want you to go back down to Florida.

1239
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:52,659
You belong to Sonny now. Believe me.

1240
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:54,957
I came here to be with you.
I want to help you out.

1241
01:35:55,098 --> 01:35:58,431
- You're my man. I'm here for you.
- I don't want you here, Donnie.

1242
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:03,898
You and Tommy is both
peas in a fucking pod. You don't listen.

1243
01:36:04,808 --> 01:36:06,708
You got your own ideas.

1244
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:10,812
You do what you want to do
up on your high horses. Everything's a joke.

1245
01:36:16,019 --> 01:36:18,249
You go to La Guardia and you get back.

1246
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:20,949
- Get back to Florida. Get on a plane.
- I ain't going.

1247
01:36:21,057 --> 01:36:23,184
- Forget about it.
- Go on!

1248
01:36:26,162 --> 01:36:29,222
I'm gonna stay here with you.
You want to kick the shit out of me?

1249
01:36:29,332 --> 01:36:31,527
I'm gonna be right here. All right?

1250
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:47,311
Twenty eight years.

1251
01:36:48,351 --> 01:36:50,979
You can read it on his birth certificate.

1252
01:36:51,087 --> 01:36:54,682
Bellevue Hospital. Now he's back, in there.

1253
01:36:55,658 --> 01:36:58,525
And I'm out here,
worried to my fucking death.

1254
01:36:59,028 --> 01:37:02,191
And he's asleep in there,
same as 28 years ago

1255
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,099
with the same expression.

1256
01:37:06,803 --> 01:37:08,361
He's made no progress.

1257
01:37:09,806 --> 01:37:11,797
He ain't got no fucking respect.

1258
01:37:14,144 --> 01:37:15,509
He's my son.

1259
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:24,179
His heart stopped like a watch.

1260
01:37:25,522 --> 01:37:28,116
That's what the doctor said.
Just like a watch.

1261
01:37:28,224 --> 01:37:30,124
They had to wind it back up.

1262
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,692
Who knows? Maybe next time,

1263
01:37:36,065 --> 01:37:37,464
they can't.

1264
01:38:01,391 --> 01:38:04,417
He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right.

1265
01:38:09,966 --> 01:38:11,456
I love you, Donnie.

1266
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,807
Hey, Joe.

1267
01:38:54,911 --> 01:38:56,105
What?

1268
01:38:57,046 --> 01:38:58,911
You know the U.S. government?

1269
01:38:59,015 --> 01:39:00,004
Yeah.

1270
01:39:00,116 --> 01:39:04,314
The U.S. government you swore an oath
and dedicated your life to?

1271
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:06,084
Yeah. Why?

1272
01:39:07,657 --> 01:39:09,056
We got audited.

1273
01:39:34,117 --> 01:39:35,744
Hey, let's make a toast to Sonny, huh?

1274
01:39:35,852 --> 01:39:38,116
To Sonny and our new Florida business.

1275
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:54,229
Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

1276
01:39:54,337 --> 01:39:56,771
- What's going on, Red?
- You know the boys.

1277
01:40:02,912 --> 01:40:04,504
I hear you was in Florida.

1278
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:07,640
Yeah, it's nice down there. Take the sun.

1279
01:40:08,084 --> 01:40:09,847
You got friends down there?

1280
01:40:11,454 --> 01:40:13,684
Everybody's nice down there.

1281
01:40:13,856 --> 01:40:16,916
The people, they're
very friendly down there.

1282
01:40:18,027 --> 01:40:19,392
Nice color.

1283
01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:23,795
Thank you.

1284
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:33,174
I'm not talking to the Bureau.
There is no Bureau.

1285
01:40:33,276 --> 01:40:36,439
There's a bunch of assholes
and the I.R.S. is another bunch of assholes.

1286
01:40:36,546 --> 01:40:39,379
So what I'm asking you to do is to
place a phone call, asshole to asshole.

1287
01:40:39,482 --> 01:40:42,007
- Please calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

1288
01:40:45,588 --> 01:40:48,489
You tell this fucking auditor
that I'm coming to D.C.

1289
01:40:48,591 --> 01:40:51,287
and I'm gonna whip the shit out of him
with his calculator, you understand?

1290
01:41:03,206 --> 01:41:05,106
Let's face it, bud,
they don't audit you for...

1291
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,334
Okay, I'm gonna hang up now.

1292
01:41:06,442 --> 01:41:08,342
Wait, I'm a GS-15. You can't...

1293
01:41:08,678 --> 01:41:09,872
Fucking cocksucker.

1294
01:41:13,449 --> 01:41:14,780
All right!

1295
01:41:16,686 --> 01:41:18,517
How you doing, Nicky?

1296
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:21,654
Hey, Sonny!

1297
01:41:21,824 --> 01:41:24,918
Look at this place. It's unbelievable.

1298
01:41:25,828 --> 01:41:27,557
- Beautiful.
- I feel lucky tonight.

1299
01:41:27,664 --> 01:41:29,461
Look at it. Opening night.

1300
01:41:29,565 --> 01:41:31,829
This place is a goddamn palace,
for Christ's sake.

1301
01:41:41,911 --> 01:41:44,038
Terrific, Sonny. I love it.

1302
01:41:45,848 --> 01:41:48,373
- It's a fucking palace!
- How you doing?

1303
01:41:48,518 --> 01:41:50,782
How you doing? Having fun?

1304
01:41:54,857 --> 01:41:57,951
Let's try another one. Again.

1305
01:42:18,047 --> 01:42:19,378
I like it.

1306
01:42:19,582 --> 01:42:21,277
I like it bigtime.

1307
01:42:26,789 --> 01:42:30,748
- I need a steak, medium rare.
- Couple bowls of chili, extra hot.

1308
01:42:33,596 --> 01:42:35,791
Okay, Donnie, this is the take.

1309
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:38,162
- Put this bag someplace safe.
- All right.

1310
01:42:38,267 --> 01:42:39,757
Chicken taco.

1311
01:42:53,349 --> 01:42:55,283
Just turn real slow.

1312
01:42:58,588 --> 01:43:00,317
Is there a problem, Officer?

1313
01:43:00,423 --> 01:43:03,722
- What's your name, boy?
- Donnie Brasco. What's yours?

1314
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,829
What are all you New York guineas
doing down here?

1315
01:43:06,929 --> 01:43:08,692
Your missus invited us.

1316
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:16,166
Gentlemen, we're running
a charity event here.

1317
01:43:16,272 --> 01:43:18,968
- We have a permit.
- You got a permit for the lion?

1318
01:43:27,617 --> 01:43:29,642
Break it up! Break it up!

1319
01:43:41,464 --> 01:43:43,523
You fucking pigs!

1320
01:43:54,844 --> 01:43:58,905
I guess you didn't ever think
of paying these guys off, did you?

1321
01:43:59,081 --> 01:44:02,380
Where the hell am I gonna get money to go
bribing cops? Nobody authorized that.

1322
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:29,771
You know how fucking embarrassed I am?

1323
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,171
The old man's people down here.

1324
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:38,309
A year now, I got to be in my house
with the shades drawn.

1325
01:44:44,327 --> 01:44:46,352
Where's that bag?

1326
01:44:46,896 --> 01:44:49,660
They got it. They got everything.

1327
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:58,870
That's Rusty's money.

1328
01:45:02,612 --> 01:45:04,739
- Sonny, I'm sorry...
- Shut up.

1329
01:45:05,414 --> 01:45:07,245
You shut up. Sit down.

1330
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:09,315
Shut the fuck up.

1331
01:45:13,756 --> 01:45:16,384
Like this, I got to go back to New York.

1332
01:45:16,993 --> 01:45:19,359
Make this right with Rusty.

1333
01:45:20,963 --> 01:45:23,523
Face that cocksucker Sonny Red.

1334
01:45:23,733 --> 01:45:26,361
You know, I got to say something.

1335
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:29,269
Usually the cops are so fucking dumb.

1336
01:45:29,405 --> 01:45:32,670
It takes them three months
just to get wind something's going on.

1337
01:45:32,775 --> 01:45:35,209
Then they got to go get a warrant.

1338
01:45:35,311 --> 01:45:38,371
They got to go through them pictures.
What are they?

1339
01:45:38,481 --> 01:45:41,075
- Surveillance.
- They go to surveillance.

1340
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:43,915
Three months taking pictures.

1341
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:47,615
All this time,
how do these cops know so much?

1342
01:45:48,124 --> 01:45:50,888
- We just opened the fucking doors.
- What are you saying?

1343
01:45:50,993 --> 01:45:52,984
There's got to be a snitch here.

1344
01:46:04,573 --> 01:46:05,870
All right.

1345
01:46:06,509 --> 01:46:08,636
So there's a snitch.

1346
01:46:09,145 --> 01:46:11,943
We find him. We cut his prick off.

1347
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:14,983
Leave it in his mouth.
Leave him on the street.

1348
01:46:16,252 --> 01:46:17,378
Okay?

1349
01:46:23,826 --> 01:46:26,420
What are you,
a silent partner all of a sudden?

1350
01:46:32,501 --> 01:46:35,493
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Hey, knock it off in there!

1351
01:46:35,604 --> 01:46:37,799
Shut up! Fuck you!

1352
01:46:44,113 --> 01:46:46,775
Keep it up, boy,
I'll send you out of here in a box.

1353
01:46:46,882 --> 01:46:49,851
- Did you bust it up good?
- Yeah, we busted it up.

1354
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:52,753
He's out of business. You understand?

1355
01:46:52,855 --> 01:46:54,322
Yeah, I'm listening.

1356
01:46:55,024 --> 01:46:58,221
That punk is finished down here. That's it.

1357
01:46:59,261 --> 01:47:01,855
That's great. I can't believe it.

1358
01:47:01,964 --> 01:47:04,524
- All right, look, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

1359
01:47:04,633 --> 01:47:06,260
Give me some of that cheese
with that salami, please?

1360
01:47:06,369 --> 01:47:08,269
- He busted up the club.
- Good.

1361
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:10,931
- Take this taste out of my mouth.
- There you go.

1362
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,372
Now he has to answer for what happened.

1363
01:47:13,642 --> 01:47:15,473
You gonna send for him?

1364
01:47:15,945 --> 01:47:17,412
He sits down with us.

1365
01:47:17,513 --> 01:47:19,743
Bing-bada-boom, it's done.

1366
01:47:20,116 --> 01:47:22,550
The whole fucking crew. All of them.

1367
01:47:22,651 --> 01:47:23,879
I'll dust off the guns.

1368
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:56,914
Napkins and tablecloths, $500 scoot.

1369
01:47:57,486 --> 01:47:58,953
$500 scoot?

1370
01:47:59,088 --> 01:48:01,215
Down in Florida, it's $500 an hour.

1371
01:48:01,323 --> 01:48:04,156
You like it down there so much,
why don't you go buy some oranges?

1372
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:07,058
- What do you got there, Bullfrog?
- Dime on the vig.

1373
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:10,599
I'm doing the best I can, Sonny.

1374
01:48:11,033 --> 01:48:12,330
What do you got, Nicky?

1375
01:48:12,435 --> 01:48:16,337
I got a guy boosted 30 tickets
to Chaka Khan at the Garden.

1376
01:48:18,107 --> 01:48:19,540
What about Florida?

1377
01:48:19,775 --> 01:48:22,642
I thought we weren't supposed to talk
about Florida.

1378
01:48:25,548 --> 01:48:27,038
So you never got nothing going on?

1379
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:30,550
No. Nothing ever panned out for me, Sonny.
I couldn't catch a break.

1380
01:48:30,653 --> 01:48:34,111
- You never got nothing going on?
- What did I just say?

1381
01:48:34,657 --> 01:48:35,954
Sonny.

1382
01:48:48,337 --> 01:48:50,464
Paulie, I got a truckload of razor blades.

1383
01:48:50,573 --> 01:48:52,939
What the fuck am I gonna do
with razor blades?

1384
01:48:53,042 --> 01:48:55,510
You know how many razor blades
fit in a truck?

1385
01:48:55,611 --> 01:48:58,307
I got a guy on the inside,
works in a warehouse.

1386
01:48:58,414 --> 01:49:00,245
Has the art collection of the Shah of Iran.

1387
01:49:02,351 --> 01:49:04,148
A sit-down where?

1388
01:49:05,888 --> 01:49:07,082
Yeah.

1389
01:49:15,231 --> 01:49:17,096
That was Sonny Red's guy.

1390
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,068
Wants to have a sit-down in Little Italy.

1391
01:49:20,402 --> 01:49:21,835
I got sent for.

1392
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:27,272
Donnie, come on.

1393
01:49:37,486 --> 01:49:39,249
Paulie, we'll take your car.

1394
01:49:39,488 --> 01:49:43,447
That cocksucker Sonny Red,
he rubbed my nose in Florida

1395
01:49:43,592 --> 01:49:44,923
because of a fucking rat!

1396
01:49:45,027 --> 01:49:46,358
Forget about it.

1397
01:49:46,529 --> 01:49:48,929
Donnie, you ride up front.

1398
01:49:49,765 --> 01:49:52,029
You know what to do
when you find that rat, right, Left?

1399
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:54,102
Could be I found him already.

1400
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:03,638
So where we headed, Sonny? Little Italy?

1401
01:50:03,779 --> 01:50:08,443
Our guy says they got a little stop
to make first. You know what I mean?

1402
01:50:49,758 --> 01:50:51,350
Let's go.

1403
01:50:59,034 --> 01:51:02,492
Where are you going? Wait in the car.

1404
01:51:55,324 --> 01:51:56,814
All right. Come on.

1405
01:51:56,959 --> 01:51:58,358
We still got to get downtown.

1406
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:02,055
- How long is this gonna take?
- I got them in the drain in the laundry room.

1407
01:52:02,164 --> 01:52:04,496
- The. 22s?
- Bruno said you want the 9mm.

1408
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,591
- Meanwhile, where the fuck is he?
- Yeah.

1409
01:52:06,702 --> 01:52:10,035
In bed with some broad with more hair
on her lip than he's got on his head.

1410
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:12,972
- He's your kid.
- Don't remind me. Come on.

1411
01:52:13,075 --> 01:52:15,669
You think that's funny?
I don't think that's so funny.

1412
01:52:15,778 --> 01:52:16,904
All right.

1413
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,907
- You don't want to listen.
- I don't think that's funny.

1414
01:52:23,018 --> 01:52:27,216
- A son should respect his father, capisce?
- Answer me. You think that's funny?

1415
01:52:27,956 --> 01:52:30,857
Shit, the bulb is out.
Watch your step, guys.

1416
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:33,585
Big fucking surprise from a fucking spider.

1417
01:52:33,729 --> 01:52:36,425
Yeah, nothing like the surprise
Sonny Black is gonna get.

1418
01:52:36,532 --> 01:52:38,966
- You can say that again.
- Put one right here.

1419
01:52:39,068 --> 01:52:40,933
He'll never know what hit him.

1420
01:52:41,036 --> 01:52:43,470
- Goddamn right.
- He's never gonna know what hit him.

1421
01:52:43,572 --> 01:52:46,166
- I'll blow his brains right there.
- Jesus! No!

1422
01:53:06,462 --> 01:53:08,123
Bruno!

1423
01:53:33,222 --> 01:53:37,625
Okay, come on! Get him off!

1424
01:53:37,726 --> 01:53:39,125
- Sonny!
- Get him off of me!

1425
01:53:39,228 --> 01:53:41,093
Take my arm. Take my hand.

1426
01:53:43,165 --> 01:53:45,133
Jesus Christ.

1427
01:53:47,369 --> 01:53:50,236
Paulie, go get Donnie.

1428
01:54:09,525 --> 01:54:10,822
What's going on?

1429
01:54:16,665 --> 01:54:19,361
- Is everything all right?
- What?

1430
01:54:21,637 --> 01:54:23,298
Is everything all right?

1431
01:54:30,045 --> 01:54:31,137
Get out.

1432
01:54:58,073 --> 01:54:59,768
Get down there.

1433
01:55:01,243 --> 01:55:04,610
The meek want to inherit the earth,
they're gonna have to get in fucking line.

1434
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,993
Look what I found.

1435
01:55:20,863 --> 01:55:22,592
Them or us.

1436
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,533
Nicky, you got Big Trin.

1437
01:55:25,701 --> 01:55:28,670
- Trin? I'll get a hernia.
- Shut the fuck up.

1438
01:55:28,937 --> 01:55:31,167
Donnie's gonna help you.

1439
01:55:34,743 --> 01:55:36,335
Come on, Donnie.

1440
01:55:36,512 --> 01:55:38,810
Help me fillet this fat fuck.

1441
01:55:55,063 --> 01:55:57,327
All right, all right. Come on.

1442
01:55:57,766 --> 01:55:59,358
We got work to do.

1443
01:56:45,781 --> 01:56:48,511
There was a rat in Florida, Donnie.

1444
01:56:50,953 --> 01:56:52,682
Nicky wasn't a rat.

1445
01:56:53,088 --> 01:56:55,522
You don't mention his name, all right?

1446
01:56:55,757 --> 01:56:58,851
That's what we said.
We don't mention his name.

1447
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:02,362
Yeah. Tell yourself
whatever you have to, Left.

1448
01:57:02,631 --> 01:57:04,394
I'm not telling myself.

1449
01:57:04,533 --> 01:57:07,627
- You was down there. You have eyes.
- Twenty years you know a guy.

1450
01:57:07,736 --> 01:57:11,035
You fuck him, whack him out,
just like that? Over a lounge?

1451
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,865
- That's beautiful.
- The man held out.

1452
01:57:14,776 --> 01:57:16,038
He held out on a coke deal.

1453
01:57:16,144 --> 01:57:18,305
What does one thing
got to do with the other?

1454
01:57:18,413 --> 01:57:21,576
He could have got whacked out just for that,
for your information.

1455
01:57:21,683 --> 01:57:23,913
- There wasn't a rat in Florida.
- There was a rat.

1456
01:57:24,019 --> 01:57:27,750
There was not a rat in Florida.
Richie fucked up paying off the cops.

1457
01:57:28,624 --> 01:57:30,148
What do you mean Richie fucked up?

1458
01:57:30,258 --> 01:57:34,092
That's why the club got busted.
Richie didn't pay off the fucking cops.

1459
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:37,694
Nicky didn't have anything to do with it.

1460
01:57:37,799 --> 01:57:40,825
You don't mention his name.
That's the rules.

1461
01:57:40,969 --> 01:57:43,938
- Fuck the rules.
- That's the rules, Donnie.

1462
01:57:47,009 --> 01:57:48,169
Say his name.

1463
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:50,405
- Come on.
- Say his name.

1464
01:57:50,512 --> 01:57:52,571
Come on. Nicky.

1465
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:55,010
Say Nicky.

1466
01:57:55,183 --> 01:57:57,947
You can't say his name
because you know that I'm fucking right.

1467
01:57:58,053 --> 01:57:59,987
Say it! Say Nicky!

1468
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:03,153
Say his fucking name!

1469
01:58:03,425 --> 01:58:07,828
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.

1470
01:58:12,067 --> 01:58:13,728
Who the fuck am I?

1471
01:58:16,405 --> 01:58:18,396
Who am I?

1472
01:58:21,276 --> 01:58:23,710
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

1473
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,216
And so was he, and so are you.

1474
01:58:32,087 --> 01:58:34,351
Quit riding the fucking brake.

1475
01:58:57,112 --> 01:58:59,307
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.

1476
01:59:00,282 --> 01:59:02,807
- He looks good, huh?
- Sonny Black.

1477
01:59:09,124 --> 01:59:12,150
Congratulations, Sonny!

1478
01:59:12,327 --> 01:59:13,487
Boss!

1479
01:59:16,932 --> 01:59:20,493
- Sonny. Congratulations, Sonny.
- Congratulations.

1480
01:59:30,345 --> 01:59:32,870
- Oh, God!
- No, everything's okay, Maggie.

1481
01:59:33,882 --> 01:59:37,648
Yeah? If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?

1482
01:59:37,753 --> 01:59:40,119
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?

1483
01:59:40,322 --> 01:59:42,222
I'm not sure. That depends.

1484
01:59:42,657 --> 01:59:44,852
At that point, he became hysterical.

1485
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,858
As if the Bureau were responsible
for this audit.

1486
01:59:47,963 --> 01:59:51,194
- Whereas, well, self-evidently...
- Did you ever think of giving him a raise?

1487
01:59:51,299 --> 01:59:53,733
The only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him.

1488
01:59:53,835 --> 01:59:54,995
Yeah.

1489
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:57,798
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.

1490
01:59:58,406 --> 01:59:59,896
So he's a supervisor.

1491
02:00:01,143 --> 02:00:04,510
But he's undercover.
He's not supervising anyone.

1492
02:00:04,613 --> 02:00:07,207
The point is,
that's the last time we heard from him.

1493
02:00:07,315 --> 02:00:10,648
Standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day.

1494
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:13,516
Maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there, but...

1495
02:00:13,622 --> 02:00:16,420
- It was three weeks ago.
- I want you to tell me

1496
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:18,692
where my husband is.

1497
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,689
I demand that
you tell me where my husband is!

1498
02:00:23,799 --> 02:00:26,529
- We can't tell you because we don't know.
- If he gets in touch with you,

1499
02:00:26,635 --> 02:00:29,229
you have got to try to talk sense into him.

1500
02:00:29,337 --> 02:00:32,135
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.

1501
02:00:32,274 --> 02:00:34,469
- You want me to help you out?
- Yes.

1502
02:00:35,043 --> 02:00:39,139
You want me to help out the FBl
that used my husband and sucked him dry,

1503
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:41,909
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become SACs

1504
02:00:42,017 --> 02:00:45,145
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you

1505
02:00:45,487 --> 02:00:48,251
could get promoted to GS-16?

1506
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:50,754
Maggie, come on. You don't mean that.

1507
02:00:52,961 --> 02:00:55,521
Let me tell you something.
I hope he crossed over.

1508
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:59,794
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on
in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover.

1509
02:00:59,901 --> 02:01:02,495
Three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered.

1510
02:01:02,604 --> 02:01:05,471
He's right in the line of fire.
Not because he's one of us,

1511
02:01:05,574 --> 02:01:06,700
because he's one of them.

1512
02:01:06,808 --> 02:01:10,744
Who he's with and who he's close to,
they're all the top dogs now.

1513
02:01:12,914 --> 02:01:15,041
It's just not a problem we anticipated.

1514
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:16,947
We have got to pull him out.

1515
02:01:17,085 --> 02:01:20,885
You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.

1516
02:01:21,256 --> 02:01:22,416
You think so?

1517
02:01:26,461 --> 02:01:28,395
He was here a week ago.

1518
02:01:30,765 --> 02:01:33,598
He snuck into the house after I was asleep.

1519
02:01:35,971 --> 02:01:39,202
And he didn't even wake me up,
didn't even say hello to me.

1520
02:01:43,945 --> 02:01:46,243
He came to get his sport coat.

1521
02:02:01,129 --> 02:02:03,962
- Let's take a walk.
- All right.

1522
02:02:08,003 --> 02:02:09,766
Left, what are we doing?

1523
02:02:09,871 --> 02:02:13,136
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.

1524
02:02:16,544 --> 02:02:20,810
Here it is, Donnie.
Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.

1525
02:02:21,182 --> 02:02:24,640
Now, as long as he's on the loose,

1526
02:02:24,753 --> 02:02:26,380
ain't none of us safe.

1527
02:02:27,022 --> 02:02:28,819
- Right?
- Yeah.

1528
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:31,358
You got no idea where the guy is?

1529
02:02:31,559 --> 02:02:35,586
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He's gonna turn up somewhere.

1530
02:02:36,598 --> 02:02:40,398
Anyway, we got the contract.

1531
02:02:44,205 --> 02:02:46,696
Now, this thing gets done right,

1532
02:02:46,808 --> 02:02:50,437
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.

1533
02:02:50,946 --> 02:02:54,074
- You know what that means?
- Yeah.

1534
02:02:54,215 --> 02:02:55,910
Yeah? What?

1535
02:02:56,051 --> 02:03:00,249
- It means I can't fuck it up.
- You read my mind.

1536
02:03:01,156 --> 02:03:05,388
- You read my mind. You can't fuck it up.
- No, I won't fuck it up.

1537
02:03:10,832 --> 02:03:12,959
You're gonna be a made guy, Donnie.

1538
02:03:13,268 --> 02:03:14,462
Capisce?

1539
02:03:15,537 --> 02:03:17,801
Yeah. All right.

1540
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,167
Yeah. All right.

1541
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:23,776
Come on. Let's go back inside!

1542
02:03:27,849 --> 02:03:29,942
- Left.
- Yeah, what?

1543
02:03:33,221 --> 02:03:35,746
What? I'm freezing here!

1544
02:03:39,527 --> 02:03:42,325
You know that boat you used to have,
that Bertram?

1545
02:03:43,465 --> 02:03:45,296
- Boat? What about it?
- Yeah, boat.

1546
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:49,632
How much is it? A boat like that?
How much? What do you think?

1547
02:03:50,805 --> 02:03:53,774
You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300, used.

1548
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:56,207
Why are you asking me
about boats, Donnie?

1549
02:03:56,311 --> 02:03:58,438
I was just wondering.
I was curious, you know.

1550
02:03:58,546 --> 02:04:00,241
- You're curious about boats?
- Yeah.

1551
02:04:00,348 --> 02:04:02,509
It's 10 degrees out here. I'm freezing.

1552
02:04:02,617 --> 02:04:05,609
You're asking me about boats,
after what we just said?

1553
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:08,582
You losing your marbles on me or what?

1554
02:04:08,723 --> 02:04:11,521
- No, I'm all right.
- So don't ask questions like that.

1555
02:04:11,626 --> 02:04:13,753
- That's crazy, okay?
- Yeah.

1556
02:04:13,895 --> 02:04:17,422
You hit this cocksucker,
and you leave him in the street. Come on.

1557
02:05:20,495 --> 02:05:23,555
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

1558
02:05:23,665 --> 02:05:26,691
I'm looking for something, all right?
I'll be right in.

1559
02:05:27,469 --> 02:05:30,097
That's not gonna work anymore.

1560
02:05:32,407 --> 02:05:33,431
Where is it?

1561
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:35,873
There's $300,000 in that bag.

1562
02:05:37,512 --> 02:05:40,481
How do you know what's in that bag?

1563
02:05:41,249 --> 02:05:42,341
I counted it.

1564
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:43,474
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1565
02:05:43,585 --> 02:05:45,212
- You counted it?
- Yeah.

1566
02:05:45,353 --> 02:05:48,151
What do you mean, you counted it?
It's none of your business.

1567
02:05:48,256 --> 02:05:51,692
Not my business? It's in my house.
Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?

1568
02:05:51,793 --> 02:05:53,761
I want that fucking bag, Maggie.

1569
02:05:53,895 --> 02:05:58,059
FBl men do not walk around
with $300,000 in a bag.

1570
02:05:58,733 --> 02:06:02,134
- Joe, you could go to jail for this.
- Shut the fuck up. Nobody's going to jail.

1571
02:06:02,237 --> 02:06:04,705
Did you think about your children
for a second?

1572
02:06:04,806 --> 02:06:07,366
- You have no idea what you're talking about.
- I don't?

1573
02:06:07,475 --> 02:06:10,239
- The bag belongs to somebody else.
- Does it? Who?

1574
02:06:10,545 --> 02:06:13,275
- Whose bag is it, Joe?
- One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.

1575
02:06:13,381 --> 02:06:17,408
- A fucked-up guy needs $300,000?
- Yeah, right. Where's the goddamn bag?

1576
02:06:19,287 --> 02:06:21,949
You're becoming like them, you know that?

1577
02:07:00,528 --> 02:07:03,861
Did you ever once ask yourself
how I make it through my days?

1578
02:07:04,666 --> 02:07:06,827
I pretend I'm a widow

1579
02:07:07,202 --> 02:07:10,296
with medals and scrapbooks and memories.

1580
02:07:12,574 --> 02:07:14,132
I pretend you're dead.

1581
02:07:14,542 --> 02:07:17,067
That's how my life makes sense to me.

1582
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:20,206
Just go away. Stay away.

1583
02:07:35,897 --> 02:07:39,094
God, why do you hate me
when I love you so much?

1584
02:07:45,073 --> 02:07:46,904
You think I hate you?

1585
02:07:48,076 --> 02:07:49,839
I don't hate you.

1586
02:07:56,284 --> 02:07:58,275
This job is eating me alive.

1587
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,949
I can't breathe anymore.

1588
02:08:04,492 --> 02:08:06,824
And if I come out, this guy Lefty dies.

1589
02:08:09,530 --> 02:08:12,727
They're gonna kill him,
because he vouched for me,

1590
02:08:12,834 --> 02:08:14,597
because he stood up for me.

1591
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:18,102
I live with that every day.

1592
02:08:20,341 --> 02:08:23,435
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet
in his head myself, you understand?

1593
02:08:26,147 --> 02:08:28,775
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.

1594
02:08:28,883 --> 02:08:31,477
You know, the man in the white fucking hat.

1595
02:08:32,353 --> 02:08:33,581
For what?

1596
02:08:36,557 --> 02:08:37,751
For nothing.

1597
02:08:42,964 --> 02:08:45,933
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie.
I am them.

1598
02:09:24,605 --> 02:09:26,539
Left? Donnie.

1599
02:09:26,641 --> 02:09:28,336
Donnie? Where you been?

1600
02:09:28,443 --> 02:09:30,274
Yeah, look...

1601
02:09:30,745 --> 02:09:33,441
- I gotta see you.
- You're right, you gotta see me.

1602
02:09:33,548 --> 02:09:35,539
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?

1603
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:38,380
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.

1604
02:09:38,486 --> 02:09:41,046
- I'll pick you up.
- We don't have time, Donnie.

1605
02:09:41,155 --> 02:09:42,452
- You meet me there.
- Okay.

1606
02:10:06,614 --> 02:10:09,515
Bruno's here. He's down the end of the pier.

1607
02:10:11,018 --> 02:10:13,953
We'll wait here a minute
while he has his drink.

1608
02:10:14,722 --> 02:10:16,952
Let him get a little sleepy.

1609
02:10:18,292 --> 02:10:21,750
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?

1610
02:10:22,463 --> 02:10:24,260
- The boat?
- Yeah.

1611
02:10:25,066 --> 02:10:26,363
Nice.

1612
02:10:27,335 --> 02:10:31,203
Forget about it. One thing I know is boats.

1613
02:10:31,773 --> 02:10:35,573
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water,
take the fucking boat.

1614
02:10:37,945 --> 02:10:42,473
Remember you said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again,

1615
02:10:43,184 --> 02:10:47,052
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette
and just go?

1616
02:10:47,255 --> 02:10:50,952
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody'd ever find you.

1617
02:10:51,058 --> 02:10:54,255
That was before.
Don't remind me about that now.

1618
02:10:54,395 --> 02:10:57,421
- Yeah, but I'm just saying...
- I don't want to think about that.

1619
02:10:57,532 --> 02:10:59,022
Did you mean it?

1620
02:11:00,134 --> 02:11:01,260
Mean it?

1621
02:11:01,636 --> 02:11:04,298
Who am I? Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?

1622
02:11:04,806 --> 02:11:07,240
- I'm saying, what if, Left?
- What if.

1623
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:08,672
What if...

1624
02:11:09,210 --> 02:11:13,340
I mean, I got a couple of things
going on the side. A couple of jewel things.

1625
02:11:14,582 --> 02:11:17,380
Maybe I could get that kind of money
for you.

1626
02:11:20,321 --> 02:11:22,414
You're gonna find money
for me to get a boat?

1627
02:11:22,523 --> 02:11:24,889
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

1628
02:11:25,793 --> 02:11:28,057
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.

1629
02:11:28,162 --> 02:11:32,326
What if I could hand you
a bagful of money right now?

1630
02:11:33,601 --> 02:11:35,501
You know what I'm saying?

1631
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:39,565
You could leave this life.

1632
02:11:40,074 --> 02:11:42,133
You said it yourself, if you don't move up,

1633
02:11:42,243 --> 02:11:44,211
every day you're looking
over your shoulder.

1634
02:11:44,312 --> 02:11:45,677
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1635
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:47,407
- Donnie, listen to me.
- No more bullshit.

1636
02:11:47,515 --> 02:11:49,210
Get out of this life
is what I'm saying, Left.

1637
02:11:49,317 --> 02:11:51,842
- I'm gonna show you something, Donnie.
- What?

1638
02:11:51,953 --> 02:11:54,786
I want you to look at it very carefully.

1639
02:11:56,023 --> 02:11:59,481
And then I want you to think very carefully

1640
02:12:00,828 --> 02:12:03,160
about what you say to me.

1641
02:12:07,168 --> 02:12:09,466
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.

1642
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:22,374
- I really don't think that's the same boat...
- That's the same boat.

1643
02:12:22,483 --> 02:12:25,111
It's got the name on it, The Left Hand.

1644
02:12:25,219 --> 02:12:27,210
It's like my name.

1645
02:12:28,589 --> 02:12:30,853
That's that Abscam boat.

1646
02:12:32,927 --> 02:12:35,521
You think I knew that was a Federal boat?

1647
02:12:37,098 --> 02:12:39,362
You think I'm a fucking rat?

1648
02:12:39,734 --> 02:12:43,226
How many times I have you
into my own house?

1649
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:47,469
Twice a week, at least. Why?

1650
02:12:47,575 --> 02:12:49,975
There it is, "At least. "

1651
02:12:51,979 --> 02:12:53,742
- I cook for you.
- Yeah.

1652
02:12:54,982 --> 02:12:57,314
If ever I had any money, I'd give you.

1653
02:12:58,152 --> 02:13:01,053
I never had any money. But if ever I had...

1654
02:13:01,155 --> 02:13:04,921
$100 in my pocket, I gave you $50, right?

1655
02:13:06,193 --> 02:13:08,718
- Yeah, you did.
- If you're a rat...

1656
02:13:19,707 --> 02:13:24,144
If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.

1657
02:13:24,946 --> 02:13:27,744
Even if this thing is a Federal boat, Left,

1658
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:32,751
they scam all these other people.
They didn't scam us.

1659
02:13:32,853 --> 02:13:34,650
You know what I'm saying?

1660
02:13:36,190 --> 02:13:38,658
We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.

1661
02:13:42,096 --> 02:13:45,327
How do you know
that we walked away from it?

1662
02:13:45,499 --> 02:13:47,524
We're sitting here, right?

1663
02:13:48,269 --> 02:13:51,329
So they tried to outsmart us,
but we outsmarted them.

1664
02:13:53,007 --> 02:13:54,907
We beat the agents.

1665
02:13:58,846 --> 02:14:00,541
You gotta believe me.

1666
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:12,519
Okay.

1667
02:14:15,630 --> 02:14:17,325
Let's go do this work.

1668
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:20,567
Get this over with.

1669
02:14:26,841 --> 02:14:29,173
Two in back of the ear.
Like pushing a button.

1670
02:14:29,276 --> 02:14:30,800
Bing, bing. That's it.

1671
02:14:30,945 --> 02:14:32,640
- Yeah.
- Don't freeze up.

1672
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,907
- You gonna freeze up?
- No.

1673
02:14:35,016 --> 02:14:37,712
- A lot of guys freeze up.
- I'll be all right.

1674
02:14:37,818 --> 02:14:40,844
Did I say you was a rat?
I can't believe you brought that up.

1675
02:14:40,955 --> 02:14:42,718
Come on. Forget about it, Left.

1676
02:14:42,823 --> 02:14:45,087
I never said you was a rat.

1677
02:14:45,326 --> 02:14:46,884
I'm your best friend.

1678
02:14:49,163 --> 02:14:51,290
Come on. Let's go do this thing.

1679
02:15:32,206 --> 02:15:34,572
Come on, Donnie. Come on.

1680
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:38,010
Gotta do it, Don.

1681
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,607
Come on, Don.

1682
02:15:42,216 --> 02:15:43,274
Now!

1683
02:15:44,218 --> 02:15:45,947
Come on.

1684
02:15:47,388 --> 02:15:49,879
FBl! Freeze!

1685
02:15:51,158 --> 02:15:52,250
Shit!

1686
02:15:56,497 --> 02:15:59,466
Don't say nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing to them.

1687
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:04,335
Don't tell them nothing, Donnie!

1688
02:16:04,438 --> 02:16:06,133
Donnie, don't say nothing!

1689
02:16:06,273 --> 02:16:09,970
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's not over. I'm not coming out.

1690
02:16:10,111 --> 02:16:13,774
There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours!
Donnie, you're all right!

1691
02:16:13,881 --> 02:16:15,644
- Shit!
- It's over, man!

1692
02:16:15,783 --> 02:16:18,149
Don't say nothing to them, Donnie!

1693
02:16:18,385 --> 02:16:20,285
It's over, Joe.

1694
02:17:02,429 --> 02:17:06,490
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco.
That's not his real name.

1695
02:17:08,602 --> 02:17:11,662
Truth is, he's been an FBl agent all along.

1696
02:17:14,942 --> 02:17:18,275
You can contact me here if you want to talk.

1697
02:18:08,362 --> 02:18:10,762
Can you believe those fucking guys?

1698
02:18:11,665 --> 02:18:13,758
There's no way Donnie's an agent.

1699
02:18:15,336 --> 02:18:17,497
It's a nice fucking bluff, huh?

1700
02:18:18,138 --> 02:18:20,971
That boat was a set-up.
They set the boat up.

1701
02:18:21,342 --> 02:18:23,503
See? Then we think Donnie's a rat.

1702
02:18:28,749 --> 02:18:31,149
Almost had me going,

1703
02:18:32,152 --> 02:18:33,847
if you didn't know Donnie.

1704
02:18:36,323 --> 02:18:38,484
Right, if I didn't know Donnie.

1705
02:19:01,582 --> 02:19:03,948
Hyenas kill many young cheetahs

1706
02:19:04,084 --> 02:19:07,918
and more than one could overpower
the mother and turn on the cubs.

1707
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,726
Yeah?

1708
02:19:22,603 --> 02:19:24,400
Yeah. All right.

1709
02:19:25,806 --> 02:19:27,273
All right. Okay.

1710
02:19:35,316 --> 02:19:37,409
Was that for me?

1711
02:19:38,118 --> 02:19:42,077
No. It was a guy I got to go see.

1712
02:19:42,523 --> 02:19:45,583
- So late?
- What am I gonna do?

1713
02:19:47,461 --> 02:19:49,088
Who knows with these people?

1714
02:19:49,196 --> 02:19:51,130
- Honey, don't wait up for me tonight.
- No?

1715
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:53,256
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

1716
02:19:53,367 --> 02:19:55,198
And listen to me.

1717
02:20:00,574 --> 02:20:02,474
If Donnie calls

1718
02:20:03,577 --> 02:20:05,135
tell him

1719
02:20:10,484 --> 02:20:12,645
if it was going to be anyone,

1720
02:20:14,021 --> 02:20:17,013
I'm glad it was him, all right?

1721
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:19,359
Look how beautiful you look.

1722
02:20:19,893 --> 02:20:22,054
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.

1723
02:22:09,570 --> 02:22:11,401
Excuse me, Mrs. Pistone.

1724
02:22:12,206 --> 02:22:13,833
Have a seat.

1725
02:22:18,745 --> 02:22:21,942
- "To Special Agent Joseph... "
- Thirty seconds, sir.

1726
02:22:22,649 --> 02:22:27,245
"Joseph D. Pistone, in grateful recognition
for meritorious service. "

1727
02:22:27,421 --> 02:22:32,051
Allow me to present you with this medal
and this check for $500.

1728
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:33,592
Hold the check up.

1729
02:22:34,661 --> 02:22:37,926
- Congratulations again, son.
- Congratulations, Joe.

1730
02:22:39,233 --> 02:22:42,259
- Ma'am, take good care of him.
- I will.

1731
02:22:42,636 --> 02:22:44,103
Mrs. Pistone.

1732
02:23:23,143 --> 02:23:24,701
It's over.

1733
02:23:26,413 --> 02:23:28,472
Come on, honey. Come home.
