1
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,707
The sleeve attaches
to the Pendaflex folder...

2
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:27,710
between the second
and fourth slots from the left.

3
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,757
We've done the same with one of these peel-off
stickers. It goes right on the file folder.

4
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:34,546
Now, each file folder needs to go
into its own Pendaflex folder.

5
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:37,793
You have to make sure
it's the appropriate Pendaflex folder.

6
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,422
Wh-Why does it have to be on the inside
folder and the outside folder?

7
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:43,424
- The case number?
- Yes.

8
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,957
Because it's the key to
the entire system.

9
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,499
It also goes on the report.
All pages.

10
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,922
You punch it with
a two-hole punch.

11
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,671
You attach it to the file folder
on this two-prong fastener.

12
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,794
That way, nothing ever gets lost.

13
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:58,251
Now, misdemeanours go in here.

14
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,338
And felonies go in there.

15
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,342
Hey, plenty of room in there.

16
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,844
Why do you think I'm leavin'? Caseload
number's also on the daily caseload sheet.

17
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:12,675
And today, for example,
we have two... count 'em, two... calls.

18
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,718
Both of 'em down at the pier.

19
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,003
If we drag our feet,
they can carry us through to lunch.

20
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,544
- Happy Birthday, Katie.
- Thanks, Scott.

21
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,881
Hey, could you give me a call
sometime today on the radio?

22
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,839
- Call you? About what?
- I don't know.

23
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:31,639
Make something up. I'm beginning
to think the damn thing's busted.

24
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,637
Police officer!
Out of my way!

25
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:35,637
- Mornin'.
- Mornin', Petey. Dave!

26
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,762
Scott?

27
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,426
Scott?

28
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:49,639
Scott, I made some muffins
for you to take with you.

29
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,638
Oh, you didn't have to do that,
Mrs Remington.

30
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,638
God bless you in that awful city.

31
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,516
We're all hoping that
you don't get shot.

32
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,889
Poor boy.

33
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,682
What?

34
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,346
Seat belt, seat belt, seat belt.
It's the law.

35
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,432
Thank you.

36
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,891
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
- Oh, come on, man.

37
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,726
I can't sit here and smell these
without havin' at least one.

38
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:28,801
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

39
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:32,053
- Just make sure it's just one.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,059
How many days do you have left?

41
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:44,972
- Three.
- Good. Real good.

42
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:47,558
- Why? Am I getting on your nerves?
- Oh, no.

43
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:50,520
I mean, I really appreciate your
showing me the ropes this week...

44
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,803
lettin' me ride around
in your nice, clean car,

45
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,810
and treating me like
a full-fledged detective.

46
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,561
- Investigator.
- Whatever. But, Scott, when are you going to learn to relax?

47
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,723
- I am relaxed.
- Mm-mm.

48
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:06,435
I'm not talkin' about the small "R."
I'm talkin' about the big "R."

49
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,602
You know, "Top of Old Smoky. "

50
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:10,603
- You mean, when am I going to get laid?
- Hey.

51
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,185
Oh, well, I... It's already been
four times this morning.

52
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:15,769
I'm exhausted.

53
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,430
Okay, come on, boys.
Mama's gonna be mad.

54
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:42,269
- Mr Boyett.
- Hey, Scott. How are you doing? I hear we're losing you.

55
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,601
Ah, yeah, 'fraid so, 'fraid so. This
is David Sutton. He'll be replacing me.

56
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,188
- Mister Boyett.
- Come on, boys.

57
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,356
Uh, we came down to tell you that...

58
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:52,559
That they found your dinghy
over in Moss Landing.

59
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:54,815
You should send somebody
to go pick it up.

60
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,935
Yeah, well, thanks. I never thought
I'd get to see that again.

61
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,522
Hey, Scott, could you, uh,
show the boys your, uh, badge?

62
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,525
- They never saw a detective's badge before.
- Sure.

63
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:04,686
- He's a detective?
- Nope, an investigator.

64
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,309
- I don't know, Dad. Looks kind of fake to me.
- Fake?

65
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,898
Hey, kid, you wanna
spend some time in jail?

66
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,737
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, well, yeah. Kids.

67
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,734
Need four hands!

68
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,193
Amos!

69
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:26,853
Amos!

70
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,397
- Who's there?
- It's me! Scott!

71
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,363
Oh. Let me get a leash on him.

72
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:37,191
Yeah, do that!
Please! Thank you.

73
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,646
Amen.

74
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,234
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I brought you a muffin, boy.

75
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:53,322
Here's a muffin for ya.
Nice little muffin, Hooch.

76
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,824
See the muffin?
See the muffin, Hooch?

77
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,159
Here's the muffin for Hooch!

78
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,452
I brought a muffin for ya!
The muffin, Hooch!

79
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,950
Hooch, the muffin!
The muffin, Hooch!

80
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,238
- Medic!
- Hooch! Come here!

81
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:25,078
Amos? Amos.

82
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,206
Let him go, Hooch.
Let go of him, Hooch.

83
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,955
Hooch. Drop him. Drop him, Hooch.

84
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,618
I- I'm sorry, Scott. I don't
have the hand strength I used to.

85
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,081
- You're okay, aren't ya? Huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

86
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,579
I was lookin' forward
to a nice, quiet cup of coffee.

87
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,624
- But now I'm awake!
- Don't let him see that you're angry.

88
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,370
H- He has a sensitive spot.
He reacts real bad to anger.

89
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,749
What is the matter with him?
I brought him a muffin. He knows me!

90
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,365
What, "know ya"?
He didn't even break the skin.

91
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,374
Why, this dog loves ya, boy.

92
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:04,247
Let's go on up to the house
and we'll all have a cookie.

93
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:07,625
Come on, Hooch.
Let's go, boy. Come on.

94
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,501
Doc says I shouldn't
give him these chocolate chips.

95
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,868
Uh, what do you say
about that, Hooch?

96
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:18,876
I thought so.

97
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:21,955
Well, I'm here, Amos.
What's the complaint this time?

98
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:25,288
Them.
That seafood plant.

99
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:27,412
There's somethin' goin' on over there.

100
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,248
- Oh, they're okay, other than a stolen dinghy.
- No, it isn't.

101
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,252
It's worse than it was before.

102
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,038
There's always some strange noises
goin' on at night.

103
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,957
Well, you're always telling me you
don't hear like you used to any more.

104
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,578
Well, I don't hear it.
Hooch hears it.

105
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,705
- He tells me.
- Oh.

106
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,458
Hooch tells you about it.

107
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,631
Well, uh, you live in
a pretty industrial area, Amos.

108
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:55,253
If you want peace and quiet, I suggest
you move to a nice apartment somewhere.

109
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,752
Me and Hooch in an apartment?

110
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:01,295
Yeah, that'd be the sight.

111
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,755
I- I thought you didn't
mind comin' around here.

112
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,456
Oh, I don't mind comin' down here.

113
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,506
It's just, uh, I'm-I'm leaving
on Monday, remember?

114
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,418
Now, the guy who's replacing me...
Sutton...

115
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,217
he's not gonna want to come down
and talk to you like I do,

116
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,708
because he's, well, he's scared
to death of your dog.

117
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:23,166
I can't figure out why.

118
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,421
Whoa, all right! Hey, all right!
That-That's good! Huh?

119
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,840
Yeah, just sit there.
Drool over yourself.

120
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,458
Gave 'im whisky once.

121
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:50,336
Then he howled all night.
Now he sticks to beer.

122
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,926
- You want some?
- No. No.

123
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,092
Thank you,
I'm not on Hooch's hours.

124
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,835
Well, I-I-I really have to get goin'.

125
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,629
Oh.
Movin' up to the big city, huh?

126
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,754
Yeah.

127
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:12,089
Well, maybe me and Hooch
could come and visit.

128
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:15,505
You? Anytime.

129
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,759
Hooch, uh...
Sacramento is the state capital.

130
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,547
I think they have laws
against dogs like Hooch.

131
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,262
Oh, stop.
It's not that funny.

132
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,796
Sorry, man.
I can't help it.

133
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:39,053
Every time I think about it...
I nearly wet my pants!

134
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,423
So do I.
That's why it's not funny.

135
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,509
Delta One, Delta One.

136
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,514
Hey, Katie. Turner can't come
to the phone right now.

137
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,309
- He's got a dog on this throat.
- Now, now. Just say "thank you,"

138
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,306
and then we're, that we're clear.

139
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,425
Thanks for the radio check, Katie.
We're clear.

140
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,007
No, it's business, Turner.
Some kids found money on Pinecone Beach.

141
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,975
So far they've counted $8,000.

142
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,720
- All right, we'll be right there, sure.
- Katie, we're on the way, pronto.

143
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:14,344
- Mrs Harper?
- Oh. Okay.

144
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:17,180
First I thought it was play money.
They had it scattered all over the road.

145
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,598
- Wow.
- Then, when I realized it was real,

146
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:22,217
I had them show me where they found it
so I could show you.

147
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:26,015
Do you suppose, uh,
more money'll wash up here?

148
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,101
- Well, I wouldn't count on it.
- Uh, here's how this works.

149
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:31,476
If no one claims it or identifies it
in 30 days, it's yours.

150
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,638
- Oh.
- I found it. It's mine.

151
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,928
- She can't have any.
- Stop!

152
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,267
Well, I'm confiscating it,
and if you do get it,

153
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:41,269
you have to use it for college.
It's the law.

154
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,932
- See?
- We have some forms you're gonna need to fill out, Mrs Harper.

155
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:46,932
Yes. Stop that!

156
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,807
She wanted a formal
church wedding, and I said fine.

157
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,428
Suddenly, it's two grand
for a wedding dress,

158
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,556
reception with a full bar for 400,

159
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,930
and I'm gonna end up
pickin' up the tab for the honeymoon.

160
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:06,348
They're talkin' Bora Bora.

161
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,603
There he is now.
Didn't you want to talk to him?

162
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:11,849
Yeah. Ferraday!
Want to talk to you.

163
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,188
Ferraday, I'm talkin' to you!

164
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,772
Right there!
What's the hurry?

165
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:57,484
Hooch! Be quiet.

166
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:02,519
For Christ's sake.

167
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,478
You know, I feel like an ass.

168
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,566
I mean, I take you in, I give you
my trust, and what do you do?

169
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:14,399
You take the food off my kid's plate.

170
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:19,687
It was there.
I- I just lost my head.

171
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,943
It won't happen again,
Mr Boyett.

172
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:32,855
Quiet!

173
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:38,444
Casey, get rid of him.
Zack, see if the old man saw anything.

174
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:41,241
Deal with it.

175
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,398
- Hi, there.
- You get out of here.

176
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,193
- You back off!
- I hope I didn't disturb you.

177
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,159
You know, I realize we were making
sort of a racket over there.

178
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,904
In fact, I-I saw your light come on
over here, I realized I woke you up,

179
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,907
and I thought I'd better come over
and make sure everything's all right.

180
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,358
Well, you just mind your own business.
This is private property.

181
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:18,942
Okay, but you know what?
I'm thinking if we disturbed you,

182
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,278
I ought to compensate you a little bit,
just to make up for any inconvenience...

183
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,900
I don't want any of your money.
I've been watching you.

184
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:27,157
I've been seeing
what you're doing over there.

185
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,692
Hey, wait a minute. I can assure you,
we're doing nothing wrong over there.

186
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:31,736
- You get the hell off my dock!
- Don't!

187
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,201
No, don't you shove me.
You understand?

188
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm gonna introduce you to my dog.

189
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,952
Jesus.

190
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:51,418
Hello. Yeah.
Yeah, I am now.

191
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,708
Uh, I'll-I'll be right there.

192
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,124
- Yo.
- Really? Turn around.

193
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:09,208
The dog was guardin' the body.
They had to wrestle him inside.

194
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:12,205
- Ah, d-d-did you talk to anybody?
- Nobody heard or saw anything.

195
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:14,210
Seafood workers spotted the body.

196
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,867
- You ever investigate a murder before?
- Are you kiddin'?

197
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,754
- I moved here to get away from murder scenes.
- Well, everybody's watchin',

198
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,163
so let's look like
we've done this before.

199
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,632
All right.
I got five rolls of film.

200
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,789
Burn it up.

201
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:12,507
Great, it's those jerks from the Sheriff's Department.

202
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:16,007
Hi, guys.

203
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,339
Hello there, ladies.

204
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,376
We'll, uh, call you
if we need any help, Turner.

205
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,081
Foster and McCabe. Glad to see you.
I need coffee, with cream.

206
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,091
- Do you take sugar?
- Two sugars.

207
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:28,052
- Two sugars.
- That's cute. Look, in the spirit of cooperation,

208
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:30,962
I'd love it if you guys would get
the hell out of here. Is that okay?

209
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:32,967
The pier is our jurisdiction, guys.

210
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:36,128
Yeah, but the entire county's the
Sheriff's jurisdiction. You know that.

211
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,501
This is police work, not a lost bicycle.

212
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,427
Excuse me.

213
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:44,426
What is this, a joke?

214
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:46,924
Come on, every little speck of dirt
is not evidence.

215
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:50,716
What are you going to do, Turner?
Put the entire pier in a little baggie?

216
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:54,093
- What is that for?
- To preserve what's ever underneath the fingernails.

217
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:57,634
For what? He was stabbed
in the back, for cryin' out loud.

218
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,003
You can never anticipate
what evidence is going to be important.

219
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,425
- You gather it now, analyse it later.
- Right.

220
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,463
Did you read that in a book?

221
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:06,470
Yeah. Yeah.
I did read that in a book.

222
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,343
It was a great big blue book, but I think
you woulda liked it. It had a lot of pictures!

223
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:13,044
Hey, wait a second. We're all upset here.

224
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:15,848
Why don't we just cooperate?
We all get our jobs done.

225
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,422
Hey, we'd just like to examine the body.
Before it decomposes, you know.

226
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:22,591
Aw...

227
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:25,295
Just gimme a minute with my guys,
would ya, please?

228
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,135
- Not a problem.
- Thanks.

229
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:32,212
Tell ya, Scott, we're gonna have to turn
this over to the Sheriff's Department.

230
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,550
Why? Why?
They couldn't find shoes in a shoe box.

231
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:38,255
Well, you're leavin' town in a few days,
David doesn't have enough experience...

232
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,383
- to handle a murder investigation...
- Oh, yeah, but wait.

233
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,887
I don't have to be in Sacramento for a whole
other week. I was going to take a vacation.

234
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:45,341
I'll just... I'll just cancel it.
I'll just canc...

235
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:48,759
- We can handle this. David's a very good learner.
- Turner's a hell of a teacher.

236
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,765
What's the point of having investigators
on your police force...

237
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:53,216
if all we get to investigate
is stolen mailboxes?

238
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,303
Come on. Howard, I got another
pay cheque coming. Let me earn it.

239
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,307
We can handle this.
We won't let you down.

240
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,841
We deserve a shot at it!

241
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:06,683
All right, just do the best job you
can with the time you got. All right?

242
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:09,382
- All right. - All right.
- All right.

243
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,642
What do we got?

244
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,642
Okay. Well, we're willing
to share the lab reports with you,

245
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,555
and we'll let you examine any evidence
that we gather. Fair enough?

246
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:20,010
- Oh, no. Not fair.
- Not fair.

247
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,267
Sounds fair enough to me.

248
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,805
Oh, excuse me. Are you goin' in there
with just these things?

249
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:35,186
We do this for a living.
Stay out of the way.

250
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,646
Take this stuff. Make sure that
these are all eight by ten glossies.

251
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,939
- Cut it out!
- Why? Get goin'.

252
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:54,270
Get out of the way! Wait!

253
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:56,437
I got him!

254
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:03,310
Turn it around. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

255
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:04,982
Pull, pull, pull!

256
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,059
- Get him around. Easy, easy, easy!
- Here he is! Here he is!

257
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,605
Oh, my God!
Whoa!

258
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,021
Back him up.
Bad dog!

259
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:29,270
Good boy, good boy.
Come on, this way. Over here, boy.

260
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:32,270
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

261
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,725
Oh! Whoa! Slow down, boy.

262
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,194
This... This dog's nuts.

263
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,643
- We're gonna have to shoot him.
- Hey, you're not gonna shoot this dog.

264
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:46,853
He's the closest thing
we have to a witness.

265
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:50,234
Oh, yeah? You think
you can handle him?

266
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,649
You're nuts.

267
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,853
Where are you goin'?

268
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:58,519
He just responds poorly to anger,
that's all.

269
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,733
- Uh, David!
- What?

270
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:04,819
David, bring the car around.

271
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,064
Up as close as you can. Open up the back
doors and leave the engine running.

272
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:13,355
Hey, there, Hooch.

273
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,729
Hey, you s...
You saw the whole thing, didn't ya?

274
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:20,771
Yeah, well, Amos is gone now, so, uh...

275
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,897
You don't have a lot of options.

276
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:26,279
Okay? You are either gonna work
with me, or they're gonna shoot you.

277
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,568
Come on. What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna try...

278
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,986
I'm go... I'm gonna try
to make you a little more...

279
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,024
a little more comfortable, huh?

280
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,320
Oh, don't you just want to
think about it?

281
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,567
Huh? Huh? Here. Here. Here.
Watch. Watch. Watch.

282
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,775
Uh, how do you do this?

283
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,275
Let me just... make ya a little...
more... Oh, there.

284
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:53,989
There, there. Isn't that nice?
Think about it.

285
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:56,274
Maybe we'll get some nice big
chocolate chip cookies.

286
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,815
Yeah. Nice big box of
chocolate chip cookies.

287
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:02,780
The soft kind? The kind
with the 22 chips? Want a cookie?

288
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,577
The ki...

289
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,369
Want a cookie?

290
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:11,196
Come on, Hooch, get in the car!

291
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,867
- Come on, boy.
- You people over there, get back.

292
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,900
Come on!

293
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,197
- Come on!
- Move it back.

294
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,114
- He's got it under control. Stay out of the way.
- Come on, Hooch. Come on, boy.

295
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,153
Aw, goddam it!

296
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:32,574
Hooch!

297
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,153
Oh, yeah, yeah!

298
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,999
What, you tired? Huh? Hope so.

299
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:41,416
If you are, it's just too bad.
Now, look out. Look out.

300
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:43,665
Come on.

301
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,915
Too bad, all right.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute.

302
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:52,616
Hey, you're goin' in the clinic
for a few days, pal.

303
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,744
It's gonna be good for ya.
Come on.

304
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:58,659
Come on! Come on. Come on.

305
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:03,786
Come on, Hooch. Come... Come on.

306
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:06,042
Come... Wait a... Whoa! Hooch!

307
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:09,620
Hooch, no! Stop!
Stop! Hooch!

308
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,580
Hooch! Stop! No!

309
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,877
I'll kill ya.
No, Hooch!

310
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:28,673
Hey, what are you doing to this dog?

311
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,334
- Ow. Ohh! Just taking him for a walk.
- Well, he's bleeding.

312
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,168
- My God, how long has he been bleeding?
- Not long enough.

313
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,830
- You! I'll kill ya.
- Hey. Now, I have a front door, you know.

314
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:40,715
- I'll shoot you, Hooch. I'll shoot you, Hooch.
- Well, you stay there.

315
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:44,172
- You just stay right there.
- Fix him up so I can shoot him.

316
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,339
All right. All done. You stay.

317
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:10,507
- What's your dog's name?
- Uh, uh, his name is Hooch, but...

318
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,673
Those wounds needed stitching.

319
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,291
- When was the last time he saw a vet?
- I don't know.

320
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,426
Well, that's neglect. And it's
borderline abuse. I mean, he's filthy.

321
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,385
His diet is terrible,
and look, if you cannot...

322
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,632
Well, no, hey, no,
this is not my dog.

323
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:25,634
He belonged to an old man
who lived down by the pier.

324
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:27,799
- Well, then, I want to speak to him.
- You can't.

325
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,595
- He was murdered last night.
- Whoa. God.

326
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,635
I'm Scott Turner, I'm the, um,
police investigator here in town...

327
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:36,963
I know. I mean, we use the same bank.
Emily Carson.

328
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:38,968
- Oh, we do? Oh. Well. Oh.
- Yes. Yes.

329
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:41,419
- I'm sorta new here, but it's a small
town, so... - It's ni-nice to meet you.

330
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:43,841
- I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
- That's quite all right.

331
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,879
I can't stand seeing animals mistreated.

332
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:49,344
- Can I ask you a question regarding the dog?
- Yes. Come in.

333
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:54,011
There's a good chance, I think,
that he was a witness to the, uh, crime.

334
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,011
He may have to identify a suspect.
Can he do that?

335
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,636
- Yes. Maybe.
- Can I show him, like, a photograph?

336
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,218
Like a, like a mug shot? And...

337
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,714
- You don't know much about dogs, do
you? - Well, no, I n-never had one.

338
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,930
- Not even as a kid?
- N-No. No way.

339
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,593
Well, dogs don't see
in two dimensions.

340
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:14,841
I mean, he could recognize a voice,
or a scent, but not a photo.

341
00:28:14,974 --> 00:28:17,428
- All right. All right.
- Come on, Hooch. Come on!

342
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:20,011
Uh, doesn't he have to... recoup?

343
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:23,056
Well, no.
He's a little tired, but he's okay.

344
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:25,091
You're a good "dawg. "
Yes.

345
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:29,468
- Boy, you sure are good with animals.
- Yeah. I'm a vet.

346
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,604
You're buttering me up for something.

347
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:36,304
Well, I-I just can't help but think that
this dog is gonna be a lot better off...

348
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:38,812
with someone like you,
than with someone like me.

349
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:41,431
- 'Cause I-I don't know... Thank you.
- Are you married?

350
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,439
No.

351
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,523
- You live alone, then?
- Yeah.

352
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,523
- House, or an apartment?
- House.

353
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,808
Yeah?
You have a girlfriend?

354
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,610
- No.
- Well, perfect.

355
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:55,650
- Perfect? Perfect for who?
- Perfect for Hooch.

356
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,064
- For Hoo... How?
- When you're home, he'll keep you company,

357
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,813
and when you're gone,
he'll take care of your house.

358
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:04,524
- You're lucky to have him.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't have room for a dog like Hooch.

359
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:09,357
Not many people do. I gotta go work.
Goodbye, Scott Turner.

360
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,152
What?

361
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,353
What? What is it?
What? What?

362
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:56,186
Are ya... If you're hungry, finish
the hamburgers. Ya... Eat the buns.

363
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,693
Eat the buns. If you're not thirsty...

364
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:01,525
You know, you're not touching the water,
the orange juice, cranapple.

365
00:30:01,657 --> 00:30:03,529
What is it?
What am I supposed to do?

366
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:07,402
Make you a margarita?

367
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,986
Shut up! God!

368
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:12,783
Shut up! This has been going on
for two and a half hours.

369
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:15,112
Just be quiet!

370
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,489
A- All right. All right. All right.
You tell me what I'm supposed to do.

371
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:48,941
You tell me what I am supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do?

372
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:50,949
You tell me.
What am I supposed to do?

373
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:52,949
What am I supposed to do, Hooch?

374
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:55,068
Am I supposed to stand out
on the porch all night long?

375
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:58,533
Give him a Valium, Turner. Take one yourself.

376
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,489
Hey, shut up!
I'm a policeman.

377
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,404
Gu... Want your car towed?

378
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,493
Man, I hate you.

379
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,160
Oh, no!

380
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:28,821
Aah! You!

381
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:32,321
Aw, ya stupid dog!

382
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,328
No.

383
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,778
Ah, ya stupid dog!

384
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:52,827
Oh, you wanna chew my head off?

385
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:56,287
Go ahead. You'll be trapped inside
and you'll starve to death.

386
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,571
That is, if they don't find
my body first and then shoot you.

387
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:02,404
You're in my house.
Back off. I'm comin' in.

388
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,408
Back off, Hooch!

389
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,953
Back off.

390
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,916
Back.

391
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:32,911
All right.

392
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:37,084
If we're gonna get along, we're gonna
have to come to a certain understanding.

393
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,750
These are the simple rules: No barking.

394
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,002
No growling. You will not lift your leg
to anything in this house.

395
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,249
This is not your room.

396
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,876
No slobbering.
No chewing.

397
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:59,374
You will wear a flea collar.

398
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:01,411
This is not your room.

399
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:06,710
No begging for food. No sniffing of crotches.

400
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:09,836
And you will not
drink from my toilet.

401
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:12,332
This is not your room.

402
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:17,749
This is your room.

403
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:21,829
The rest of the house is mine,

404
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:23,835
and when I come back into my house,

405
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:26,333
I like to find everything
where I put it.

406
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,664
Everything in its place.
Now, you don't touch my stuff.

407
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:33,246
And I certainly
won't touch any of yours.

408
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,369
Well, this is the room to do that.

409
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:42,417
This is your bed.

410
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:46,756
You follow these very simple rules...

411
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:48,838
and shut up,

412
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:50,838
we'll get along fine.

413
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:23,088
Hey, Scott.

414
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:59,220
So what does it tell you?

415
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:01,669
Not much. I never read
an autopsy report before,

416
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:03,677
and I'd just as soon
never read one again.

417
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,589
Autopsy report's the cornerstone
of any homicide investigation.

418
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:10,004
This one tells us that the perpetrator
probably had special combat training.

419
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,462
- Where did you see that?
- Right here. "The murder weapon penetrated the body...

420
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:14,505
"between the third and fourth ribs,
at an upward angle...

421
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,795
"entering the right lung
at a depth of two inches,

422
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,803
severing the pulmonary artery. "

423
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,803
I read that. The victim was stabbed from
behind on the right side of the rib cage,

424
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,803
which would make
the killer right-handed.

425
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,803
Yeah, yeah.
But you're missing something.

426
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:27,171
Now, you stab somebody in the heart,
they can still scream.

427
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,795
But you penetrate the lung,
they can't even let out a whisper.

428
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:31,804
They're trained to do that
in Special Forces.

429
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:33,804
Well, that wasn't in the report.
How did you know that?

430
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:37,133
I'm a professional investigator.
It's my business to know these things.

431
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,138
Besides,
I called the coroner and he told me.

432
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:42,383
Hey, fellas.

433
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:46,890
How much do you think we could get for
all of the furniture here in the office?

434
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:50,217
Or I got a better idea, how about
we sell a couple of squad cars,

435
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,222
startin' with yours first, Turner?

436
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,222
- Is there a problem, Howard?
- Well, yeah. There sure is.

437
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,684
I mean, the county crime lab wanted
to charge me $7,280 for this stuff.

438
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,883
Now, suppose I send all of this in,

439
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:04,506
who do you suggest I lay off?

440
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,514
Hmm?

441
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:11,266
Katie. Katie wouldn't mind
making the sacrifice, would you, Katie?

442
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:13,597
- I've sacrificed enough for you, Tur...
- Oh, hey!

443
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:16,097
- We'll thin this out, Howard. I'll go through it.
- Please.

444
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:19,178
Don't worry. I'll thin it out.
Howard. It's fine.

445
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:27,966
Oh, no, no, no!
You're eatin' the car!

446
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,599
Don't eat the car!
Not the car!

447
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:35,224
Oh, what am I yellin' at you for?
You're a dog.

448
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:38,221
Don't understand a word I'm sayin'.

449
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:41,021
What does it matter anyway? This car is
gonna be David Sutton's in a couple of days.

450
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:44,263
Here. You hungry? Here.
Here's an ashtray. Eat that.

451
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,349
You know,
it's a terrible thing about Amos.

452
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,519
I'm lockin' my door tonight,
for the first time in years.

453
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,729
Oh, now, don't-don't do that.
We'll-We'll catch the guy.

454
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,687
L- I-Is this dog food?
It says turkey and bacon.

455
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,102
Oh yeah. You know, people love
their dogs, so they want a variety.

456
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:25,028
- What kinda dog are we talkin' about?
- Oh, very, very, very big.

457
00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:29,397
Very large, very tall.
Very, very wide. Massive. Ugly.

458
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,650
Ah-ha. Well.
You don't need this.

459
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,314
What you need is...

460
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,484
this!

461
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,480
I don't even like the dog, Kevin.
Why would I get him a toy?

462
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,772
Because dogs like to chew, Scott.
I mean, it's either chew this,

463
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:15,779
or your furniture or your shoes.

464
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:18,478
- It's up to you.
- Okay.

465
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:44,030
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
At the Imperial Raceway in San Rapello.

466
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,526
The world-class semifinals of
the N.R.D.A. Funny car competition!

467
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,322
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

468
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:00,025
I'd like to thank you, Kevin,
for taking all this time away...

469
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,032
Oh, no, no problem.
It's my pleasure.

470
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,400
- Dog shampoo.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's regular, no.

471
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,155
What you need is... Yeah, medicated.
There, that's what you need.

472
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:10,071
Let's see.
Flea, tick, uh, wormer...

473
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:21,619
Scott! Oh, Scott! In case of
bad breath, regular, or minty?

474
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,284
Thank you, Kevin.

475
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,706
- Ninety-seven fifty-one.
- Ninety-seven fifty-one?

476
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:42,319
What? Is that...
Is that pesos?

477
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:45,738
This is for a dog. This is dog food.
Ninety-seven fifty-one?

478
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,745
I'm not gonna eat this stuff!

479
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:50,824
Uh, did I buy smoked salmon?
Ninety-seven fifty-one!

480
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:52,829
How much if I take this back?

481
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:56,405
I'd like to talk to Kevin.
Can you call him, please? Kevin!

482
00:43:01,383 --> 00:43:04,334
You get off of there.
Off!

483
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,211
All right, that's it.
I'm gettin' my gun.

484
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:17,253
My rod, my piece,
my iron, my heater,

485
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:19,838
my gat, my lead-hurler!

486
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,252
Do not come back!

487
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:57,008
Oh, wow. Wow.

488
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:59,708
That dog's got a lot of guts.

489
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,009
Either that, or he's stupid.
No!

490
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:05,543
You are out! Out.

491
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,341
Out for good. Forget it, I wish it was snowing.

492
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,427
No, no. I wish it was hailing.

493
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:14,090
I wish it was hailing, God.

494
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:17,919
Send me hail the size of cantaloupes,

495
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,927
If you're a just and fair God.

496
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:22,130
No!

497
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:27,261
Cut it...

498
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:30,341
No, the...
I'm runnin' out of doors.

499
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:38,633
Oh, no. No.
She cannot spend the night.

500
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:58,216
Get back. Get back.

501
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,716
You, you go ahead. Not you.
No, no, no. Come on.

502
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:04,719
Not you, just her.
Get back in the car.

503
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,594
Wait a minute, what am I doin'?
What am I doin'?

504
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:12,215
Go ahead, Hooch.
Go ahead. Go. Go!

505
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,559
Go.
Go. Go ahead. Go, boy, go.

506
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:21,051
Follow her. Follow her, boy.
She wants ya, man!

507
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:24,764
This is why she's doin' this,
so you'll follow her. In. In. In.

508
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:26,766
Go in, go in, go in.

509
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,804
Hi.

510
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:35,384
- Scott Turner, right?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for my dog. Have you seen him?

511
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,434
Yeah, I noticed.
You know anything about fuses?

512
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,718
- Electrical fuses?
- Uh, yeah. Can you come in?

513
00:45:40,853 --> 00:45:42,974
For two minutes?
Just two minutes.

514
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:46,055
- A fuse box? Sure.
- Come in.

515
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,720
- Bedroom light is on!
- Huh? What?

516
00:45:50,854 --> 00:45:55,844
- What?
- Bedroom light is on!

517
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,433
So tell me when
the bathroom light goes on.

518
00:45:58,563 --> 00:46:00,435
Mm, all right!

519
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,894
Hey!

520
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:12,979
- Hey!
- Uh, no, not yet.

521
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:28,732
Uh, look, thank you, but, uh...

522
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:31,062
The-The... Your lights are on. This is
going to take you all night, you know.

523
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:33,182
No, actually, I just quit.

524
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:37,554
- You were gonna leave it like this?
- Yes.

525
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:40,523
- Oh.
- I'm gonna start again tomorrow, but...

526
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:43,055
Well, you, ah, don't have
to help, but there's...

527
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,597
a couple of rollers there,
and an extra brush.

528
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,897
- This really bothers you.
- This would make me nuts, yeah.

529
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:53,559
It's harder to cut it in a big town
than it is in a small town.

530
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:55,564
Aw, that's a crock.

531
00:46:55,692 --> 00:46:57,897
- Oh?
- In a big town, you're anonymous.

532
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,017
You make your mistakes,
no one sees it.

533
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,233
Who cares? In a small town, you got
to look everybody right in the eye.

534
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,358
Oh. Well, there's a...
There's a lot more to it than that.

535
00:47:06,485 --> 00:47:08,725
Well, that's true. You'll probably
have better luck with women.

536
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,399
Women in big cities outnumber the men,
so they're more desperate.

537
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:16,063
Thank you very much.

538
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:18,066
If you have opinions about anything,

539
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:20,066
I want to encourage
you to express them.

540
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:22,730
Don't be shy. Just blurt them right out.

541
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:24,733
Well, you're better off here.

542
00:47:24,862 --> 00:47:27,232
- Oh, yeah?
- It's a wonderful town to raise kids in.

543
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:30,775
- Well, I don't have kids.
- Well, I want five kids.

544
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:34,021
How about a dad? Huh? Have you got
a dad picked out for these five kids?

545
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:36,725
- No. Not yet.
- No?

546
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:40,773
- Well, let me fill you in on the Cypress Beach singles scene.
- God, I hate that phrase...

547
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:43,572
- "The Singles Scene. "
- There's Embers Cocktail Lounge.

548
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:48,852
Or, what else?
I guess the, uh, well, the Dairy Queen.

549
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:51,904
But I usually arrest guys my age
who are hanging out at the Dairy Queen.

550
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:55,193
'Course, you're pretty opinionated, and
you want to have those five kids, so...

551
00:47:55,322 --> 00:48:00,228
- That I am.
- And we are...

552
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:02,153
- Uh, yeah.
- Finished.

553
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:06,278
- This is good.
- Yeah.

554
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:08,278
- Doesn't it feel good?
- This feels very good.

555
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:10,029
- Huh?
- I got to admit it.

556
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:21,903
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

557
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:27,563
Thank you.

558
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:33,788
You have paint all over you.

559
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,788
It's even up in your hair.

560
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,872
Look at you.
You don't even have it on your hands.

561
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,237
- Spotless.
