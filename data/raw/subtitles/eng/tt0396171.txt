1
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:19,111
Quick.

2
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,152
We can't hold them back much longer.

3
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:25,152
Hurry.

4
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,027
- Come on!
- Get up!

5
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:38,985
Quick!

6
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,361
Faster!

7
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,361
Open the doors. Come on, quickly!

8
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,194
Just read them the sentence.

9
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:38,111
The sentence of the court
is that in two days hence

10
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:42,444
the perfumer journeyman
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

11
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,860
shall be bound to a wooden cross

12
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,486
with his face raised toward heaven.

13
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,985
And whilst still alive

14
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,777
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod

15
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:02,403
breaking the joints of his arms,

16
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:05,027
his shoulders,

17
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,069
his hips,

18
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:08,694
his legs.

19
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:15,152
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead

20
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,528
and all customary acts of mercy

21
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,361
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

22
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,236
In 18th-century France,

23
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:35,361
there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted

24
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,528
and notorious personages
of his time.

25
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:42,486
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

26
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:46,111
and if his name has been
forgotten today, it is

27
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:50,694
for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain

28
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,361
that leaves no trace in history:

29
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,236
To the fleeting realm of scent.

30
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,277
In the period of which we speak,

31
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:19,985
there reigned
in the cities a stench

32
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,902
barely conceivable to us
modern men and women.

33
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,111
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris,

34
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,860
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

35
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:34,444
And nowhere in Paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant

36
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,652
than in the city's fish market.

37
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,027
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

38
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:46,568
It was here, then, on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom,

39
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,652
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

40
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,568
was born
on the 17th of July, 1738.

41
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,819
It was his mother's fifth birth.

42
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,568
She'd delivered them all here
under her fishstand

43
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,777
and all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths,

44
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:25,985
You all right?

45
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,027
And the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river.

46
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:33,860
It would be much the same today

47
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,361
but then,

48
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:39,735
Jean-Baptiste chose differently

49
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,694
What's that noise?

50
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,944
- It's a baby.
- What's going on here?

51
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,985
It's a newborn.

52
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:25,819
Where's its mother?

53
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:28,610
She was just here.

54
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,694
She tried to kill it.
Her own child.

55
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,403
She tried to kill her baby!

56
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,568
There! There she is!

57
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,443
Stop! Stop where you are!

58
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,568
Murderer!

59
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,652
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips

60
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:49,069
sent his mother to the gallows

61
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:55,319
and Jean -Baptiste,
by official order,

62
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,443
to the orphanage
of Madame Gaillard.

63
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,985
How many today?

64
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,319
Four. Well, three and a half.

65
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,735
As usual, more dead than alive.

66
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,652
Just take the money and sign.

67
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,527
Make room.

68
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,944
- Where?
- Move!

69
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,694
Go on, now.

70
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:44,777
Is it dead?

71
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
That's not staying in my bed.

72
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,527
- Let's throw it out, then.
- What if it screams?

73
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:19,902
Let's just kill it.

74
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:40,777
Harder! Push!

75
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,069
What are you doing?

76
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:57,568
For Mme Gaillard, Grenouille was a
source of income, like any other.

77
00:08:58,402 --> 00:08:59,610
The children, however,
sensed at once

78
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,860
that there was something
different about him.

79
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:24,944
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

80
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:30,610
But he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind.

81
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,318
It was not that the other
children hated him,

82
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,402
they felt unnerved by him.

83
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:48,777
Increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell

84
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:52,527
was a gift that had been
given to him, and him alone.

85
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:04,819
When Jean-Baptiste
did finally learn to speak

86
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:08,318
he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate

87
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:12,485
for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself

88
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,235
Wood.

89
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,735
Warm wood.

90
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:28,193
Grass.

91
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,360
Wet grass.

92
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,944
Stones.

93
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,110
Warm stones.

94
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:38,860
Water.

95
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,610
Cold water.

96
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,694
Frog.

97
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:54,402
Wet stones.

98
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:58,860
Big, wet frog stones.

99
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:01,652
Something.

100
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:05,193
Something.

101
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,069
Something.

102
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:13,360
By 13, Mme Gaillard no longer
had room for Jean-Baptiste

103
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,902
and therefore
decided to sell him.

104
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,694
Come on.

105
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:21,402
Ten francs.

106
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:26,819
From his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man...

107
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:29,193
Seven, and not one sou more.

108
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,235
Grenouille knew that
his life in Grimal's tannery

109
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:35,527
would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish.

110
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,694
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard,

111
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,694
the bargain was short-lived.

112
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:57,735
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years

113
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,276
but Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

114
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,652
He adjusted to his new fate

115
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,068
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence.

116
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:12,193
Slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

117
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:17,819
Gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery,

118
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:23,360
where a Utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him.

119
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:48,944
Grenouille!

120
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,527
Come with us. I'm taking you
to town for delivery.

121
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:00,318
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed.

122
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,819
He was alive

123
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,984
and at last he was
in his element.

124
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,527
He was not choosy.

125
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:52,318
He did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad

126
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,777
at least not yet.

127
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:00,901
He was very greedy.

128
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,276
The goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors.

129
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:12,276
His only condition being,
that they were new ones.

130
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:18,735
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel

131
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:23,026
which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces.

132
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:41,151
Grenouille!

133
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,151
Come on!

134
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:51,652
Get your ass over here!

135
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:58,151
He needs two dozen skins
by next week. Can you do that?

136
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,652
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, come with me.

137
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,485
What is it called?

138
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,901
"Amor and Psyche", madame.
My latest creation.

139
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,360
May I try it?

140
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,859
If you'll allow me, mademoiselle.

141
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,610
Sheer heaven!

142
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:33,485
Monsieur Pelissier,
you are truly an artiste.

143
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,068
Please, take them.
I've got far too many.

144
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,568
What do you want?

145
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:13,943
Want to buy some?

146
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,235
Two for a sou.

147
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:45,442
Next time you run off like that,
I'll kill you!

148
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,234
That night, he could not sleep.

149
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:58,192
The intoxicating power of the
girl '5 scent made it clear to him

150
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,526
why he'd come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

151
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:08,317
The purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny.

152
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:12,651
He would learn
how to preserve scent

153
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:17,068
so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty.

154
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:45,275
There were about a dozen
perfumers in Paris in those days.

155
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:50,693
One of them, the once-celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

156
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:54,401
had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called Pont Au Change

157
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,651
on his arrival in Paris
over thirty years ago.

158
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:02,484
To be sure, at one time in
his youth, Baldini had created

159
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:06,776
several truly great perfumes,
to which he owed his fortune.

160
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,943
But now Baldini was

161
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,234
out of touch, out of fashion,

162
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:17,150
and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came.

163
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,068
- Chenier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

164
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:22,317
Put on your wig.

165
00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:24,693
Put on your wig!

166
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,068
You going out?

167
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,901
I wish to retire to my study
for a few hours

168
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,567
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

169
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,359
Will you be creating a new
perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

170
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,526
Correct. For Count Verhamont.

171
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,901
He has asked for something like...
I think he said it was called

172
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:47,901
Amor and Psyche from that swindler
in the Rue Saint André des Arts.

173
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:49,109
Pelissier?

174
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,609
Pelissier, that's him.

175
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:54,984
Amor and Psyche!

176
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:00,651
Do you know it?

177
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:03,734
Oh, yes. You can smell it
everywhere these days, monsieur.

178
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,317
On every street corner.

179
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:10,943
In fact, I just
purchased you a sample.

180
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,401
In case you wanted to test it.

181
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:20,609
What on earth makes you think I'd
be interested in testing it?

182
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,234
You're right.
It's nothing special.

183
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:28,609
Actually
it's a very common scent.

184
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,984
I believe the head chord
contains lime oil.

185
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,401
Really? And the heart chord?

186
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,192
Orange blossom, I believe.

187
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,776
And civet in the base chord,

188
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,484
but, you know,
I cannot say for sure.

189
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,526
Well, I couldn't care less
what that bungler Pelissier

190
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,984
- slops into his perfumes.
- Naturally not, monsieur.

191
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:54,859
And I am thinking of creating
something for Count Verhamont

192
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,192
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

193
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,234
I'm sure it will,
Monsieur Baldini.

194
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:06,025
Take charge of the shop, Chenier,
and don't let anyone come near me.

195
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:09,317
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

196
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:53,317
Is there anything else you need?

197
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,234
Inspiration, perhaps.

198
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:58,067
Ah, my Giuseppe.

199
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,192
You are still
the great perfumer Baldini.

200
00:31:59,025 --> 00:31:59,942
Wonderful.

201
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,818
He did it again.

202
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:14,942
Lime oil.

203
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:19,900
Orange blossom,

204
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:21,484
to be sure.

205
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:28,067
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

206
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,067
No.

207
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:34,275
Or could be cinnamon?

208
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:37,651
It's gone.

209
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,526
Cinnamon.

210
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:44,942
It's not cinnamon.

211
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:49,983
Cloves.

212
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,234
No.

213
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:53,317
Musk?

214
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:54,150
No.

215
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,317
Who's there?

216
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:38,442
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

217
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,609
I've got the goatskins
you ordered.

218
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:50,858
Follow me.

219
00:33:57,442 --> 00:33:58,067
This way.

220
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:33,609
There.

221
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:35,275
Lay them there.

222
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:47,442
Tell your master
that the skins are fine.

223
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,817
I'll come by in the next
few days and pay for them.

224
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,942
Yes, Monsieur.

225
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,983
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

226
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,651
Why, of course and so it shall.

227
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,401
With Amor & Psyche by Pelissier?

228
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,192
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

229
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,567
It's all over you.

230
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,275
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands...

231
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:23,526
It's bad, Amor & Psyche
is, Master.

232
00:35:23,692 --> 00:35:25,234
There's too much rosemary in it.

233
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:26,567
And too much of...

234
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,067
that and that.

235
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:36,484
Bergamot and Patchouli?

236
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:37,359
Pat...?

237
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:39,442
Patchouli.

238
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,651
Patchouli.

239
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,025
What else?

240
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,817
That and that.

241
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:55,192
That and that.

242
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:06,609
Orange blossom,

243
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:09,067
lime...

244
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,900
- Rosemary.
- Musk.

245
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:17,025
And cloves?

246
00:36:17,484 --> 00:36:18,192
And this.

247
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,983
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

248
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:33,192
- Storax.
- Storax.

249
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:43,067
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man.

250
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,526
My nose knows all the smells
in the world.

251
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:48,526
It's the best nose in Paris,
only I don't know the names.

252
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:50,150
I need to learn the names,
learn them all...

253
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:51,442
No, no, no!

254
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,359
You don't interrupt me
when I'm speaking.

255
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:55,484
You are both impertinent
and insolent.

256
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,817
Even I don't know every scent.

257
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:04,650
I've, of course, known for some time
the ingredients of Amor & Psyche.

258
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:08,858
But all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose, nothing else.

259
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,900
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer

260
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,733
to detect the exact formula,

261
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:19,317
which notes, which chords,

262
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,817
and in what precise measurements.

263
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:26,608
Could you tell me the exact
formula of Amor & Psyche?

264
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:30,692
Best-nose-in-Paris!

265
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:37,150
Speak up!

266
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:40,109
You see, you can't. Can you?

267
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,900
And I'll tell you why.

268
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:45,817
Because talent means
next to nothing,

269
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,858
while experience acquired

270
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,484
in humility and hard work
means everything.

271
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:01,442
I don't know what a formula is,

272
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,442
but I can make Amor & Psyche
for you now.

273
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,401
And you think I just let you
slop around in my laboratory

274
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,692
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

275
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:12,650
YOU?

276
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:14,442
YES.

277
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:16,150
Now pay attention!

278
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:21,317
What is your name, anyway?

279
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,025
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

280
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,900
Very well,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

281
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:35,442
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion.

282
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:38,608
Your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you

283
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,650
to learn the virtue of humility.

284
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:43,775
- How much do you want me to make?
- How much of what...?

285
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,733
How much Amor & Psyche do you want?

286
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,025
Shall I fill this flask?

287
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,192
No! You shall not!

288
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,067
You may fill this one.

289
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,359
Yes, Master.

290
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:09,401
But, Master Baldini...

291
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,942
You must let me do it in my own way.

292
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:14,608
As you please.

293
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,317
No!

294
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:26,150
Don't drop it. That's pure alcohol.
You want to blow up the building?

295
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:30,733
You have to measure it first!

296
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:21,275
Stop, stop it!

297
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:22,983
That's enough!

298
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:24,608
You know nothing!

299
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:27,858
Essential oils are always
to be mixed first,

300
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:29,900
then the alcohol added

301
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:33,109
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that!

302
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:36,525
I must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish!

303
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:40,025
It's all done.

304
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:27,858
This is Amor & Psyche!

305
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:31,566
But it's not
a good perfume, Master.

306
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:36,650
If you let me again, Master,
I'll make it more better.

307
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:53,983
Now it's a really good perfume.

308
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:03,192
Don't you want
to smell it, Master?

309
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,358
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

310
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,900
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

311
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:12,025
- But, Master...
- Go! Now!

312
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,858
Can I come to work
for you, master? Can I?

313
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:34,067
Let me think about it.

314
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:34,858
Master!

315
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:39,983
I have to learn
how to keep smell!

316
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:42,067
What?

317
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,983
Can you teach me that?

318
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,191
I shall have to think
about it. Now, go.

319
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:35,983
I love you.

320
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:45,233
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

321
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:53,817
Grenouille!

322
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,149
Grimal's transaction

323
00:44:57,316 --> 00:44:59,733
had a profound effect
on all three parties.

324
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,067
Not least upon
Monsieur Grimal himself

325
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:12,733
As for Giuseppe Baldini,
the acquisition of Grenouille

326
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,191
miraculously transformed
his dwindling business

327
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:19,025
even surpassing its former glory.

328
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,149
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

329
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:31,900
the mysterious secrets
of the perfumers craft

330
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:34,108
began to unfold.

331
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,066
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

332
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:46,400
Just like a musical chord,
a perfume chord contains

333
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:47,733
four essences

334
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,733
or notes, carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

335
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,858
Each perfume contains three chords:

336
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:57,025
The head, the heart and the base,

337
00:45:57,608 --> 00:45:59,900
necessitating twelve notes in all.

338
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:02,817
The head chord contains

339
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:05,525
the first impression,
lasting a few minutes

340
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:07,733
before giving way
to the heart chord,

341
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,316
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

342
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:13,817
Finally, the base chord,

343
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:17,900
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

344
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,650
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians
believed that one can only create

345
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:29,733
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note,

346
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:33,858
one final essence
that will ring out

347
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,650
and dominate the others.

348
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,525
Legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb

349
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:47,775
and when it was opened
a perfume was released.

350
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:50,900
After all those thousands of years,

351
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:55,066
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power,

352
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:57,775
that for one single moment

353
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:02,108
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise.

354
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,858
Twelve essences could be identified,

355
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:09,358
but the 13th,

356
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:11,692
the vital one,

357
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:15,608
could never be determined.

358
00:47:17,566 --> 00:47:18,358
Why not?

359
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,024
Why not?
What do you mean, why not?

360
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:27,149
Because it's a legend, numbskull!

361
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,692
What's a legend?

362
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:33,108
Never mind.

363
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:16,358
Jean-Baptiste.

364
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:17,817
Jean-Baptiste?

365
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:25,191
What's the matter?

366
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:26,441
Master,

367
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:29,650
I have to learn
how to capture scent.

368
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:33,817
What are you talking about?

369
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,066
I have to learn
how to capture scent

370
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:38,650
and reprise it forever.

371
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,525
You mean, preserve.

372
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:42,233
You have to teach me that.

373
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:44,400
All right.
Calm down, my boy.

374
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:45,899
Calm down.

375
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:48,149
We have work to do.

376
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,733
"The soul of beings is their scent."

377
00:48:54,108 --> 00:48:55,483
You said that, master.

378
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:57,858
Did I?

379
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:00,817
I will make you
as many perfumes as you want

380
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,608
but you have to teach me

381
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,108
how to capture
the smell of all things.

382
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:07,817
Can you do that?

383
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:11,650
Well, naturally.

384
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,899
Then teach me
everything you know

385
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,899
and I'll make you the best
perfume in the whole world.

386
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:40,066
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste,

387
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:43,274
ten thousand roses to produce

388
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:46,483
one single ounce of essential oil.

389
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:53,733
Now, keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew

390
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:58,483
while I set up the alembic.
And take care not to damage them.

391
00:49:58,775 --> 00:50:01,899
We have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact.

392
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:21,857
Perfect.

393
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:24,566
Now, help me
with the Moor's head.

394
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:39,441
Temperature is vital.

395
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:43,316
When the quicksilver is here,
the heat is precisely correct

396
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:46,108
and the oil will gradually rise.

397
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:52,857
Note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising.

398
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:56,525
You will observe how cold water

399
00:50:57,149 --> 00:50:59,774
is pumped through here

400
00:51:02,149 --> 00:51:05,441
allowing the essence
to condense here

401
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:09,692
until it finally appears

402
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:12,525
here.

403
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:17,108
Of course,
out on the hillside above Grasse

404
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,982
we had only to bellow
pure, fresh air.

405
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:24,525
Ah, Grasse. What a town.

406
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,191
The Rome of scents.

407
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:31,941
The Promised Land of perfume.

408
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,816
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer

409
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:42,525
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

410
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:47,774
Not to worry.
Happens all the time.

411
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:50,525
To Grasse.

412
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:09,816
Master.

413
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:12,149
Look.

414
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:20,066
The very soul of the rose.

415
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:15,358
Jean-Baptiste.

416
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:19,941
What's wrong?

417
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:22,982
Jean-Baptiste.

418
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,483
What have you done?

419
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:30,191
- You lied.
- What?

420
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:32,149
You lied to me.

421
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:36,274
How dare you talk to me like that.

422
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:40,441
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

423
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:42,483
And so you can.

424
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:48,066
What do you smell?

425
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:50,483
What do you smell?

426
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:56,732
Nothing.

427
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:02,191
What were you expecting to smell?

428
00:54:02,525 --> 00:54:03,358
Glass.

429
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,191
But glass doesn't smell.

430
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:08,400
Course it does.
What's this?

431
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:15,274
I don't smell a thing.

432
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:18,358
It should smell like copper!

433
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:19,358
Enough!

434
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:26,024
You were trying to distill
the smell of copper?

435
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:29,649
Iron? Glass? Copper?

436
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:35,524
What else did you try?

437
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:40,441
No!

438
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:44,857
Have you gone completely insane?

439
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:47,732
You told me I had to experiment.

440
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:50,691
Experiment? Experiment?

441
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,316
But not with the cat.

442
00:54:56,691 --> 00:54:58,400
What kind of a human being are you?

443
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:00,774
Don't you know anything?

444
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:03,441
You can no more distill
the scent of a cat

445
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:05,565
than you can distill
the scent of you or me.

446
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:17,607
I can't?

447
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,149
Of course not!

448
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,607
He is in stadio ultimo.

449
00:55:28,774 --> 00:55:30,108
- What?
- He's dying.

450
00:55:30,441 --> 00:55:31,982
Is there nothing you can do?

451
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:35,649
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

452
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:38,108
Well, my fee is 50 francs.

453
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:39,400
50 francs?

454
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:42,524
You charlatan!
You can't even name the disease!

455
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:48,441
No! Jean-Baptiste!

456
00:55:50,982 --> 00:55:52,400
You cannot do this to me.

457
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:57,607
Not now. Not yet.

458
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,274
Is there

459
00:56:15,524 --> 00:56:16,732
any other way

460
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:21,774
to preserve smell
besides distill it?

461
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:23,440
Jean-Baptiste?

462
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:30,149
Is there, master?

463
00:56:31,732 --> 00:56:34,732
Well, yes, I believe there is.

464
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,440
What is it?

465
00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:43,941
It is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage.

466
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:47,857
Can you teach me?

467
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:54,565
Not even I am intimate
with its secrets.

468
00:56:57,899 --> 00:56:59,982
But could I learn it in Grasse?

469
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:03,899
- Well...
- Could I?

470
00:57:10,316 --> 00:57:12,108
Where else but in Grasse?

471
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:22,191
Within a week Grenouille
was well again,

472
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:26,524
but to travel to Grasse to find
a job he needed journey papers.

473
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:29,857
Baldini agreed to provide them

474
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,108
on condition that
Grenouille left him

475
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:35,732
not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes.

476
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:40,691
Grenouille did not mind. He
could have given him a thousand

477
00:57:46,982 --> 00:57:50,941
The morning of Grenouille S'
departure, Baldini was pleased.

478
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:55,108
At last, he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work.

479
00:57:55,899 --> 00:57:58,732
He could not remember
a happier day.

480
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:02,565
Deeply satisfied,
he went back to sleep

481
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:05,482
and awoke no more in this life.

482
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:29,315
With every step he took from
the city, the happier he felt.

483
00:58:30,399 --> 00:58:34,565
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner,

484
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:38,357
and at last he was able
to breathe freely.

485
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:44,482
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

486
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:48,607
The first followed the winding
roads through the villages

487
00:58:48,774 --> 00:58:52,899
while the second lead across
the mountains, down into Provence.

488
00:58:55,233 --> 00:58:57,066
The choice was quite easy.

489
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,691
Thus his nose led him
ever higher,

490
00:59:03,899 --> 00:59:06,191
ever further from mankind,

491
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:11,273
more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude.

492
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:54,774
Grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found

493
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:58,524
a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent.

494
01:00:03,899 --> 01:00:08,066
Spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone.

495
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,232
There was something sacred
about this place.

496
01:00:18,607 --> 01:00:21,399
No longer distracted
by anything external,

497
01:00:21,941 --> 01:00:25,774
he was finally able to bask
in his own existence

498
01:00:28,315 --> 01:00:30,108
and found it splendid.

499
01:00:38,941 --> 01:00:42,691
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions

500
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,899
Ana, indeed, might have done
so altogether.

501
01:01:03,108 --> 01:01:03,857
Hello?

502
01:01:08,524 --> 01:01:09,273
Hello?

503
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:13,357
Hello?

504
01:01:31,857 --> 01:01:34,649
There were a thousand
smells in his clothes.

505
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,607
The smell of sand, stone, moss.

506
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:40,982
Even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

507
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:43,315
Only one smell was not there.

508
01:01:46,565 --> 01:01:47,691
His own.

509
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:29,273
For the first time, Grenouille
realized he had no smell.

510
01:02:31,857 --> 01:02:35,857
He realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone.

511
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:40,482
What he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion.

512
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,024
It was as though
he did not exist.

513
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:54,982
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

514
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:57,774
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

515
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:02,273
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed,

516
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,190
that he was someone,

517
01:03:04,565 --> 01:03:06,565
but that he was exceptional.

518
01:03:10,982 --> 01:03:12,357
And with this decision

519
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:16,982
it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him.

520
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:40,440
Go in.

521
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:45,357
Laura?

522
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:54,565
Laura?

523
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:56,773
Coming, Papa.

524
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,357
Haven't seen you here before.

525
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:39,773
It's my first season.

526
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,190
Picking together
is always more fun.

527
01:08:45,107 --> 01:08:46,815
They say you pick
everything you find.

528
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:32,232
Idiot!

529
01:09:32,898 --> 01:09:35,190
How many times have I told you
not to cram the blossoms in

530
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,773
like you're stuffing a chicken?

531
01:09:39,023 --> 01:09:40,773
Watch how Grenouille does it.

532
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,107
Look how skillfully
he handles them.

533
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:49,315
The whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly.

534
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:51,607
In their sleep, as it were.

535
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:55,898
Handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

536
01:09:56,815 --> 01:09:57,981
If you say so, Madame.

537
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:03,524
You. Check the jonquil blossoms.

538
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:08,648
They need more time.

539
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,023
Do what I say!

540
01:10:57,648 --> 01:10:58,524
Stop it!

541
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,773
I'm not in the mood.

542
01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:02,357
Are you sure?

543
01:11:03,815 --> 01:11:05,190
Of course I'm sure.

544
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:13,315
I said...

545
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:17,273
...no!

546
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:30,065
Suit yourself

547
01:11:33,898 --> 01:11:34,564
Lucien?

548
01:11:38,815 --> 01:11:40,107
Fetch me back the ladder.

549
01:11:40,357 --> 01:11:41,440
Fetch it yourself.

550
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,357
Lucien?

551
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,148
Lucien!

552
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:11,273
Lucien?

553
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:15,690
Lucien?

554
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:35,856
Lucien?

555
01:13:34,107 --> 01:13:37,981
Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi.
She here?

556
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:42,648
She's busy.

557
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,523
Seems such a waste to boil them.

558
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:55,940
Or whatever you do with them.

559
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:03,107
So what do you do with them?

560
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,564
Warm them in animal fat.

561
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:10,606
- What for?
- The fat soaks up their scent.

562
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:12,273
Then what?

563
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,190
Then I cool it to a pomade

564
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,648
and then I filter it before...

565
01:14:27,356 --> 01:14:28,273
Before what?

566
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:32,523
Before I add in alcohol and
other essences to make a perfume.

567
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:33,606
Don't touch anything.

568
01:14:39,856 --> 01:14:40,731
What's in there?

569
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:43,107
Nothing. Just flowers.

570
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:45,856
- Can I look?
- No.

571
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:47,690
Not now. I've got work to do.

572
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:48,898
You must go now.

573
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:51,398
- Come on. Let me look.
- Don't touch.

574
01:14:51,564 --> 01:14:52,731
Ah, my tuberoses.

575
01:14:54,606 --> 01:14:55,898
Morning, Madame.

576
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:57,148
Morning.

577
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:02,690
Why have you covered the tank?

578
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:05,648
It's an experiment, Madame.

579
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,148
To protect the blossoms
from daylight.

580
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,439
To preserve the scent better.

581
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:16,523
Well, if you say so.

582
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:21,606
Come with me. I'll settle
your master's account.

583
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:26,731
To preserve
their scent better, you say?

584
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:42,314
I don't smell much.

585
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,439
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

586
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:59,356
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

587
01:16:12,231 --> 01:16:13,523
How much must I pay

588
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:17,523
to be with you?

589
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:20,023
Depends what you want.

590
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:34,940
What's that stuff?

591
01:16:39,231 --> 01:16:40,690
I'm creating a perfume.

592
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:45,606
Lie down, please.

593
01:17:05,606 --> 01:17:06,731
It feels horrible.

594
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:11,731
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

595
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,481
Creating a perfume, eh?

596
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:18,439
Admit it. You're getting
some sort of bang out of this.

597
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:20,356
Aren't you?

598
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:22,815
I enjoy my work.

599
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,272
Hold your arm still.

600
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:36,272
Don't think
you're gonna tie me up.

601
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:39,398
Hold out your arm, please.

602
01:17:47,523 --> 01:17:49,231
I've come across some
strange men in my time...

603
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:52,231
Just relax.

604
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:02,189
Holy Mother, what's that?!

605
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,314
Just for scraping off the fat.

606
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:10,731
- Are you mad?
- Relax. You'll ruin everything.

607
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:15,773
If you're frightened, you stink.
Then your perfume will be spoiled.

608
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:17,564
I've had enough.

609
01:18:18,648 --> 01:18:21,147
Here, take your money.

610
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:25,564
Basting me up in all this goo.
You think I am a Christmas goose?

611
01:18:25,856 --> 01:18:27,065
Get out of here!

612
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:56,980
Quickly, blow them out
before the roses melt!

613
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:59,481
- Roses can't melt, Papa!
- These ones can.

614
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:18,856
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honour,

615
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,439
his Excellency,
the Marquis de Montesquieu.

616
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:24,815
May our trade
continue to flourish!

617
01:22:30,231 --> 01:22:31,231
I thank you all

618
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:34,606
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first

619
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:37,189
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter

620
01:22:37,523 --> 01:22:40,356
and present her with a small
token of my affection.

621
01:22:47,855 --> 01:22:48,690
It's beautiful.

622
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:08,189
I'm overwhelmed, your Grace.

623
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:09,564
"Your Grace"?

624
01:23:10,897 --> 01:23:14,189
I had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now.

625
01:23:17,564 --> 01:23:19,272
Let's have a game
of hide-and-seek!

626
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,022
Oh yes! But everyone must play!

627
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:26,356
Let the men catch the women.

628
01:23:33,523 --> 01:23:35,022
Albine! Wait!

629
01:25:04,523 --> 01:25:06,814
Put me down. Please?

630
01:25:11,897 --> 01:25:13,523
Now there's no escape.

631
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:45,980
Game's over, everybody.

632
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:49,147
Laura?

633
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:52,564
Time to go in now.

634
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:18,106
Laura?

635
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:39,314
Albine? Françoise?

636
01:26:45,064 --> 01:26:46,980
Laura, have you seen the twins?

637
01:26:47,897 --> 01:26:49,605
No, not since the game started.

638
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:54,605
Albine? Françoise?

639
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:07,772
Albine? Françoise?

640
01:27:07,939 --> 01:27:08,564
Jacques?

641
01:27:10,356 --> 01:27:11,398
Take this way.

642
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:13,605
You two with me.

643
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:17,356
Your Excellency? Through here.

644
01:27:22,563 --> 01:27:24,398
Albine! Françoise!

645
01:28:35,814 --> 01:28:38,939
I told that cretin ten times
to get these ready!

646
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:40,980
Don't keep picking on the boy.

647
01:28:42,272 --> 01:28:44,272
I'll kill him, the useless
little sewer rat!

648
01:28:45,272 --> 01:28:46,064
Grenouille!

649
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:49,064
What are you doing?

650
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:51,314
Why aren't the enfleurage
frames...

651
01:28:58,356 --> 01:28:59,064
Yes, master?

652
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:03,814
I mean, would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames?

653
01:29:07,897 --> 01:29:09,439
Certainly, master.

654
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:26,730
A curfew?

655
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:28,605
Are you mad?

656
01:29:28,772 --> 01:29:31,814
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that.

657
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,772
This could mean
the ruin of our trade.

658
01:29:35,064 --> 01:29:35,730
Yours.

659
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:38,356
And yours and yours.

660
01:29:39,855 --> 01:29:41,980
Supposing it's your daughter
next time.

661
01:29:44,022 --> 01:29:47,689
Of course a curfew is necessary,
but we also have to catch this man

662
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:52,022
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks, what he wants.

663
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:55,814
I should have thought that
was obvious. Use your imagination.

664
01:29:56,022 --> 01:29:58,689
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute

665
01:29:58,855 --> 01:30:01,231
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

666
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,314
How would you know?

667
01:30:03,563 --> 01:30:07,356
The coroner had each girl examined.
They were all found to be virgins.

668
01:30:09,814 --> 01:30:11,855
Supposing there isn't a next time?

669
01:30:12,438 --> 01:30:16,106
If we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing.

670
01:30:18,563 --> 01:30:20,522
So we wait until he's killed,
what? Six?

671
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:22,939
Seven? Eight?

672
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:51,189
Curfew!
Go back to your homes!

673
01:31:06,189 --> 01:31:07,314
Gentlemen!

674
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,522
Gentlemen!

675
01:31:09,647 --> 01:31:13,605
We have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter.

676
01:31:13,939 --> 01:31:16,605
I suggest that we ask
for support from Paris.

677
01:31:16,897 --> 01:31:18,689
Paris won't be smarter than we are.

678
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:20,605
We must arrest every Gypsy
in Provence. And every beggar.

679
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:22,814
And every man without
a wife and family!

680
01:31:23,064 --> 01:31:23,897
Listen.

681
01:31:26,605 --> 01:31:30,689
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

682
01:31:31,272 --> 01:31:35,397
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

683
01:31:35,647 --> 01:31:39,730
We know he doesn't want
their virginity, so it seems to me

684
01:31:39,897 --> 01:31:42,605
that it's their beauty itself
that he wants.

685
01:31:42,855 --> 01:31:45,522
It's almost as if he's trying
to gather something.

686
01:31:45,897 --> 01:31:49,313
As if his ambitions
are those of a collector.

687
01:31:50,231 --> 01:31:52,106
A collector? Of what?

688
01:31:53,355 --> 01:31:54,147
Their hair?

689
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:05,522
Whatever it is,
I fear he won't stop killing

690
01:32:05,814 --> 01:32:08,689
until his collection is complete.

691
01:32:34,231 --> 01:32:34,939
Monsieur.

692
01:32:38,147 --> 01:32:42,106
This man is a demon.

693
01:32:42,355 --> 01:32:45,397
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means.

694
01:32:45,563 --> 01:32:49,605
Now, I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

695
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,647
What good would that do?

696
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:56,313
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

697
01:32:58,106 --> 01:32:59,647
This is not a matter of faith.

698
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:01,397
There's a murderer out there

699
01:33:01,605 --> 01:33:05,064
and we must catch him
by using our God-given wits!

700
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:08,730
I say until
we submit to Mother Church

701
01:33:09,605 --> 01:33:11,563
these killings will not cease.

702
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,647
Citizens of Grasse, we hereby
declare that this murderer,

703
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:35,939
this demon in our midst,

704
01:33:36,522 --> 01:33:40,605
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication.

705
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,480
Not only has this depraved monster

706
01:33:45,897 --> 01:33:48,397
robbed us of our daughters,

707
01:33:48,772 --> 01:33:51,480
the young and fair blossom
of this city,

708
01:33:51,814 --> 01:33:53,647
and by his wanton acts

709
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:57,689
has brought our trade,
our livelihood,

710
01:33:57,855 --> 01:34:00,563
our very existence,

711
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:03,855
to the brink of eternal darkness.

712
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:07,313
We therefore declare

713
01:34:08,147 --> 01:34:10,147
that this vile viper,

714
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:13,730
this ignominious carbuncle,

715
01:34:13,897 --> 01:34:17,022
this execrable evil in our midst,

716
01:34:17,188 --> 01:34:21,355
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence,

717
01:34:22,772 --> 01:34:26,897
rejected from the communion
of Holy Mother Church

718
01:34:27,522 --> 01:34:29,855
as a disciple of Satan,

719
01:34:31,188 --> 01:34:33,397
slayer of souls.

720
01:34:33,563 --> 01:34:34,271
Stand clear!

721
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:38,563
An infected limb,
an outsider of the faith

722
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:43,480
a necromancer,
a diabolist, a sorcerer

723
01:34:44,106 --> 01:34:46,397
and a damned heretic.

724
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:51,355
Oh, God, in Thy most
merciful spirit,

725
01:34:52,605 --> 01:34:55,522
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head

726
01:34:56,355 --> 01:35:00,064
and may the Devil
make soup of his bones.

727
01:35:00,397 --> 01:35:01,563
Amen.

728
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,939
My Lord! It's a miracle!

729
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:07,939
He's been caught!
He's been caught!

730
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:12,814
My Lord, the fiend has been caught.

731
01:35:13,605 --> 01:35:15,313
In the city of Grenoble.

732
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,980
He's confessed to everything.

733
01:35:17,605 --> 01:35:19,605
He's confessed to everything!

734
01:35:21,814 --> 01:35:22,939
Hallelujah!

735
01:35:23,105 --> 01:35:25,438
Hallelujah!

736
01:35:26,397 --> 01:35:27,855
Praise be to God!

737
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,022
And we thank Him

738
01:35:30,188 --> 01:35:33,689
for listening to our prayers
and answering them.

739
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:37,397
Amen.

740
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:40,188
Amen.

741
01:35:56,313 --> 01:35:58,022
Just read the report.

742
01:35:58,188 --> 01:36:00,146
This cannot possibly
be the same man.

743
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:07,563
He confessed to everything.
Including the murders in Grasse.

744
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,022
Yes. Under torture.

745
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:12,438
Look. Here.

746
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:16,397
He admits to strangling
his victims,

747
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:19,271
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them.

748
01:36:19,438 --> 01:36:22,563
The Grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads

749
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,897
their hair was carefully cropped,
and not one of them was violated.

750
01:36:26,063 --> 01:36:26,689
Antoine,

751
01:36:28,438 --> 01:36:30,855
we're all happy it's over.

752
01:36:31,814 --> 01:36:32,605
Let it go.

753
01:37:20,563 --> 01:37:23,438
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home. Now!

754
01:37:23,605 --> 01:37:25,021
But why? I'm enjoying myself.

755
01:37:25,188 --> 01:37:28,313
- Don't argue with me, Laura.
- Stop it! I'm going...

756
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:36,689
Laura!

757
01:37:38,438 --> 01:37:39,271
Laura!

758
01:37:42,814 --> 01:37:44,146
Out of my WHY!

759
01:37:44,855 --> 01:37:45,480
Laura!

760
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:43,480
Laura!

761
01:38:44,772 --> 01:38:45,522
Papa!

762
01:38:51,938 --> 01:38:53,146
I'm so sorry.

763
01:39:07,063 --> 01:39:09,854
I know you must think me
a very foolish man,

764
01:39:11,188 --> 01:39:13,146
but try to understand

765
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:15,730
you're all I have left.

766
01:39:15,896 --> 01:39:17,772
You don't need to explain, Papa.

767
01:39:17,938 --> 01:39:20,730
- If anything were to happen to you...
- I know.

768
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:24,563
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

769
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,896
Sweet dreams, my love.

770
01:39:51,063 --> 01:39:52,647
Sweet dreams, Papa.

771
01:40:52,689 --> 01:40:53,771
Laura!

772
01:41:04,563 --> 01:41:06,854
Papa, what's the matter?

773
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:12,938
Did you open the window?

774
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:15,896
No.

775
01:41:16,605 --> 01:41:17,438
Why?

776
01:41:20,813 --> 01:41:24,896
Have this letter dispatched to the
Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

777
01:42:13,938 --> 01:42:16,355
Stay on the road north
into the mountains.

778
01:42:34,438 --> 01:42:36,146
Did Monsieur Richie leave?

779
01:42:36,313 --> 01:42:36,938
He did.

780
01:42:37,355 --> 01:42:38,146
Which way?

781
01:42:39,605 --> 01:42:40,438
North.

782
01:42:47,438 --> 01:42:49,105
You sure it wasn't south?

783
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:52,813
I saw them with my own eyes.
Why do you want to know?

784
01:42:54,563 --> 01:42:57,146
I said north. North!

785
01:42:59,563 --> 01:43:00,438
Grenouille!

786
01:43:03,021 --> 01:43:03,896
Grenouille!

787
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:07,854
Grenouille!

788
01:43:18,604 --> 01:43:19,522
Grenouille!

789
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,230
Good God!

790
01:44:34,105 --> 01:44:35,521
Good afternoon, Monsieur.

791
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:38,896
Good afternoon. Do you have
anyone else staying here?

792
01:44:39,521 --> 01:44:40,271
No, Monsieur.

793
01:44:40,854 --> 01:44:43,271
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

794
01:44:43,438 --> 01:44:45,604
It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.

795
01:44:47,063 --> 01:44:50,646
And tomorrow, at first light, we wish
to be ferried to the Ile de Lérin.

796
01:44:51,397 --> 01:44:54,854
- It's deserted, just a few monks.
- I'm aware of that.

797
01:44:55,813 --> 01:44:56,521
Very well, Monsieur.

798
01:45:01,646 --> 01:45:03,271
Our finest room, Mademoiselle.

799
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,146
With a superb view of the sea.

800
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:09,938
One moment.

801
01:45:16,688 --> 01:45:17,313
Very well.

802
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:21,438
Do you have a room next to this one?

803
01:45:21,604 --> 01:45:25,688
- Yes, but the view is different.
- I have no interest in the view.

804
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:22,771
Papa, will you please tell me
now what is happening?

805
01:46:23,729 --> 01:46:25,896
You haven't said a word all day.

806
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:28,313
Why all this secrecy?

807
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:34,313
Last night I dreamt you were dead,

808
01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:38,063
murdered like all the other girls.

809
01:46:47,646 --> 01:46:50,854
The truth is, I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

810
01:46:52,688 --> 01:46:54,979
All of his victims
were young and beautiful,

811
01:46:55,146 --> 01:46:57,021
and who is there more beautiful
than you, Laura?

812
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:00,854
Whatever his insane scheme,

813
01:47:01,105 --> 01:47:03,938
it will surely be incomplete
without you.

814
01:47:12,813 --> 01:47:15,938
I wrote to the Marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage

815
01:47:16,146 --> 01:47:19,021
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

816
01:47:20,562 --> 01:47:23,688
Until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery.

817
01:47:25,396 --> 01:47:28,396
And all this because
you had a bad dream?

818
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:31,979
- I've made my decision.
- But I don't know if I love him!

819
01:47:32,396 --> 01:47:34,646
I'm afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice.

820
01:47:34,813 --> 01:47:36,896
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

821
01:53:26,896 --> 01:53:29,312
On your feet.
Hands in the air!

822
01:54:15,521 --> 01:54:18,020
Why did you kill my daughter?

823
01:54:22,145 --> 01:54:22,896
Why?

824
01:54:26,771 --> 01:54:27,771
I needed her.

825
01:54:54,521 --> 01:54:56,937
Why did you kill my daughter?

826
01:55:01,229 --> 01:55:02,187
I just...

827
01:55:05,646 --> 01:55:06,771
needed her.

828
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,062
Very well.

829
01:55:18,312 --> 01:55:20,646
But remember this.

830
01:55:27,145 --> 01:55:28,688
I will be looking at you

831
01:55:31,729 --> 01:55:33,479
when you are laid on the cross

832
01:55:33,646 --> 01:55:37,604
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs.

833
01:55:40,354 --> 01:55:43,978
And when the crowd has finally tired

834
01:55:44,145 --> 01:55:46,895
of your screams and wandered home,

835
01:55:47,145 --> 01:55:50,729
I will climb up through your blood

836
01:55:53,354 --> 01:55:55,145
and sit beside you.

837
01:55:57,270 --> 01:56:00,187
I will look deep into your eyes

838
01:56:02,312 --> 01:56:04,479
and drop by drop

839
01:56:07,104 --> 01:56:10,853
I will trickle my disgust into them

840
01:56:12,853 --> 01:56:15,688
like burning acid,

841
01:56:17,521 --> 01:56:18,813
until

842
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:23,771
finally

843
01:56:27,812 --> 01:56:29,104
you perish.

844
01:58:29,687 --> 01:58:31,646
Unchain the prisoner.

845
01:58:42,770 --> 01:58:44,187
That's enough.

846
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:47,646
Let him be brought to the scaffold.

847
01:58:52,853 --> 01:58:53,770
What's that?

848
02:00:07,937 --> 02:00:09,312
He's over there.

849
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:02,396
This man is innocent!

850
02:02:07,812 --> 02:02:09,312
He is innocent!

851
02:03:33,395 --> 02:03:34,020
A" angel!

852
02:03:35,354 --> 02:03:36,354
This is no man!

853
02:03:37,229 --> 02:03:38,812
This is an angel!

854
02:09:40,353 --> 02:09:41,353
Grenouille!

855
02:09:47,645 --> 02:09:49,728
You can't fool me!

856
02:10:38,728 --> 02:10:39,645
Forgive me,

857
02:10:46,937 --> 02:10:48,019
my son.

858
02:11:51,311 --> 02:11:55,311
The people of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.

859
02:11:56,812 --> 02:12:00,228
For many of them,
the experience was so ghastly,

860
02:12:00,395 --> 02:12:04,019
so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals

861
02:12:04,812 --> 02:12:07,812
that they literally erased it
from their memories.

862
02:12:08,936 --> 02:12:11,853
The town council was
in session by the afternoon

863
02:12:12,019 --> 02:12:14,311
and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant

864
02:12:14,478 --> 02:12:18,103
to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders.

865
02:12:19,603 --> 02:12:22,478
The following day,
Dominique Druot was arrested.

866
02:12:22,645 --> 02:12:26,812
It was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims.

867
02:12:28,144 --> 02:12:31,728
After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.

868
02:12:34,645 --> 02:12:37,061
With that, the case was closed.

869
02:12:41,311 --> 02:12:45,269
By then, Grenouille was already
half way back to Paris.

870
02:12:49,353 --> 02:12:53,520
He had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose.

871
02:12:54,395 --> 02:12:57,603
He could walk to Versailles
and have the King kiss his feet.

872
02:12:58,061 --> 02:13:02,228
He could write the Pope a letter,
re veal himself as the new Messiah.

873
02:13:03,353 --> 02:13:05,852
He could do all this
and more if he wanted to.

874
02:13:07,019 --> 02:13:09,894
He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money,

875
02:13:10,061 --> 02:13:11,852
or terror, or death.

876
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:16,520
The invincible power to command
the love of mankind.

877
02:13:23,144 --> 02:13:26,228
There was only one thing
the perfume could not do:

878
02:13:26,478 --> 02:13:29,228
It could not turn him
into a person

879
02:13:29,395 --> 02:13:31,603
who could love and be loved
like everyone else.

880
02:13:32,977 --> 02:13:35,436
50, to hell with it, he thought.

881
02:13:35,603 --> 02:13:37,186
To hell with the world,

882
02:13:37,478 --> 02:13:38,811
with the perfume,

883
02:13:39,186 --> 02:13:40,520
with himself

884
02:13:43,311 --> 02:13:46,478
On the 25th of June, 1766,

885
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:48,520
around 110 'clock at night,

886
02:13:49,144 --> 02:13:52,436
Grenouille entered the city
through the Port d'Orleans

887
02:13:52,603 --> 02:13:54,436
and like a sleep-walker,

888
02:13:54,936 --> 02:13:59,103
his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born.

889
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:23,353
A" angel!

890
02:15:26,144 --> 02:15:27,520
I love you!

891
02:16:15,144 --> 02:16:18,186
Within no time,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

892
02:16:18,353 --> 02:16:20,727
had disappeared from
the face of the earth.

893
02:16:21,894 --> 02:16:26,061
When they had finished, they
felt a virginal glow of happiness.

894
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:29,644
For the first time
in their lives

895
02:16:30,311 --> 02:16:32,395
they believed that they
had done something

896
02:16:33,144 --> 02:16:35,977
purely out of love.

897
02:17:08,019 --> 02:17:10,353
- Ey, over here!
- Look!

898
02:17:18,061 --> 02:17:19,311
