1
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,735
60 knots? No way, Barnes.

2
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:15,257
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

3
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,778
Checked it twice. I mean,
it's a real unique signature.

4
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,536
No cavitation. No reactor noise.

5
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,780
It doesn't even sound like screws.

6
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,541
What the hell is it?

7
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,296
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

8
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,577
Sir, contact changing to heading

9
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:42,677
214.

10
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:44,955
Speed,

11
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,635
80 knots.

12
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,470
80 knots.

13
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,940
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

14
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,655
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

15
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:58,778
Port clearance 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir.

16
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:01,254
It's getting tight in here.

17
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,697
We can still give him a haircut.

18
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:06,659
Helm, come right to... 069.

19
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,735
Down five degrees.

20
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,134
Coming right 069. Down five degrees. Aye.

21
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,976
Port side clearance 120 feet. Narrowing 75.

22
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,497
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

23
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:18,974
It's too damn close! We gotta back off.

24
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,098
Sir, range to contact 200.

25
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:24,785
Contact just jinked to bearing 260
and accelerated to...

26
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,135
to 130 knots, sir.

27
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,698
Nothin' goes 130.

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,576
Sir, range to contact 100 yards.

29
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,655
80 yards, sir!

30
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:37,755
60!

31
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,255
It's turbulence! We're in its wake!

32
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,495
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder.

33
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,778
Hydraulic failure. Planes not responding, sir.

34
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,739
Auxiliary power. Monitors back.

35
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,469
Hydraulics restored, sir.

36
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,663
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,178
Fire in sonar!

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,704
Collision alarm!

39
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,547
Fire control to sonar!

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,614
Let's get outta here!

41
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:28,217
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!

42
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:32,189
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

43
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,855
All back full!

44
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:39,818
Answering, all back full!

45
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,378
Give me a damage report! What's our depth?

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,017
Passing 1400, sir.

47
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,175
Main forward tanks are ruptured!

48
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:51,058
Still descending, sir!

49
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:52,158
1450.

50
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,615
Passing 1500, sir.

51
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,094
Still descending.

52
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:04,857
- We're too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1550. Still descending.

53
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:08,175
- We're losin' her!
- Passing 1600, sir,

54
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,899
- and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.

55
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,815
Passing 1650.

56
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,866
- Passing 1700, sir.
- Launching!

57
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,141
Come on! Give me your hand!

58
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,227
Get the door closed!

59
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:11,498
Benthic Explorer, Salvor One on final. Over.

60
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,217
Copy you, Salvor One.
This is Benthic Explorer.

61
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,293
You're cleared to land.

62
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,856
Hey! They're coming.

63
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,853
This... could get pretty ugly.

64
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,953
Yeah.

65
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,379
Does not look good at all.

66
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,654
Oh, no. Look who's with them.

67
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,101
The queen bitch of the universe.

68
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,816
Sonny, how you doin'?

69
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,573
I've got two more welds on this bypass valve.

70
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:18,652
No light from the surface.

71
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,934
- How deep are they?
- McBride?

72
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,012
1700 feet.

73
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:26,816
- I need them to go below 2,000.
- No problem. They can do that.

74
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:33,215
So that's it? You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

75
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,299
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

76
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,492
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

77
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,572
Get Brigman on the line.

78
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,652
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

79
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,732
Man, if Bud goes along with this,

80
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:49,095
they're gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilliser gun.

81
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:50,666
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.

82
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:02,936
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

83
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,257
Hang on. I'll be up there in a second.

84
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,692
Hey, you guys are milkin' that job.

85
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:17,534
Yeah, it's just because we love freezing
our butts off out here for you so much.

86
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,618
Bring me another hammer!

87
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,889
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!

88
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:27,969
Hippy's on the bitch box!

89
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,970
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

90
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,533
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:35,652
That guy don't know his butt from a rathole.

92
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:39,613
Perry, square away this mud hose
and get rid of some of these empty sacks.

93
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:43,413
- It's starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!

94
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:49,049
- Bud, pick up the topside line. Urgent.
- I'm coming!

95
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,977
I'm coming! Jesus! Keep your pantyhose on!

96
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:01,050
Brigman here.

97
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,527
Yeah, Kirkhill. What's goin' on?

98
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,608
Yeah, I'm calm.

99
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,582
I'm a calm person. Is there some reason
why I shouldn't be calm?

100
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:14,903
What?

101
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,094
I am on last feed now.

102
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:29,175
Can you get that goddamn hippy shit music
off the comm line, please?

103
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:37,330
I'm almost done with the shut-off valve.

104
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,611
Sonny, I'm right behind you
with the next fitting.

105
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,694
Hang on a second.

106
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,208
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.

107
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,895
Thanks, sweetie.

108
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:56,451
All divers, drop what you're doin'.
Everybody out of the pool.

109
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,287
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let's go.

110
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,012
Damn it. We just got out here.

111
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,742
There was a time when I woulda asked why.

112
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,701
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

113
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:22,290
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.

114
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,374
Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.

115
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,651
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.

116
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,462
Everybody get to sub-bay. ASAP.

117
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:37,374
Come on. Let's get his hat off.

118
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,408
- Take it off.
- What the hell's goin' on?

119
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:43,329
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.

120
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,229
I got it.

121
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:49,489
- What's the drift, pardner? Why are we up?
- Just follow standard procedure.

122
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,292
Flog your dog till somebody
tells you what's happenin'.

123
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,578
- What's the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

124
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:59,690
We just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

125
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,768
- Oh, shit!
- What?

126
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:06,850
We've received an invitation to, um,
cooperate in a matter of national security.

127
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,928
Now you know as much as I do.

128
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:12,567
Get your gear off and get to control.
We've got a briefing in ten minutes.

129
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,667
Come on! Let's move it!

130
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:18,168
At 0922 local time today
an American nuclear submarine,

131
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:21,221
the USS Montana,
with 156 men aboard, went down

132
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,328
- about 22 miles from here.
- Damn!

133
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:29,046
There's been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.

134
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:32,606
Your company has authorised
the navy's use of this facility

135
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,687
for a rescue operation
code-named Operation Salvor.

136
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,166
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

137
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,289
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

138
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,888
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors... if any.

139
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:49,126
Don't you have your own stuff for this?

140
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:52,446
By the time we get our submersibles here,
the storm'll be on us.

141
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:56,527
You can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours. That makes you our best option.

142
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,729
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

143
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,249
I have been authorised
to offer you all special bonuses

144
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,928
equivalent to three times normal dive pay.

145
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,846
Yes, sir, buddy!

146
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:09,926
For triple time, I'd eat Beany!

147
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,571
Set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss.

148
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,567
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company,

149
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,126
but my people are not qualified for this.
We're oil workers.

150
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,808
Shut up! Hold it down.

151
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,886
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

152
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:27,728
He will transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

153
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:30,887
Send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig.

154
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:34,366
When it comes to the safety of these people,
there's me and then God.

155
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,765
Understand? If things get dicey,

156
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,852
I'm pulling the plug.

157
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:43,169
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

158
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,412
Now, let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?

159
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,456
Let's take it about five degrees left, all right?

160
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,093
Roger. Five degrees left, Bud.

161
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,246
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.

162
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,564
Well, it's official.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

163
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,963
And it's gonna be making our lives

164
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,284
- real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred?

165
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:47,088
I don't know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don't you?

166
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,967
- I can't believe you're letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!

167
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,698
I thought you were in Houston.

168
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,204
I was. Now I'm here.

169
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:07,003
- Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

170
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:11,085
We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.

171
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,367
- I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

172
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:17,487
- I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.

173
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,007
So as long as they're holding the pink slip,
I go where they tell me.

174
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:25,846
I had a lot riding on this. They bought you,
didn't they? More like rented you cheap!

175
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,924
I'm switchin' off now.

176
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,126
Bye-bye.

177
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,886
Oh, OK. Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!

178
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,586
Bye-bye.

179
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,464
Virgil?

180
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,690
God, I hate that bitch!

181
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,336
Probably shouldn't have married her,
then, huh?

182
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,570
Get it stable!

183
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,889
Cab 3. You're clear to launch.

184
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,091
Hang on, gentlemen.

185
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,929
Touchdown! Crowd goes wild!

186
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,805
Explorer, this is Cab 3. We are styling.

187
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,891
- How you boys doin' back there?
- Great.

188
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:24,763
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

189
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,931
- Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.

190
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,527
- Hey, One Night. How you doin'?
- I got a white line fever, baby.

191
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,210
Yeah, I heard that.

192
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,123
Deepcore, Deepcore.

193
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:06,407
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey?

194
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,707
None other.

195
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,018
Oh, no!

196
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,607
Howdy, boys!

197
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,683
Hey, Lindsey!

198
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:37,763
I'll be damned!

199
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,328
Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.

200
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:49,322
The bad news is we got eight hours
in this can blowin' down.

201
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:52,846
And the worse news is
it's gonna take us three weeks

202
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,286
- to decompress later.
- We've all been fully briefed, Mrs Brigman.

203
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,733
Just don't call me that, OK? I hate that.

204
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:04,044
All right. What would you like us to call you?

205
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,144
Sir?

206
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,923
There we go!

207
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,327
Y'all start equalisin'... now!

208
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,247
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of HPNS.

209
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:24,324
High pressure nervous syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

210
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,802
- Nausea, excitability...
- Disorientation.

211
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,173
And a partridge in a pear tree.

212
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:35,327
About one person in 20 can't handle it.
They just go buggo.

213
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,882
Look, they've all made runs to this depth.

214
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:40,203
- They checked out.
- I understand that.

215
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,848
What I'm saying is it's impossible to predict

216
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,930
- just who's susceptible.
- They checked out.

217
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,323
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:54,367
Those guys ain't so tough.
I've fought guys plenty tougher than them.

219
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,965
Now we get to hear
how you could have been a contender?

220
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,065
Hey!

221
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:01,686
- You see this?
- Yeah.

222
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:03,734
They used to call this the hammer.

223
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,527
Y'all done to a turn and ready to serve.

224
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,609
Everybody OK?

225
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:23,685
- They're really very sweet.
- Yeah.

226
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:27,365
Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here.
How you doin', Jammer?

227
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,097
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm OK.

228
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,363
I want a full check on their gear.

229
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:42,973
These guys are about as much fun
as a tax audit.

230
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,242
Hippy, you're gonna give that rat a disease.

231
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:03,142
Hi, Lins!

232
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,881
Well, well. Mrs Brigman.

233
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,967
Not for long.

234
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,809
You never did like being called that, did you?

235
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:19,166
Not even when it meant something.

236
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:24,605
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

237
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:29,292
- Hey, One Night. It's Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.

238
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:41,290
Obstacle-avoidance is showin' a rise
out about 100m. What do you wanna do?

239
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:45,163
I can't believe
you were dumb enough to come down here.

240
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:47,480
Now you're stuck here for the storm.

241
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,126
- That was dumb, hot rod. Real dumb.
- I didn't come down here to fight with you.

242
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,480
Yeah, well...

243
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,560
Then why did you come down?

244
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,279
You need me. Nobody knows
the systems on this rig better than I do.

245
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,601
Once you're disconnected, you guys are on
your own for however long this storm lasts.

246
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:10,319
What if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?

247
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,561
Wow, you're right. Us poor dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

248
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,646
It could've been a disaster.

249
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:21,921
- You wanna know what I think?
- Jesus! Look where this thing is set.

250
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,964
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

251
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:28,360
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

252
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,483
No, seriously. I think you were.
Come on. It's OK.

253
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,560
It's OK. You can admit it.

254
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,683
I was worried... about the rig.

255
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:38,484
I've got over four years
invested in this project.

256
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,408
Yeah. You only had three years
invested in me.

257
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,125
Well, you have to have priorities.

258
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:03,519
It's kinda messy, but I guarantee you
it's the only bunk that won't be occupied.

259
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,723
You can get a couple of hours' rest
before we get there.

260
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,045
What are you still wearing that for?

261
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,526
I don't know.

262
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:15,286
Divorce ain't final.

263
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,686
Forgot to take it off.

264
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,520
I haven't worn mine in months.

265
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Yeah.

266
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,687
Well, whatshisname wouldn't like it.
The suit.

267
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,240
Do you always have to call him that?

268
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,922
The suit. Makes you sound like such a hick.

269
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:37,000
His name is Michael.

270
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,240
How is Michael, then? Mr Brooks Brothers.

271
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,740
Mr BMW.

272
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,280
You still seeing him?

273
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
No.

274
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:51,359
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

275
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:54,253
Terribly sorry. What happened?

276
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,964
Why are you doing this?
This is none of your business!

277
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,285
It's not a part of your life any more.

278
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll tell you what happened.

279
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,083
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets,

280
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:11,443
rolled over,
and there was this good-looking guy.

281
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,643
Well-groomed, expensive watch on.

282
00:22:13,743 --> 00:22:16,763
And you realised
"This guy never makes me laugh."

283
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:20,442
That's it, Bud. That's it!
Aren't you clever? Jesus! You're clever!

284
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:23,361
You should start your own talk show!
Ask Dr Bud.

285
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:26,324
Advice to the lovelorn from 300 fathoms.

286
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:27,973
Thank you. Thank you.

287
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:03,053
Oh, shit!

288
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:09,041
- Cuttin' you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night. Stay clear.

289
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:11,124
We're setting her down.

290
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:17,533
Touchdown!

291
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,600
This is us, sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

292
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,359
This is the Montana.
300m away, 70m below us.

293
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:31,729
We think she slid down the wall
and now sits here on this outcropping.

294
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:35,999
So we're gonna have to drop
straight down... here and...

295
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,997
This tell us how much radiation we're gettin'?

296
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:42,119
Whoa! I'm not going near
no radiation! No way!

297
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,840
- Hippy, you pussy.
- What good is the money,

298
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,278
six months later your dick drops off?

299
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:50,357
We'll take readings as we go.
If the reactor's breached,

300
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:54,517
the warheads have released
any radioactive debris, we'll just back off.

301
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,596
- It's that simple.
- OK.

302
00:23:56,696 --> 00:24:00,278
OK. Hippy's not going,
so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

303
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:03,958
Goddamn it! You know
McWhirter can't run an ROV worth shit!

304
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:05,999
Then you'd better go.

305
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:07,699
I'll go.

306
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,997
What is your problem? On this dive

307
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:14,476
you'll do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me.

308
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:18,769
And you'll follow those orders
without discussion. Is that clear?

309
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:23,084
I want everyone
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

310
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,838
- Gimme a hand loading Little Geek.
- Let's get suited up.

311
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:31,001
Hey, guys! Hold it a second.

312
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,571
Hold it!

313
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:34,817
Whoa!

314
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:39,931
Look...

315
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:44,959
...it's 3am. These guys are running on
bad coffee and about four hours of sleep.

316
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,276
Maybe you could cut them some slack.

317
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:51,480
- I can't afford slack.
- You come on my rig, you don't talk to me,

318
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,919
and you start ordering my people around.
It's not gonna work.

319
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,359
You gotta know how to handle these people.
We got a certain way of doing things here.

320
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:04,366
I'm not interested in your way of doing
things. Just get your team ready to dive.

321
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:12,120
These guys have got no sense of humour.

322
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:18,276
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?

323
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:21,090
Finler, why don't you just shut up
and put your gear on?

324
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,688
Keep it coming.

325
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,717
Hippy, throw me
one of them cyalumes, please.

326
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,680
- Good.
- Excuse me.

327
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,880
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid breathing system. We just got them.

328
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,239
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

329
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,322
- Deep.
- How deep?

330
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:42,448
It's classified.

331
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,621
You breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

332
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:48,360
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

333
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,522
- Oxygenated, fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit!

334
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,723
Check this out.

335
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,544
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

336
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:03,651
- What do you doin'? You gonna kill her.
- It's okay. I've done this myself.

337
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,943
Oh, man. look what you doin'!
You just drowning her!

338
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:07,495
It's gonna be fine.

339
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:10,121
I've breathed this myself.
He's gonna be fine.

340
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,697
No, man! She... she's gonna drown.
Look, look! She's freakin' out.

341
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,082
Just going through a
normal adjustment period.

342
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:17,069
Normal? Is this look normal to you?
She's gonna drown!

343
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,409
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

344
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:22,824
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

345
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,740
Here he goes.

346
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,127
There is a bit of anxiety here.

347
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,109
Now he's starting to relax.

348
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:33,473
He's breathing fine.
See, he's just moving.

349
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,096
Getting plenty of oxygen.

350
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,489
Damn rat's breathing that shit.

351
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:42,570
That is, no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamned thing I ever saw.

352
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,767
See the fluid is harder
to push in and out than air.

353
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,629
It's a little more work to breath.

354
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,852
He's doing fine.
He's diggin' it.

355
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,980
She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.
All right, let her out! Now!

356
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,890
- Now!
- Okay. All right.

357
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,553
OK. Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs.

358
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:01,862
All right. Give her here. Give her here.

359
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,629
Here's your rat.

360
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,855
- See? He's fine!
- It's a she.

361
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,707
Going over the wall.

362
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:12,790
Coming to bearing 065.

363
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,204
Flatbed, you on line?

364
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:19,894
Ten-four, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

365
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:23,245
Starting our descent. Divers, how you doin'?

366
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,287
Everybody's OK so far.

367
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:28,684
Hang on, boys. It's all downhill from here.

368
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:33,367
- Hey, how deep's the drop-off here?
- This here's the bottomless pit, baby.

369
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:36,496
Two and a half miles straight down.

370
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,004
Cab 3, it's Bud. You on line?

371
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:44,047
Cab 3 check.

372
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:46,130
I'm right behind you.

373
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:51,887
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

374
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:55,726
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

375
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:57,969
Hang on. I'm gonna test my strobes.

376
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,890
Cab 1, do you have a visual?

377
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,526
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Yeah.

378
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,610
Roger that. Found it.

379
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,323
Cab 1, radiation readings?

380
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:32,926
Neutron counter's not showing much.

381
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:36,643
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.

382
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:40,928
Copy that. Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?

383
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:43,366
Roger that. Document as much as you can.

384
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:47,163
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we're on a tight time line.

385
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:49,250
Copy that.

386
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,643
Coming up to the midships hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

387
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,172
Yeah, roger. I got it.

388
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,248
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.

389
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:07,367
- Roger. Holding.
- OK. It's all yours, Lieutenant.

390
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:10,576
- All right, A Team.
- Let's do it.

391
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,246
OK. Perry, Hippy.

392
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:29,644
- Let's get that ROV launched.
- OK. We're on it, boss.

393
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:30,744
Go!

394
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,729
Little Geek is on the case.

395
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:51,365
Monk here, sir.
We got the midships outer hatch open.

396
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:55,047
Entering escape trunk.

397
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,767
Inner hatch looks intact.

398
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:08,128
It's flooded. All right. I'm gonna open her up.

399
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,332
OK. Get in there.

400
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:24,685
- Roger. Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.

401
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:29,486
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better
you than me. You know what I mean?

402
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:40,404
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?

403
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:44,120
That's right. It looks like
a couple of the hatches have sprung.

404
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,324
Radiation's nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.

405
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,401
How many are there?

406
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,169
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.

407
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:55,207
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

408
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,241
How powerful are they?

409
00:30:58,341 --> 00:31:02,402
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.

410
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,532
Say... five times Hiroshima.

411
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:09,087
Jesus Christ!

412
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,921
It's World War III in a can.

413
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,371
Let's knock off the chatter.

414
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:18,482
OK. I'm headin' into the reactor compartment.

415
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,960
- Getting a reading?
- It's twitching.

416
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,570
But it's below the line you said was safe.

417
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:27,085
All right. Let's get in there.

418
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:39,002
Flatbed, drop down starboard
of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.

419
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:41,087
OK. Copy that.

420
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,326
Keep heading for the bow.

421
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,687
OK, Flatbed. This looks good.

422
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,054
Just set it down here.

423
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:09,288
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

424
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,730
All right. Let's go.

425
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,933
OK. Let's just take it slow and easy goin' in.

426
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,927
Don't take any chances.

427
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,121
Where are we, Coffey?

428
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:57,492
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

429
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:16,882
- You guys OK? Cat? Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.

430
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:18,967
Check your gauges.

431
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:22,121
How's your O2?

432
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,484
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.

433
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:26,584
OK.

434
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,207
16 minutes to go.

435
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,287
Jammer here. CO2 is up.

436
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:43,167
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- OK.

437
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,927
Come on. Let's keep up.

438
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:57,009
All right. Up this way to the control centre.

439
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,521
It's jammed! Gimme a hand!

440
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:26,766
Get up here with that pry bar.

441
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:30,766
It's moving. Pull!

442
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:40,600
Jesus!

443
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,246
All right! We knew we were gonna see this.

444
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:45,327
Just move on.

445
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:51,050
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

446
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:27,163
OK. Let's stay cool.

447
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:29,372
Everybody stay cool.

448
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:34,975
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

449
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:42,168
Stay here.

450
00:35:57,696 --> 00:36:00,921
Hey, Jammer. You OK?

451
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,805
- How you guys doin'?
- I'm dealin'.

452
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:07,084
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

453
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:09,087
We're here. Let's get it done, OK?

454
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,001
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.

455
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,922
Split up into two teams.

456
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:19,002
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

457
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:20,495
Let's go.

458
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,361
You OK, Jammer?

459
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:32,447
Yeah, I'm fine.

460
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:41,040
- What's this?
- Should be the missile launch control centre.

461
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,600
- Don't touch anything.
- No.

462
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,500
This way.

463
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:48,286
I'm right behind you.

464
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:10,640
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

465
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,206
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

466
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:22,456
Shit!

467
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,087
Hey, Jammer.

468
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,251
Hey!

469
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,683
Hey! You OK?

470
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,761
Deep and slow, big guy.

471
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:38,363
- Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
- Everybody's dead!

472
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:42,123
- They're all dead!
- OK. I'm taking you back out. Let's go.

473
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:43,623
I'm OK.

474
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:49,601
I just can't go any further in.

475
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,565
OK, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

476
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:55,562
I've gotta check out this compartment,
all right?

477
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:59,685
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.

478
00:37:59,785 --> 00:38:02,762
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

479
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,406
- I got it.
- Pull it hard. Five more minutes.

480
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:07,641
Just relax, all right? You'll be OK.

481
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,294
- It's OK.
- Be right back.

482
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:55,207
You still readin' me OK, big guy?

483
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:58,371
Read you fine, Bud.

484
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:06,162
OK. Just a few more minutes.

485
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:09,684
There's a couple of compartments up ahead
that might have air.

486
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,964
- OK. No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?

487
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,490
Hang on, Jammer. Just hold onto that...

488
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:23,056
Shit!

489
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,407
Bud? Can you hear me?

490
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:28,296
Bud?

491
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,536
Goddamn it!

492
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,330
Oh, Jesus!

493
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,575
Bud, is that you?

494
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:41,967
Hang on, Jammer.

495
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:46,611
Lew! Cat! Hurry up, on the double!

496
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:49,767
I'm on my way!

497
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,056
Jammer!

498
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,970
- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!

499
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,446
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!

500
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:11,092
Gotta get the O2 cut down! Turn him over!

501
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,805
Crank it down, man! You're losing him!

502
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:21,565
All right. We've gotta get him outta here!
Let's go. Let's move it.

503
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:23,641
Easy, big fella.

504
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:24,805
That's it.

505
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,921
One Night, do you see the divers?

506
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:31,400
- Are they out yet?
- Negative, Lindsey.

507
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,764
Haven't seen hide nor hair.
Let's give 'em two minutes more max

508
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:36,972
and then I'll sound the diver recall...

509
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:58,601
Lindsey, do you copy?

510
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:01,602
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!

511
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:05,132
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way.

512
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:13,007
Look, I'm just a medic.

513
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:17,885
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it's...

514
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,967
There's not much I can do.

515
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,806
The coma could last hours or days.

516
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,562
So you didn't get anything on the cameras?

517
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:34,801
No, I didn't get a picture of it.

518
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:37,163
- What about the video?
- No.

519
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,241
We lost power right then.

520
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:41,965
Look, I just don't wanna talk about this, OK?

521
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:44,041
Fine. Be that way.

522
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:46,440
Look, I don't know what I saw, Bud, OK?

523
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,564
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible-fine.

524
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:52,482
It's a Russian submersible. No problem.

525
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:55,322
Yeah, but you think it was something else.

526
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:56,422
What?

527
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,727
One of ours?

528
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,136
No.

529
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:05,807
Well, whose then?

530
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:09,047
Come on, Lindsey. Talk to me.

531
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:12,483
Look, Jammer saw something down there.

532
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,243
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.

533
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:20,083
Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator
and his mixture got screwed up.

534
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,531
But what did he see that made him panic?

535
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:26,367
Well, what do you think he saw?

536
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:30,400
I don't know.

537
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,330
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

538
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:37,720
Could have been a Russian bogey.

539
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,886
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.

540
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:45,081
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.

541
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:48,486
And now they don't know
where the hell they are. OK.

542
00:43:50,016 --> 00:43:53,843
I don't have any choice.
I'm confirming you to go to Phase Two.

543
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:58,566
You'll recover one warhead, arm it,
and wait for further instructions.

544
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:02,329
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

545
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:05,764
Come on!

546
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:07,920
- What'd he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

547
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,444
...early reports that the Montana encountered
a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking

548
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:16,484
and the Kremlin
continues to deny any involvement.

549
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:18,560
That's us! That's us, man!

550
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,359
Benthic Petroleum are participating
in the recovery operation,

551
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,520
but we have little information.

552
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,999
We want names!

553
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:30,523
Hey, that's the Explorer! We're famous!

554
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:33,202
There is a tremendous amount of activity.

555
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:37,840
With Cuba only 80 miles away,
the massive build-up of American forces

556
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,123
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

557
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:45,563
Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,

558
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,800
have been circling the area

559
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,489
- and Soviet aircraft have been warned away.
- This sucks!

560
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:55,484
- Hippy, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? Nothing!

561
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,481
We're in the middle
of some international incident

562
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:02,359
- like the Cuban Missile Crisis!
- Figured that out for yourself, Hip?

563
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:04,563
We got Russian subs creeping around.

564
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:08,279
Anything goes wrong,
they could say whatever they want happened.

565
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:10,962
Relax, will you?
You're making the women nervous.

566
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:13,280
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know,

567
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,723
those SEALs ain't tellin' us diddly.
Something is goin' on!

568
00:45:16,823 --> 00:45:20,322
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

569
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:22,400
Everything is.

570
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,560
Coffey's splitting with Flatbed!

571
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,800
I showed him how to work the controls
and they're outta here!

572
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,923
- Didn't you tell him we need it?
- Yeah!

573
00:45:30,023 --> 00:45:32,522
- Where the hell is he takin' it?
- I have no idea!

574
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:33,622
Shit!

575
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:37,922
Coffey! Come back! We need

576
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:40,397
the big arm to unhook the umbilical.

577
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,802
There's a goddamn hurricane coming!

578
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:46,007
- He switched off.
- It's unbelievable.

579
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:52,050
Go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there!

580
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:04,837
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now!

581
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:07,961
- All right. Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys

582
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:12,598
went sightseeing with Flatbed. My people
need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.

583
00:46:12,698 --> 00:46:14,721
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?!

584
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:17,407
We're gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in two hours!

585
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:26,721
OK. Set cold tab fitting to 200psi.

586
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:29,239
- Set.
- There she goes.

587
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,679
- She's breakin' loose.
- Bringin' her up.

588
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:32,779
OK.

589
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,598
All right.

590
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,677
Clear the hatch.

591
00:46:37,777 --> 00:46:39,757
Go on with it.

592
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:41,677
Go on. That's it. Up.

593
00:46:41,777 --> 00:46:44,279
Sir, the missile looks intact.

594
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:47,517
Little is known about the events
leading up to the collision.

595
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,996
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton

596
00:46:50,096 --> 00:46:55,718
apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions.

597
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:59,559
In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen,

598
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:03,601
still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen

599
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:07,316
have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack.

600
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,839
- This was denied by...
- Bud, this is big time.

601
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:12,446
...who said that Captain Michael Sweeney...

602
00:47:13,612 --> 00:47:17,040
- OK. It's clear.
- It's all yours, sir.

603
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,878
I'm gonna swing it away and drop it.

604
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:21,978
Check. OK.

605
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:26,641
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

606
00:47:26,741 --> 00:47:30,239
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

607
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:33,078
Remove explosive bolts one through six

608
00:47:33,178 --> 00:47:37,051
- in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check. Removing bolt one.

609
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:49,079
Negotiators have walked out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks

610
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:51,961
in protest over the incident this morning.

611
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:55,357
The deterioration of relations
with the United States...

612
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:58,118
Soviet build-up of tanks
and aircraft has continued.

613
00:47:58,218 --> 00:48:02,438
...this morning, all US and NATO military
forces have been put on full alert.

614
00:48:02,538 --> 00:48:04,517
It's on every channel.

615
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:06,597
Well, you just feel so helpless.

616
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:09,199
You can see it coming, but what can you do?

617
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:11,277
What can anyone do?

618
00:48:11,377 --> 00:48:13,681
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.

619
00:48:14,652 --> 00:48:16,637
So why are we doing this?

620
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:18,919
If it happens, it happens.

621
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:21,519
There's nothing I can do about it, right?

622
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:23,603
I just don't think about it.

623
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:39,492
All right! Let's get their gear off! Then
clear the sub! We gotta get it outta here!

624
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:45,117
Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
One Night, you're up!

625
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,000
Get ready to roll, baby!

626
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,731
- Don't touch that! Just back away.
- Excusez-moi!

627
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:55,006
Hey, Coffey. We're a little pressed for time.

628
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,486
Prick.

629
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:03,162
This ain't no drill, Slick. Make me proud.

630
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:05,243
Piece of cake, baby.

631
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,518
What's the problem, One Night?

632
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:44,995
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable's pissin' me off!

633
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:49,208
- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby. Just keep tryin'.

634
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,921
Son of a bitch!

635
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,434
Shit! We got a problem!

636
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,718
- What's going on?
- We're losing number two thruster!

637
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,562
Bearing's going!

638
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:05,000
It's not holding!
We're swinging out of position here!

639
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,330
Jesus!

640
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,770
Shit!

641
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,315
The rig is movin'!

642
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:40,114
Yeah, I can see that. Topside!
Pay out some slack! We're gettin' dragged!

643
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:43,202
Down on number one winch! Down on one!

644
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,566
We're headed for the drop-off!

645
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,203
What the hell...?
We just lost all the topside feeds!

646
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,638
Shit! Get 'em on the UQC.

647
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:30,324
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!

648
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,115
- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?

649
00:51:34,215 --> 00:51:36,760
The crane! We've lost the crane!

650
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,841
It's on its way down to you!

651
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,967
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!

652
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:47,728
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let's move it! Let's go! Go!

653
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,881
- Wait!
- Get in here!

654
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,006
- What the hell is goin' on around here?!
- I don't know!

655
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,439
You two help secure the rig! Let's go!

656
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,724
One Night! Get the hell outta there!
The crane's comin' down!

657
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,168
I'm OK. I'm clear, Bud.

658
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,604
I've got it! It's headed straight for us!

659
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,368
Oh, shit!

660
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:00,887
- Oh, God...
- No!

661
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:03,609
Bud?

662
00:54:03,736 --> 00:54:05,606
Grab onto something!

663
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,409
Jesus!

664
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:23,564
- Battery room's flooding! Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

665
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:28,838
- Bud! The drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

666
00:54:31,649 --> 00:54:33,634
Go! I'll take the battery room!

667
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:34,934
Jesus!

668
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:53,049
Shit!

669
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:58,715
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!

670
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,800
Seal the room!

671
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,003
Lindsey! Let's get outta here!

672
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:01,043
- Hold this on me!
- OK!

673
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:07,594
Lindsey!

674
00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:09,167
I got it!

675
00:56:29,808 --> 00:56:32,083
Let's get the hell outta here!

676
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:39,168
Let's go!

677
00:56:39,453 --> 00:56:42,053
Hit the door!

678
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:46,088
No!

679
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:49,648
Bud!

680
00:56:59,168 --> 00:57:02,313
Finler, cut the hose! Cut the line to the motor!

681
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:04,553
I can't open it from out here!

682
00:57:04,653 --> 00:57:07,685
Finler, cut the hose!

683
00:57:09,568 --> 00:57:10,968
Finler!

684
00:57:34,928 --> 00:57:35,928
Hey!

685
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:40,128
Hey!

686
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:41,608
Hey!

687
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:47,276
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

688
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:48,721
Hang on!

689
00:57:51,528 --> 00:57:55,237
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

690
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,635
Come on, Cat!

691
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:02,935
Hurry!

692
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:06,407
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out! Come on! Push!

693
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:14,075
- Come on, Sonny! Let's go!
- Come on! Let's go! We gotta go!

694
00:58:14,175 --> 00:58:16,595
Get outta here! Come on! Move it!

695
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:17,695
Go!

696
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,072
Get the hatch, Cat!

697
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:22,079
Get the hatch!

698
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:38,634
- You all right? Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

699
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,713
Son of a bitch!

700
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:41,813
Oh, man!

701
00:58:48,606 --> 00:58:51,996
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore Two. Do you read me?

702
00:58:55,685 --> 00:58:59,192
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore.

703
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,270
Do you read me? Over.

704
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,674
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone, man.

705
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:08,556
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.

706
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:11,716
They're gone.

707
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:15,325
OK?

708
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,796
I just wanna get out of this.

709
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:25,599
I'd just like to see my wife one more time.

710
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:29,601
Well, all right, then.
You'd better keep trying, huh?

711
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:33,237
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore Two.

712
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:40,152
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Do you read me? This is Deepcore Two. Over.

713
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:42,236
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

714
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,996
Hey, Jammer.

715
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:19,153
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.

716
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:23,523
I'll deal with it, all right?
I'll deal with me. You deal with yourself.

717
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:26,436
Find your buddy?

718
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,196
- No.
- Tighter.

719
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:31,796
- Brigman.
- What?

720
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:35,670
I was under orders.

721
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,756
I had no choice.

722
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,116
How's it going, Cat?

723
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:07,071
- What's the scoop, ace?
- Well,

724
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:11,194
I can get power to this module
and sub-bay if I reroute these buses.

725
01:01:11,294 --> 01:01:14,880
But I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

726
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:19,231
But there won't be enough to run the heaters.

727
01:01:19,331 --> 01:01:22,283
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

728
01:01:24,283 --> 01:01:25,672
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.

729
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:30,757
If we close off the sections we're not using,
we have about maybe 12 hours' worth.

730
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:35,991
The storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

731
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:38,068
Yeah, well...

732
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:40,148
I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

733
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:44,352
There are some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

734
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:47,276
I'll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

735
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:52,883
Hey, Lins.

736
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:54,988
- Lins.
- Yeah?

737
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:56,357
I'm glad you're here.

738
01:01:57,683 --> 01:01:58,683
Yeah?

739
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:01,957
I'm not.

740
01:02:28,402 --> 01:02:32,069
Hey. Found Cab 3.
Deader than dogshit, boss.

741
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:35,111
That girder went right through the brainpan.

742
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:37,193
Yeah, I see that.

743
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,715
- Where are you?
- Living quarters. Level two.

744
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:50,962
Jeez!

745
01:02:53,882 --> 01:02:55,873
That's Perry.

746
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:03,078
That's it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

747
01:03:04,042 --> 01:03:05,242
Jesus.

748
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,027
We just leave 'em there?

749
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:14,400
Yeah, for now. We got no choice. Our first
priority is to get somethin' to breathe.

750
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,711
Where are you now, Lins?

751
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,111
I'm under the starboard tri-module.

752
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:35,715
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

753
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:49,269
- How's it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.

754
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:53,146
- There's a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don't get fouled.

755
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,387
- Hit me with that nine sixteenths, OK?
- Yeah.

756
01:03:56,487 --> 01:03:58,473
Thank you. So...

757
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,991
- There you were.
- Yeah, there we were.

758
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:06,075
Side by side on the same ship
for two months.

759
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:11,471
I'm a tool pusher and we're testing
this automated derrick of hers.

760
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:14,271
We get back on the beach
and we're livin' together.

761
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:16,427
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

762
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,907
Well, we were due to go back out
on the same ship. Six months of tests.

763
01:04:20,007 --> 01:04:23,307
If you were married, you got a stateroom.
Otherwise it was bunks.

764
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:28,027
OK. Good reason. Will you come over here
and tighten this for me? Then what?

765
01:04:28,127 --> 01:04:31,108
Then it was all right
there for a while, you know.

766
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,667
Then she got promoted
to chief engineer on this thing.

767
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:39,153
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

768
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:42,110
She's just too damn aggressive.

769
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,999
Son of a bitch!

770
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:47,788
She didn't leave me. She just left me behind.

771
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:49,918
Bud, let me tell you somethin'.

772
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:54,355
She ain't half as smart as she thinks she is.

773
01:04:57,362 --> 01:04:58,715
Get outta here.

774
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:35,236
Come on. Let's see those muscles.

775
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:38,626
Bingo! That's one.

776
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,707
Two for two.

777
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:42,607
Hey, hey.

778
01:05:43,602 --> 01:05:45,672
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

779
01:05:46,922 --> 01:05:49,311
Copy you, Hippy. What's the matter?

780
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,830
Oh, shit.
The power's jackin' around with us again.

781
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,710
Lindsey, come back.

782
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,191
I just lost video. Lins, are you there...?

783
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:01,953
Hippy, do you copy?

784
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:06,760
Lins, you copy?

785
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:09,322
Oh, shit!

786
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:12,833
Oh, what the hell! Hippy, do you copy?

787
01:06:13,922 --> 01:06:15,428
Damn it!

788
01:06:15,528 --> 01:06:17,160
Bud, do you copy? Over.

789
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:22,511
I seem to be having a problem here.

790
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:36,442
Shit!

791
01:08:49,562 --> 01:08:51,162
Damn it!

792
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,029
- That's a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?

793
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:29,426
Come on, you guys. That's the smaller one.
That's the smaller one here.

794
01:09:29,526 --> 01:09:32,389
- You can see how it's zigging around.
- Whatever it is.

795
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:35,386
I'm telling you what it is.
You're just not hearing me.

796
01:09:35,486 --> 01:09:38,306
- Now, Lindsey...
- There is something down there.

797
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:42,386
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.

798
01:09:42,486 --> 01:09:44,471
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

799
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,305
Not human.

800
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:50,551
Get it? Something non-human but intelligent.

801
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,677
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

802
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,585
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

803
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:07,310
NTIs. Oh, man, that's better than UFOs.
But that works too.

804
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,237
Underwater Flying Objects.

805
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,065
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!

806
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:19,225
Hot rods of the gods! Right, Lins?

807
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:21,305
No, no, really. It could be NTIs.

808
01:10:21,405 --> 01:10:24,066
- The CIA has known about 'em for ever.
- Step outside.

809
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,864
- They abduct people all the time, man.
- Hippy, would you do me a favour?

810
01:10:27,964 --> 01:10:29,945
Stay off my side.

811
01:10:30,045 --> 01:10:33,237
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

812
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,111
I... Come here.

813
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,026
- Jesus, Lins!
- Something really important's happening.

814
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:45,505
I'm trying to keep the situation under control.
I can't allow this kind of hysteria.

815
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:48,637
Who's hysterical?! Nobody's hysterical!

816
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,785
When you're hanging on by your fingernails,
you don't go waving your arms around.

817
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:58,585
I saw something. I'm not gonna go in there
and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.

818
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:01,506
- Please.
- You are the most stubborn woman I know.

819
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:03,585
Yes, I am!

820
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:05,984
But I need you to believe me right now.

821
01:11:06,084 --> 01:11:09,108
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

822
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:13,708
Do I have any symptoms of pressure -
sickness, tremors, slurred speech?

823
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:15,791
- No.
- No.

824
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,835
Bud, this is me - Lindsey. OK?

825
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,713
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

826
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,665
Now watch my lips.

827
01:11:25,765 --> 01:11:27,955
I saw these things.

828
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,348
I touched one of them.
And... it wasn't some clunky steel can...

829
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:35,829
...like we would build.

830
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,665
It glided.

831
01:11:38,765 --> 01:11:41,672
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

832
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,185
Oh, God, I wish you'd been there.

833
01:11:45,285 --> 01:11:47,265
It was a machine.

834
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:51,797
It was a machine, but it was alive.
It was like a... like a dance of light.

835
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,065
Please. You have to trust me.

836
01:11:56,165 --> 01:12:00,349
Now, I don't think they mean us any harm.
I don't know how I know that.

837
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,635
It's just... a feeling.

838
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,509
Jesus! I'm supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

839
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:12,385
- You think Coffey's gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

840
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:15,030
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.

841
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,111
He sees hate and fear.

842
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,753
You have to look with better eyes than that.

843
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,279
Please.

844
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,597
I can't, Lins.

845
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,231
I'm sorry.

846
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,586
All I want is 24-hour surveillance
on exterior cameras.

847
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,026
- You've got six people. I've got...
- Comin' through!

848
01:12:41,126 --> 01:12:43,109
Everybody just stop!

849
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:54,787
All right. I want around-the-clock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

850
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,023
That Russian bogey comes back,

851
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,423
- I don't think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.

852
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:03,866
Those things live three and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench.

853
01:13:03,966 --> 01:13:06,472
Trust me, they're not speaking Russian.

854
01:13:09,478 --> 01:13:11,543
Have you finished the repairs

855
01:13:11,643 --> 01:13:13,993
- on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.

856
01:13:15,318 --> 01:13:18,746
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.

857
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:20,823
Well, get it done.

858
01:13:20,923 --> 01:13:23,068
Kiss my ass.

859
01:13:34,438 --> 01:13:36,423
All right.

860
01:13:36,523 --> 01:13:38,822
Get something straight.

861
01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:41,063
You people are under my authority.

862
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:43,462
Look, pardner...

863
01:13:43,562 --> 01:13:45,666
we don't work for you.

864
01:13:45,766 --> 01:13:47,749
We don't take orders from you.

865
01:13:48,398 --> 01:13:50,514
And we don't much like you.

866
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,438
Hey, Cat!

867
01:13:57,318 --> 01:13:58,313
Yeah.

868
01:13:58,413 --> 01:14:01,834
Why don't you take
the first watch on sonar? OK?

869
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:04,758
Right on.

870
01:14:06,118 --> 01:14:09,987
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.
Then you spell Cat, all right?

871
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:12,751
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.

872
01:14:14,318 --> 01:14:19,312
One Night... Will you do me a favour
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?

873
01:14:20,478 --> 01:14:22,867
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.

874
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:33,598
Got it.

875
01:14:55,318 --> 01:14:57,303
All right.

876
01:14:57,403 --> 01:15:01,277
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.

877
01:15:02,478 --> 01:15:04,469
What is...?

878
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:14,472
Oh, this is not happening.

879
01:15:21,838 --> 01:15:25,387
I'm shaking, man. All right. Wait. And now...

880
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:28,918
Here's MIRV!

881
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:36,422
- Oh, come on, man! What else could it be?
- Why bring it here?

882
01:15:36,522 --> 01:15:41,143
It's gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the Russians, right?

883
01:15:41,243 --> 01:15:43,542
Look, they hot-wire one of the nukes.

884
01:15:43,642 --> 01:15:46,746
They use some kind of detonator
that they brought.

885
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:50,622
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Fry the whole thing up. Bam!

886
01:15:50,722 --> 01:15:52,709
Slicker than snot.

887
01:15:54,558 --> 01:15:57,391
I'm tellin' you. And I'm not being paranoi...

888
01:15:58,278 --> 01:16:00,078
Hi, Lins.

889
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:12,702
- Lins, will you just wait a second?
- If you don't do something about it, I will!

890
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:16,382
- Lindsey, we'll do something about it!
- Fellas?! Hello!

891
01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:19,865
- Lins! Stop and think about this for a second.
- What?

892
01:16:39,955 --> 01:16:43,984
You know, you've got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

893
01:16:44,084 --> 01:16:48,024
With all that's goin' on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon

894
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:49,903
- in here!
- Mrs Brigman...

895
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:53,699
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

896
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:57,223
Mrs Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

897
01:16:57,323 --> 01:17:00,620
- It's better if you don't.
- You're right! I don't need to know!

898
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,505
What I need to know is that thing is
off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?!

899
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,903
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

900
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:14,503
Now, you either do an about-face and walk
out of here, or I'll have you escorted out.

901
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:17,581
I will not do an about-face and get outta here!

902
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:22,785
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- Emergency! Maintenance Room B! Move it!

903
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:24,424
On the double!

904
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:25,524
Now!

905
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:30,387
- In here! Come on! We got trouble! Come on!
- What's goin' on?

906
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:32,515
All right!

907
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:37,142
- What's up? What's happening?
- You let her go, man. Do it.

908
01:17:37,242 --> 01:17:38,944
Do it now!

909
01:17:39,044 --> 01:17:40,593
Let her go.

910
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,066
The smartest thing you ever did.

911
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:51,024
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey! Cool it.

912
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:55,631
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we?

913
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:17,466
We don't need them.

914
01:18:18,555 --> 01:18:20,546
We can't trust them.

915
01:18:23,555 --> 01:18:25,546
We may have to take steps.

916
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:31,066
We're gonna have to take steps.

917
01:18:35,515 --> 01:18:39,102
Lins, I want you
to stay away from that guy. I mean it.

918
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:41,702
The guy is gone. Did you see his hands?

919
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:43,940
What? He's got the shakes?

920
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,341
Look, he's operating on his own.
He's cut off from his chain of command.

921
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:51,623
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis.

922
01:18:51,723 --> 01:18:53,700
And he's got a nuclear weapon.

923
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,702
So, as a personal favour to me, will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while?

924
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:02,265
I gotta tell you. I give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

925
01:19:40,336 --> 01:19:44,205
You can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go

926
01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:47,441
- and he'll go there, right?
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey.

927
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,723
Why, Hip? Come on.

928
01:19:48,823 --> 01:19:53,723
Because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth, which I don't think it can,

929
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:58,840
without the tether, you know what would
happen? It would just sit like a dumb shit.

930
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,922
Something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything.

931
01:20:03,022 --> 01:20:05,682
But we could get lucky.
So we should go for it.

932
01:20:05,782 --> 01:20:08,203
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.

933
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,761
No. This is between you and me. We get
proof and then we tell the others. Hippy, look.

934
01:20:12,861 --> 01:20:17,045
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there,

935
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,042
maybe he'll ease off the button a little bit.

936
01:20:20,142 --> 01:20:25,043
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me more
than anything we're gonna find down there.

937
01:20:25,143 --> 01:20:29,334
He's a goddamn
AJ Squared Away jarhead robot!

938
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:34,963
Give me a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can do.

939
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,614
Great. Thanks.

940
01:20:44,856 --> 01:20:46,847
How's that?

941
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,576
Thanks.

942
01:21:13,376 --> 01:21:15,367
Virgil, turn on your side.

943
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,482
All right. You're all set, big guy.

944
01:21:46,582 --> 01:21:49,409
Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.

945
01:21:58,256 --> 01:22:00,247
Good night, little buddy.

946
01:23:44,376 --> 01:23:45,376
Bud!

947
01:23:46,701 --> 01:23:48,101
Get up!

948
01:24:01,696 --> 01:24:02,696
Cat?

949
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,736
Cat!

950
01:24:06,023 --> 01:24:08,769
Hey! Goddamn... Leave me alone.

951
01:24:16,896 --> 01:24:17,896
Bud!

952
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,521
No, wait. It's OK.

953
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:25,761
Sweet Christ almighty!

954
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,245
I think it likes you.

955
01:24:45,896 --> 01:24:48,126
It's trying to communicate.

956
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:51,616
It's Bud.

957
01:24:55,136 --> 01:24:57,730
- It's wonderful!
- It's me!

958
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:02,806
- No. Don't...
- It's OK.

959
01:25:07,616 --> 01:25:09,607
Is it alive?

960
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,567
Lindsey, no...

961
01:25:16,016 --> 01:25:17,816
Seawater.

962
01:25:18,064 --> 01:25:19,664
Oh, man.

963
01:25:32,296 --> 01:25:33,896
Come on!

964
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,645
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it going?

965
01:25:48,856 --> 01:25:51,320
Hurry! I think it's headed for B module!

966
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,407
Lins, you see it?

967
01:26:51,015 --> 01:26:55,640
So, raise your hand if you think
it was a Russian water tentacle.

968
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,364
Lieutenant?

969
01:26:57,464 --> 01:26:59,446
No? Well...

970
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:02,400
A breakthrough.

971
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,682
Hey, ace,

972
01:27:03,782 --> 01:27:08,400
- you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.

973
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:13,200
They must have learned to control water.
I mean, at a molecular level.

974
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,201
They can plasticise it, pulverise it,
do whatever they wanna do with it.

975
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:22,202
- They can put it under intelligent control.
- Maybe... their whole technology

976
01:27:22,302 --> 01:27:25,128
is based on that-controlling water.

977
01:27:26,255 --> 01:27:29,363
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

978
01:27:29,463 --> 01:27:30,463
No.

979
01:27:30,742 --> 01:27:34,322
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

980
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:37,880
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an NTI.

981
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:41,323
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.

982
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,560
Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin' us out?

983
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,640
- Yeah.
- How come?

984
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,720
Curious, I suppose.

985
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,012
We're probably the first people
they've ever seen.

986
01:28:07,975 --> 01:28:11,604
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it's cute!

987
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:32,046
You need to get some sleep.

988
01:28:41,295 --> 01:28:42,694
We have no...

989
01:28:43,495 --> 01:28:46,134
...way of warning the surface.

990
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:49,326
And you know what that means?

991
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,526
It means whatever happens...

992
01:28:54,575 --> 01:28:56,566
...is up to us.

993
01:28:57,735 --> 01:28:58,735
Us.

994
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:08,878
So you think they're from down there
originally? Or from...

995
01:30:08,978 --> 01:30:10,958
...you know.

996
01:30:11,058 --> 01:30:13,038
I don't know.

997
01:30:13,138 --> 01:30:16,199
I think... I think they're from "you know".

998
01:30:16,299 --> 01:30:18,597
Someplace with similar conditions.

999
01:30:18,697 --> 01:30:21,359
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!

1000
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:24,570
Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
probably.

1001
01:31:20,693 --> 01:31:22,684
Sniff something?

1002
01:31:25,973 --> 01:31:27,964
Did you, rat boy?

1003
01:31:32,609 --> 01:31:33,609
Hey!

1004
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:35,755
Freeze!

1005
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:38,055
Don't move!

1006
01:31:38,174 --> 01:31:39,887
That's right.

1007
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:43,157
- OK, Hip?
- They're using Big Geek

1008
01:31:43,257 --> 01:31:45,633
- to take the bomb to the NTIs.
- What?

1009
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,677
We set it up to go right to 'em.

1010
01:31:47,777 --> 01:31:49,361
Oh, my God!

1011
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:54,355
Take this. We're going to Phase Three.

1012
01:31:54,455 --> 01:31:56,674
What? We don't have orders for that!

1013
01:31:56,774 --> 01:32:01,154
I programmed Big Geek to go down to the
bottom of the trench and shoot some video.

1014
01:32:01,254 --> 01:32:03,809
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.

1015
01:32:07,209 --> 01:32:11,435
Coffey... Come on, Coffey.
Just think about what you're doing, OK?

1016
01:32:11,535 --> 01:32:13,759
Just think about what you're doing!

1017
01:32:14,449 --> 01:32:16,249
Get back!

1018
01:32:16,774 --> 01:32:20,921
This is something I've wanted to do
since we first met.

1019
01:32:28,129 --> 01:32:30,120
Take it easy.

1020
01:32:32,849 --> 01:32:36,995
- All right! Into the kitchen! Let's go! Move!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

1021
01:32:37,095 --> 01:32:39,074
I know the way.

1022
01:32:39,174 --> 01:32:42,197
Your boss is fixin' to pull the pin
on 50 kilotons.

1023
01:32:42,297 --> 01:32:44,636
And we're all gonna be ringside!

1024
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:46,714
He's havin' a full-on meltdown!

1025
01:32:46,814 --> 01:32:49,316
- What's the timer set for?
- Three hours.

1026
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:51,517
- Shut up! Don't talk.
- Three hours.

1027
01:32:51,617 --> 01:32:54,877
We can't get to minimum safe distance
in three hours.

1028
01:32:54,977 --> 01:32:58,035
We can't go to Phase Three.
What about these people?

1029
01:32:58,135 --> 01:33:00,359
Shut up! What's the matter with you?

1030
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:10,158
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.

1031
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:17,838
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

1032
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:25,434
Shoenick! Your lieutenant's
about to make a real bad career move!

1033
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:27,833
The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!

1034
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:30,995
- Can't you see he's lost it?
- Shut up!

1035
01:33:31,095 --> 01:33:33,516
- The shock wave'll kill us.
- Quiet!

1036
01:33:33,616 --> 01:33:35,717
It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

1037
01:33:35,817 --> 01:33:38,156
- Shut up, man!
- We gotta stop him.

1038
01:33:38,256 --> 01:33:39,638
Shut up!

1039
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:43,358
This is not our mission.
We can't detonate without orders.

1040
01:33:57,009 --> 01:33:59,675
He's about to declare war on an alien species

1041
01:33:59,775 --> 01:34:02,994
just when they're trying
to make contact with us. Please!

1042
01:34:03,094 --> 01:34:06,968
- I don't know. I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah!

1043
01:34:08,089 --> 01:34:10,080
I'll be damned.

1044
01:34:12,929 --> 01:34:14,920
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?

1045
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:17,649
Oh, man!

1046
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:21,677
- Don't move, jarface!
- Look, I'm the least of your problems.

1047
01:34:21,777 --> 01:34:24,595
Take it easy, Hippy.
How you feeling, big guy?

1048
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:26,680
I'm OK, Bud. I...

1049
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:32,642
I just... figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel coming for me.

1050
01:34:35,729 --> 01:34:38,926
Yeah, OK.
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later?

1051
01:34:45,489 --> 01:34:48,395
- Come on.
- He's got it tied off with something.

1052
01:34:48,495 --> 01:34:50,480
Come on. Ready?

1053
01:34:53,329 --> 01:34:57,447
- We're not gonna be able to budge it.
- Now what? This is the only door to sub-bay.

1054
01:35:09,049 --> 01:35:12,077
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch six.

1055
01:35:12,177 --> 01:35:13,377
What?!

1056
01:35:14,254 --> 01:35:16,117
I'm gonna get inside

1057
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:19,997
- and open the door from the other side.
- Bud, this water is freezing.

1058
01:35:20,889 --> 01:35:23,555
Then I guess you'd better wish me luck, huh?

1059
01:35:23,655 --> 01:35:25,996
- Wish us luck.
- You comin' along?

1060
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:27,442
Looks that way.

1061
01:35:28,769 --> 01:35:31,522
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

1062
01:35:32,169 --> 01:35:35,357
- In case I don't die...
- This is insane.

1063
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:38,885
Come on, Bud.
Let's go, pardner. I ain't got all day.

1064
01:36:36,089 --> 01:36:38,080
Come on. Yank on it.

1065
01:36:43,449 --> 01:36:45,434
We have to...

1066
01:36:45,534 --> 01:36:47,514
We have to go to the moon pool.

1067
01:36:47,614 --> 01:36:50,116
- It's the only way.
- I can't.

1068
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:52,396
I can't make it, pardner.

1069
01:36:52,496 --> 01:36:54,480
I'm sorry.

1070
01:36:55,849 --> 01:36:57,449
OK, Cat.

1071
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:00,320
You head on back, all right?

1072
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:33,238
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

1073
01:38:33,338 --> 01:38:37,677
- He's gonna try and take him out himself.
- No. God, he couldn't be that dumb.

1074
01:38:37,777 --> 01:38:39,805
That guy's a trained killer.

1075
01:39:26,929 --> 01:39:27,929
No!

1076
01:39:28,418 --> 01:39:30,969
Coffey... Coffey, listen.

1077
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:45,129
Hey!

1078
01:41:01,769 --> 01:41:02,769
Hey!

1079
01:41:18,769 --> 01:41:21,602
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

1080
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:30,486
- He's dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.

1081
01:41:33,889 --> 01:41:36,198
Come on. Help me. Pull the gripper!

1082
01:41:47,329 --> 01:41:49,320
Cat, get the door!

1083
01:41:58,409 --> 01:41:59,409
Shit!

1084
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:01,928
Come on!

1085
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:04,516
Shoot!

1086
01:42:04,616 --> 01:42:05,607
You all right?

1087
01:42:05,707 --> 01:42:07,717
The safety's on!

1088
01:42:07,817 --> 01:42:09,765
Give me that!

1089
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:17,676
Come on! Let's go! Help me out!
Gimme a hand. Let's move it.

1090
01:42:17,776 --> 01:42:21,284
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.

1091
01:42:22,209 --> 01:42:24,875
Go! You're better in these than I am.

1092
01:42:24,975 --> 01:42:27,085
You got air? Come on.

1093
01:42:29,289 --> 01:42:31,359
You got air.

1094
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:21,969
Shit!

1095
01:44:49,969 --> 01:44:53,439
Bud, get out of the way!

1096
01:44:58,969 --> 01:44:59,969
Shit!

1097
01:45:21,729 --> 01:45:23,720
Get in! Hurry up!

1098
01:45:24,329 --> 01:45:27,526
I'm comin', baby! Keep your pantyhose on.

1099
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:38,640
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1100
01:45:42,129 --> 01:45:44,927
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

1101
01:45:52,809 --> 01:45:55,113
Oh, my God! OK. Get on the arm.

1102
01:45:55,213 --> 01:45:58,195
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

1103
01:45:58,295 --> 01:45:59,695
Steady.

1104
01:46:00,055 --> 01:46:01,555
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!

1105
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:04,395
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

1106
01:46:04,495 --> 01:46:07,003
- Hold it still.
- I am.

1107
01:46:17,249 --> 01:46:19,240
Shit! We lost Geek!

1108
01:46:24,969 --> 01:46:26,997
Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?

1109
01:46:27,097 --> 01:46:29,045
I'll take a look.

1110
01:46:30,729 --> 01:46:33,163
- He's comin' up fast. Step on it!
- Shit!

1111
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:47,005
- Go to the right! Swing to the right!
- Shit!

1112
01:47:01,889 --> 01:47:03,880
Keep movin', baby!

1113
01:47:05,729 --> 01:47:06,729
Come here.

1114
01:47:13,169 --> 01:47:14,488
Son of a bitch!

1115
01:47:21,929 --> 01:47:24,159
Hard left, baby! Left!

1116
01:47:37,809 --> 01:47:39,358
Jesus Christ, lady!

1117
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:41,963
If you think you can do any better,
you're welcome!

1118
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,120
Son of a bitch!

1119
01:47:52,609 --> 01:47:54,754
- Is he right on us?
- Right on your ass.

1120
01:47:54,854 --> 01:47:55,854
OK.

1121
01:47:56,338 --> 01:47:58,320
- Where you goin'?
- Hang on!

1122
01:49:38,129 --> 01:49:40,359
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Do you read?

1123
01:49:42,569 --> 01:49:45,367
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1124
01:49:47,569 --> 01:49:49,560
I'm not getting any answer!

1125
01:49:50,289 --> 01:49:52,716
And we're flooding like a son of a bitch.

1126
01:49:52,816 --> 01:49:54,794
Yeah. You noticed?

1127
01:49:54,894 --> 01:49:56,874
You did OK back there, Virgil.

1128
01:49:56,974 --> 01:49:59,997
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.

1129
01:50:00,097 --> 01:50:03,873
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.

1130
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,483
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1131
01:50:09,809 --> 01:50:11,555
Try it again.

1132
01:50:11,655 --> 01:50:13,605
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. We need a...

1133
01:50:17,009 --> 01:50:18,283
You all right?

1134
01:50:19,409 --> 01:50:20,409
Yeah.

1135
01:50:26,609 --> 01:50:27,998
Well, that's that.

1136
01:50:28,098 --> 01:50:30,080
Yeah, wonderful.

1137
01:50:30,889 --> 01:50:34,274
There's some light comin' from somewhere.
Off to the right.

1138
01:50:34,374 --> 01:50:36,354
Yeah, that's the rig.

1139
01:50:36,454 --> 01:50:38,434
It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say.

1140
01:50:38,534 --> 01:50:40,514
Well, they'll come after us.

1141
01:50:40,614 --> 01:50:45,364
Yeah, but it's gonna take 'em a while to get
here. We gotta get this flooding stopped.

1142
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:50,957
- Can you see where it's coming in?
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp?

1143
01:50:51,057 --> 01:50:56,203
There's a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don't think I can get to it.

1144
01:50:58,009 --> 01:51:01,394
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don't know. I'll have to look around.

1145
01:51:01,494 --> 01:51:03,480
Yeah, well, I looked already.

1146
01:51:05,489 --> 01:51:08,845
Goddamn it!
All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench!

1147
01:51:11,089 --> 01:51:12,689
Come on.

1148
01:51:18,329 --> 01:51:20,314
Son of a bitch!

1149
01:51:20,414 --> 01:51:22,240
OK. Calm down, Bud.

1150
01:51:23,209 --> 01:51:25,200
- Calm down.
- OK.

1151
01:51:28,249 --> 01:51:29,249
OK.

1152
01:51:31,969 --> 01:51:33,954
We gotta get you outta here.

1153
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:36,034
- How?
- I don't know how.

1154
01:51:36,134 --> 01:51:39,876
- All right. We've only got one suit.
- We gotta come up with something.

1155
01:51:39,976 --> 01:51:43,556
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Give me your hands.

1156
01:51:43,656 --> 01:51:47,353
Listen, you're smart. Think of something.
Can't you think of something?

1157
01:51:47,453 --> 01:51:50,759
OK. Why don't you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit?

1158
01:51:52,249 --> 01:51:57,721
That'll take me about seven or eight minutes
to swim, get the gear, and come back.

1159
01:51:58,729 --> 01:52:01,997
I wouldn't make it.
By the time I got back, you'd be...

1160
01:52:02,097 --> 01:52:03,097
OK.

1161
01:52:03,498 --> 01:52:06,640
Let's look around. Let's look. Oh, my God!

1162
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:10,720
Is that working?

1163
01:52:11,449 --> 01:52:12,449
Shit!

1164
01:52:23,449 --> 01:52:25,041
All right.

1165
01:52:25,889 --> 01:52:27,475
Here. You put this on.

1166
01:52:27,575 --> 01:52:31,236
- No! Are you growing gills all of a sudden?
- Don't argue with me, goddamn it!

1167
01:52:31,336 --> 01:52:35,757
- This is not an option, so forget about it!
- Lindsey, shut up and put this thing on!

1168
01:52:35,857 --> 01:52:38,558
- If you'd be logical...
- Fuck logic!

1169
01:52:38,658 --> 01:52:42,598
Listen to me. You've got the suit on
and you're a better swimmer than I am, right?

1170
01:52:42,698 --> 01:52:45,515
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right? Yes! So I've got a plan.

1171
01:52:45,615 --> 01:52:48,595
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.

1172
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:49,695
No!

1173
01:52:50,135 --> 01:52:53,317
Yes! This water's only
a couple of degrees above freezing.

1174
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:57,475
I'll... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood'll go like ice water.

1175
01:52:57,575 --> 01:53:00,597
My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

1176
01:53:00,697 --> 01:53:04,878
You tow me back and I can...
I can be revived after maybe

1177
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:07,795
- 10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

1178
01:53:07,895 --> 01:53:11,636
It's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.

1179
01:53:11,736 --> 01:53:16,796
Please! It's the only way. You've got
all the... stuff on the rig to do this.

1180
01:53:16,896 --> 01:53:19,084
Put this on. Bud, please!

1181
01:53:20,249 --> 01:53:22,234
- This is insane.
- I know.

1182
01:53:22,334 --> 01:53:24,314
Oh, my God.

1183
01:53:24,414 --> 01:53:26,394
- Are you OK?
- It's the only way.

1184
01:53:26,494 --> 01:53:28,480
All right. Here. Hold this.

1185
01:53:30,809 --> 01:53:32,800
Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey.

1186
01:53:35,289 --> 01:53:37,280
You can do this, you know.

1187
01:53:42,009 --> 01:53:44,436
- You can do this.
- God, Lins... I...

1188
01:53:44,536 --> 01:53:46,520
I know. You can tell me later.

1189
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:06,199
This is maybe not such a good idea!

1190
01:54:07,809 --> 01:54:09,208
Oh, my God!

1191
01:54:10,289 --> 01:54:11,889
Bud! No!

1192
01:54:20,929 --> 01:54:23,966
I can't! Oh, Bud, I'm scared!

1193
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:54,929
No!

1194
01:55:18,889 --> 01:55:20,438
I got him!

1195
01:55:20,538 --> 01:55:22,674
- Where?
- Oh, my God! It's Lindsey.

1196
01:55:22,774 --> 01:55:25,835
- Deepcore, do you read? Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

1197
01:55:25,935 --> 01:55:28,074
- We're here.
- Go to the infirmary.

1198
01:55:28,174 --> 01:55:30,958
Get the cart oxygen, defib kit,

1199
01:55:31,058 --> 01:55:35,834
adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,
and some heating blankets. You got all that?

1200
01:55:35,934 --> 01:55:38,595
- Got it.
- Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast!

1201
01:55:38,695 --> 01:55:40,238
Now! Come on! Let's go!

1202
01:55:40,338 --> 01:55:42,314
Hippy, get the hot packs!

1203
01:55:42,414 --> 01:55:44,014
Got 'em!

1204
01:55:59,129 --> 01:56:01,484
Here he comes!

1205
01:56:08,209 --> 01:56:10,354
- Watch her head.
- I got it. I got it.

1206
01:56:10,454 --> 01:56:12,440
Watch her feet.

1207
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:16,518
Watch her head comin' down. Watch...

1208
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:25,236
Clear it out. Is she clear?

1209
01:56:25,336 --> 01:56:27,596
Get the defib ready. Hurry up, Cat.

1210
01:56:27,696 --> 01:56:29,680
OK. Got it.

1211
01:56:31,049 --> 01:56:33,034
- OK?
- Yeah.

1212
01:56:33,134 --> 01:56:35,636
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

1213
01:56:35,736 --> 01:56:37,336
Breathe.

1214
01:56:37,814 --> 01:56:41,274
One one thousand...
two one thousand... three one thousand...

1215
01:56:41,374 --> 01:56:44,557
No! You gotta have bare skin or it won't work!

1216
01:56:44,657 --> 01:56:47,395
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

1217
01:56:47,495 --> 01:56:48,495
Here.

1218
01:56:49,414 --> 01:56:51,118
Is that right?

1219
01:56:51,218 --> 01:56:52,875
- I got it.
- Well, do it!

1220
01:56:52,975 --> 01:56:54,575
Breathe!

1221
01:56:55,017 --> 01:56:57,569
- Come on! Zap her!
- Clear!

1222
01:56:58,809 --> 01:57:01,193
- Come on, baby! Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.

1223
01:57:01,293 --> 01:57:02,875
Breathe.

1224
01:57:02,975 --> 01:57:07,434
- I'll jack it up to three hundred.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

1225
01:57:07,534 --> 01:57:09,956
It's going, it's going. It's charging.

1226
01:57:10,056 --> 01:57:12,040
Charging...

1227
01:57:13,209 --> 01:57:14,528
- Now!
- Clear!

1228
01:57:16,049 --> 01:57:18,034
- Anything?
- No pulse.

1229
01:57:18,134 --> 01:57:20,556
- Come on, baby!
- Charging one more time.

1230
01:57:20,656 --> 01:57:22,844
Zap her again. Come on!

1231
01:57:24,169 --> 01:57:26,160
- Come on!
- Clear!

1232
01:57:28,249 --> 01:57:30,234
God! No pulse.

1233
01:57:30,334 --> 01:57:32,474
It's flat. Goddamn! It's flat.

1234
01:57:32,574 --> 01:57:34,677
Get outta here.

1235
01:57:34,777 --> 01:57:38,037
One, two, three, four, five one thousand.

1236
01:57:38,137 --> 01:57:40,643
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1237
01:57:41,009 --> 01:57:44,160
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1238
01:57:50,169 --> 01:57:53,836
Come on, baby.
One one thousand, two one thousand,

1239
01:57:53,936 --> 01:57:57,037
three one thousand, four one thousand...

1240
01:57:57,137 --> 01:58:01,477
Come on, baby. One one thousand,
two one thousand, three one thousand...

1241
01:58:01,577 --> 01:58:05,475
Come on, baby! Breathe! Come on!
Two one thousand, three one thousand...

1242
01:58:05,575 --> 01:58:06,775
Bud...

1243
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:12,040
It's all over, man.

1244
01:58:14,569 --> 01:58:16,554
It's all over.

1245
01:58:16,654 --> 01:58:18,654
I'm sorry.

1246
01:58:18,936 --> 01:58:20,736
No pulse.

1247
01:58:42,049 --> 01:58:43,049
No!

1248
01:58:44,134 --> 01:58:46,636
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

1249
01:58:46,736 --> 01:58:48,720
Come on, Lins! Come on, baby!

1250
01:59:20,889 --> 01:59:23,316
- Zap her again! Do it!
- Charging.

1251
01:59:23,416 --> 01:59:24,616
Do it!

1252
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:32,284
Clear.

1253
01:59:32,384 --> 01:59:33,579
Clear!

1254
01:59:36,409 --> 01:59:38,400
Get outta here!

1255
01:59:44,609 --> 01:59:47,435
Come on. Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it! Breathe!

1256
01:59:47,535 --> 01:59:52,074
Goddamn it, you bitch! You never backed
away from anything in your life! Now fight!

1257
01:59:52,174 --> 01:59:53,374
Fight!

1258
01:59:54,254 --> 01:59:56,436
Right now! Do it!

1259
01:59:56,536 --> 01:59:58,520
Fight, goddamn it!

1260
01:59:59,369 --> 02:00:00,569
Fight!

1261
02:00:01,656 --> 02:00:02,856
Fight!

1262
02:00:03,138 --> 02:00:04,338
Fight!

1263
02:00:11,369 --> 02:00:13,354
Lins? That's it, Lindsey.

1264
02:00:13,454 --> 02:00:15,434
That's it, Lins. You can do it.

1265
02:00:15,534 --> 02:00:18,275
That's it, Lins. Come on back, baby. Come on.

1266
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:20,360
You can do it, baby.

1267
02:00:29,769 --> 02:00:31,754
Get her some air.

1268
02:00:31,854 --> 02:00:33,454
Breathe.

1269
02:00:37,489 --> 02:00:39,474
You did it, ace!

1270
02:00:39,574 --> 02:00:40,574
God!

1271
02:00:54,849 --> 02:00:56,840
Make sure her heart's OK.

1272
02:01:13,089 --> 02:01:15,080
Big boys don't cry, remember?

1273
02:01:21,249 --> 02:01:23,049
Hi, lady.

1274
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:26,280
Hi, tough guy.

1275
02:01:29,169 --> 02:01:31,154
I guess it worked, didn't it?

1276
02:01:31,254 --> 02:01:33,240
Yeah. Of course it did.

1277
02:01:34,529 --> 02:01:36,520
You're never wrong, are you?

1278
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:41,796
How you feelin'?

1279
02:01:41,896 --> 02:01:43,880
I feel better.

1280
02:01:45,129 --> 02:01:47,199
What did you do to me?

1281
02:01:52,729 --> 02:01:54,720
Next time it's your turn, OK?

1282
02:01:57,449 --> 02:01:59,440
Yeah, you got that right.

1283
02:02:00,529 --> 02:02:05,037
These are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid. How's that feel?

1284
02:02:05,137 --> 02:02:07,795
If you can't see, you can't disarm the bomb.

1285
02:02:07,895 --> 02:02:11,484
OK. With this much weight,
you're gonna fall like a brick.

1286
02:02:12,769 --> 02:02:16,958
We've still got about an hour,
so you should get there in plenty of time.

1287
02:02:17,058 --> 02:02:22,282
When you get down there, all you gotta do is
cut a wire, drop the weights and come home.

1288
02:02:25,049 --> 02:02:29,486
- Hand me that wrench.
- Maybe I oughta check everything.

1289
02:02:31,529 --> 02:02:34,275
That's loose. I'll fix that up.

1290
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:37,281
Bud, you don't have to do this.

1291
02:02:37,929 --> 02:02:39,914
Somebody's gotta do it.

1292
02:02:40,014 --> 02:02:41,957
It doesn't have to be you.

1293
02:02:42,057 --> 02:02:43,857
Who then?

1294
02:02:48,289 --> 02:02:51,594
So, what, I can hear you
but I can't talk, right?

1295
02:02:51,694 --> 02:02:54,877
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

1296
02:02:54,977 --> 02:02:57,715
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1297
02:02:57,815 --> 02:03:01,165
I gotta warn you all... I'm a pretty lousy typist.

1298
02:03:04,809 --> 02:03:06,765
The moment of truth.

1299
02:03:08,049 --> 02:03:10,040
Come on. Let's go.

1300
02:03:10,729 --> 02:03:11,729
Easy.

1301
02:03:14,409 --> 02:03:16,756
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.

1302
02:03:16,856 --> 02:03:19,436
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1303
02:03:19,536 --> 02:03:21,158
- Set.
- Clamp?

1304
02:03:21,258 --> 02:03:22,258
Set.

1305
02:03:32,329 --> 02:03:34,958
OK, let's rock and roll!

1306
02:03:35,058 --> 02:03:36,858
Crack it.

1307
02:03:37,489 --> 02:03:39,639
Headset, please.

1308
02:03:41,729 --> 02:03:43,765
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1309
02:03:45,169 --> 02:03:46,878
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.

1310
02:03:46,978 --> 02:03:47,968
Watch me.

1311
02:03:48,068 --> 02:03:50,077
OK? Watch me. Watch me.

1312
02:03:50,177 --> 02:03:52,633
Don't hold your breath. Take it in.

1313
02:03:52,733 --> 02:03:55,402
Just let yourself take it in. Take it in.

1314
02:03:57,129 --> 02:04:00,157
That's it. Don't hold your breath now.
There you go.

1315
02:04:00,257 --> 02:04:02,958
Don't hold your breath. Take it in. That's it.

1316
02:04:03,058 --> 02:04:05,678
- There you go.
- Bud!

1317
02:04:05,778 --> 02:04:07,594
This is not normal!

1318
02:04:07,694 --> 02:04:10,957
It's normal! It’ll pass in a second!
It's perfectly normal!

1319
02:04:11,057 --> 02:04:13,353
- It's not normal.
- It's perfectly normal.

1320
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:17,638
We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.
Your body will remember. That's it.

1321
02:04:17,738 --> 02:04:19,738
That's it.

1322
02:04:19,857 --> 02:04:22,558
- Perfectly normal.
- Christ! He's breathing!

1323
02:04:22,658 --> 02:04:24,640
Give me that.

1324
02:04:25,449 --> 02:04:27,833
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.

1325
02:04:27,933 --> 02:04:30,313
Yes? OK. Bud...

1326
02:04:30,413 --> 02:04:32,718
Try your keypad.

1327
02:04:46,569 --> 02:04:48,525
I already have.

1328
02:04:50,889 --> 02:04:52,089
Great.

1329
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:54,737
Let's go!

1330
02:05:00,609 --> 02:05:03,116
- Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

1331
02:05:03,216 --> 02:05:04,216
Easy.

1332
02:05:05,337 --> 02:05:07,923
Watch out. Watch his back. Watch the back.

1333
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:10,769
Careful.

1334
02:05:12,689 --> 02:05:16,516
I redid Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek!

1335
02:05:16,616 --> 02:05:18,754
It should take you straight there!

1336
02:05:18,854 --> 02:05:21,204
All you have to do is hang on!

1337
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,153
What's his depth?

1338
02:07:05,253 --> 02:07:07,914
- 3200 feet.
- Your depth is 3200 feet.

1339
02:07:08,014 --> 02:07:11,675
You're doing fine. Now,
you better watch out for crane wreckage.

1340
02:07:11,775 --> 02:07:13,838
You should be almost to it.

1341
02:07:23,968 --> 02:07:25,953
4800 feet. It's official.

1342
02:07:26,053 --> 02:07:27,053
Yeah.

1343
02:07:27,777 --> 02:07:31,637
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1344
02:07:31,737 --> 02:07:35,403
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?

1345
02:07:43,848 --> 02:07:46,840
One mile down. Still grinnin'.

1346
02:08:01,808 --> 02:08:03,799
8500 feet.

1347
02:08:05,088 --> 02:08:07,073
8500 feet, Bud.

1348
02:08:07,173 --> 02:08:09,159
Everything OK?

1349
02:08:10,688 --> 02:08:15,079
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1350
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:18,597
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.

1351
02:08:30,288 --> 02:08:33,316
It's starting. It hits the nervous system first.

1352
02:08:33,416 --> 02:08:35,436
Keep talking. Let him hear your voice.

1353
02:08:35,536 --> 02:08:37,513
OK, Bud. Your depth is 8900 feet.

1354
02:08:37,613 --> 02:08:41,036
- You're doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

1355
02:08:41,136 --> 02:08:43,119
Talk to him.

1356
02:08:49,768 --> 02:08:50,968
Bud...

1357
02:08:52,013 --> 02:08:55,318
There's some... some things I need to say.

1358
02:08:57,048 --> 02:08:59,039
It's hard for me, you know.

1359
02:09:00,528 --> 02:09:02,917
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch.

1360
02:09:03,568 --> 02:09:06,676
It takes discipline and years of training.

1361
02:09:06,776 --> 02:09:09,282
A lot of people don't appreciate that.

1362
02:09:12,768 --> 02:09:16,392
Jesus, I'm sorry
I can't tell you these things to your face.

1363
02:09:16,492 --> 02:09:18,160
I have to wait till you're alone in the dark,

1364
02:09:19,246 --> 02:09:23,034
freezing, and there's 10,000 feet
of water between us.

1365
02:09:24,686 --> 02:09:26,881
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

1366
02:09:39,606 --> 02:09:41,642
Comin' up on the big ten thou.

1367
02:09:48,166 --> 02:09:50,151
12,000 feet. Jesus!

1368
02:09:50,251 --> 02:09:52,550
- I don't believe he's doin' this!
- Hippy!

1369
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:55,319
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

1370
02:09:58,326 --> 02:10:00,317
Bud, how are you doing?

1371
02:10:01,486 --> 02:10:03,311
Signal's fading.

1372
02:10:03,411 --> 02:10:06,551
No! No, Bud, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

1373
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:10,430
Kill everything we don't need.
Knock out those exterior lights. Go! Go!

1374
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:13,954
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!

1375
02:10:14,054 --> 02:10:16,031
I am right here with you, Bud.

1376
02:10:16,131 --> 02:10:18,074
Bud, this is Lindsey.

1377
02:10:18,174 --> 02:10:21,115
Please. I'm right here with you.

1378
02:10:21,215 --> 02:10:24,881
OK? So try and stay calm.
I'm right here, all right?

1379
02:10:30,766 --> 02:10:31,766
Bud.

1380
02:10:34,366 --> 02:10:35,835
He's losing it.

1381
02:10:35,935 --> 02:10:39,513
- Talk to him. Keep him with us.
- Comin' up on 16,000 feet.

1382
02:10:39,613 --> 02:10:41,990
No, Bud, it's the pressure, all right?

1383
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:44,832
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.

1384
02:10:44,932 --> 02:10:48,710
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.

1385
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:50,914
17,000 feet.

1386
02:10:51,014 --> 02:10:53,433
Christ almighty, this is insane.

1387
02:10:53,533 --> 02:10:55,517
Bud? I'm not getting anything!

1388
02:11:01,246 --> 02:11:03,593
- Whoa! Come on! No!
- What?

1389
02:11:03,693 --> 02:11:05,836
- Little Geek just folded.
- Jesus.

1390
02:11:54,402 --> 02:11:56,358
He can still make it.

1391
02:11:57,842 --> 02:11:58,842
OK.

1392
02:12:01,482 --> 02:12:02,482
Bud?

1393
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,673
I know how alone you feel.

1394
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:11,477
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.

1395
02:12:15,522 --> 02:12:19,231
But I'm there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud. You're not alone.

1396
02:12:23,322 --> 02:12:24,922
Oh, God!

1397
02:12:25,407 --> 02:12:27,387
You remember that time...

1398
02:12:27,487 --> 02:12:30,867
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

1399
02:12:30,967 --> 02:12:35,160
The power went out in that little apartment
we had on Orange Street.

1400
02:12:35,922 --> 02:12:40,909
We were staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb like...

1401
02:12:41,009 --> 02:12:42,993
..."That candle is me, like...

1402
02:12:43,882 --> 02:12:48,319
like every one of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life."

1403
02:12:50,162 --> 02:12:54,867
And you just... you just lit up another candle
and you put it beside mine,

1404
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:57,874
and you said "No. See, that's me. That's me."

1405
02:12:59,002 --> 02:13:01,675
And we stared at the two candles and then...

1406
02:13:04,562 --> 02:13:08,874
Well, if you remember any of this,
I'm sure you remember the next part.

1407
02:13:11,762 --> 02:13:14,071
But there are two candles in the dark.

1408
02:13:16,202 --> 02:13:18,187
I'm with you.

1409
02:13:18,287 --> 02:13:21,035
I'll always be with you, Bud. I promise that.

1410
02:13:34,162 --> 02:13:36,153
How you doin', pardner?

1411
02:13:37,202 --> 02:13:39,193
You still with us? Come back.

1412
02:13:40,242 --> 02:13:42,227
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1413
02:13:42,327 --> 02:13:44,307
- Come on.
- Bud?

1414
02:13:44,407 --> 02:13:46,387
Talk to me, Bud.

1415
02:13:46,487 --> 02:13:48,866
Now, come on. You hangin' in there?

1416
02:13:48,966 --> 02:13:51,911
You have to talk to me, Bud! Please!

1417
02:13:52,011 --> 02:13:54,721
I need to know if you're OK.

1418
02:14:08,042 --> 02:14:10,229
You... you see light?

1419
02:14:10,329 --> 02:14:11,880
What kind of light, Bud?

1420
02:14:13,802 --> 02:14:16,032
He's hallucinating badly.

1421
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:40,469
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.

1422
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:44,748
OK, Bud.

1423
02:14:44,848 --> 02:14:46,824
We'll go step by step.

1424
02:14:46,924 --> 02:14:51,347
Remove the detonator housing
by unscrewing it

1425
02:14:51,447 --> 02:14:53,430
counterclockwise.

1426
02:15:22,279 --> 02:15:25,185
All right, Bud. You have to cut

1427
02:15:25,285 --> 02:15:28,345
the ground wire. Not the lead wire.

1428
02:15:28,445 --> 02:15:30,946
It's the blue wire with the white stripe.

1429
02:15:31,046 --> 02:15:33,846
Not, I repeat,

1430
02:15:34,646 --> 02:15:37,153
not the black wire with the yellow stripe.

1431
02:16:31,519 --> 02:16:33,504
Quiet! Save your air.

1432
02:16:33,604 --> 02:16:36,193
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1433
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:44,439
What?

1434
02:16:46,279 --> 02:16:49,148
- It took him 30 minutes to get there!
- Bud! Do you hear me?

1435
02:16:49,248 --> 02:16:51,304
You drop your weights and start back now!

1436
02:16:51,404 --> 02:16:54,348
That gauge could be wrong. Do you hear me?

1437
02:16:54,448 --> 02:16:58,665
Just drop your weights and start back now!
Your gauge could be wrong!

1438
02:16:58,765 --> 02:17:03,116
Your gauge could be wrong!
You drop your weights and start back now!

1439
02:17:07,039 --> 02:17:11,547
You won't stay there. You drop your weights.
You can breathe shallow! Do you hear me?

1440
02:17:11,647 --> 02:17:14,226
Bud, please listen to me! Please! Goddamn it!

1441
02:17:14,326 --> 02:17:16,826
You dragged me back
from that bottomless pit!

1442
02:17:16,926 --> 02:17:20,144
You can't leave me here alone now. Please!

1443
02:17:20,244 --> 02:17:22,543
Oh, God, Virgil! Please!

1444
02:17:22,643 --> 02:17:24,043
Please!

1445
02:18:03,959 --> 02:18:05,950
I love you.

1446
02:22:59,157 --> 02:23:00,357
Howdy.

1447
02:23:01,242 --> 02:23:04,115
How are you guys doin'?

1448
02:23:09,317 --> 02:23:13,586
Attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed...

1449
02:23:13,686 --> 02:23:16,663
The Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has...

1450
02:23:16,763 --> 02:23:20,866
All citizens to stay on their jobs,
restrict unnecessary travel...

1451
02:23:20,966 --> 02:23:23,464
...what officials are calling
an unprovoked attack.

1452
02:23:23,564 --> 02:23:24,555
Oh, shit!

1453
02:23:24,655 --> 02:23:27,862
Across the country,
National Guard units have been mobilised

1454
02:23:27,962 --> 02:23:31,472
and all civil defence volunteers
have been called to full-time duty.

1455
02:23:33,997 --> 02:23:36,983
You watch our TV.
That's what you're telling me.

1456
02:23:37,083 --> 02:23:40,505
- You know what's going on up there.
- Seismologists are reporting

1457
02:23:40,605 --> 02:23:43,785
an enormous disturbance
throughout the world's oceans

1458
02:23:43,885 --> 02:23:46,261
which apparently began
about 15 minutes ago.

1459
02:23:46,361 --> 02:23:50,982
They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis,
but with no apparent seismological source.

1460
02:23:51,082 --> 02:23:54,664
The waves are propagating towards
the shorelines of every continent.

1461
02:23:54,764 --> 02:23:57,386
- I'm sorry. That's...
- Dr Berg, would you please...

1462
02:23:57,486 --> 02:23:59,585
Young lady. Young lady, listen to me.

1463
02:23:59,685 --> 02:24:03,033
I don't know. We don't know
what's going on yet. We don't have a clue.

1464
02:24:04,317 --> 02:24:06,542
The horizon has already grown dark.

1465
02:24:06,642 --> 02:24:09,745
People are running everywhere.
It's sheer panic.

1466
02:24:09,845 --> 02:24:11,183
Stay on me!

1467
02:24:11,283 --> 02:24:15,306
The wave... the wave is,
I don't know, maybe 1,000 feet high already.

1468
02:24:15,406 --> 02:24:17,382
Getting bigger as I'm watching,

1469
02:24:17,482 --> 02:24:19,462
still miles out.

1470
02:24:19,562 --> 02:24:21,382
- My God!
- Get outta here!

1471
02:24:21,482 --> 02:24:23,186
No! Stay! We're staying!

1472
02:24:23,286 --> 02:24:24,703
Give it to me, then!

1473
02:24:24,803 --> 02:24:28,262
I don't even know if I'm still broadcasting.
I can't be sure.

1474
02:24:28,362 --> 02:24:30,587
I'll just keep going as long as I can.

1475
02:24:35,197 --> 02:24:37,188
You guys are doing this.

1476
02:24:39,157 --> 02:24:42,505
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

1477
02:24:42,605 --> 02:24:45,794
That's your technology,
but why are you doing this?

1478
02:25:05,077 --> 02:25:09,063
OK. That's enough. I get the point!

1479
02:25:09,163 --> 02:25:11,142
How do you know

1480
02:25:11,242 --> 02:25:13,228
they're really gonna do it?

1481
02:25:14,477 --> 02:25:18,304
Where do you get off passing judgement
on us? You can't be sure.

1482
02:25:18,404 --> 02:25:20,274
How do you know?

1483
02:28:08,157 --> 02:28:10,148
You could've done it.

1484
02:28:12,437 --> 02:28:14,428
Why didn't you?

1485
02:29:29,997 --> 02:29:33,025
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1486
02:29:33,125 --> 02:29:35,544
Do you hear, Deepcore?

1487
02:29:35,644 --> 02:29:38,754
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

1488
02:29:41,514 --> 02:29:44,950
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1489
02:29:46,634 --> 02:29:48,901
Hell, yes, we read! Good of you to join us!

1490
02:29:49,001 --> 02:29:51,144
Copy, Deepcore. Hey, I've got 'em!

1491
02:29:51,794 --> 02:29:53,779
How's that storm goin' up there?

1492
02:29:53,879 --> 02:29:55,982
It just blew itself out all of a sudden.

1493
02:29:56,082 --> 02:29:59,299
Well, hell, son.
You'd better get a line down to us.

1494
02:29:59,399 --> 02:30:03,620
We're in moderately poor shape down here.
We've lost seven people, including Bud.

1495
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:06,512
And we're about out of O2,
so whatever you're gonna do...

1496
02:30:09,032 --> 02:30:11,496
You make up your mind
how to get us outta here?

1497
02:30:11,596 --> 02:30:13,423
They're talking about
flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.

1498
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:16,618
- I just wish I could've seen it.
- OK.

1499
02:30:16,718 --> 02:30:18,695
How long's that gonna take?

1500
02:30:18,795 --> 02:30:21,623
How do you stop
a half-mile-high tidal wave...

1501
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:27,430
Hey...

1502
02:30:28,597 --> 02:30:31,058
- Hey! It's Bud!
- That's impossible.

1503
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:35,855
- No, it's not.
- Do you hear, Deepcore?

1504
02:30:35,955 --> 02:30:36,955
Yes!

1505
02:30:37,636 --> 02:30:40,259
Wait. We've got a message from Bud.

1506
02:30:40,359 --> 02:30:43,069
- Bud?
- What's it say?

1507
02:30:44,110 --> 02:30:45,110
Here.

1508
02:30:46,195 --> 02:30:48,181
It says...

1509
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:52,620
It says "Virgil Brigman back on the air."

1510
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:07,739
"Have some new friends down here."

1511
02:31:07,839 --> 02:31:10,185
"Guess they've been here a while."

1512
02:31:19,190 --> 02:31:23,468
"They've left us alone, but it bothers them
to see us hurting each other."

1513
02:31:27,310 --> 02:31:29,824
"Getting out of hand."

1514
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:39,739
"They sent a message. Hope you got it."

1515
02:31:39,839 --> 02:31:42,779
I'd say that's a big ten-four, Jack.

1516
02:31:42,879 --> 02:31:45,536
"They want us to grow up a bit

1517
02:31:45,636 --> 02:31:48,064
and put away childish things."

1518
02:31:49,750 --> 02:31:53,379
"Of course, it's just a suggestion."

1519
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:03,863
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

1520
02:32:13,390 --> 02:32:15,375
What the hell's goin' on?

1521
02:32:15,475 --> 02:32:17,774
One Night, get to sonar.

1522
02:32:17,874 --> 02:32:19,383
Good God almighty!

1523
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:24,574
Fellas...
I'm gettin' some awful big readings here.

1524
02:32:24,674 --> 02:32:27,299
- Something's comin' up the wall!
- What is it?

1525
02:32:27,399 --> 02:32:29,381
Whatever it is, it's major!

1526
02:32:59,310 --> 02:33:01,028
Something is definitely going on down there.

1527
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:06,537
Active is pinging back something really big.
It's huge!

1528
02:33:06,637 --> 02:33:08,897
- It's coming up underneath us.
- Where?

1529
02:33:08,997 --> 02:33:11,948
Where? It's everywhere!
There! Starboard bow!

1530
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:33,422
There! Look!

1531
02:34:46,386 --> 02:34:48,377
Help, Cat!

1532
02:35:17,346 --> 02:35:20,702
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.

1533
02:35:23,169 --> 02:35:25,456
They must have done something to us.

1534
02:35:26,989 --> 02:35:28,789
Oh, yeah.

1535
02:35:29,377 --> 02:35:31,457
Yeah, I think you could say that.

1536
02:36:18,986 --> 02:36:20,977
Hi, Brigman.

1537
02:36:22,097 --> 02:36:23,911
Hi, Mrs Brigman.
