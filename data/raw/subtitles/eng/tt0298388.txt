1
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,451
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey
was a really clumsy kid

2
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,662
On the first day of first grade
I'll tell you what he did

3
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,374
He tripped over a pencil box
Flew up in the air

4
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,211
Landed on a kangaroo
who pulled out all his hair

5
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:33,175
He needed first aid in the first grade
First aid in the first grade

6
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,095
First aid in the first grade

7
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,306
You could buy a zoo
with all the doctor bills he paid

8
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,017
Where is Route 59?

9
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:47,856
First aid in the second grade

10
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,818
You could buy a zoo
with all the doctor bills he paid

11
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,240
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey
was a really clumsy kid

12
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,866
Lights! Lights!

13
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,662
He fell out of a fishing boat
Splashed into the sea

14
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,872
Landed on a moray eel
Who bit him on the knee

15
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,710
He needed first aid in the third grade
He needed first aid in the third grade

16
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,421
He needed first aid in the third grade

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,174
You could buy a zoo
with all the doctor bills he paid

18
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,014
I get to meet Twippo.

19
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,313
Twelfth grade.

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,650
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey
Was a really clumsy kid

21
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,236
On the 12th day of 12th grade
I'll tell you what he did

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,780
He walked into financial aid
Fell and broke a bone

23
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,907
Showed them all his bills
and got a great big college loan

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,118
He needed first aid in the twelfth grade

25
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:48,458
First aid in the twelfth grade

26
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:56,842
You could buy a zoo
with all the doctor bills he paid

27
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,051
Yeah, Twippo.

28
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,095
Let's do another Twippo song.

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,806
- I love Twippo.
- Me, too.

30
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,058
But I'm the only one who gets to meet him,

31
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,686
because I won the Twippo Sweepstakes.

32
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,980
You don't have to rub it in.

33
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,107
It's great that you won the contest, Laura,

34
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,610
but let's try not to brag about it.

35
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,069
Nice one with the lights, Bob.

36
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,115
My pleasure. For the next song,
maybe I can drive into the river.

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah.

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,412
Drive into the river, Bob
Oh, drive into the river, Bob...

39
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,290
Or maybe you could help me with the map.

40
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,667
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,424
Is there anything you want me
to tell Twippo when I meet him?

42
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,467
Look out!

43
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,094
- My ticket.
- Quick, get it.

44
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,304
- The map.
- Sorry.

45
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,099
My ticket.

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,896
Do you mind?

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,231
I'm stuck.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,877
Get it! Get it! Fix it! Stick it in! Put it back!

49
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,010
Porcupine!

50
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,245
Tree.

51
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,706
Cabin.

52
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,417
Underwear.

53
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,895
Well, I'm glad that's over.

54
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,566
Did you say something?

55
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,777
- Oh...
- Dear.

56
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,624
Am I in heaven?

57
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,587
Smells like Wisconsin.

58
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,721
Well. Nobody got hurt.

59
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,022
Wow. What a shot.

60
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,693
Hey.

61
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,530
What's that?

62
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,580
What's "Seafoo"?

63
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,791
Maybe it's like tofu.

64
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,292
Only saltier.

65
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,228
I can't believe I did that.

66
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,272
Oh, yeah? Well, if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

67
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,358
I said I was sorry. I'll do better next time.

68
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,568
There isn't gonna be a next time.

69
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,863
Mr. Bob? How are we gonna get
to the Twippo concert?

70
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,699
Yeah.
We're gonna miss the Bald Bunny song.

71
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,329
I don't know.
I don't know about any bald bunnies.

72
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,664
I'm a bald bunny
Ain't got no fur

73
00:06:55,706 --> 00:07:00,001
Even if we make it to the concert,
I can't get in. I lost my ticket.

74
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,880
Serves you right. It's your own fault
for waving it around in my face.

75
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,173
I have to go to the bathroom.

76
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,426
You know,
I'm usually not that clumsy in the car.

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,718
Two flat tires.

78
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,053
Usually, I'm quite dexterous.

79
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,348
How in the world
are we gonna change two flat tires?

80
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,516
Where's the phone?

81
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,684
I lost my ticket.

82
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,396
If you hadn't been teasing me with it,
we wouldn't be in this mess, Laura.

83
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,862
May we help you?

84
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,665
Porcupine.

85
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,168
- I need to call my wife.
- Here.

86
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,087
May I please use the bathroom?

87
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,716
- Down the hall, first door on the left.
- Thank you.

88
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,014
Captain Ahab's Moby Blaster. My favorite.

89
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,437
What do you want?

90
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,066
Well, sirs. The asparagus hit me
in the head with a guitar,

91
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,736
and an angry mother porcupine
shot out our tires

92
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,071
and one of her babies got me.

93
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,493
- And I need to use your phone to call...
- A tow truck.

94
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,827
...my wife.

95
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,457
- I see.
- Next to the Moby Blaster.

96
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,792
- Thanks.
- Well,

97
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,837
in the meantime,
would you like to have a seat?

98
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,424
Maybe enjoy a nice combo platter?

99
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,927
Steak, steak
Eat it, eat it

100
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,845
Shrimp, shrimp
Need it, need it

101
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,639
Steak and shrimp
Steak and shrimp

102
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,724
Need to, need to
eat it, eat it

103
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,445
Do you prefer "poking" or "non-poking?"

104
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,615
Non.

105
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,452
Good one, Phillipe.
You are one clever pea, no?

106
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,499
VoilÃ . A skewer for the scampi.

107
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:10,215
We are
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything

108
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:16,596
We just stay home and lie around

109
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,808
Please make yourselves comfortable.

110
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,310
I will be back to take your order.

111
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,983
Why don't you two wait here.
I'm gonna go call a tow truck.

112
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,819
Maybe we can still
make it to the concert on time.

113
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,989
Yeah, everyone but me.

114
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,157
Hey, it's your own fault for teasing me.

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,159
You're just getting what you deserve.

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,037
I'm coming with you, Mr. Bob.

117
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,500
See, the guy, one guy,
all he does, he just folds these napkins.

118
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,668
The napkin guy.

119
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,087
- He works at night after everybody's gone.
- Yeah.

120
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,007
You know, he used to fold maps.

121
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:57,345
No. No. Listen to me. He takes one spoon,
he takes one knife, and he takes one fork,

122
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,142
and he rolls it up in a napkin. He's the one
that makes it into that little swan shape.

123
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,191
Excuse me.

124
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,321
- How's it going?
- Hey. What's up?

125
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,905
Who are you?

126
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,741
Who, us?

127
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,075
Yeah.

128
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,496
We are The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.

129
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,914
You know that's right.

130
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,124
- Nothing.
- Zilch.

131
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,208
Nada.

132
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,793
Didn't you hear our song?

133
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,961
Well, yeah, but...

134
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,464
Look, sonny... Can I call you sonny?

135
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,382
- Junior.
- Hey. Pretty close.

136
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,260
Look, Junior, we couldn't help but notice

137
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,055
you were having a little thing
with your friend over there.

138
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,432
Yeah. You weren't being very nice.

139
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,225
Well, it's her own fault.

140
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,896
She was teasing me,
and now she's getting what she deserves.

141
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,022
Right.

142
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,026
Junior, we've seen
these types of situations before.

143
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,322
- Happens all the time.
- What you need is a little compassion.

144
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,531
And maybe some scampi.

145
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,911
Hey, I saw that in the menu.
What is that? What's "compassion"?

146
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,288
That's a hard question.

147
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,167
Well, compassion is
when you see that someone needs help,

148
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,710
and you wanna help them.

149
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,838
That's what I thought you'd say.

150
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,256
- They all do.
- Yep.

151
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,927
We find it helpful
to illustrate with a little story.

152
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,679
- A story?
- Yep.

153
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,182
You know, we call ourselves
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything,

154
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,768
but that's not entirely accurate.

155
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,648
Yeah. Remember when we did that one thing
with that one guy?

156
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,985
- Do I ever.
- I remember it like it was yesterday.

157
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,124
Are you guys still doing that pirate thing?

158
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,586
Watch your tongue, matey, or we'll have to...

159
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,923
- What will we do?
- We won't do anything.

160
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,467
We're The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything,
remember?

161
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,969
That's right.

162
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,555
You got off easy today.

163
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,809
We need more
Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls.

164
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,811
Yeah. And root beer.

165
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,565
I told you, boys,
no more cheese curls until you pay your tab.

166
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,025
You still owe me from last week.

167
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,485
But you'll take away our chance

168
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,364
to win the Mr. Twisty's Twisted
Cheese Curl Sweepstakes.

169
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,449
Come again?

170
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,118
Inside one of those bags
of cheesy goodness

171
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,955
is a golden ticket
that'll change our lives forever.

172
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,209
Well, you could work here for me.

173
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,670
That way you could earn more cheese curls.

174
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,131
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

175
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,550
So what do you know how to do?

176
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,261
Well, I'm pretty good at lawn darts.

177
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,346
Ping-Pong. I can play Ping-Pong.

178
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,099
Croquet is my specialty.

179
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,604
When do we start?

180
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,691
Monday's good for me.

181
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,569
We were short on cash.

182
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,198
It seems not doing anything
didn't pay very well.

183
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,700
So what do we do now?

184
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,994
Nothing.

185
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,288
You are a genius.

186
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,091
Are these fish fresh?

187
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,885
- You bet.
- Oh, yeah.

188
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,099
What?
They were fresh when we caught them.

189
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,060
- That's right.
- Two weeks ago.

190
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,898
Ninevites.

191
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,360
Beside the fact that we were low on funds,

192
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,446
this was a memorable day
because he showed up.

193
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,574
Jonah.

194
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,246
Now, Jonah was a prophet of God,

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,790
which means he was
one of the very special people

196
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,584
God used to deliver messages to Israel.

197
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,591
He was kind of like a mailman,
except his letters came straight from God.

198
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,681
Anyway, Jonah loved helping his friends
by bringing them God's messages.

199
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,768
Sometimes the messages were good.
Sometimes they were not so good.

200
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,272
But when a prophet talked,
everybody listened.

201
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,108
What's the word, Jonah?

202
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,068
Yeah, what's the word?

203
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,283
Stop right here, Reginald.

204
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,123
Dear people,
I bring you a message from the Lord.

205
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,252
It's a message of encouragement.

206
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,800
Do not fight, do not cheat

207
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,219
Wash your hands before you eat

208
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,515
There is nothing quite as sweet
A message from the Lord

209
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,476
Be a friend
Say your prayers

210
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,812
Heaven loves a heart that cares

211
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,816
That is why I've come to share
a message from the Lord

212
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,487
And if you follow God's commands

213
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:11,117
There will be peace throughout the land

214
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,955
You will live long and happy lives

215
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,790
With your sheep

216
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,167
Your kids

217
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,335
Your wives

218
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,339
Don't eat pigs
Don't eat bats

219
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,716
Don't eat beetles, flies or gnats

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,762
Stay away from all of that
A message from the Lord

221
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,932
Do what's right
Don't provoke

222
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,351
Put four tassels on your cloak

223
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,436
Do not laugh
It's not a joke

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,438
A message from the Lord

225
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,316
Do not fight
Do not cheat

226
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,526
Wash your hands before you eat

227
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,695
There is nothing quite as sweet

228
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,364
A message from the Lord

229
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,490
All together now.

230
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,367
Be a friend
Say your prayers

231
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,494
Heaven loves a heart that cares

232
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,915
That is why he came to share
a message from the Lord

233
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,435
And if we follow God's commands

234
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,730
There will be peace throughout our land

235
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,067
We will live long and happy lives

236
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,027
With our sheep
Our kids

237
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,445
Our wives

238
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,531
Do what's right
Don't provoke

239
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,241
Put four tassels on your cloak

240
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,659
Do not laugh
It's not a joke

241
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,327
A message from the Lord

242
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,996
Don't do drugs
Stay in school

243
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,580
This is quite a lot of rules

244
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,667
Follow them and you're no fool

245
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:49,966
Follow them and you're no fool
A message from the Lord

246
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,509
A message from the Lord

247
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,766
All right. Good show, everyone.

248
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,893
Thank you very much.

249
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,106
That was pretty much Jonah's life.

250
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,568
Town to town,
bringing God's messages to his friends.

251
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,070
Not a bad gig, overall.

252
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,245
So, every night before he went to sleep,
Jonah would pray and ask God

253
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,290
if there was a new message
for him to deliver.

254
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,588
And this night, there was a message
that would change Jonah's life.

255
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,383
A new message? Yes, what's that?

256
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,096
People being unkind? Lying? Stealing?

257
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,017
Oh, dear. Sounds like a standard
"turn and repent" to me.

258
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,896
All right, name the town.
I'll be on my way first thing in the morning.

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,857
Where is it? Jericho? Damascus?

260
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,443
What? Nineveh?

261
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,281
I'm not aware of any Ninevehs in Israel.

262
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,325
No, I don't think...

263
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,662
You mean that Nineveh?

264
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,959
That Nineveh wasn't in Israel at all.
It was the capital of Assyria,

265
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,046
and it was the biggest, meanest city around.

266
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,467
Now, the people of Nineveh
were particularly mean to Jonah's people,

267
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,843
the Israelites.

268
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,137
They lied. They stole.

269
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,349
But worst of all,
they slapped people with fishes.

270
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,727
They even slapped each other with fishes.

271
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,397
They didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

272
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:33,486
The Ninevites were so mean, in fact,
that most Israelites, including Jonah,

273
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,948
wished God would just wipe Nineveh
off the face of the Earth.

274
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,665
Needless to say, Jonah was shocked

275
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,418
that God would want him
to deliver a message to his enemies.

276
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,214
You don't want me to go there.

277
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,258
You don't know what Nineveh is like.

278
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,802
Perhaps you've never been there.

279
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,053
Well, of course you haven't.

280
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,014
A god like you
would never go to a place like Nineveh.

281
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,393
Or for that matter,
neither would a prophet like me.

282
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,024
No, it cannot be

283
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:18,739
Your messages are meant for me
and my brothers

284
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:23,911
We are your chosen people

285
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,167
And Nineveh
Well, they're not

286
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:35,256
There must be some mistake
A big misunderstanding

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,219
It's really hard to take
How could you be so demanding?

288
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,974
For years I've been your messenger
from Moresheth to Gath

289
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,188
But Nineveh should get no chance to turn
They've earned your wrath

290
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,150
No, it cannot be

291
00:19:54,985 --> 00:20:00,615
Your messages are meant for me
and my brothers

292
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:06,162
We are your chosen people

293
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,791
And Nineveh
Well, they're not

294
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,587
We're the good guys
And they're the bad guys

295
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,674
Please, don't send me there
with a message of your mercy

296
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,012
Damascus or Jerusalem
I'll be there in a minute

297
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,432
Any town in Israel, just ask me
I'll be in it

298
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,436
Shiloh, Gilgal, Jericho
Just say the word

299
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,689
But Nineveh
That is just absurd

300
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,568
Joppa, Aphek, Jezreel
They're all just fine

301
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,820
But Nineveh

302
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,698
Nineveh.

303
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,242
No.

304
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,869
Nineveh is where I draw the line

305
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,464
No, it cannot be

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,679
Your messages are meant for me

307
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,232
Yep. It sounded like God wanted to
offer mercy to the Ninevites.

308
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,942
The tow truck's on its way.

309
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,653
You know, Junior, I love your dad and all,

310
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,948
but that's the last time
I pick him for a copilot.

311
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,954
What's going on?

312
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,040
We're telling a little story.

313
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,459
You should listen, too.

314
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,545
As I was saying,

315
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,966
it sounded like God wanted
to offer mercy to Jonah's enemies.

316
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,384
What's "mercy"?

317
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,928
It's what this whole story is about.

318
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,223
I thought it was about compassion,
remember?

319
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,808
The menu?

320
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,853
Yeah. There's that, too.

321
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,982
Better check your menu again.
We got two specials today,

322
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,067
and they go hand in hand.

323
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,947
Compassion is when you want
to help someone who needs help.

324
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,783
Mercy is when you give someone
a second chance,

325
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,702
even if they don't deserve it.

326
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,121
This story is about both of them.

327
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,124
That's right, my cucumber friend.

328
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,501
You can't have mercy without compassion.

329
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,087
But mercy is even more important.

330
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,591
Jonah was afraid God was going
to give Nineveh a second chance,

331
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,594
that he was going to help them,
even though they didn't deserve it.

332
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,262
So what did he do?

333
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,724
Well, never before
had he gotten a message from God

334
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,685
that he didn't want to deliver.
He didn't know what to do.

335
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,317
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?

336
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,944
What? Nothing. There is no word.

337
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,781
Nothing at all?

338
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,618
No. Nothing at all.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm very busy.

339
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,079
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?

340
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,290
Stop it. There is no word. Nothing.

341
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,209
I've got to get out of here.

342
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,836
There is no word.

343
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,465
I have no new messages.

344
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,471
And above all, I am not going to Nineveh.

345
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,526
Sorry, sir.
I can't sell you a ticket to Nineveh.

346
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,486
What? Who are you?

347
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,447
The name's Angus. I sell cruise tickets.

348
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,158
There's nothing like a cruise
on the Great Sea

349
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,869
to clean the sand out of your wicket, aye?

350
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,332
But you can't sail to Nineveh.
It's landlocked. See?

351
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,920
You can't go by sea. You gotta go by land.

352
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,047
But I don't want to go to...

353
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,509
Hello, Mr. Jonah. What's the word?

354
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,886
He's going to Nineveh.

355
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,847
Oh, really?

356
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,974
I am not going to Nineveh.

357
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,810
Why on earth
would I want to go to Nineveh?

358
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,729
In fact, I'm going in the opposite direction.

359
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,024
What's the farthest thing in the world
from Nineveh?

360
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,486
Well, if you have a few days,
you could sail down to Egypt.

361
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,780
It's lovely this time of year.

362
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,284
There. I want to go there.

363
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,327
Tarshish?

364
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,790
Why, that would take weeks.
It's the other end of the world.

365
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,834
Perfect. How much?

366
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,086
Even if you had the money,

367
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,591
no one around here has the time
to sail all the way to Tarshish.

368
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,222
Then again.

369
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,896
We couldn't possibly.

370
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,150
We're very busy with cargo and stuff.

371
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,738
You know, pirates have to pillage and
plunder and...

372
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,948
That really takes it out of you...

373
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,494
Yeah, and ALF is on in a half hour,
so I don't think we should...

374
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,206
And besides that, we don't really sail.

375
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,750
At all.

376
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,586
So, the answer is no.

377
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,924
Money is no object.

378
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,763
Next stop, Tarshish. I'll hoist the mainsail.

379
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,391
- I'll pop the popcorn.
- I'll get the moist towelettes.

380
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,979
Where did we put them?
Hey, Larry, have you seen the towelettes?

381
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,816
- I got it. I got it.
- No, those are baby wipes.

382
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,613
Sorry.

383
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,074
My fault.

384
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:47,545
Even though we'd never sailed before,
we took to it like a fish to water.

385
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,178
Thar she blows.

386
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,347
Where?

387
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,933
Right there. Next to the grill.

388
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,851
Got it.

389
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,938
Six-zero.

390
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,567
Seven-zero.

391
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,402
That's a skunk. I win.

392
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,904
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

393
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,532
What do you say, Jonah? Two out of three?

394
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,826
No. I'm done.

395
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,830
When we get to Tarshish, Ho Hos on me.

396
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,373
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

397
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,292
He winny at the Ping-Pong

398
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,378
We get the Ho Ho and the Ding Dong

399
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,213
Ding dong

400
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,051
Once we finally got out to sea,
Jonah went below deck to rest a bit.

401
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,818
What have I done? What have I done?

402
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,665
You are powerful and attractive.

403
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,250
What? Who's there?

404
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,212
You do not run from your problems,
but confront them face to face.

405
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,715
The bag. It speaks.

406
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,058
What did you do that for?

407
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,893
Mr. Twisty?

408
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,563
Who's there? Show yourself.

409
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,659
Hello.

410
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,786
What are you?

411
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,414
Who, me? My name is Khalil.

412
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,668
I am a caterpillar. Well, that's only half true.

413
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,420
My mother was a caterpillar.
My father was a worm.

414
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,130
But I'm okay with that now.

415
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,548
Khalil?

416
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,510
Khalil. You've got to get your gut into it.

417
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,936
I bet you are wondering why I am here.

418
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,357
You tidy up around the ship?

419
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,943
No. I do not work on the ship.

420
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,571
I am a small business operator.
A traveling salesman.

421
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,199
I sell Persian rugs door to door.

422
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,702
See?

423
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,955
- Lovely.
- By the way,

424
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,832
do you know where this ship is going?

425
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,459
- Yes, Tarshish.
- Tarshish.

426
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,712
What a trip.

427
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,548
You know, that may be just what I need.

428
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,467
The Persian rug business has not been
going very well around here.

429
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:45,973
But I still have a positive mental attitude
because of my motivational tapes.

430
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,269
You are a skilled metalworker.

431
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,273
I am a skilled metalworker.
I did not know that.

432
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,693
Yes, well, that's lovely, Carlyle,

433
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,447
but if you don't mind,
I think I'll just get some rest.

434
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,781
Jonah?

435
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,825
You are Jonah.

436
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,828
- You know me?
- Of course I do.

437
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,998
You are the most famous prophet
in the whole world.

438
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,002
- Well, I don't know if I'd say...
- I sell your licensed merchandise.

439
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,588
Look. I have the Jonah rugs,

440
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,007
the Jonah plush toy

441
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,301
with sound chip.

442
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,512
A message from the Lord.
A message from the Lord.

443
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,265
Well, I'm flattered.

444
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,435
You are huge. You are a celebrity.

445
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,519
Well, I...

446
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,939
From town to town,
delivering God's messages.

447
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,610
What a life. You are a big shot.

448
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,361
No, it's really...

449
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,199
The man God can count on
to deliver his messages.

450
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,701
Yes, well...

451
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,537
You and God are like peas in a pod.

452
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,417
Like two humps on a camel,
you always sway the same way.

453
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,795
That is a good one.

454
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,880
You know, humor runs very deep
in my family.

455
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,300
My uncle was a big star
back at a comedy club in Nineveh.

456
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,929
The Taj Ma-Haha. Standing room only.

457
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,389
And then he was hit with a fish.

458
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,726
I am telling you,
those people do not know right from wrong.

459
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,978
Nineveh.

460
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,899
You are sad now, my friend?

461
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,902
Something about Nineveh
makes you feel sad inside?

462
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,238
I don't really want to talk about it.

463
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,198
I just need some rest.

464
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,033
You do not have to tell me.

465
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,452
- Good.
- Because I already know.

466
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,913
- You do?
- Yes.

467
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,835
There is a woman in Nineveh, is there not?
A beautiful young asparagus.

468
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,587
- She is waiting there for you, no?
- No.

469
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,174
You were promised to be married,
but your job is now in the way.

470
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,388
The woman's father is the head
of an international ring of camel thieves.

471
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,224
This very day, you set sail for Tarshish

472
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,103
to deliver a message that will break
the back of the camel thieves,

473
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,899
but in the process,
will break the heart of the woman you love.

474
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,156
Insight runs very deep in my family.

475
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,242
Do not worry, the first one is free.

476
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,746
Please, Carlyle, I just need to get some rest.

477
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,417
It's Khalil.
But you can call me Carlyle if you want to.

478
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,128
When we get to Tarshish,
you can deliver the message,

479
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,297
and I'll sell the plush toys.

480
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,340
We can be a team.

481
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,758
A message

482
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,719
from the Lord.

483
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,473
Well, sweet dreams, traveling buddy.

484
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,686
We can make our plans
to save those camels tomorrow.

485
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,400
You are a go-getter.

486
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,835
Yes, which way is Tarshish?

487
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,298
Right this way. You can't miss it.

488
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,301
Thank you.

489
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,391
Jonah.

490
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,685
What? Who is it?

491
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,772
Jonah, where are you going?

492
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,941
It's you, Lord.

493
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,778
I'm going to... I'm going...

494
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,697
- Jonah.
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

495
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,367
- Jonah.
- I can't hear you.

496
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,411
Jonah.

497
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,581
I can't hear you.

498
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,500
Jonah.

499
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,088
Jonah. Jonah. Jonah.

500
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,674
No. I can't hear you.

501
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,551
Come on, wake up. We got trouble.

502
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,596
What? What's happening?

503
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,724
We're in a storm. Like I've never seen before.

504
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,560
If we don't do something quick,
we're gonna sink.

505
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,230
We seem to have sprung a leak,
traveling buddy.

506
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,899
Hey. What are you doing here?

507
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,778
Didn't I tell you to get off my ship,
you lousy leaf eater?

508
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,279
Well, yes.

509
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,157
But, you see, my new friend and I
are going to Tarshish

510
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,910
to break the back of the camel thieves.

511
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,041
Crime fighting runs very deep in my family.

512
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,753
Why, if it wasn't for this storm,
I'd make you walk the plank.

513
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,090
And you,
how can you sleep at a time like this?

514
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,466
What's going on?

515
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,135
I'll tell you what's going on.

516
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,929
We're all gonna be fish food
if I don't get some help.

517
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,515
Well, what can we do?

518
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,517
Get up and pray to your god.

519
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,520
Maybe he'll have mercy on us
and spare our lives.

520
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,693
Somebody up there must be really upset
with somebody down here.

521
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,821
Wait a minute. That's it.

522
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,990
All right. You two, follow me.

523
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,214
You got electric eel?

524
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,175
Nope. Go fish.

525
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,762
One more card.

526
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,806
You are one cheating buccaneer.

527
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,225
How am I supposed to cheat at Go Fish?

528
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,644
I don't know.

529
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,480
All right, you lazies.

530
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,484
Game over. Shuffle them up and deal us in.

531
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,651
But...

532
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,111
Okay. Here's the deal.

533
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,156
The way I see it,
there is a reason for this storm.

534
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,119
Somebody up there is really upset
with somebody down here.

535
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,956
And it ain't gonna let up
until we know who that somebody is.

536
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,667
It could be any one of us.

537
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,503
I have my suspicions.

538
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:54,216
But we won't know for sure
until we figure it out scientifically.

539
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,302
All right men, Go Fish.

540
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,513
Loser takes a swim.

541
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,229
- You got a perch?
- No.

542
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,273
- You have any pickerel?
- No.

543
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,778
You got a muskellunge?

544
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,947
Nope. Go fish.

545
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,616
Oh, dear.

546
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,827
I am most desperate for a lobster.

547
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,537
Sorry.

548
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,455
Drat.

549
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,763
You got any bass?

550
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,306
Yeah.

551
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,566
- Octopus?
- Bluegill?

552
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,234
- Tuna.
- Halibut.

553
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,911
You got any trout?

554
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,089
What a goose I am. It's a match.
I had it all along.

555
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,391
I thought for sure...

556
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,520
All right. I admit it. It's my fault. All my fault.

557
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,606
I'm the one to blame.

558
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,816
But I... The worm...

559
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,652
I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord,

560
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,239
the god of heaven,
who made the sea and the land.

561
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,866
And I'm running away from him.

562
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,953
He told me to go to Nineveh,
but I didn't listen.

563
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,080
You know, I don't like those people.

564
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,875
- Fish slappers.
- Yes.

565
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,295
So I ran. I ran, and I ended up here.

566
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,549
And now everyone's in terrible danger
all because of me.

567
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,638
I'm afraid the only thing left
is to be thrown into the sea.

568
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,516
You don't have to do that. We've got a plank.

569
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,811
You can just walk off.

570
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,774
Yes. Thank you. You're too kind.

571
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:19,027
Well, Jonah, old buddy.
It was nice knowing you.

572
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,988
Normally, you'd be entitled to a refund,

573
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,034
but under the circumstances,
you know, with you dying and all...

574
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,997
No, I don't suppose a refund
would do me much good now, would it?

575
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,793
Thanks. You're a trouper. Ain't he a trouper?

576
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,421
But the camels...

577
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,843
Hey. Wait a minute.
I just remembered something.

578
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,638
Maybe you don't have
to walk the plank after all.

579
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:54,229
Every winter, my cousin from Moose Lake
asks me to take care of this.

580
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,402
- Cool.
- What is it?

581
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,240
This, my friends,
is a Jupiter 1,600 horsepower,

582
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:09,869
high-octane, dual propeller,
pull ignition outboard motor.

583
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,206
With the optional chrome trim package.

584
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,585
- Cool.
- What is it?

585
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,505
It gets us back to Joppa.

586
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,092
Well, how does it work?

587
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,386
That I don't know.

588
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,388
Perhaps I could help.

589
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,016
- You know, technical competency runs...
- I know,

590
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,059
very deep in your family.

591
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,520
Our reputation precedes us.

592
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,400
Well, then, it appears
that one should pull the cord,

593
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,821
and then perhaps
push this black bubbly thingy.

594
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,283
No. Maybe it's the other way around.

595
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,828
Perhaps if one first pushes
the black bubbly thingy

596
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,955
and then pulls the cord...

597
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,752
See?

598
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,322
Yep. That's how it works.

599
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,080
It has been delightful, but I must go now.

600
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:53,681
Oh, Lord, don't let us die for this man's sin.

601
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:58,478
And don't hold us responsible for his death,
because it isn't our fault.

602
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:04,317
Oh, Lord, you have sent this storm
upon him for your own good reasons.

603
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,320
And keep my duckie safe.

604
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,738
- Amen.
- Amen.

605
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,859
That was easy.

606
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,449
Well, should we pull him back in?

607
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,285
I don't see why not.

608
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,558
Something touched me!
There's something in the water!

609
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,563
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- I'm hurrying!

610
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,898
Hold on, Jonah!

611
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,150
- Aim this time!
- I was aiming!

612
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,153
- I can never tell where you're looking.
- You should talk.

613
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,654
Hurry!

614
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,827
Fellows, please!

615
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,623
- Pull it back in. Hurry!
- Okay, okay! I got it!

616
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,882
- Let me do that!
- No, no! I'll throw it!

617
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,678
Fellows, please!

618
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,680
Come on! Give it here!

619
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,265
I said, I got it!

620
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,268
Excuse me, gentlemen.

621
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,480
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

622
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,306
Man the cannon!

623
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,266
Aye-aye, Captain!

624
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,859
We ain't got no ammo!

625
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,363
Yes, we do!

626
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,407
Fire one!

627
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,040
Fire two!

628
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,642
Hello?

629
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,560
Fire three!

630
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:15,443
I'm coming, traveling buddy!

631
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:24,285
Traveling buddy? Where are you?

632
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:24,637
Look, a bowling ball.
If I could only find some pins.

633
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,014
You found better than that, traveling buddy!

634
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,850
It's me!

635
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,977
Oh, my.

636
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,729
So forget about Tarshish.

637
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,982
All we need to do is get this whale
to swim to Nineveh!

638
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,360
You give the message. I sell the plush toys.

639
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,070
We'll be right back on track.

640
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,073
Carlyle, please don't speak to me.

641
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,367
I'm having a rather bad day.

642
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,788
Well, you don't need to be so down about it,
Mr. Grumpypants!

643
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,458
Look around you!

644
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,669
We're inside a whale!

645
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,672
We're going to be digested!

646
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,300
Do you know what that means?

647
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,679
Of course I do!
Digestion runs very deep in my family.

648
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,849
I'm just trying to have a positive outlook,
you know.

649
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,436
You know,
the difference between you and me

650
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,608
is that you see the whale as half empty,
but I see the whale as half full!

651
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,028
I don't know what that means.

652
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,198
Neither do I.

653
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,748
I might as well face it.

654
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:38,211
God gave me a job to do,
and I disobeyed him.

655
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,379
I ran the other way.

656
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:45,802
I've done something terrible,
and now I'm getting what I deserve.

657
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,056
I'm going to die here in this whale.

658
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,024
Have you ever seen anything so pathetic?

659
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,487
This boy needs some help!

660
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,239
What? Who's there?

661
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,323
Take it easy, Jonah.

662
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,116
We're on your side.

663
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,495
How did you know my name?
How did you get in here?

664
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,581
Were you in the bowling ball, too?

665
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,625
No. That's not how we get around.

666
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:21,254
No, we came straight
from the big man himself.

667
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,922
You mean...

668
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,677
And just like you, we deliver his messages.

669
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,972
- So, you're prophets, too?
- Not exactly.

670
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,600
You see, we work on a slightly higher level.

671
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,769
- You do?
- And, Jonah,

672
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,480
we've got a message for you.

673
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,325
You're feeling pretty blue

674
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,956
You didn't do what God requested

675
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,961
Yeah, I'd be moping, too

676
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,215
If I was gonna be digested

677
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,637
This ain't a pretty picture, no

678
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,309
I said, it ain't a pretty sight, no

679
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,439
You ran from God this morning

680
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,024
And you're

681
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,611
Whale chow

682
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:31,616
Tonight

683
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,245
Hold up

684
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,623
Hang on

685
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:44,837
Not so fast
Your life ain't over yet

686
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,884
See, we're here to tell you all about

687
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,554
The forgiveness that

688
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:59,644
You can get

689
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,188
You see, ours is a god of mercy

690
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,023
Ours is a god of love

691
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,069
And right now he gonna lend
a helping hand from up above

692
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,614
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances

693
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,867
You'll be floored
how his love your life enhances

694
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,829
You can be restored
from your darkest circumstances

695
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,875
Our god is the god of second chances

696
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,295
Ain't it good to know a god
who gives a second chance?

697
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,007
Why, that's enough to get
a smile from Mr. Grumpypants

698
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,011
So if you say you're sorry
for all the stuff you do

699
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,807
We know that he'll be ready
with a second chance for you

700
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,686
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances

701
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,855
You'll be floored
How his love your life enhances

702
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,859
You can be restored
from your darkest circumstances

703
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,571
Our god is the god of second chances

704
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,824
Our god is the god

705
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,121
If you believe
God's love is true

706
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:03,874
Then you should know
what you should do

707
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,503
If you believe
God's love is true

708
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,424
Then you should know
what you should do

709
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:15,219
If you believe
God's love is true

710
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,848
Then you should know
what you should do

711
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,685
If you believe
God's love is true

712
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:26,647
Then you should know
what you should do

713
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,026
God gives a second chance

714
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,780
Second chances
Second chances

715
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,701
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances

716
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,788
You'll be floored when you're restored
from your darkest circumstances

717
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,540
Our god is the god

718
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,461
Second chances
Second chances

719
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,881
He's the god of second chances

720
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,926
You'll be floored when you're restored
from your darkest circumstances

721
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,344
Our god is the god

722
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,555
Second chances

723
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,267
If you believe
God's love is true

724
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,979
Then you should know
what you should do

725
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,816
If you believe
God's love is true

726
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,487
Then you should know
what you should do

727
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,990
Second chances
Second chances

728
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,827
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances

729
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,915
You'll be floored when you're restored
from your darkest circumstances

730
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,374
Our god is the god

731
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,710
Second chances
Second chances

732
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,670
Our god is the god

733
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,646
So, from inside the whale,

734
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,149
Jonah prayed and asked God
to forgive him for not obeying.

735
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,819
He told God that if he got another chance,

736
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,073
he would go to Nineveh, even though
he didn't like those people very much.

737
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,492
So, did he get another chance?

738
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,870
Shouldn't you be looking out
for your tow truck?

739
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,916
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That can wait.
Did Jonah get another chance?

740
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,045
Well, God saw that Jonah needed help,
and he wanted to help him.

741
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,588
That's compassion!

742
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,716
But did he give him a second chance,
even though he didn't deserve it?

743
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,885
You know, mercy?

744
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,348
After three days, Jonah noticed
something strange happening.

745
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,390
Reginald! Good to see you.

746
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,560
Yes, well...

747
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:35,502
So God told the whale to burp up Jonah,
and Jonah got his second chance.

748
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,891
And just like he promised,
he headed straight for Nineveh!

749
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,668
Turn back!

750
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,295
Turn back! Turn back!

751
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,425
The slapping!

752
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,719
Turn back!

753
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,306
Turn back! Turn back!

754
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,130
Go in, give the message, get out.
Go in, give the message, get out.

755
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,882
Who goes there?

756
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,140
Yes. My name is Jonah.
And I'm a prophet from...

757
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,350
You're not from here, are you?

758
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,394
No, you see, I'm from...

759
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,604
That would make you a stranger,
wouldn't it?

760
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,232
Well, yes. I suppose so. But I...

761
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,942
We don't like strangers.

762
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,571
No. Yes, I've heard that.
But, you see, I have a...

763
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,448
So why are you here?

764
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,825
Well, I have a message.

765
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,077
A message? For who?

766
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,665
Well, for everyone! For the whole city.

767
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,918
You've got a message for the whole city?

768
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:43,255
- The whole city!
- That's rich!

769
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,049
I'll alert the king.

770
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:49,136
"Your honor, a bleached asparagus
has a message for us all."

771
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,348
- "Most important!"
- I do not think this is going very well.

772
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,144
Let's just go home! I did what you said.

773
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,688
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

774
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,523
- Jonah?
- What?

775
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,985
It is our friends from the ship!

776
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,614
What on earth? What are you doing here?

777
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,657
What are you doing here?

778
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,951
Yeah. You were... You were...

779
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,036
Fish food!

780
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:18,791
The whale spit us out like so much
bad couscous, and here we are now,

781
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,126
delivering the message to Nineveh.

782
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:25,005
But they wouldn't let us in,
so I guess we're going home.

783
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,510
Hey, I bet we could get him in.

784
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,641
Hey, look! It's the cheese curls blokes.

785
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,683
Right.

786
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,936
Coming back for a visit, are you?

787
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,978
- Yep.
- Yep.

788
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,484
Is that fellow with you?

789
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,319
Yes, he's with us!

790
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,779
You're with them?

791
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,155
Yes, indeed!

792
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:56,161
Why, I sailed halfway across the world
with these fine gentlemen.

793
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,539
All right. You can come in.

794
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,166
Enjoy your stay in Nineveh.

795
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,253
What was that all about?

796
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,671
How did you do that?

797
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,382
Remember that money you gave us?

798
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,552
By the way,
you aren't gonna want that refund, are you?

799
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:17,141
Good. 'Cause we spent it, every last penny,
on cheese curls.

800
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,685
- Cheese curls?
- Yep.

801
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,229
One thousand four hundred
and fifty-eight bags

802
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,690
of Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls!

803
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,776
And you'll never guess
what we found in bag 497.

804
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,529
The golden ticket.

805
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:35,534
We won the Mr. Twisty's
Twisted Cheese Curl Sweepstakes!

806
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,039
And the prize was...

807
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,044
But in addition to our enviably
fashionable headgear,

808
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:51,175
we also got a tour of the Mr. Twisty's
factory, right here in Nineveh.

809
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:00,851
Which, despite its unseemly location,
was a splendid experience.

810
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,480
And, believe it or not,
in this town, we are famous.

811
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,942
Hey, look!
Here comes a city official to greet us.

812
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,110
Hello!

813
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,945
We were in the neighborhood,
so we thought we'd...

814
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,655
These are the men. Arrest them at once.

815
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:14,948
But...

816
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,076
Excuse me. What have they done?

817
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,038
Thievery.
High theft against the Royal City of Nineveh.

818
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,498
That's ridiculous.

819
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,291
Is it?

820
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,047
No! Wait! I thought they were free samples.

821
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,715
Take them away!

822
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,884
You can't do that.

823
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,345
I'm sorry, are you with these men?

824
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,848
Well, yes, I suppose.

825
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,768
Hello. What are you doing?

826
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,404
Wonderful. It must be time for my speech.

827
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,115
Hey. I can't move.

828
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,535
I can't move, either.

829
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,340
What? Have I got something on my face?

830
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,600
This doesn't look good.

831
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,562
I'm sorry, guys.
I thought they were free samples.

832
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,314
They were right out there in the open
in a big bowl.

833
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,985
- Very misleading.
- Don't go blaming yourself.

834
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,570
No. Blame him.

835
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,614
"Let's put it all in cheese curls," he says.

836
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,867
"No," I say, "We need a balanced portfolio!"

837
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,203
A little stock, a little bonds,

838
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,664
a little cash, or cash equivalents.

839
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,624
And then maybe some snacks.

840
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,086
But, no. "Put it all in cheese curls," he says.

841
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,298
Man, you gotta plan for the future.

842
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,592
What? It got us here, didn't it?

843
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,846
Not "here" literally, but...

844
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,683
We were somebody! We were celebrities!

845
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,519
We are going to die!

846
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,939
People of Nineveh.

847
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,568
These four men and that small,
whatever it is...

848
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,613
I am a caterpillar. Well, that is only half true.

849
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:22,034
...have been found guilty of high thievery
against the Royal City of Nineveh.

850
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,535
For their punishment,

851
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,079
the slap of no return!

852
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,875
What's so funny?

853
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,877
Observe.

854
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,733
What is happening
that is making you all cry like little babies?

855
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:59,279
Why on earth do you take snack food
so seriously?

856
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:07,412
People of Nineveh,
I give you King Twistomer.

857
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,506
It's Mr. Twisty.

858
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,508
Well, that explains it.

859
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,052
He looks happier on the bag.

860
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,763
Your Royal Gourdliness,

861
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,474
these are the perpetrators of the heinous

862
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,810
act against your curls of cheese.

863
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,687
For their punishment,

864
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,690
the slap of no return!

865
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,277
Proceed.

866
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,530
Wait!

867
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:46,952
Won't you at least give the guilty parties
a chance to speak in their own defense?

868
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,206
You may speak.

869
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,251
Well, as I understand it,

870
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:59,297
the snacks in question were right out
in the open in a large bowl!

871
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,301
I think we'll all agree
this was somewhat misleading.

872
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,303
Don't you think?

873
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,685
Slap them.

874
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,606
No! You don't understand!
I'm not really with them.

875
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,400
I mean, how could I be?

876
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,820
While they were taking the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!

877
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,991
What did you say?

878
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,829
I said, while they were on the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!

879
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,209
But you're not dead.

880
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,672
No! That's just it!
I was in the whale for three days and nights!

881
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,257
Then I prayed to my god,

882
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,218
and the great monster
spit me up on the shore

883
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,846
so that I could bring you all a message.

884
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:54,728
Asparagus, here in Nineveh,
we bow to the Great Fish.

885
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,440
We celebrate the Great Fish in our art.

886
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,859
Yes, I noticed.

887
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,113
If what you are saying is true...

888
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,949
Yes. How do we know
if he is telling the truth, sire?

889
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,535
Smell him.

890
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,204
Your Highness?

891
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,372
Smell him.

892
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,714
I'm terribly sorry.

893
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,925
I've been meaning to shower, but...

894
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:30,889
He has been in the Great Fish.
We must hear the message.

895
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,267
What? The message. Yes.

896
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,561
The message.

897
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,980
- What was the message?
- Come on!

898
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,233
It's been so long, I...

899
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,401
Yes.

900
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,737
Stop it!

901
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,409
Stop cheating. Stop lying.

902
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,038
And, especially,
stop slapping people with fishes

903
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,917
or this entire city will be destroyed!

904
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,296
A message from the Lord.

905
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,927
Well, the king was very upset.

906
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,013
He had no idea
they weren't supposed to do that stuff.

907
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,015
No one had ever told him before.

908
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:30,448
"A decree from the king!
Let everyone call urgently to God.

909
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:34,452
"Let them give up their evil ways
and their violence.

910
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,498
"Perhaps the god
that brought this man out of the Great Fish

911
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,835
"will give us a second chance."

912
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:54,139
And let the asparagus
and his friends go free.

913
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,643
So, the King and the people of Nineveh
said they were sorry,

914
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:02,689
stopped the fish slapping
and started being nice to people.

915
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,823
- Wow! That's great!
- Yeah!

916
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,743
Everyone must've been really happy, right?

917
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,537
Well, almost everyone.

918
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:20,165
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

919
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,333
- So long.
- Thank you!

920
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,293
Yes, thank you very much.

921
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,508
You see, Jonah figured God
wouldn't really forgive the Ninevites.

922
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,345
I mean, they had done some terrible stuff.

923
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,932
No.
He figured God had something else in mind.

924
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:11,925
What are we doing?

925
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,178
It's time to watch the fun.

926
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,766
And what fun would that be?

927
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,936
Well, I did what I was supposed to do.

928
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,523
I warned them
that they were going to get in big trouble.

929
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,733
So, now that they've had their warning,

930
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:33,113
it's time to watch God wipe them
off the face of the Earth!

931
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,327
I picked a safe distance
so we won't get singed.

932
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,988
This is going to be great!

933
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:19,701
The bad guys finally getting
what they deserve.

934
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,292
So, Jonah waited for God
to destroy Nineveh.

935
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:31,087
Even now,
God was compassionate towards Jonah

936
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,633
and caused a plant to grow
that shaded him from the hot sun.

937
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,972
Yes! Very nice. Thank you.

938
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,891
Very nice.

939
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,439
Jonah kept waiting.

940
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,067
But it didn't seem like
anything was happening.

941
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,403
He wondered if maybe God
was forgetting something.

942
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,492
All right. I did my job.

943
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:05,914
So, fire! Brimstone! Whatever! You pick!
Right over there!

944
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,795
I'll just sit here under my weed and wait.

945
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,842
What happened?

946
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,181
What? How could you?

947
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,019
All your whining made me hungry.
It was just a weed.

948
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:33,858
Just a weed? It was my shade!
It was my friend!

949
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,988
Oh, dear Lord,
how could you let this happen?

950
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,703
Would you look at yourself!

951
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,541
You care more about that weed
than about all the people in Nineveh!

952
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,334
Well, I...

953
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,796
Why are you here now,
instead of back in the belly of that whale?

954
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:59,175
Because God is compassionate!
He wanted to help you.

955
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:03,346
And because he is merciful,
he gave you a second chance!

956
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,598
Oh, yes, and I'm very grateful...

957
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:09,227
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe God loves everybody?

958
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,731
Not just you! That maybe he wants
to give everyone a second chance?

959
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,652
- Well...
- He saw that those people needed help,

960
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:21,573
that they didn't know right from wrong,
and he wanted to help them.

961
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,533
And that is why he sent you.

962
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,288
And when you told them what they were
doing wrong, they said they were sorry.

963
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,583
They put down their mackerels
and their halibuts,

964
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,918
and they asked God for a second chance.

965
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:36,379
And, by golly, he gave them one!

966
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:41,843
Don't you see? God wants to give
everyone a second chance.

967
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,554
And so should we.

968
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:56,107
Well, if they get a second chance,
those fish slappers,

969
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:00,486
well, then it would be better if I were dead!

970
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:05,575
I wish I were back in that whale!

971
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,372
You are pathetic.

972
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,961
You know, patience runs very deep
in my family, but not that deep.

973
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,296
I am out of here.

974
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,342
What? What are you doing?

975
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,638
I wanted to be big and important,
just like you.

976
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,642
But the world doesn't need more people
who are big and important.

977
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,686
The world needs more people who are nice.

978
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,564
And compassionate. And merciful.

979
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:39,484
That's what I want to be.

980
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:42,612
You can find yourself
a new traveling buddy. Goodbye.

981
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,574
- You can't just leave!
- Can and am.

982
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,619
But who will I talk to?

983
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,914
You can't just leave me here all alone?

984
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,083
Hello?

985
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:01,381
Carlyle? Reginald? Carlyle!

986
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:08,763
Khalil! Khalil! Khalil!

987
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,727
The end!

988
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,192
Wait a minute.

989
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,820
- It's over?
- Yep.

990
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,739
- That's how it ends?
- Yep.

991
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,325
But what did Jonah learn?

992
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:34,163
The question, my friends,
is not, "What did Jonah learn?"

993
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,709
The question is, "What did you learn?"

994
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:42,880
Well, I learned that we need to help people
who need help.

995
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,425
And we need to give second chances,

996
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:49,929
even if they don't deserve them.
But what's that got to do with us?

997
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,890
Hey, Tomato.

998
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,853
Your friend there, the big asparagus.

999
01:11:56,937 --> 01:12:01,524
If I'm not mistaken, he didn't do such
a good job helping you with the map.

1000
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,776
It was a disaster.

1001
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:08,448
He said he was sorry and that
he'd do better next time, but no way.

1002
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,869
Mercy.

1003
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,246
I guess everyone deserves a second chance.

1004
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,331
Yep!

1005
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,792
Now get out of here
before my crab legs get cold.

1006
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:25,089
You know, that still wasn't a very good way
to end a story.

1007
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:29,052
Well, what do you want?
A big musical number?

1008
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,179
Well, yeah!

1009
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,724
Who do they think I am? Twippo?

1010
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,392
Yes?

1011
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,357
- Twippo!
- Twippo!

1012
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,406
What are you doing here?

1013
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,118
Well, I have a concert tonight,
but I'm running late.

1014
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:58,831
Can't find Route 59 to save my life!
I stopped here for directions.

1015
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,544
We're going to your concert tonight.
At least, we were.

1016
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,963
And then porcupines!

1017
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,048
And underwear!

1018
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,132
And pirates!

1019
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:11,135
And now it looks like
we aren't going to make it at all.

1020
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,512
Good heavens!

1021
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:16,307
Well, if it's a ride you need,
I've plenty of room on my bus.

1022
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,017
You can all come with me.

1023
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,147
Yeah. Everyone but me.

1024
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,823
Laura, you can have my ticket.

1025
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,494
But, Junior, it was my fault.

1026
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:47,422
Why, that was a very merciful thing to do.

1027
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:55,179
Tell you what.
I'll give you all a ride to the concert,

1028
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:59,809
and I'll make sure you all
have backstage passes!

1029
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:10,862
Speaking of mercy, have any of you heard
the story of a man named Jonah?

1030
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,114
- Yes.
- Yes.

1031
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,702
Well, would you like to hear a song about it?

1032
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,954
Is it like the Bald Bunny song?

1033
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,709
Not really.
It's more of a big musical number.

1034
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,960
Perfect!

1035
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,426
When I was a boy

1036
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:39,390
I went to church back home in Arizona

1037
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:44,437
And that is where I heard the tale

1038
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:48,900
Of a man whose name was Jonah

1039
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:52,528
Now, Jonah was a prophet

1040
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,740
But that's not why he's remembered

1041
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,702
We tell the tale 'cause in a whale

1042
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:04,665
He nearly was dismembered

1043
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:24,769
Jonah was a prophet

1044
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:27,605
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1045
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,232
If you've been watching, you can spot it

1046
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,817
He did not get the point

1047
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,531
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me

1048
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:40,576
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point

1049
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,286
Jonah was a prophet

1050
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,331
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1051
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,791
If you've been watching, you can spot it

1052
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,418
He did not get the point

1053
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,796
Now, Jonah set sail

1054
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,173
On a pirate ship in a dreadful gale

1055
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:58,177
Got eaten up by a giant whale
But managed not to be dead

1056
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,974
You'd think he would learn a lot
from being saved from an awful spot

1057
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:07,019
But the second chance that he had got
he didn't want to be spread

1058
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:11,732
So poor old Jonah
Now he's all alone

1059
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:15,528
Gotta use a megaphone
to get it through to his head

1060
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,612
Hey

1061
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,655
Jonah was a prophet

1062
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,491
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1063
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,034
If you've been watching, you can spot it

1064
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,745
He did not get the point

1065
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,455
Jonah was a prophet

1066
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,333
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1067
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,835
If you've been watching, you can spot it

1068
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,379
He did not get the point

1069
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,427
Now, true, in your life
you probably don't ride on a camel

1070
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:42,513
And you probably won't wake up
inside a large aquatic mammal

1071
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,516
But all the same, like Jonah
there is something you can do

1072
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,769
Everyone deserves to get
a second chance from you

1073
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:55,192
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me

1074
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:59,196
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point

1075
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,115
Jonah was a prophet

1076
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,201
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1077
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,453
Jonah was a prophet

1078
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,456
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true

1079
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,915
Jonah was a prophet

1080
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,547
I beg your pardon.

1081
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,968
I hate to break up the party,
but who needed a tow?

1082
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,056
Have we met?

1083
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,800
This is the song that runs under the credits

1084
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:51,136
These are the credits
So this is where it goes

1085
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:54,807
Has nothing to do with the movie
so we'll say

1086
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:58,102
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1087
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:01,689
There once was a song
that ran under the credits

1088
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:05,109
That went with the movie
But this is not that song

1089
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,737
Has nothing to do with the movie
so we'll say

1090
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,866
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1091
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:15,578
Wouldn't it be nice
if the song under the credits

1092
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,956
Had something to do
with the movie you just saw

1093
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,751
But that's not the case
So for now we'll have to say

1094
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,838
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1095
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:29,592
There should be a rule
that the song under the credits

1096
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:32,970
Remotely pertains to the movie's basic plot

1097
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:36,640
That rule has not been made
so for now we'll have to say

1098
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,184
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1099
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:40,519
Come on

1100
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,538
Where you going?
I don't think we're done yet.

1101
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,248
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.

1102
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,001
Come on. We have contractual obligations
to finish this one.

1103
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:09,006
They paid for a full 79 minutes
of entertainment, pal. Get back in the booth.

1104
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,175
Wake me up for the prequel.

1105
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:14,345
Come on. We were just starting to have fun.

1106
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:20,184
Hey. What? Oh, man. I need a Tums.

1107
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,022
What? What, are we done?
You mean, that's it?

1108
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:34,365
If you want me, I'll be on the porch.
