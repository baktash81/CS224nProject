1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
They were screaming at each other
for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,583
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,421
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:08,963
Yeah.

5
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,553
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,473
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,270
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:22,109
What?

9
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:23,903
The kid.

10
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:26,568
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:31,618
We'll be glad to
get rid of you, Somerset.

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,744
Always these questions.

13
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:37,086
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

14
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:38,120
He's dead.

15
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,588
His wife killed him.
The rest is nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,308
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,269
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,149
I get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

19
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:01,148
Look...

20
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:02,782
Mills?

21
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,997
Let's find a bar,
sit and talk...

22
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:08,157
I'd like to get to the precinct.

23
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,955
Not much time for
this transition thing.

24
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,340
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,048
Yeah?

26
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,681
- Why here?
- I don't follow.

27
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,215
All this effort
to get transferred.

28
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,100
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

29
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,102
Same reasons as you,

30
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,356
or the reasons you had
before you decided to quit.

31
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,402
You just met me.

32
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:40,861
Maybe I don't understand
the question.

33
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,405
It's very simple.

34
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:48,036
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

35
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,667
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

36
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:57,057
Be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

37
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,344
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

38
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:05,983
I want you to look
and listen, okay?

39
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:10,275
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I worked homicide 5 years.

40
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,324
- Not here.
- I understand.

41
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,491
Over the next 7 days,
do me a favor and remember that.

42
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,806
Yeah. Okay.

43
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,800
Say it again?

44
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:13,897
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

45
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,659
Serpico's got to go.

46
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,076
You might want to get rid of...

47
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,658
this crusty. This eye, Serpico.

48
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:28,461
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

49
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:29,370
Good.

50
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:47,855
Coffee? No?

51
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:55,325
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

52
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:57,155
What time was death established?

53
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,742
Like I said,

54
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,451
I didn't touch anything,

55
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,869
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

56
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,040
No one bothers with vital signs?

57
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:08,713
Did I stutter?

58
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:12,338
He ain't breathing unless
he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

59
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,641
- That's how it's done around here?
- I beg your pardon, Detective,

60
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:18,764
but the guy's sitting in a pile
of his own piss and shit.

61
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,979
If he wasn't dead,
he would have stood up by now.

62
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,983
- Alright.
- Thank you, officer.

63
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:24,650
Thank you.

64
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:35,906
I wonder...

65
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,710
what was the point
of that conversation?

66
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,750
I don't know.

67
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:47,842
How many times Barney Five found
dead bodies that weren't dead?

68
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:50,472
Drop it.

69
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:25,341
Phone Guinness.
I think we got a record here.

70
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,529
Better Homes and Gardens.

71
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,051
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,218
No one.

73
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,261
Guy's heart must be

74
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,894
the size of a canned ham.

75
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,976
If this isn't a coronary,

76
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,024
well,

77
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,019
I don't know.

78
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,041
Whoops.

79
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,389
How about that?

80
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,824
We had this case once,

81
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,779
guy dead on the ground,

82
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,699
knife in his back.

83
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,989
Murder, right?

84
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:00,078
Fuck.

85
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,965
Big insurance policy involved.

86
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,086
Guy took the tip of the blade,

87
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,545
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:11,594
He must have screwed up
because there were...

89
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,720
...multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:24,863
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:25,823
What?

92
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,539
We got a bucket here.

93
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:32,830
What's in it?

94
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,333
My God!

95
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,385
Fucking vomit!

96
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,052
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,223
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,477
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,570
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:00,825
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,078
You girls have got
forensics waiting outside.

102
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,736
We might not fit.

103
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,490
There's room.
Light's the problem.

104
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,541
How are you?

105
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,831
Detective Mills,
go help the officers

106
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,585
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:18,046
What?

108
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,257
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:36,989
He's dead.

110
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,117
Thank you, doctor.

111
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,836
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:50,794
Nope.

113
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:57,218
I did door-to-doors,
walked the beat, all that shit...

114
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:58,799
a long time.

115
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,349
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,442
"detective", same as yours.

117
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:07,730
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,201
I had to consider
the integrity of the crime scene,

119
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:14,702
not whether you were getting
enough time in the field.

120
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:15,739
Hey, man...

121
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:21,494
Just don't jerk me off.
That's all I ask.

122
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,086
He's been dead...

123
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,100
a long time,
and not from poison.

124
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,015
Oh, man.

125
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,720
How can you
let yourself go like this?

126
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,190
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

127
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,859
How'd the fat fuck
fit out his door?

128
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,818
It's obvious he was a shut-in.

129
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,486
See how big this stomach is?

130
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,825
Strange thing is, it stretches.

131
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:56,627
Look, the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

132
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,418
I see that,
but it means nothing to me.

133
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,715
He's got lines of distention

134
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,428
across the duodenum.

135
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,222
The interior wall's ripped open.

136
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,927
This man ate till he burst?

137
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,010
No, he didn't burst all the way.

138
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:14,313
He was hemorrhaging internally.

139
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:17,142
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

140
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,359
...the abdominal muscles.
- He did die by eating?

141
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:21,447
Yes and no.

142
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,745
What about these bruises here?

143
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,458
I haven't figured that out yet.

144
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,496
Gun pressed against his head?

145
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,042
Pressed hard enough.

146
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:34,122
Fuck, yeah.

147
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,470
On the front,
flush with the muzzle.

148
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:42,557
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a homicide.

149
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:49,978
Killer put a bucket under him.
Took his time, too.

150
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,196
Coroner said
it could've lasted 12 hours.

151
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:56,656
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort,

152
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,662
and there was a point
when he passed out.

153
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,906
That's when the killer kicked him,

154
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,957
...and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

155
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,081
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

156
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,794
You don't risk
the time it takes for this,

157
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,336
unless the act itself
has meaning.

158
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:17,850
Somebody had a problem with
a fat boy and tortured him. Simple.

159
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,306
In the grocer bags,

160
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,138
we found two receipts.
So the killer went back...

161
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,680
to the supermarket.

162
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:26,066
So?

163
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:31,280
It's his thing.
I've been out in the rain.

164
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,361
- This is a beginning.
- We've got...

165
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,280
one dead guy, not three.

166
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:36,488
No motive.

167
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,159
Don't start
that big brain of yours...

168
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,997
cooking on this, alright?

169
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,421
I'd like to be reassigned.

170
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:45,672
Whoa!

171
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,837
What are you talking about?

172
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:51,511
This can't be my last duty.

173
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:52,881
It'll go on and on.

174
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,635
You're retiring in 6 days.

175
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,850
You've left
unfinished business before.

176
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,100
The cases were taken
as close as possible to conclusion.

177
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,189
- May I speak freely?
- We're friends here.

178
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,909
It shouldn't be his first case.

179
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:12,117
I knew it. It's not
my first assignment, you dick.

180
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:13,405
It's too soon for him.

181
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:16,787
You can say that shit
to my face. Captain?

182
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:18,161
It's too soon for you.

183
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,957
Captain,

184
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:22,341
can we talk in private?

185
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:23,875
This is a personal thing...

186
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,586
Just shut up, Mills.

187
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,556
I don't have anyone else

188
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,976
to put on this.
This is Metro.

189
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:34,101
- You don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

190
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:35,189
What?

191
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:38,859
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

192
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:39,944
Give it to me.

193
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,026
I'll put you on something else.

194
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,738
Go on, Mills, just go on.

195
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:56,048
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck

196
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,879
cleaning up the fat man.

197
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:17,404
Quiet down.

198
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,075
Alright, calm down, calm down.

199
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:22,578
Quiet down.

200
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,201
Here's how it'll work:

201
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,505
I'll answer questions
for 10 minutes only.

202
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,307
Ask those questions in a calm,
orderly fashion, or I will leave.

203
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,511
Detective?

204
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:41,596
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

205
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,566
I won't discuss the details
of this investigation,

206
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:51,732
so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:13,546
- What you got for me?
- Nothing yet, boss.

208
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,518
Why don't you guys
go get a coffee?

209
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:26,104
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown, where attorney,

210
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:28,899
Eli Gould,
was found murdered today.

211
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:33,331
DA Martin Talbot is taking
questions from reporters.

212
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,831
That's ridiculous and offensive.

213
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,131
There is no conflict,

214
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:45,090
and any claim there could be
is irresponsible.

215
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:47,047
Now hold on.

216
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:52,636
I just met with
law enforcement officials,

217
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,145
and they have
their very best men on this.

218
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:00,317
This will be the definition

219
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:02,986
of swift justice.

220
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:28,052
Pardon me, George.

221
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,937
- Somerset...
- Come in.

222
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:37,819
You heard the news?

223
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,404
Nope, haven't heard.

224
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:42,283
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

225
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,123
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

226
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,120
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

227
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,129
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

228
00:19:57,974 --> 00:19:59,932
Mills is heading the investigation.

229
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,390
Excuse me.

230
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:04,935
Don't do that, please?

231
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,517
Good for him.

232
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,360
What will you do...

233
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:13,608
with yourself out there, Somerset?

234
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,905
I'll work maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

235
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,444
Don't you feel it?

236
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:20,874
Don't you feel that feeling?

237
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,833
You won't be a cop anymore.

238
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,791
That's the whole idea.

239
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,171
I don't think you'll leave.

240
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,005
You can't leave all this.

241
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,428
Guy's out walking his dog.

242
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:37,724
Gets attacked.

243
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,848
His watch is taken, his wallet.

244
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,514
And while he's lying on
the sidewalk,

245
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,355
helpless,

246
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:47,783
his attacker stabs him
in both eyes.

247
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:52,204
This happened last night,
four blocks from here.

248
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:54,113
I read about it.

249
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,917
I don't understand anymore.

250
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,039
It's the way it's always been.

251
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:03,005
- Maybe you're right.
- You were made for this work.

252
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:05,301
You can't deny that.

253
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:07,795
Maybe I'm wrong.

254
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,475
Coroner sent this for you.

255
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,894
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach,

256
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,395
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces...

257
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,314
...of plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

258
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,693
They were...

259
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,361
fed to him.

260
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:08,774
Lord.

261
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,541
This was found behind the fridge
in the obesity murder scene.

262
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,758
"Long is the way,

263
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:28,007
and hard, that out of Hell
leads up to the light."

264
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,172
It's from Milton.

265
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:31,726
"Paradise Lost"

266
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:32,975
Alright,

267
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:34,344
I'm confused.

268
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,765
It means that
this is a beginning.

269
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,479
This was behind the fridge,

270
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,814
written in grease.

271
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:45,114
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

272
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:46,609
Gluttony,

273
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,490
greed,

274
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,037
sloth, wrath,

275
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:57,296
pride, lust,

276
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,088
and envy.

277
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:00,758
Seven.

278
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,385
Hold on.

279
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,506
This is not even my desk.

280
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:08,137
You can expect 5 more of these.

281
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,559
Wait a minute.

282
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,107
I can't get involved in this.

283
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:17,396
Somerset.

284
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:19,449
He wanted it.

285
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,027
Damn!

286
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,954
I'm all over it.

287
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,036
Where to?

288
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,245
Far away from here.

289
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,933
- A few things to look up.
- Okay.

290
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:20,724
Sit where you like.

291
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:22,479
How's everybody?

292
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:25,183
Hiya, Smiley.

293
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:28,486
George, cards are getting cold.

294
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,153
Duty calls.

295
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,294
Gentlemen.

296
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:49,921
I'll never understand.

297
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,060
All these books,

298
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,518
a world of knowledge,

299
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:59,189
and what do you do?
Play poker all night.

300
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:01,526
We got culture.

301
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,906
We got culture
coming out our asses.

302
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:09,786
How's this for culture?

303
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,639
You know, Smiley...

304
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,562
you'll really miss us.

305
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,562
I just might.

306
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:53,841
Fucking Dante.

307
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:58,306
Goddamn poetry-writing
faggot piece of shit.

308
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,142
Fucker.

309
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,278
Good work, officer.

310
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,582
Thank you, Lord.

311
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,093
Oh, sorry.

312
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:34,768
I'll move in a second.

313
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:49,901
- You want your chair?
- No, you go ahead.

314
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:50,696
Yeah?

315
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:30,534
Phone.

316
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,293
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

317
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:40,046
Mills.

318
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,882
Honey. You okay?
Something wrong?

319
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:49,226
Dingleberry. I told you
not to call when I'm at work.

320
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,522
Yeah. Why?

321
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:52,859
Why?

322
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,235
Why?

323
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:01,237
Okay.

324
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:06,873
It's my wife.

325
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,043
Sorry?

326
00:32:09,924 --> 00:32:11,466
She'd like to speak to you.

327
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:23,437
This is Detective Somerset.

328
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,194
Yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

329
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,023
I appreciate the offer, but...

330
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,951
In that case, I'd be delighted.

331
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,832
Yes, thank you very much.

332
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:41,917
Bye.

333
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:45,920
Honey, what...?

334
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:54,974
Well?

335
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:57,259
- Sorry?
- What?

336
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:02,473
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

337
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,735
At my... how's that?

338
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,064
Tonight.

339
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:14,654
Hello, men.

340
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,621
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

341
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:20,669
That's Tracy.

342
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:23,341
Hello.

343
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,634
Happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

344
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:29,801
Except your first name.

345
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,427
It's William.

346
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,265
Well, it's a good name.

347
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,148
William.

348
00:33:37,486 --> 00:33:39,395
I'd like you to meet David.

349
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:42,989
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

350
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:46,495
- How are the kids?
- Good, they're in the room.

351
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:49,828
Good dogs.

352
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,998
Good dogs.
How are you, pretty?

353
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:05,929
- Smells good.
- What?

354
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,724
Yeah. I mean, thanks.

355
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,234
Please have a seat, if you like.

356
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:17,022
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'll wait.

357
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:21,237
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

358
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:23,198
We're still unpacking.

359
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:28,289
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

360
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:31,414
Pretty hokey, huh?

361
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,251
You know something?

362
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,885
From the first date,
I knew he was...

363
00:34:38,182 --> 00:34:39,511
...the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

364
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,396
He was the funniest guy
I'd ever met.

365
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:48,894
Really.

366
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,573
It's kind of rare nowadays.

367
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:57,112
I mean, that level...

368
00:34:57,372 --> 00:34:58,072
of commitment.

369
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:04,036
Don't worry.

370
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:06,797
I won't wear it to the table.

371
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:10,253
You know,

372
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:12,968
no matter how often I see guns,

373
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:14,215
I can't get used to them.

374
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,557
Same here.

375
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,732
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy...

376
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,032
What the hell...?

377
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:33,032
I was close once.

378
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,328
It just didn't happen.

379
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,078
It surprises me.

380
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:38,910
It really does.

381
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:41,623
Well...

382
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:47,293
anyone who spends much time
with me finds me disagreeable.

383
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,975
Just ask your husband.

384
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:50,842
Very true.

385
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,020
Very, very true.

386
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:56,188
How long have you lived here?

387
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:57,815
Too long.

388
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:03,312
How do you like it?

389
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:06,157
You know,

390
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,031
takes time. Settle in,

391
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,490
it'll be good.

392
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,412
You get numb after a while.

393
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,713
There are things to any city.

394
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:24,304
Subway.

395
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,933
It'll go away in a minute.

396
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,767
Real estate guy.

397
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,650
Fucking piece of... sorry honey.

398
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:39,823
Shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

399
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:42,651
He's efficient.
Trace really likes it.

400
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:47,120
Then we wonder why he only
brings us here for 5 minutes.

401
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:49,329
We found out the first night.

402
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:51,997
The soothing, relaxing...

403
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:54,134
vibrating home.

404
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,803
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:13,364
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

406
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:18,327
I don't know why you're laughing.

407
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:23,830
Alright, already.

408
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,216
He had to get into the building

409
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,717
before the office closed.

410
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,511
- Gould would've been working late.
- I'm certain.

411
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,761
The biggest defense lawyer
in town. Infamous, really.

412
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:41,105
The body was found
on Tuesday morning.

413
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:45,528
The office was closed Monday.
He could've gotten in Friday,

414
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,817
laid low till the cleaners left,
then had his way

415
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:52,409
with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

416
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:53,738
Look.

417
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,540
Gould was bound, right arm free.

418
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:58,833
He was handed a butcher's knife.

419
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:04,043
- Check out the scale.
- A pound of flesh.

420
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:12,174
"One pound of flesh,

421
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:14,595
no more, no less.
No cartilage,

422
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:15,679
no bone,

423
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,516
only flesh."
"Merchant of Venice"

424
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:19,684
Didn't see it.

425
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,237
"This task done,
and he would go free."

426
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:25,200
That chair was...

427
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:27,740
...soaked with sweat.
- Of course.

428
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,576
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time,

429
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,834
deciding which cut

430
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,457
to make first.

431
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:36,870
Imagine it.

432
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,090
There's a gun in your face.

433
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,377
Which part of your body
is expendable?

434
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:43,593
The love handle.

435
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:47,423
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

436
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:52,137
Let's take a fresh look.
The corpse is there, but...

437
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:55,687
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

438
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:58,983
The trick is to find
one item, one detail...

439
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:00,700
and focus on it...

440
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:03,319
till it's an exhausted possibility.

441
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,413
I'll get another beer. Beer?

442
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:06,947
Wine, please.

443
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:17,637
He's preaching.

444
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:19,046
Punishing.

445
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:24,804
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

446
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:27,479
7 cardinal virtues, 7 deadly sins,

447
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:30,812
...used as teaching tools.
- Yeah, like in...

448
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:34,612
- "The Parson's Tale" and Dante.
- You read them?

449
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:35,364
Yeah.

450
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:38,276
Parts.
Remember in "Purgatory"

451
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:40,246
Dante and his buddy
climb up...

452
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:42,990
the hill and check out
the sinners?

453
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,371
The 7 Terraces of Purgation.

454
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:47,377
Yeah, right.

455
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:51,128
But there, pride comes first,
not gluttony.

456
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:52,804
Let's consider the books

457
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:55,629
as the killer's inspiration.

458
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:58,977
The sermons were about
atonement for sin.

459
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:01,352
These murders are like
forced attrition.

460
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:02,730
Forced what?

461
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,235
Attrition's when you
regret your sins...

462
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,231
...but not for love of God.
- Because of a gun in your face.

463
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,201
No fingerprints.

464
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:16,246
No.

465
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,532
Totally unrelated victims.

466
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,668
And no witnesses.

467
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,246
Which I don't get...

468
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:27,428
because the fucker
had to get back out.

469
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:32,263
In a major city,
minding your business is a science.

470
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:37,097
In rape prevention, they tell you
never to cry for help.

471
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:39,352
Always yell "fire!"

472
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,891
Nobody answers "help".

473
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:43,028
Holler "fire", they'll come.

474
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:44,479
That's fucked up.

475
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:48,278
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

476
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:53,948
Thanks for talking this out,
but I got to sleep.

477
00:40:54,336 --> 00:40:55,617
I got to walk the dogs.

478
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,252
This is just to satisfy
my curiosity.

479
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:02,298
- I'm leaving the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

480
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,933
Gould's wife was out of town.

481
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:10,269
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

482
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:14,514
I put her in a safehouse.
She wasn't happy about it.

483
00:41:22,452 --> 00:41:24,825
What if it isn't
what she's seen,

484
00:41:25,164 --> 00:41:29,162
but what she's supposed to
and hasn't yet?

485
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:30,868
Yeah, okay. What?

486
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:32,127
I don't know.

487
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:36,377
But that's the one thing.

488
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:22,889
I'll sign us in.

489
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,727
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

490
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:32,943
Mrs. Gould?

491
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:42,120
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

492
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:44,625
I don't understand.

493
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:47,590
I need you to look at each photo

494
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:49,674
very carefully.

495
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,385
See if anything's strange,

496
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:56,219
out of place, anything at all.

497
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,471
I don't see anything.

498
00:42:58,775 --> 00:42:59,356
You're sure?

499
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:01,935
Please,
I can't do this right now.

500
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:02,943
Okay.

501
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:05,907
It's got to be now.

502
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,736
Maybe we missed something.

503
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,164
Wait.

504
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:19,332
What?

505
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:20,375
Here.

506
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:26,886
This painting, it's upside down.

507
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:37,067
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

508
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:39,901
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

509
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:43,867
Nothing.

510
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:47,330
There's got to be something.

511
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:00,926
He moved the screws
to re-hang it.

512
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,683
What the fuck is that?

513
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,061
Switchblade.

514
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:19,241
Goddamn it.

515
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,167
There must be something.

516
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,675
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

517
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,684
No, he's fucking with us.

518
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:47,192
See this, this is us.

519
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:50,270
Just wait a minute.

520
00:44:53,577 --> 00:44:56,579
- Somerset's climbing furniture.
- Wait a minute.

521
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:03,964
You're kidding me.

522
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:05,961
Call the print lab.

523
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,429
Oh, man.

524
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:17,303
Honestly...

525
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,473
have you ever seen
anything like this?

526
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:23,229
No.

527
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,119
The swell pattern tells me
they're not...

528
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,244
the victim's prints.

529
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,797
I say he's whacked enough.

530
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,048
It doesn't fit.

531
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:51,347
He doesn't want to stop.

532
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:52,476
Who knows.

533
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:56,724
Freaks doing their evil deeds
they don't want to.

534
00:45:56,944 --> 00:45:59,400
"Voices made me do it."
"My dog made me do it."

535
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:01,358
"Jodie Foster told me to do it."

536
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:02,940
It can take...

537
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:07,034
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to...

538
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,914
cross your fingers somewhere else.

539
00:46:12,546 --> 00:46:15,464
You meant what you said
to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

540
00:46:15,674 --> 00:46:18,047
- About catching this guy.
- Yeah.

541
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,303
Wish I still thought
the way you do.

542
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,305
What the hell
do you think we're doing?

543
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,649
Picking up the pieces.

544
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:36,615
Collecting evidence,
taking pictures and samples,

545
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:39,491
writing everything down,

546
00:46:39,786 --> 00:46:41,945
noting the times things happened.

547
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:44,287
That's all?

548
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:45,748
That's all.

549
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:50,087
Putting everything into
neat piles...

550
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,300
and filing it, on the off chance
it'll be needed in a courtroom.

551
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:00,468
Picking up diamonds
on a desert island,

552
00:47:00,728 --> 00:47:03,398
saving them in case
we get rescued.

553
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,642
Bullshit.

554
00:47:10,406 --> 00:47:14,321
Even the most promising clues
only lead to others.

555
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:19,696
So many corpses roll away,
unrevenged.

556
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:25,830
Don't tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

557
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:27,749
I saw you.

558
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:31,261
We're getting somewhere.

559
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,318
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

560
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,107
We got a winner.

561
00:47:56,544 --> 00:48:00,210
He uses the name Victor.
Real name: Theodore Allen.

562
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:03,253
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

563
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:06,672
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

564
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:09,423
He got a very strict,
Southern Baptist upbringing.

565
00:48:10,143 --> 00:48:12,849
Somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

566
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:16,439
Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

567
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,730
Spent time in prison
for attempted rape of a minor.

568
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:23,073
His lawyer made sure
that didn't last long.

569
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:26,861
By the way, the lawyer was
Eli Gould, the "greed" victim.

570
00:48:27,163 --> 00:48:29,240
We're finishing this today,
ladies and germs.

571
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:33,492
Victor's been out of circulation,
but we have a residence for him.

572
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:36,370
- You're not buying this.
- Doesn't seem like...

573
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:39,385
...our guy, does it?
- You tell me.

574
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:42,671
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

575
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:12,955
You ever take a bullet?

576
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,261
Never in my 34 years.
Knock wood.

577
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,558
I've only taken my gun out

578
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:21,968
three times,
intending to use it.

579
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:23,848
Never pulled the trigger.

580
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:25,179
Not once.

581
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:26,606
You?

582
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:30,479
No, I never took a bullet,
but...

583
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,568
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

584
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:35,777
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

585
00:49:36,037 --> 00:49:37,994
We were a secondary unit.

586
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,160
I was shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

587
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:44,622
We bust open a door,
looking for this junkie,

588
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,291
and he opened fire on us.

589
00:49:47,592 --> 00:49:49,336
One cop got hit in the arm.

590
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:52,972
What was his name?

591
00:49:55,184 --> 00:49:59,230
It spun him like a top.
Well, more like slow motion.

592
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:01,728
I remember

593
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,232
riding in that ambulance...

594
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:06,402
and well...

595
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:08,354
he died right there.

596
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:09,614
Right there.

597
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:12,904
What was his fucking name?

598
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:33,753
SWAT goes before dicks.

599
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,468
They love this.

600
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,550
Police!

601
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:46,765
Clear!

602
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:13,001
Good morning, sweetheart.

603
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,972
Get up now motherfucker, now!

604
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:28,280
Get up, you sack of shit!

605
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:35,954
Fuck me!

606
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:37,831
Dicks!

607
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:40,828
You'll want to look at this.

608
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:44,757
Dicks!

609
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:53,433
Jesus.

610
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:54,596
Victor?

611
00:52:55,189 --> 00:52:57,265
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

612
00:52:57,525 --> 00:53:00,480
- Call an ambulance.
- Hearse, I'd say.

613
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:02,060
Call for forensics.

614
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:05,610
Get your people out.
No on touches anything.

615
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:08,072
It's like a wax sculpture.

616
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,039
Sloth.

617
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:23,964
Aw, man.

618
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:25,257
Goddamn.

619
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,385
The pictures
were dated 3 days ago.

620
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:38,316
This must be the first.

621
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:39,029
Look.

622
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,567
It's dated one year ago today.

623
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,241
I got a hair sample.

624
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,457
I got a stool sample, piss,

625
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:49,791
fingernails.

626
00:53:52,507 --> 00:53:53,787
He's laughing at us.

627
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:56,003
You got what you deserved.

628
00:53:59,515 --> 00:54:01,757
He's alive!
Cocksucker's alive!

629
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:06,311
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

630
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:26,165
- He's playing games.
- No shit.

631
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,840
We have to divorce our emotions.

632
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:33,087
We must focus on details.

633
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:36,182
I feed off my emotions,
how's that?

634
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:39,008
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, I can hear you.

635
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:40,979
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

636
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:43,520
- Closed crime scene. Out!
- I got a right to be here.

637
00:54:43,776 --> 00:54:45,187
I'm a UPI photographer.

638
00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:48,029
I got a right to be here.

639
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:50,073
- Get out! Jesus!
- Fucking jerk!

640
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:51,868
I got your picture, man.

641
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:53,525
I got your picture.

642
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,866
Detective Mills, M-i-l-l-s.
Fuck off.

643
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,244
- You can spell.
- Fuck you.

644
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,079
How do they get here so quick?

645
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:06,090
The pay police for information.
They pay well.

646
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,209
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

647
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,096
They piss me off.

648
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,133
Okay.

649
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,312
It's impressive to see
a man feeding off his emotions.

650
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:26,157
One year of immobility,
judging by...

651
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:28,408
muscle and spine deterioration.

652
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:32,162
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

653
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,540
Even an antibiotic,
probably to prevent

654
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:37,671
the bedsores from infecting.

655
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:41,631
Has he tried to speak,
or communicate in any way?

656
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,888
Even if his brain
were not mush, which it is,

657
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,344
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

658
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:50,596
Doc...

659
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,268
is there no chance
he might survive?

660
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:58,863
He'd die of shock now
if you shined a flashlight

661
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:00,775
in his eyes.

662
00:56:01,534 --> 00:56:05,913
He's had as much pain
and suffering as anyone,

663
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,127
and he still has
Hell to look forward to.

664
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:11,250
Good night.

665
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:27,350
Hello, William. It's Tracy.

666
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,231
Tracy?

667
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:31,268
Everything okay?

668
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,979
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

669
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:35,779
Where's David?

670
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,946
In the other room,
in the shower.

671
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,862
Sorry to call you like this.

672
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:43,656
It's all right.

673
00:56:44,794 --> 00:56:46,288
What can I do for you?

674
00:56:52,011 --> 00:56:53,968
I need someone to talk to.

675
00:56:54,222 --> 00:56:56,844
Do you think you could
meet me somewhere,

676
00:56:57,142 --> 00:56:59,265
maybe tomorrow morning?

677
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:01,719
I don't understand.

678
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,026
I feel stupid calling,

679
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:10,530
but you're the only person
I know here.

680
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:12,319
There's no on else.

681
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:13,990
If you can,

682
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:16,577
give me a call, okay?

683
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,452
I have to go now.

684
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:21,371
- Good night.
- Good night.

685
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:31,888
I mean...

686
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,011
you know this city so well.

687
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:36,845
You've been here...

688
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,305
so long.

689
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:42,561
It can be a hard place.

690
00:57:42,904 --> 00:57:45,360
I don't know why
I asked you to come.

691
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:49,027
Why don't you talk to him?

692
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:51,239
Tell him how you feel.

693
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:55,252
I can't be a burden.

694
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:56,831
Especially now.

695
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:00,924
I'll get used to things,

696
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,091
you know?

697
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:04,754
I wanted to talk to someone

698
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,505
who's lived here a long time.

699
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:12,432
Upstate, it's a completely
different environment.

700
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:21,062
Did David tell you
I teach 5th grade? I did.

701
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:24,910
He mentioned it.

702
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:31,211
I've been going around,
looking at schools,

703
00:58:33,673 --> 00:58:35,713
but here the conditions here

704
00:58:36,176 --> 00:58:37,089
are horrible.

705
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:41,138
What about private schools?

706
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,224
I don't know.

707
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,805
Tell me what's
really bothering you.

708
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,145
David and I
are going to have a baby.

709
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,234
Tracy, I...

710
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:03,446
I don't think I'm...

711
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:05,205
the one to talk to...

712
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,333
...about this.
- I hate this city.

713
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,629
I had a relationship once.

714
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:17,340
It was like a marriage.

715
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:21,889
We got pregnant.

716
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:25,266
This was a long time ago.

717
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:34,367
I remember getting up
and going to work.

718
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:40,584
A day like any other,
but the first day after I knew

719
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:42,292
about the pregnancy.

720
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,506
And I felt this fear,

721
00:59:47,552 --> 00:59:48,548
for the first time ever.

722
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:53,094
I remember thinking:

723
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:57,060
How can I bring a child
into a world like this?

724
00:59:57,313 --> 01:00:00,315
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

725
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:09,902
I told her I didn't want it.

726
01:00:12,331 --> 01:00:14,205
Over the next few weeks,

727
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:17,293
I wore her down.

728
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,839
I want to have children.

729
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,300
I can tell you now that...

730
01:00:29,602 --> 01:00:31,595
I know, I mean,

731
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,179
I'm positive that

732
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:37,686
I made the right decision.

733
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:41,572
But not a day passes
that I don't wish

734
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:44,494
that I'd made
a different choice.

735
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,954
If you don't...

736
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,033
keep the baby...

737
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:55,046
if that's your decision,

738
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:59,751
don't ever tell him
you were pregnant.

739
01:01:01,473 --> 01:01:04,391
But if you choose to
have this baby,

740
01:01:05,227 --> 01:01:06,425
then spoil that kid,

741
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,645
every chance you get.

742
01:01:15,448 --> 01:01:16,194
That's about...

743
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,321
all the advice

744
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:19,824
I can give you, Tracy.

745
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:28,119
I got to go.

746
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:29,920
William,

747
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:38,424
thank you.

748
01:01:52,617 --> 01:01:53,862
Victor's landlord said

749
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:56,692
there was cash in the mailbox,

750
01:01:56,955 --> 01:01:58,498
first of every month.

751
01:02:03,546 --> 01:02:04,127
Quote:

752
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:07,586
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

753
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:11,259
in apartment 306,
and nobody complained about him.

754
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:13,383
Best tenant I've ever had."

755
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,599
A landlord's dream.

756
01:02:15,811 --> 01:02:17,934
A paralyzed tenant
with no tongue.

757
01:02:18,355 --> 01:02:19,814
Who pays the rent on time.

758
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:22,525
I'm sick of this waiting.

759
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:23,767
This is the job.

760
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:26,857
Why aren't we out there?

761
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:30,278
Why sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic

762
01:02:30,536 --> 01:02:31,735
does it again?

763
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,034
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

764
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,742
Come on. He's insane.
Look.

765
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,954
Right now he's dancing
in his grandma's panties.

766
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,708
Rubbing himself in peanut butter.

767
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,470
- How's that?
- I don't think so.

768
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:51,218
His luck will run out.

769
01:02:52,479 --> 01:02:54,139
He's not depending on luck.

770
01:02:57,568 --> 01:03:01,519
We walk in exactly one year
after Victor's tied to the bed.

771
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,157
One year to the day.

772
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,989
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

773
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:07,117
Oh, yes we do.

774
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:12,450
The note he left,
his first words to us:

775
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:15,167
"Long is the way and hard
that out of Hell

776
01:03:15,423 --> 01:03:17,416
leads up to light."

777
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,344
Fuck him. So what?

778
01:03:20,637 --> 01:03:21,966
He's right so far.

779
01:03:22,556 --> 01:03:26,507
Imagine the will to keep
a man bound for a year.

780
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:29,346
To sever his hand
and to use it...

781
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,149
to plant fingerprints.

782
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,808
To insert tubes into
his genitals.

783
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:37,020
The guy's methodical, exacting

784
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:39,240
and worst of all, patient.

785
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,202
He's a nutbag.

786
01:03:41,495 --> 01:03:45,161
Because he's got a library card
doesn't make him Yoda.

787
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:51,080
You got money?

788
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,383
I got 50 bucks.

789
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:55,877
I propose a field trip.
Come on.

790
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,556
We'll make a list.
At the top we put "Purgatory",

791
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:06,639
"Canterbury Tales"
anything on the 7 deadly sins.

792
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:08,223
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

793
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,232
What would he study
to do things he's done?

794
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,032
What are his interests now?

795
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,907
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

796
01:04:16,161 --> 01:04:17,739
- Where are we going?
- Library.
