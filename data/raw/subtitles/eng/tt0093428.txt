1
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,995
Gentlemen,

2
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:59,204
this may only be an exercise so far as
the Ministry of Defence is concerned,

3
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,380
but for me it is a matter of pride that the
00-Section has been chosen for this test.

4
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:10,260
Your objective is to penetrate
the radar installations of Gibraltar.

5
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:13,514
The SAS have been placed
on full alert to intercept you,

6
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:16,103
but I know you won't let me down.

7
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:18,854
Good luck, men.

8
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,320
Oh, blast!

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,548
Damn!

10
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:33,608
That's it, chum. You're out of it.

11
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,889
Game's up, mate. You're dead.

12
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,448
No!

13
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:25,304
Halt.

14
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,651
Here! Hold on, you're dead!

15
00:06:56,351 --> 00:07:01,310
It's all so boring here, Margot. There's
nothing but playboys and tennis pros.

16
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,933
If only I could find a real man!

17
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,073
I need to use your phone.

18
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:15,694
She'll call you back.

19
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:19,373
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

20
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:22,668
Exercise control, 007 here.
I'll report in an hour.

21
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,961
Won't you join me?

22
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,295
Better make that two.

23
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:20,110
BRATISLAVA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA

24
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,484
Saunders, head of Section V, Vienna.
You're bloody late.

25
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:00,399
This is a mission, not a fancy-dress ball.

26
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,072
We have time.

27
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:09,195
- Now, where's our man?
- In the box. Between the KGB minders.

28
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,711
Lovely girl with the cello.

29
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,548
Forget the ladies for once, Bond.

30
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,720
Koskov will leave here at the interval.

31
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,062
We'd better go.

32
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,558
Turn off the lights.

33
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:31,373
Now, let's understand one another, Bond.
General Koskov is a top KGB mastermind.

34
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:34,376
His defection is my baby.
He contacted me.

35
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,082
I've planned this out to the last detail.

36
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:43,473
- You'll want the soft-nosed ones, I expect.
- No, the steel-tipped.

37
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,556
KGB snipers usually wear body armour.

38
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:51,850
- What's your escape route?
- Sorry, old man. Section 26, paragraph 5.

39
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:55,604
That information is on
a need-to-know basis only.

40
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,613
I'm sure you understand.

41
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:00,530
Koskov is under
intensive KGB surveillance.

42
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,904
A sniper has been assigned to watch him

43
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,124
and he expressly asked
for you to protect him.

44
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,668
- Why me?
- He has the impression you're the best.

45
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:16,302
- Where's the car?
- In the alley out the back.

46
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,894
Bring the chair.

47
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:44,748
It'll take him about
10 seconds to reach us.

48
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:48,541
Plenty of time for a sniper
to make strawberry jam of him!

49
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,133
There's Koskov now.

50
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,313
What's he waiting for?

51
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,361
Sniper. Two floors up, centre window.

52
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:54,859
The girl with the cello!

53
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,333
Fire, Bond, fire!

54
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,206
Shoot her! What are you waiting for?

55
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,218
You missed deliberately!

56
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:49,750
Where is he?

57
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:52,045
- In the boot.
- First place they'd look.

58
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,506
- But my escape route...
- Scrubbed.

59
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,634
Get in the front.

60
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,641
- James. James Bond!
- Later, General.

61
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:06,485
Lose them. I'll pick you up at the border.
2300 hours. Be there.

62
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,483
- How will you get him out?
- Sorry, old man.

63
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:14,159
Section 26, paragraph 5: "need-to-know".
I'm sure you understand.

64
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,834
- The sniper was a woman.
- I noticed.

65
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:29,251
Some of the best KGB shots are women.

66
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,268
- Did you...?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

67
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,222
No, of course not.

68
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:49,948
They are looking for me! If they
close the border, how will I get out?

69
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:54,703
Don't you worry about that, Georgi.
We have a pipeline to the West.

70
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:11,338
- Rosika Miklos.
- Our man here.

71
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:14,144
Good to work with you again, Mr Bond.
Come.

72
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:18,264
Keep quiet.

73
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,202
- We must hurry. Get him in the pig.
- Pig? What is pig?

74
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:43,497
Scouring plug to clean out the pipeline.
This one's been designed to carry a man.

75
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:46,006
Pipeline? You mean our pipeline?

76
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:49,756
Great Soviet achievement -
piping natural gas into the West.

77
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:53,260
- But not me!
- Don't worry, Georgi. It's a piece of cake.

78
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:57,891
Never mind cake. If you open valve
before 100, he will be borsch!

79
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,478
Pigs! Borsch! Cake!
There must be another way!

80
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:06,782
Get in. Put on the mask
and breathe normally.

81
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,116
- Enough talk!
- Relax, Georgi.

82
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,570
Our people have spent months on this.

83
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:15,324
- How many times have you done this?
- You're the first.

84
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:28,676
Remember. When this says 100,
turn this. Not before.

85
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:32,727
- Where are you going?
- To take care of the supervisor.

86
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:37,148
When pig goes, his control panel
will light up like Christmas tree.

87
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,075
What kind of girl do you think I am!

88
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,032
Welcome to Austria, General.

89
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,619
Come on. Up you go.

90
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,582
Come on, hurry up!

91
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,515
That's right. We've got him.

92
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,698
Excuse me. Shut it now.

93
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:48,955
Thank you.

94
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,973
Cheer up, Saunders.
The operation's a success.

95
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:54,977
- And officially still yours.
- I don't intend to leave it at that, 007.

96
00:21:55,698 --> 00:22:00,076
I'm telling M you deliberately missed.
Your orders were to kill that sniper.

97
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:03,987
Stuff my orders. I only kill professionals.

98
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:07,374
That girl didn't know
one end of a rifle from the other.

99
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:11,452
Go ahead. Tell M what you want.
If he fires me, I'll thank him for it.

100
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:16,792
Whoever she was, I must have
scared the living daylights out of her.

101
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:19,921
Russian general defects!

102
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:26,439
Ula Yarkhov. Confirmed kills, three.
Probable kills, two.

103
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:31,440
Assassination methods:
strangulation with hands or thighs.

104
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,610
James, she's just your type!

105
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,028
Wrong again, Moneypenny. You are.

106
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:39,029
I'll file that
with the other secret information.

107
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,950
Specialist-child impersonations.

108
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:46,245
Assassination method:
explosive teddy bears.

109
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,833
That's all the KGB female assassins.

110
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:53,425
You know, we could try freelancers
stationed outside the Soviet bloc.

111
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:57,384
It'll have to wait. M wants you
out at the Blayden safe house.

112
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,428
Right. Looks like
it's a dead end here anyway.

113
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:03,598
Ah! Good!

114
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:24,243
Something we're making for
the Americans. It's called a ghetto blaster.

115
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:30,087
You'd better hurry. M wants you
to stop at Harrods and pick up a parcel.

116
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:36,385
Moneypenny, ask Records to monitor
Czech publication and news services

117
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,893
for any mention of a woman cellist
at the conservatoire in Bratislava.

118
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,147
I didn't know
you were such a music lover, James.

119
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:48,687
Any time you want to drop by and
listen to my Barry Manilow collection...

120
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,702
- Sorry, sir. Excuse me.
- Bloody Yanks.

121
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:35,325
Good morning, sir.

122
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,530
Control here. 007's on his way.

123
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,390
Sorry, Mr Bond.
You'll have to leave the metal.

124
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:58,602
Thank you, sir.

125
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:01,766
- Good morning, sir. May I help you?
- No, thanks.

126
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,939
They're in the drawing room.

127
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:11,366
Come.

128
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:16,949
James!

129
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,617
James, I will never forget
what you did for me!

130
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,376
Thank you so... What's this?

131
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:28,839
From Harrods. A godsend!
The food here is horrible.

132
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,924
- The foie gras is excellent.
- Da, da. As Russians say,

133
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:35,758
hearts and stomachs
good comrades make.

134
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:40,852
What's this? Caviar. Well, that's peasant
food for us, but with champagne it's OK.

135
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:43,901
Bollinger RD. The best!

136
00:25:45,488 --> 00:25:49,320
The brand on the list was questionable,
sir, so I chose something else.

137
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,443
Superb, Mr Bond!

138
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:54,070
May I suggest we resume the debriefing?

139
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,531
Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm all yours.

140
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:06,045
- Where's the usual milkman?
- What d'you say?

141
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:09,178
- Where's the usual man?
- Flu.

142
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:21,023
- Hey, mate. Watch it!
- Kitchen entrance, round the back.

143
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:25,530
General Leonid Pushkin is why I defect.

144
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:29,108
What? Your KGB superior?

145
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:32,494
Gogol's replacement when
he joined their foreign service.

146
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:36,490
Once we were like brothers,
but now he's a different man.

147
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:39,746
Power has gone to his head.
He's sick, like Stalin!

148
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,668
He hates our new policy of détente.

149
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:53,472
I have here a secret directive
from Pushkin. Smiert Spionom.

150
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:57,185
"Death to Spies", Minister.

151
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:02,608
For an assassination programme, with list
of targets - British and American agents.

152
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:06,443
When this starts, you will retaliate.

153
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:10,194
Soviet and Western Intelligence
could destroy each other.

154
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,405
This might lead to nuclear war!

155
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,826
Unless Pushkin can be...
How do you say?

156
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:19,127
Put away.

157
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,712
Where is Pushkin now? In Moscow?

158
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:27,048
But in three days
he will leave for Tangier.

159
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:31,179
Cover - North African trade convention.

160
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:35,311
Real reason?

161
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,480
New directive.

162
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:45,571
Minister, in view of the importance
of what Mr Koskov has just told us,

163
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:48,619
I believe we should
consult with higher authority.

164
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:52,875
- By all means. Good day, Mr Koskov.
- Good day, sir.

165
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,500
There you go. There's a good lad.

166
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:17,774
- Good morning.
- Morning. Put it down there, would you?

167
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,527
Ta.

168
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,078
Green Four to base!

169
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,882
Green Four, this is control.
Where are you?

170
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,590
You may have a malfunction.

171
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:27,726
Green Four to base.
We have gas leaks in main building.

172
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:32,562
Some personnel overcome. Evacuate.
Send for emergency medical services.

173
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,143
Green Four, I read and understand you.

174
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:39,322
Control to all stations.
Code 1 0. Initiate emergency drill.

175
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:43,577
Evacuate the main building.
Emergency. Emergency.

176
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:56,332
Green Four to base. Major gas explosion.
Keep clear of the main building.

177
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,421
KGB!

178
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,597
Keep back!

179
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:17,028
- Get up. Come on!
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

180
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,528
Move. Move!

181
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,493
Keep clear of the main building.

182
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:43,889
- Who's that for?
- You, comrade.

183
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,763
Help him or I kill you both.

184
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,236
Move! Hurry.

185
00:30:56,365 --> 00:31:00,197
Only emergency services
should be allowed in the area.

186
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:12,295
Stay away from the house.

187
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:18,627
Please don't use
your private radiophones.

188
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:44,540
Two dead, two in hospital, and Koskov
probably back in Moscow, if not dead.

189
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:47,835
We're the laughing stock
of the Intelligence community.

190
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:53,302
Our first major coup in years, snatched
from right under our noses by the KGB

191
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:55,467
only hours after he defected!

192
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,636
- No trace of him?
- Nothing.

193
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:01,928
- Then there's this Pushkin matter.
- Well, I must be off.

194
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:04,350
Meeting with the PM this afternoon.

195
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,106
We have to nip
Smiert Spionom in the bud.

196
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:15,197
Pushkin should be in Tangiers
in two days' time.

197
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,864
A termination warrant
has been issued for him.

198
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:21,744
This plot to kill agents
sounds rather far-fetched, sir.

199
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,039
- I know General Pushkin.
- Do you think I don't?

200
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,087
I've dealt with him on several occasions!

201
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:33,589
Our paths have crossed over the years.
He's tough and resourceful, but...

202
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:37,968
- I can't believe he's a psychotic.
- Neither did I until today.

203
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,849
This arrived from Gibraltar.
It was found near 004's body.

204
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,565
Your name was on Pushkin's list, too, 007.

205
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:58,997
There are a few things I'd like to check
out first, sir. That sniper, for instance.

206
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:02,872
Yes. I've read Saunders' report.
You jeopardised the mission

207
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:08,876
- To avoid shooting a beautiful girl.
- I had to make a split-second decision.

208
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,678
- It was instinct.
- I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong.

209
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,211
He can do it. He doesn't know Pushkin.

210
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:17,551
He follows orders, not instincts.

211
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,812
- You can take a fortnight's leave.
- No!

212
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,395
Sir.

213
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:29,230
If it has to be done, I'd rather do it.

214
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,161
Right, bring it down slowly. Gently now.

215
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:38,158
- Morning, Q.
- Ah, morning, 007.

216
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,532
Mind your head.

217
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:44,369
I've got something for you.
We're just winterising this.

218
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,755
Now, pay attention, 007.

219
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:52,342
A key-ring finder.

220
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:57,389
- Surprise me.
- You arm it by pressing that button there.

221
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,476
Like that. See?

222
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,147
Right. Now wear that.

223
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:08,520
Right. Now whistle
the first bars of "Rule, Britannia".

224
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:23,922
Stun gas. Effective range?
Ooh, about five feet.

225
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:28,879
Disorientates any normal person
for about, ooh, 30 seconds.

226
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:32,761
You don't find too many
normal people in this business, Q.

227
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:35,762
What is it to blow up the room -
"God Save the Queen"?

228
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:40,806
It so happens, 007, that we've packed
the finder with concentrated explosive,

229
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:43,349
sufficient to remove the door of any safe.

230
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:47,947
It's magnetic.
The actuating signal is personalised.

231
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:50,565
- What's my code?
- Oh, most appropriate.

232
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:53,704
- A wolf whistle.
- You mean, um...

233
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:56,829
Stop!

234
00:34:58,044 --> 00:35:00,369
You may find the keys useful.

235
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,871
They open 90% of the world's locks.

236
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,886
All right, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

237
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:18,481
- Well done, Moneypenny. That's her.
- Records sent over this translation.

238
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:21,277
"Kara Milovy,
talented scholarship cellist,

239
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:25,020
whose arm was injured
during an intermission last week,

240
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,279
will be at the academy on Thursday,

241
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:30,445
playing Borodin's
'String Quartet No.2 in D'."

242
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:33,283
That's tomorrow.

243
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:39,002
Moneypenny, I'll need travel documents
for Tangier via Bratislava.

244
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:41,620
And keep this between ourselves.

245
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:44,165
That girl must be very talented.

246
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:48,300
Believe me, my interest in her
is purely professional.

247
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:52,725
- Just taking the Aston Martin for a spin.
- Be careful, 007.

248
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:54,929
It's just had a new coat of paint!

249
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,631
I dropped the gun in the river.

250
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,804
The KGB made quite a mess.

251
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:26,059
You're English. Who are you?

252
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:30,642
I heard you play
at the conservatoire yesterday.

253
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:37,279
It was exquisite.

254
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,326
I saw what happened on the tram.
Where did they take you?

255
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,999
KGB headquarters?

256
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:49,711
They released me this morning.

257
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,413
Take a look across the street.

258
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,848
They let you go so they could follow you.

259
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:08,266
I don't understand.
Why are you trying to help me?

260
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:13,990
What did Pushkin want?

261
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:17,485
Did he ask you about Georgi Koskov?

262
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:23,038
He wanted to know where he was.

263
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,252
- Did you tell him?
- No.

264
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:29,048
That was clever of Georgi, using blanks.

265
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:35,420
Made the British believe
his defection was real.

266
00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:37,762
How do you know that?

267
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:40,264
He told me.

268
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:43,680
- You saw him?
- Two days ago. He's safe and sound.

269
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:50,320
- You're a friend of his?
- We've been through quite a lot together.

270
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:56,660
Dear Georgi!
He kept his promise to send for me.

271
00:41:57,996 --> 00:41:59,824
Where are we going? To London?

272
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:04,750
No, not yet. The British think
he'll be safer if he keeps moving around.

273
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:08,295
- We might catch up with him in Vienna.
- Vienna?

274
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,209
We must leave immediately,
before they pick you up again.

275
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,386
- But how?
- We'll manage.

276
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,887
Get packed. Bring some warm clothes.

277
00:43:22,004 --> 00:43:24,460
Looks like we got away with it.

278
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:30,507
My cello! It's at the conservatoire.

279
00:43:30,638 --> 00:43:33,889
- I'll get you another in Vienna.
- No, we must go back for it.

280
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:37,434
We have 10 minutes before
they discover what's happened.

281
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:40,433
- I must get my cello.
- No way!

282
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,790
Come on, get in!

283
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,748
Why didn't you learn the violin?

284
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:38,952
You've picked up the police band.

285
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:41,625
There must be an atmospheric anomaly.

286
00:44:45,136 --> 00:44:48,920
They're looking for a foreign car.
A man and a woman.

287
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:50,764
And a cello!

288
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:59,066
Looks like they just found us.

289
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:15,161
Pull over to the side and stop!

290
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,601
- What happened?
- Salt corrosion.

291
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,945
They're setting up roadblocks.

292
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,803
- What is this?
- I've had a few optional extras installed.

293
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:38,670
Amazing, this modern safety glass.

294
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:41,417
Look out!

295
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,767
See where this leads to.

296
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,819
This road only leads to the lake.

297
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,140
Time to leave.

298
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,345
James!

299
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,497
Brace yourself.

300
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:02,992
We almost made it.

301
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,210
Come on, quick! Go!

302
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,933
Glad I insisted you brought that cello!

303
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:06,230
Sorry!

304
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,854
Not far now!

305
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:22,239
Here, wave this.

306
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,460
Duck!

307
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,088
- We've nothing to declare!
- Just a cello!

308
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:40,680
TANGIER

309
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:23,982
If you wait here, sir, I'll find the chief.

310
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:45,661
General Pushkin, it's a pleasure.

311
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:49,298
I'm Brad Whitaker.
Didn't expect to see you in Tangiers.

312
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:51,800
General Koskov with you?

313
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,925
War. War has always been
man's main occupation.

314
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,058
Fools say his greatest accomplishments
were the wheel and the alphabet.

315
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:02,514
I say it's a battering ram and gunpowder.

316
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,438
How do you like my pantheon
of great commanders?

317
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:08,737
- Butchers.
- Surgeons.

318
00:52:08,865 --> 00:52:12,994
They cut away society's dead flesh.
Let me show you something.

319
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,242
At ease, Sergeant. This way, sir.

320
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,746
My hobby-the strategy and tactics
of the world's historic battles.

321
00:52:25,758 --> 00:52:29,009
Afghanistan,
the North-West Frontier, 1895.

322
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:32,257
The initial trial of the first
automatic machine gun.

323
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,597
The.303-calibre Maxim.

324
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:38,178
The King's Royal Rifles
wiped out a vastly superior force.

325
00:52:38,314 --> 00:52:41,564
Kept the British in Afghanistan
for another 25 years.

326
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:45,820
What you Russians need nowadays
is the equivalent of a modern Maxim.

327
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:48,945
Third-generation starlight scope.

328
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:53,702
A laser-sighting, short-barrelled
machine pistol. Infantry mini-missiles.

329
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:57,495
Range - 5km.
And smart. Just fire and forget.

330
00:52:57,626 --> 00:53:00,331
It penetrates all existing armour.

331
00:53:00,463 --> 00:53:03,001
Yes, sir! Samples of everything ordered.

332
00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:05,670
The order is cancelled.

333
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:09,633
You'll return our deposit
of $50 million within the next 48 hours.

334
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:11,804
You can't be serious, General.

335
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:14,804
Do you know how hard it is
to obtain this equipment?

336
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:17,345
This is the latest US and European stuff.

337
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:21,016
I've made commitments,
letters of credit, special payoffs.

338
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:25,280
We know that you've had our money
in your Swiss account for eight weeks

339
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:28,028
and that you have made
no payments of any kind.

340
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,911
Look, I can't cancel
orders at this late date.

341
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:34,074
As one soldier to another,
you have my word of honour...

342
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:39,249
Spare me your military pretensions.
What army did you serve in?

343
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,334
You were expelled
from West Point for cheating.

344
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,384
Then a short stint as
a mercenary in the Belgian Congo.

345
00:53:46,513 --> 00:53:51,056
Later you worked with various criminals
to help finance your first arms deals.

346
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:54,138
Lies spread by my competitors.

347
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:57,307
You forget your many
so-called wars of liberation

348
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:01,604
that I have supplied through General
Koskov. Those are my credentials.

349
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:06,898
The money in two days, or you'll find
yourself out of business permanently.

350
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,490
Georgi Koskov as well.

351
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,200
I don't know what you two are scheming,

352
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,618
but it is over. Is that understood?

353
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,966
Careful.

354
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,151
Taxi!

355
00:54:47,578 --> 00:54:50,614
Vienna's beautiful, just like Georgi said.

356
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:54,662
- You care for him a great deal, don't you?
- I owe him everything.

357
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:58,874
My scholarship
at the conservatoire, my Strad.

358
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:03,800
- Your cello's a Stradivarius?
- A famous one. The Lady Rose.

359
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,764
- Georgi got it in New York.
- Quite a present.

360
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,884
Maybe someday I'll play there.
At Carnegie Hall?

361
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,639
- Georgi believes I can do it.
- I'm sure he's right.

362
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,399
- We go to him now?
- Yeah. Unless he had to move on.

363
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:23,402
If he did, I'm sure he left a message.

364
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:09,662
- Careful.
- Careful.

365
00:56:20,303 --> 00:56:22,260
good afternoon, Mr Bond.

366
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:25,972
- You will need your usual suite?
- Not tonight, Hans.

367
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:28,141
- We need a second bedroom.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,853
- Shall I have vodka martinis sent up?
- Shaken, not stirred.

369
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:34,023
Of course.

370
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:40,230
Universal Exports.

371
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:45,444
Bond here. I need two tickets for the
opera tonight, to be left at the box office.

372
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:02,927
- Do you like it?
- For princess or wife of commissar?

373
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:05,465
- Let's buy it.
- Don't joke!

374
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:08,722
- Who will pay?
- Georgi, of course.

375
00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:33,544
The chief wants you.

376
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:50,646
We have to report.

377
00:58:03,122 --> 00:58:05,365
Very good. At ease, Sergeant.

378
00:58:07,085 --> 00:58:09,125
Pushkin wants the money back.

379
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:15,498
Don't worry. We've convinced
the British that Pushkin is a danger.

380
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:19,800
They will send their best man,
James Bond, to eliminate him.

381
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:22,720
I'm not convinced. Necros can do it.

382
00:58:22,853 --> 00:58:26,851
I've worked with the Russians.
My appearance is well known to them.

383
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:30,351
It could jeopardise my comrades
who depend upon me.

384
00:58:30,486 --> 00:58:34,947
And they depend upon me. Where else
will they find a supply of arms?

385
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,150
Our basic plan is sound.

386
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,156
Pushkin is, how you say, history.

387
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:43,075
Not yet. James Bond
hasn't laid a finger on him.

388
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,283
- The British are cautious.
- Yeah.

389
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:48,622
An additional inducement will ensure this.

390
00:58:48,756 --> 00:58:52,623
For instance,
if another agent were eliminated.

391
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:58,973
Do it. But if Pushkin is alive on
the last day of the conference, kill him!

392
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:55,908
- All my life I've dreamed of this.
- You might play here one day.

393
00:59:56,037 --> 01:00:00,165
That's too much to hope for.
Excuse me for a few moments.

394
01:00:09,592 --> 01:00:11,502
- Is that...?
- The cello girl.

395
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:14,887
- The KGB sniper? Why bring her here?
- She's not a KGB sniper.

396
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:17,933
She's Koskov's girlfriend.

397
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,145
She shot blanks to make
his defection look real to us.

398
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:24,476
Koskov's defection phoney?
The KGB snatched him back.

399
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:27,278
That's what we were supposed to think.

400
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:32,149
These are serious accusations, Bond.
What are you up to?

401
01:00:32,284 --> 01:00:36,329
I'm posing as Koskov's friend
to see what leads I can get from her.

402
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,621
You know he bought her a cello
in New York called the Lady Rose?

403
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:46,668
- A cello with a name?
- It's a Stradivarius.

404
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,006
They all have names.

405
01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:51,840
Where would Koskov
get the money? Check it out.

406
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:57,596
I'll need papers for her tonight. I have
to get her out of the country by tomorrow.

407
01:00:57,728 --> 01:01:00,646
Here. I took these this afternoon.

408
01:01:01,107 --> 01:01:04,891
Look, this is highly irregular.
I won't get the OK from London today.

409
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:10,734
It can't wait, Saunders. That girl's
our only chance of getting Koskov back.

410
01:01:17,165 --> 01:01:21,662
Very well.
I've got nothing to lose but my pension.

411
01:01:21,796 --> 01:01:27,301
Meet me at the Prater Café
near the Ferris wheel at midnight.

412
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:57,454
- No more.
- This one!

413
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:18,895
Take me on the wheel.

414
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,670
You'll be able to see better.

415
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,604
Is it real or just a dream?

416
01:03:21,342 --> 01:03:23,583
What's wrong? Why do we stop?

417
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,802
I arranged it.

418
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:29,972
We could be here all night.

419
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,353
Don't.

420
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,727
It's impossible.

421
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:45,655
Knowing you only two days and all I can
think of is how we would be together.

422
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:50,120
Don't think.

423
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:52,287
Just let it happen.

424
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:30,661
Do you want another ride?

425
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:47,840
I'll be back in a minute.
There may be a message for me.

426
01:05:08,082 --> 01:05:11,866
It was bought recently
at auction in New York.

427
01:05:12,002 --> 01:05:17,424
Lot 1 24, the Lady Rose,
a cello by Stradivarius of Cremona, 1 724.

428
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,337
Sold for $1 50,000

429
01:05:21,722 --> 01:05:23,714
to Brad Whitaker.

430
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:26,138
Whitaker? The arms dealer?

431
01:05:26,268 --> 01:05:28,307
The same.

432
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:31,186
Koskov and Whitaker.

433
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:36,771
- Where's Whitaker now?
- At his place in Tangier.

434
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:41,071
Well done.

435
01:05:43,328 --> 01:05:45,368
Good luck.

436
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:47,200
Saunders.

437
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:51,042
Thanks.

438
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,791
Where are you going?

439
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:43,555
What's the matter?

440
01:06:45,646 --> 01:06:48,315
Bad accident back there.

441
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,276
Did you hear?

442
01:06:51,402 --> 01:06:53,441
Hear from Georgi?

443
01:06:57,158 --> 01:06:59,198
Yes.

444
01:06:59,744 --> 01:07:01,986
I got the message.

445
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:08,623
He's with Whitaker in Tangier.

446
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:11,791
Brad Whitaker? The American?

447
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:14,462
- You know him?
- He's a patron of the arts.

448
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:17,594
Georgi said he'd help me.

449
01:07:17,721 --> 01:07:20,178
How soon do we have to go?

450
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:26,146
Immediately. I promised Georgi
I'd get you back as soon as I could.

451
01:07:26,272 --> 01:07:28,432
Can't we stay here a few days?

452
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:31,140
No. We leave first thing in the morning.

453
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:48,046
Is anything wrong?

454
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:53,971
- Bond!
- Don't make any sudden moves, General.

455
01:09:54,892 --> 01:09:56,931
Go to the table.

456
01:10:15,706 --> 01:10:17,745
Sit down.

457
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:31,131
I take it that this is not a social call, 007.

458
01:10:31,264 --> 01:10:34,348
Correct. You should have brought lilies.

459
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:40,064
- May I ask why?
- Smiert Spionom.

460
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:48,438
That was a Beria operation in Stalin's
time. It was deactivated 20 years ago.

461
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,860
- Two of our agents are dead.
- My condolences.

462
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:54,071
We had nothing to do with it.

463
01:10:59,586 --> 01:11:01,460
Where's Koskov?

464
01:11:01,589 --> 01:11:05,883
He disappeared two weeks ago.
I was about to have him arrested.

465
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:09,462
- Why?
- For misusing state funds.

466
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:11,930
Involving Whitaker?

467
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:15,095
That is a security matter
and cannot be discussed.

468
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:20,645
That was damn stupid!

469
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,911
Get in the bathroom and lock the door.

470
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:48,761
Stay where you are!

471
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:54,016
Get down on your knees.

472
01:11:56,899 --> 01:11:58,938
Put your hands behind your back.

473
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,188
You are professional.
You do not kill without reason.

474
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:08,076
Two of our men are dead.
Koskov's named you.

475
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:14,162
- Now, why should I disobey my orders?
- I am in the dark as much as you are.

476
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:18,243
It is a question of trust.
Who do you believe?

477
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,669
Koskov or me?

478
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:24,085
If I trusted Koskov,
we wouldn't be talking.

479
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:30,723
But as long as you're alive,
we'll never know what he's up to.

480
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,109
Then I must die.

481
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:41,731
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:45,648
it is my honour to introduce
the head of the Russian delegation,

483
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:47,825
Comrade Leonid Pushkin.

484
01:12:59,258 --> 01:13:00,965
Comrade delegates,

485
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:06,300
I bring you profound fraternal greetings
from your comrades in Soviet Union.

486
01:13:33,628 --> 01:13:35,336
Seal the building!

487
01:14:58,845 --> 01:15:02,759
- You looking for a party?
- Seems like a good idea.

488
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,440
I'm sorry to put you
through that, my dear.

489
01:15:13,444 --> 01:15:19,281
It is the first time I've ever been grateful
that James Bond is a good shot!

490
01:15:21,745 --> 01:15:26,491
Pull over here. We can have a party
some other time. A little present for you.

491
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,838
Not enough? Take it all.

492
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,681
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

493
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:08,166
Down below.

494
01:16:12,174 --> 01:16:16,468
What the hell are you trying to do, 007?
Start World War III?

495
01:16:16,596 --> 01:16:20,546
Felix Leiter!
Now, what's the CIA doing here?

496
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:22,511
Nice work, girls.

497
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:25,598
- No hard feelings?
- Not if the party's still on.

498
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:33,936
It's a long story, Felix, but in the end
Pushkin makes a miraculous recovery.

499
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:36,528
You mean this is a put-up job?

500
01:16:38,244 --> 01:16:41,079
- What's all this?
- We've been watching Pushkin

501
01:16:41,206 --> 01:16:43,281
since he met two days ago with Whitaker.

502
01:16:43,624 --> 01:16:47,077
- An illegal arms deal with the Russians?
- You've got me, James.

503
01:16:47,212 --> 01:16:52,289
Whitaker has a few samples of hi-tech
stuff, but he's placed no big orders yet.

504
01:16:52,426 --> 01:16:57,302
Looks like we're working on the same
case from opposite ends. Let's talk shop.

505
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:01,305
Well done!

506
01:17:01,436 --> 01:17:04,010
Congratulations.
We heard it over the radio.

507
01:17:04,147 --> 01:17:06,899
I didn't kill him. Bond did.

508
01:17:07,818 --> 01:17:11,068
I told you the British believed me!
I told you!

509
01:17:11,196 --> 01:17:13,189
I told you!

510
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:16,823
Now we can move. I'll signal
Amsterdam to ship the diamonds.

511
01:17:16,952 --> 01:17:19,574
- Sir?
- Hello? Yes.

512
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,330
Who?

513
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:26,917
It's for you.

514
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:33,425
Hello?

515
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:01,744
Where have you been, James?
You were gone so long, I was worried!

516
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:06,373
It's always nice to be missed.
Still no sign of Georgi.

517
01:18:06,506 --> 01:18:08,545
- No, please. Go on playing.
- No.

518
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,591
Let's have a drink.

519
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:24,855
You remembered.

520
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,316
To us.

521
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:34,490
Nazdraviye.

522
01:18:38,082 --> 01:18:40,122
Did I get it right?

523
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:44,001
Perfect.

524
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:47,087
What's the matter?

525
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:53,800
Kara, it's time I told you the truth.

526
01:18:55,601 --> 01:18:59,930
I'm not a friend of Georgi's.
I'm a British agent looking for him.

527
01:19:00,064 --> 01:19:05,521
He's betrayed us all, Kara.
The Russians, the British, even you.

528
01:19:07,947 --> 01:19:12,444
He told us a sniper might try to kill him.

529
01:19:12,577 --> 01:19:15,863
And he set you up as the sniper, Kara.

530
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:19,497
He wants you dead. You knew too much.

531
01:19:19,626 --> 01:19:23,411
Liar! You pretended to love me!

532
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:28,755
I telephoned Whitaker.
Georgi was there. He told me the truth.

533
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:32,386
You're a KGB agent,
using me to find him and kill him!

534
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:34,390
No, that's not...

535
01:19:34,518 --> 01:19:36,557
That's not true. I...

536
01:19:39,648 --> 01:19:41,059
That's...

537
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,026
Chloral hydrate!

538
01:19:45,154 --> 01:19:48,155
- Keep your hands off me!
- Kara, listen to me!

539
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,533
The rifle was shot out of your hands.

540
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:56,120
- How do you know?
- Because I was the...

541
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,826
I was the man sent to kill you.

542
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,788
Why didn't you?

543
01:20:17,022 --> 01:20:20,605
Kara, my darling,
you were absolutely perfect.

544
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,605
Hurry.

545
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,200
Open it, please.

546
01:21:11,665 --> 01:21:14,238
Careful. It must be kept absolutely sterile.

547
01:21:15,586 --> 01:21:17,625
Urgh! Go.

548
01:22:10,853 --> 01:22:13,475
I've been such a fool.

549
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:17,016
We both have.

550
01:22:17,152 --> 01:22:19,191
Open the lid.

551
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:21,610
Oh, my God!

552
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,492
That's not human. It's an animal's heart.

553
01:22:28,873 --> 01:22:31,873
Diamonds hidden in the ice.

554
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:40,092
- How can I help you?
- I need my key ring. Look out!

555
01:23:06,246 --> 01:23:08,536
Black coffee for our guest.

556
01:23:11,502 --> 01:23:14,123
She has so many talents!

557
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,248
I'm curious.

558
01:23:16,383 --> 01:23:19,752
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, I'm not a barbarian, James.

559
01:23:19,886 --> 01:23:22,638
I'm taking you
to the proper Soviet authorities

560
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,885
for the killing of General Pushkin.

561
01:23:29,146 --> 01:23:34,189
You're a wonder, Georgi!
You get me to kill Pushkin for you.

562
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:37,355
Then you turn me in
to the Russians for his murder.

563
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:41,154
What are you going to ask for? Lmmunity?

564
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:45,117
Permission to emigrate
and enjoy the amenities of the West?

565
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:48,248
You don't think they'll
condone your defection?

566
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:50,000
What defection?

567
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:53,378
I have been on a secret mission
for General Pushkin

568
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:57,124
to disinform British Intelligence.

569
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:01,507
I'm sorry, James.
For you I have great affection,

570
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,101
but we have an old saying:
"Duty has no sweethearts."

571
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:11,189
We have an old saying, too, Georgi.

572
01:24:11,317 --> 01:24:13,724
And you're full of it!

573
01:24:37,304 --> 01:24:39,343
Come, Kara.

574
01:24:49,983 --> 01:24:52,736
- Kara?
- Yes.

575
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:01,444
Welcome to Afghanistan.

576
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,367
Colonel Feyador,
my old comrade in arms.

577
01:25:06,085 --> 01:25:12,205
I have here General Pushkin's assassin.
British Agent 007, James Bond.

578
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:15,508
See he is sent to Moscow.

579
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:18,009
One moment. There's one more.

580
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:21,223
Take her, too. She's a defector.

581
01:25:23,603 --> 01:25:25,679
I will be compassionate with you

582
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:29,978
and try to have you assigned to
the Siberian Philharmonic Orchestra.

583
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:33,645
They're quite good
despite their bourgeois repertoire.

584
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:46,658
I am on a secret state mission. I need
a detachment of men and some trucks.

585
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,467
- What are these here for?
- For murder.

586
01:25:55,596 --> 01:25:57,635
Murder?

587
01:25:58,641 --> 01:26:02,555
I haven't had a woman prisoner
for a long time!

588
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:08,806
Come.

589
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:11,945
Russky! Has Colonel Feyador
considered my appeal?

590
01:26:12,072 --> 01:26:14,029
Yes. Good news.

591
01:26:14,157 --> 01:26:17,492
You won't be hung in the morning.
You will be shot!

592
01:26:20,248 --> 01:26:22,620
It's all a mistake! I stole nothing!

593
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,206
You can tell Allah when you see him!

594
01:26:28,173 --> 01:26:31,542
- Strip!
- Nye smeyete menya trogat/

595
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:37,016
Shout all you want. It's soundproofed.
They don't like to hear screaming at night.

596
01:26:38,351 --> 01:26:41,056
I didn't tell you to get down!

597
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,348
I did not tell you to get up!

598
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:48,524
Now get up!

599
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,734
Lock the door.

600
01:28:17,207 --> 01:28:20,576
You were fantastic! We're free!

601
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:26,252
Kara, we're in a Russian air base in the
middle of Afghanistan. Try the small key.

602
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,511
At least we're together.

603
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,680
Terrific. Come on.

604
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,018
Please.

605
01:30:24,428 --> 01:30:26,670
Come on, jump!

606
01:30:39,653 --> 01:30:42,109
- What's going on?
- I tell them you no Russian.

607
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,611
- They no kill you now.
- How about later?

608
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:48,407
Don't worry.
They'll save you for the harem!

609
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,142
It's the work of the mujaheddin.

610
01:31:13,272 --> 01:31:14,933
Mujaheddin?

611
01:31:15,066 --> 01:31:17,106
The Afghan Resistance.

612
01:32:55,258 --> 01:32:57,713
I hope he's not invited to dinner.

613
01:33:23,622 --> 01:33:28,533
Thank you both for your help.
My name is Kamran Shah.

614
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:33,296
Please forgive the theatricals.
It's a hangover from my Oxford days.

615
01:33:33,424 --> 01:33:35,547
I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.

616
01:33:37,554 --> 01:33:39,593
It's all right, go ahead.

617
01:33:48,774 --> 01:33:52,938
- I have to get back to the air base.
- You must be crazy!

618
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:57,448
- Half the Russian army's looking for you!
- You won't help?

619
01:33:57,575 --> 01:34:00,030
No.

620
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:02,487
Then put me in touch
with the mujaheddin.

621
01:34:06,835 --> 01:34:09,540
Deputy Commander
of the Eastern District.

622
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:15,960
I was caught reconnoitring the air base.
Thankfully they didn't know who I was.

623
01:34:16,095 --> 01:34:18,551
Now, who are you?

624
01:34:19,098 --> 01:34:21,423
I work for the British government.

625
01:34:24,563 --> 01:34:26,935
We've uncovered a plot
by General Koskov

626
01:34:27,065 --> 01:34:30,315
to purchase American hi-tech weapons.

627
01:34:30,444 --> 01:34:34,311
Arms that could be used
against you and your men.

628
01:34:34,448 --> 01:34:38,493
That is important. You must go to
our commander in the Khyber Pass.

629
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:43,578
That could take days. I have to get back
to the air base before Koskov leaves.

630
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:47,706
Look, come with us tomorrow.
After our mission, I'll see what I can do.

631
01:34:47,838 --> 01:34:49,878
That'll be too late.

632
01:34:51,508 --> 01:34:54,082
- I need a gun and some guides.
- Impossible.

633
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,972
I cannot spare men or the horses.

634
01:34:57,098 --> 01:35:01,226
And now it is time to rest.
We leave at sunrise.

635
01:35:15,492 --> 01:35:17,532
I was worried for you, James.

636
01:35:21,124 --> 01:35:23,164
What's going to happen to us?

637
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:29,340
Kheista.

638
01:35:29,466 --> 01:35:31,506
What does that mean?

639
01:35:33,345 --> 01:35:35,919
It means beautiful in Afghan.

640
01:35:40,519 --> 01:35:43,355
We're with the mujaheddin.

641
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:47,230
We leave with them in the morning
on some kind of operation.

642
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,768
And you're going to the Khyber Pass.

643
01:35:49,904 --> 01:35:52,859
You're not coming with me?

644
01:35:52,991 --> 01:35:56,361
No. I'll catch up with you later.

645
01:35:56,496 --> 01:35:59,069
You're going back for Georgi, aren't you?

646
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:03,745
- It's too dangerous. Don't go.
- I have to.

647
01:36:03,878 --> 01:36:07,045
You have to what? Get killed?

648
01:36:08,175 --> 01:36:10,962
- I won't wait for you.
- Fine.

649
01:36:11,094 --> 01:36:14,048
Then I'll have Kamran
send you direct to London.

650
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:18,178
You dumb, stubborn, stupid...

651
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:28,602
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Back end of horse!

652
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:31,110
Are you calling me a horse's arse?

653
01:36:43,796 --> 01:36:45,955
I might never see you again.

654
01:36:49,427 --> 01:36:51,337
You will.

655
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,511
I promise.

656
01:38:40,798 --> 01:38:44,547
Raw opium. Worth half a billion
dollars on the streets of New York.

657
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:02,811
- What are you up to? Selling dope?
- Not so loud.

658
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:05,730
- That's the chief of the Snow Leopards.
- Who?

659
01:39:05,867 --> 01:39:10,079
- The biggest opium dealer in the area.
- I've worked for them.

660
01:39:10,204 --> 01:39:13,870
I don't care if the Russians die
from my bullets or their opium!

661
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:16,373
Besides, we need the money to buy arms.

662
01:39:19,089 --> 01:39:21,711
- Georgi!
- And the diamonds.

663
01:39:23,552 --> 01:39:26,839
He arranged for the Russians
to buy many hi-tech weapons.

664
01:39:26,973 --> 01:39:30,176
He's using the down payment
to buy this opium instead.

665
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:35,600
He can turn a huge profit in days and
still provide the Russians with their arms.

666
01:39:35,732 --> 01:39:38,105
- Unless...
- Go on.

667
01:39:39,195 --> 01:39:40,985
If the opium never arrives.

668
01:39:41,113 --> 01:39:44,316
The Snow Leopard Brotherhood
are dangerous to cross.

669
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:46,941
This is their biggest deal
since the invasion.

670
01:39:47,078 --> 01:39:49,236
You won't help?

671
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:56,660
Perhaps. As long as nothing is done
till the Russians pay up and leave.

672
01:39:56,796 --> 01:39:59,798
Right. I'll need
some plastic explosives and a timer.

673
01:39:59,925 --> 01:40:01,964
I'll see what I can do.

674
01:41:40,576 --> 01:41:43,411
James is trapped. You must help him!

675
01:41:43,537 --> 01:41:47,155
- He'll have to take his chances.
- You owe him your life!

676
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:50,624
- There's nothing more I can do.
- Yes, there is!

677
01:42:03,725 --> 01:42:05,765
Women!

678
01:43:58,057 --> 01:44:00,595
Wait here. We'll come back for you.

679
01:44:52,866 --> 01:44:54,490
Bond!

680
01:45:11,803 --> 01:45:14,425
Don't shoot! Don't destroy the plane.

681
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:04,454
Block the runway!

682
01:48:07,826 --> 01:48:09,107
The tanker!

683
01:49:20,113 --> 01:49:22,106
Where is she?

684
01:49:29,081 --> 01:49:31,122
We have to stop him!

685
01:49:33,336 --> 01:49:34,332
Kara!

686
01:50:05,787 --> 01:50:07,828
James!

687
01:50:12,504 --> 01:50:14,045
James!

688
01:50:22,555 --> 01:50:25,641
Don't shoot! You'll hit the plane!

689
01:51:13,235 --> 01:51:14,860
- Kara!
- Oh, my God!

690
01:51:19,367 --> 01:51:20,909
Jump!

691
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:55,402
Now that you're here, take over.

692
01:51:55,531 --> 01:51:59,149
- What?
- Hold this and keep it straight and level.

693
01:51:59,285 --> 01:52:01,325
- Where are you going?
- To defuse a bomb.

694
01:55:09,825 --> 01:55:11,484
No!

695
01:55:12,869 --> 01:55:14,032
Please!

696
01:56:31,329 --> 01:56:34,165
- What happened?
- He got the boot.

697
01:57:32,228 --> 01:57:34,019
Take over. Hold it steady.

698
01:57:34,147 --> 01:57:36,685
- Where are you going?
- To drop a bomb.

699
01:58:46,934 --> 01:58:48,974
What's the matter?

700
01:58:49,979 --> 01:58:52,019
We're losing fuel fast!

701
01:59:02,826 --> 01:59:06,077
I just hope we can make Pakistan.

702
01:59:28,145 --> 01:59:30,981
There's no place to put down.

703
01:59:34,068 --> 01:59:36,559
Go in the back.
Get in the Jeep. Quickly!

704
01:59:52,588 --> 01:59:54,830
Fasten your seat belt!

705
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:08,136
Hold on!

706
02:00:29,754 --> 02:00:34,001
I know a great restaurant in Karachi.
We can just make dinner!

707
02:00:47,105 --> 02:00:51,269
Whitaker's on the ground floor.
Koskov is in an upstairs bedroom.

708
02:00:51,401 --> 02:00:53,644
Guard in the pool area near you.

709
02:00:55,614 --> 02:00:57,654
Guard clear. Proceed.

710
02:01:04,415 --> 02:01:05,994
Hold it.

711
02:01:07,545 --> 02:01:09,751
He's coming back.

712
02:01:12,507 --> 02:01:15,082
Go, James. Over and out.

713
02:01:15,511 --> 02:01:17,883
Well, he's in.

714
02:01:42,206 --> 02:01:46,287
Pickett's charge was up
Cemetery Ridge, not Little Round Top.

715
02:01:46,419 --> 02:01:49,835
I'm replaying the battle
as I would have fought it.

716
02:01:49,965 --> 02:01:52,587
Meade was tenacious
but he was cautious.

717
02:01:52,718 --> 02:01:55,636
He missed his chances
to crush Lee at Gettysburg.

718
02:01:55,763 --> 02:01:57,803
I've come for Koskov.

719
02:02:00,017 --> 02:02:04,265
Well, hell, you can have him!
Soon as I get my opium.

720
02:02:04,397 --> 02:02:07,683
- Now where is it?
- Up in smoke.

721
02:02:08,819 --> 02:02:11,903
You burned up a half a billion bucks?

722
02:02:14,992 --> 02:02:17,318
That's too bad, Bond.

723
02:02:17,453 --> 02:02:22,163
You know, you could have been a live,
rich man instead of a poor, dead one.

724
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:27,369
You're finished, Whitaker. If the Russians
don't get you, the Americans will.

725
02:02:27,672 --> 02:02:29,665
Nah.

726
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:34,012
You know, Meade should have
taken another 35,000 casualties.

727
02:02:34,805 --> 02:02:37,177
He could have ended
the rebellion right then.

728
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:39,301
Hell, Grant would have done it.

729
02:03:07,966 --> 02:03:11,133
Right, you've had your eight.
Now I'll have my 80!

730
02:03:16,475 --> 02:03:20,556
Sorry to say your popgun is no match
for the latest body armour!

731
02:03:50,721 --> 02:03:56,759
Should have known you'd take refuge
behind that British vulture Wellington!

732
02:03:59,897 --> 02:04:05,140
You know he had to buy German
mercenaries to beat Napoleon, don't you?

733
02:04:28,553 --> 02:04:30,593
I owed you that one, Bond.

734
02:04:34,684 --> 02:04:37,804
He met his Waterloo.

735
02:04:41,776 --> 02:04:43,603
General Pushkin!

736
02:04:44,779 --> 02:04:46,818
Thank God you're still alive!

737
02:04:49,743 --> 02:04:54,867
Whitaker has held me here for weeks.
Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!

738
02:04:57,418 --> 02:04:59,873
Georgi! Georgi!

739
02:05:03,173 --> 02:05:06,674
- Put him on the next plane to Moscow.
- Oh, thank you, General!

740
02:05:06,803 --> 02:05:09,009
Thank you so much! Thank you!

741
02:05:09,139 --> 02:05:11,510
In the diplomatic bag.

742
02:05:19,025 --> 02:05:20,898
What about Kara?

743
02:05:21,026 --> 02:05:23,066
She is a defector, too.

744
02:05:24,405 --> 02:05:26,445
What shall we do about her?

745
02:06:24,595 --> 02:06:27,430
Are you going to stay in France now?

746
02:06:28,933 --> 02:06:31,638
Oh, you were marvellous!

747
02:06:32,812 --> 02:06:34,852
Will you excuse us?

748
02:06:38,903 --> 02:06:41,274
General Gogol, Miss Kara Milovy.

749
02:06:42,949 --> 02:06:48,322
Magnificent! I hope you can find time
to play in Moscow very soon.

750
02:06:48,454 --> 02:06:51,953
It's all right. General Gogol
is with their foreign service.

751
02:06:52,083 --> 02:06:56,875
He's arranged an immigration visa,
so you can come and go as you like.

752
02:06:57,005 --> 02:06:59,081
Wonderful!

753
02:07:03,179 --> 02:07:04,258
Excuse me.

754
02:07:06,515 --> 02:07:10,430
I'm sorry we missed the concert.
We had some trouble at the airport.

755
02:07:10,561 --> 02:07:15,520
I can't imagine why! General Gogol,
I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.

756
02:07:15,650 --> 02:07:18,272
- My pleasure.
- Where's James?

757
02:07:18,403 --> 02:07:23,529
- Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.
- I'll be with you shortly.

758
02:07:54,192 --> 02:07:57,561
You didn't think I'd miss
this performance, did you?

759
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,781
Oh, James.
