1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:42,000
...::: SILICONCHIP :::...

2
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,000
Looks good, right?

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,080
So, my plan is to create
this cluster of live/work lofts

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,090
all along the perimeter here.
And... Come here.

5
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,030
I also am planning this neighborhood-y
kind of dining and retail area

6
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,320
in the central square.

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,860
You know, I even had this thought
that maybe you, Denise and Hailey

8
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,490
could open up a second location
for your store.

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,330
Really? Because Denise keeps talking

10
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,060
about wanting to open up
another branch.

11
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,600
Well, it'd be great. Yeah.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,610
Look, the land is a little pricey,
so I couldn't develop it right away,

13
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,170
but once I sell the Ferrigno estate,

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,540
I figured out I could at least
put a down payment on it

15
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,910
and still have enough money left over
for the reception in Santa Barbara.

16
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,810
What are you talking about?
What reception?

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,760
Zooey, I know it's only been
eight months,

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,820
but I am so madly, insanely,
ridiculously in love with you.

19
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,200
Will you marry me?

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,460
Yes! It just happened
two minutes ago, Hailey.

21
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,410
- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't. It's amazing.

22
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh, my God.
I've been on like 10 million dates,

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,340
and you end up marrying
some totally awesome guy

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,470
who randomly walks into our store?

25
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,640
It's so cute. She doesn't know
she's on speakerphone.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
You do not know how lucky you are.

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,150
It is impossible
to find a good guy in this city.

28
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,690
- I know.
- I thought we were connecting.

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,160
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Kind of.

30
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm sorry, but not really.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,230
- Hey, will you conference in Denise?
- Oh, my God! You called me first?

32
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,890
- Oh, God.
- Awesome. Yes. Hold on.

33
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,860
Hi.

34
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,130
Hi.

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,310
- I love that piece of land. It's perfect.
- I'm glad.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,440
I mean, I know the neighborhood's
a little, you know...

37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, my God, Zo! I cannot
fucking believe you didn't call me first!

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,210
You are such a freak.
Hailey's first on my speed dial.

39
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,350
No, no, no, I'm totally kidding.
I'm so psyched for you.

40
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,590
I feel like I'm gonna puke right now.

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh, my God, hold on.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,590
Barry hates when I'm in the house
during his poker night.

43
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,930
Would you give me a second,
you fat douche?

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,490
Get out. Get out of the fucking house...

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,090
- Zooey just got engaged!
- To who?

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,170
- "To who," are you joking? To Peter.
- To who? To me.

47
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,900
- I don't know Peter.
- I've met the guy like 20 times.

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,530
- You've met him like 20 times.
- I don't know Peter.

49
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,410
- You don't know Peter?
- I have no idea who that is.

50
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,740
Okay, we've been on like 20 dates
with him.

51
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
- You don't know him?
- I've never met Peter.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,010
You are such an asshole.

53
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,170
Sorry, Zo. Have you set a date?

54
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,010
Yes. June 30th in Santa Barbara.

55
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,480
Peter already booked the place
we went for that long weekend.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,610
So romantic.

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,450
Oh, my God. He is so romantic.

58
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,680
That's the place where you guys
fucked for the first time, right?

59
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,220
No.

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,490
No, no, no,
that was the hot tub in Mexico.

61
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,470
That's right.
Santa Barbara was just oral.

62
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,800
- Yeah.
- You guys.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,060
That's right. The hot tub, yeah.

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,870
It was Mexico. You had your period in
Santa Barbara and you wanted to wait.

65
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,580
God, you're so old-fashioned, Zooey.

66
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,570
- You told them about the hot tub?
- Maybe.

67
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,520
- Wow. So, June 30th?
- Yeah, I know. It's soon, but...

68
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,780
Who cares? Peter's a doll,

69
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,650
and he goes down on you
like six times a week.

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
- What are you waiting for?
- Wow.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
Marry him. Don't wait.

72
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,860
Lock that tongue down, girl.

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,320
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,550
All right, you guys, I'll call you later.
Love you.

75
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,080
It is beautiful. It's totally understated,
and it's just... It's perfect.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,310
I know! No, he's the best. I feel so lucky.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,910
All right. All right, Debbie.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

78
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,380
Honey!
I've been totally hogging the phone.

79
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,180
- Who do you wanna call?
- I'm okay.

80
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,490
My parents are probably asleep,
so I'll just talk to them tomorrow.

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,050
You don't wanna tell
any of your friends?

82
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,120
I'll make some calls this weekend.

83
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,790
Really?
Well, what about that guy, Tevin?

84
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,920
You talk to him
like 20 times a day, right?

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,090
Well, yeah.
He works two cubicles away from me.

86
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,260
I'll see him Monday morning.

87
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,770
Or what's his name?
The one that you fence with.

88
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,860
- Gil?
- Gil.

89
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,670
Gil. Gilliam.

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,870
No, he's not really a "call right away"
kind of friend.

91
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,850
Toasting.

92
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,890
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi.

93
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,220
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mom.

94
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,860
- Excellent meat.
- So good.

95
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,430
- This is delicious. Thank you so much.
- Really is, Mom.

96
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,970
Thank you.

97
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,740
But did Peter have any good friends
growing up?

98
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,070
I honestly don't remember any.

99
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,870
All right, look, Zooey,
just to clarify here,

100
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,970
my dad worked for IBM,
so we moved a lot when I was a kid.

101
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,810
Robbie always managed to have friends.

102
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,820
Of course, he probably wanted
to suck their dicks, but...

103
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,080
Oswald!

104
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,080
No, Mom, it's cool. I totally did.

105
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,250
But he doesn't have to use
that kind of language.

106
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,380
- Indeed.
- Why?

107
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,490
My son is a gay man,
and I embrace his lifestyle.

108
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,290
It's true. Dad loves the gays.

109
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,600
I actually made him
an honorary homo last month.

110
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,230
The point is, Zooey, Peter always
connected better with women.

111
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,500
You know, I can see that
because he's a great boyfriend.

112
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,010
Thank you, fiancée.

113
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,340
Also, you gotta understand, Zooey.

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,440
Peter matured sexually
at a very early age.

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,510
I remember taking him swimming
when he was 12 years old.

116
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,610
Kid had a bush
like a 40-year-old Serbian.

117
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,480
Come on. Okay.
Dad, please, stop talking.

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
- Good to know.
- Nice.

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,130
Come on. He had a Speedo full of Brillo.
Be proud.

120
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,890
God.

121
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,730
Who invited the stand-up comedian
over here?

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Zooey, here's the deal.
Peter's always been a "girlfriend guy."

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,260
He put all his focus and energy
into his relationships,

124
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,670
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside.

125
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,610
Zooey, don't listen to him, all right?
I mean, we're eight years apart.

126
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,700
Barely grew up together
in the same house.

127
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,270
This is ridiculous.
Why is it weird that I had girlfriends?

128
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,080
Nothing. We're just saying
you never really had a best friend, is all.

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,420
- Well, who's your best friend?
- I have two.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,250
Hank Mardukas has been
my closest friend

131
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,520
since our first year at IBM.

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,460
- Best man at our wedding. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

133
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,330
Talk to him two, three times a week
on the phone for 30 years now.

134
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,130
And then there's Robbie.

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,490
What's up?

136
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,430
- Robbie is your other best friend?
- Correct. And Hank Mardukas.

137
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,410
What the shit is he looking at?

138
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,420
Davis Dunn Realty,
how may I direct your call? Please hold.

139
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,860
Hold, please. Put him through to Tevin.

140
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,960
It's very close to downtown.
How close do you wanna be?

141
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,200
Thank you, sweetheart.

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,600
I can't get you that close.
'Cause the schools are terrible.

143
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,770
The skyscrapers were all lit up.
I got down on one knee.

144
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,510
She was totally surprised.

145
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,380
Well, I'm jealous, Peter,
'cause you never gave me a shot.

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,550
But you're gonna
make the best husband.

147
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,780
Stop it. Stop.
All right, you can continue now.

148
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,890
Morning, Trayce.

149
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,060
- Hey, Tevin.
- Hey, man.

150
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,120
What's so funny?

151
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,460
One of the guys
in my fantasy football league

152
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,530
just sent me a QuickTime.

153
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,130
It's a grandma riding a Sybian machine.

154
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,540
What's that?

155
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,100
It's one of those vibrating saddles

156
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,810
that women sit on to give them,
like, super intense orgasms.

157
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,170
Check it out.

158
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,210
- Damn!
- How sick is that?

159
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,450
It's very. That's very sick.

160
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,990
So awesome.

161
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,450
Hey. So, what up, dog?
How's that Ferrigno dealio coming?

162
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,520
It's coming good. Yeah. I'm getting
ready to show in a couple of weeks.

163
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,430
Great.
Dude, I'm just gonna throw this out there

164
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,260
because it's a big piece of house.

165
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,570
If you want a copilot on this,
I'd be happy to team up with you.

166
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,940
No, I know. I feel like I wanna
give myself the challenge

167
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,480
- and just see how it goes...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,810
- I appreciate the offer.
- No sweat.

169
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,350
Hey, anyway, you know,
my girlfriend and I...

170
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,080
Well, we had this very special evening
planned, and I...

171
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,180
She's a squirter! She's squirting!
Peter, we got a squirter!

172
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,750
Old Faithful!

173
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,320
Hello, fiancée.

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,460
Hey, baby. I totally forgot.
It's my turn to host ladies' night.

175
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,170
No prob.
I have fencing practice, anyway.

176
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,100
I'll grab a beer with Gil and the boys
afterward. Hit them with the big news.

177
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,370
- Great! I gotta go. Love you.
- I love you, too.

178
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,170
Peter! Peter!

179
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,710
I'm sending it to you.

180
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,080
- No. I don't want it.
- You got it.

181
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,780
God!

182
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,810
Wait a minute, I didn't even click...
How does it... I didn't even click it on.

183
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,610
She's got a bush like a porcupine.

184
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,760
I don't wanna know anything
about her bush. Hi, Lynette.

185
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,200
- Suck it!
- Good bout, Gil. Sweet bout!

186
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,700
Good job.

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,040
Wow. Way to go, buddy.

188
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,640
- Great bout.
- Fuck off!

189
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,810
Bro, really sorry I lost my shit out there.

190
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,780
I just did not see that
In Quartata coming.

191
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,950
Hey, man, don't worry.

192
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,890
You know, you came in
with a pretty sweet glissade.

193
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,360
Anybody seen my manchette?

194
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,620
Did you look under your plastron,
dick wicker?

195
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,160
- Fuck you, Larry!
- Fuck you, Eugene.

196
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,430
- Classic.
- Thank you, Larry.

197
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,140
Hey, so you guys want to,
like, get some grub

198
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,260
or grab a beer or something?

199
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,970
We're actually heading up
to Joshua Tree tonight.

200
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,670
Oh, yeah? What's going on up there?

201
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,210
We're just doing this thing
for Eugene, you know.

202
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,240
Kind of a bachelor party/camping trip
kind of thing, you know.

203
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,510
I didn't even know
you were getting married.

204
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,380
Yeah. Taking the leap next Sunday.

205
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,690
- Great.
- Dirty little slut.

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,160
He's gonna lose his virginity finally.

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,290
I've fucked my girlfriend. He's kidding.

208
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,800
Right on! Very cool.
Very, very cool. That's cool.

209
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,470
I would've invited you, man.
I just didn't think that you'd be into it.

210
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,630
You never really come out with us
after practice and stuff.

211
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,970
Oh, no, dude... Don't even.

212
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,570
It's so fine. Really.
Thanks, though. Thank you, but...

213
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,140
You know, it's funny, actually.
I just got engaged myself.

214
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,240
- Wow. That's awesome.
- You did? Congratulations.

215
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,910
- Mazel tov.
- That's great.

216
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,650
Good luck with that.

217
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,590
- Thank you. And you, too.
- Thanks.

218
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,220
Yeah.

219
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,260
All right, well,
we should probably hit the road.

220
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,320
- Traffic.
- Yes.

221
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,690
- Have a blast.
- Shotgun.

222
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,260
- We'll be back on Wednesday, right?
- Yeah.

223
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,600
Play a U2 record while you're there.

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,570
- Good. 'Cause of Joshua Tree.
- That's right.

225
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,100
It's hilarious, know what I mean?

226
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,480
No, I'm serious.
You know what my favorite nights are?

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,220
Hanging out with you girls,
and I can do that guilt-free

228
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,090
because Barry loves hanging out
with his friends, too.

229
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,320
I mean, every weekend,
there's a golf getaway,

230
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,220
a ski trip, a weekend in Vegas.

231
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,860
Wait, Vegas? You're not worried
he's gonna cheat on you?

232
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,800
He's 40 pounds overweight
with a Jewfro and a small dick.

233
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,730
Look, I love the guy to death,
but I'm far and away

234
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,240
the best-looking woman
he's ever gonna get,

235
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,800
and I'm only a 7, so, come on.

236
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,100
Oh, my God. You're not a 7.

237
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,680
Peter's not a freakazoid.

238
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,780
I don't know, Zo.
I mean, I think this is kind of serious.

239
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,380
A guy without friends
can be really clingy.

240
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,830
Like, my brother-in-law
drives my sister crazy.

241
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,860
He's always like,
"When are you gonna be home?

242
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,630
"Where're you going?
Can I come with you?

243
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,460
"But nothing's on TV.
What am I gonna do?"

244
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,730
- That's... No, come on. What the...
- "Be home before midnight."

245
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,360
Peter's not like that. Please.
He's just not like that.

246
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,630
Well, just wait.

247
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,200
But anyway, you've got six bridesmaids
and a maid of honor.

248
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,470
It's gonna be a little weird
if we're walking down the aisle alone.

249
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,210
- Yeah, I know.
- He's great.

250
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,680
- So who's gonna be his best man?
- I have no idea.

251
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,780
I honestly think that his best friend
is his mom.

252
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,580
- Terrible.
- No, no, no. Not like that.

253
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,290
Peter?

254
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,890
Peter?

255
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,820
Honey?

256
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,260
Hey!

257
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,300
- Hey!
- Hey!

258
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,040
I made you guys some root beer floats.

259
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,170
Peter, are those chocolate straws?

260
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,270
Yeah. Pirouettes. Pepperidge Farm.

261
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,110
Thank you so much for the floats, baby.
That was so sweet.

262
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,210
My pleasure. Enjoy.

263
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,280
- Hey, congratulations on the wedding.
- Congratulations!

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,780
I know. It's so exciting.
I feel so grown-up.

265
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,190
- All right, sir.
- Okay, ma'am.

266
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,360
Okay.

267
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,030
Shit! Do you think he heard us?

268
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,290
- No.
- No way.

269
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,230
I gotta get some fucking friends.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,710
This is cool.
You're coming to me for help.

271
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,040
Well, the good news is
not only do I know men,

272
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,480
but straight guys are my specialty.

273
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,740
What does that mean?

274
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,980
I get bored pursuing gays.
I like to give myself more of a challenge.

275
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,540
- Yeah!
- Excuse me one second.

276
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,680
There you go, brother.
Dig deep, come on.

277
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,590
Push that shit out. Look at me,
I'm pinkies. I'm barely touching it.

278
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,820
You're clear. Locked it in, dude.
Nice job. Nice lift.

279
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,830
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

280
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,060
All right, I'll see you around.

281
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,620
I hope so.

282
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,870
- That guy was totally flirting with you.
- I told you.

283
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,510
And did you see his wedding ring?
Straight as an arrow.

284
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,610
I'm telling you, hooking up is easy.

285
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,620
Meeting platonic male friends,
not so much.

286
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,680
So, what do I do?
I mean, how do I meet friends?

287
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,310
It's such a weird concept.

288
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, I can do some recon
around the gym,

289
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,420
but you're gonna have to be
aggressive about this, man.

290
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,550
- Yeah, yeah.
- Use the Internet to meet guys.

291
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,000
Get Mom to fix you up.

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,360
I mean, if you see a cool-looking guy,
strike up a conversation

293
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,370
- and ask him on a man-date.
- A what?

294
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,030
- A man-date.
- Okay.

295
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,330
- You know what I mean?
- No.

296
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,740
By that, I mean a casual lunch
or after-work drinks, okay?

297
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,330
No dinner and no movies.

298
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,540
You're not taking these boys
to see The Devil Wears Prada.

299
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,910
God, I love that movie.

300
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,880
No, I won't. I got you.
I know what you mean.

301
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,380
This is really exciting.
We're gonna find you some friends.

302
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,650
- So I'm gonna... What do I do?
- You don't play much?

303
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,180
- I used to play a lot of Hearts in college.
- This is the same thing.

304
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,020
I don't even know why he called.
This guy hasn't even played poker.

305
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,530
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's Zooey's fiancé,

306
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,030
so just shut the fuck up and be nice.

307
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,660
Well, if I do this, we have sex
with the lights on when you get home.

308
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,200
- Really?
- Yeah. Like in Jamaica.

309
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
- Fine.
- All night long.

310
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
- Fine. Love you.
- All right.

311
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,840
My brother's a great guy, you know?
I mean, he's smart, he's...

312
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,850
Well, actually,
I don't know him that well,

313
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,480
but I'll give you five free sessions
if you take him out.

314
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,180
Go Beckham!

315
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,790
So glad Robbie hooked this up.
This is awesome! This is awesome!

316
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,660
- Me, too. This is really...
- Isn't this great, man? I love soccer!

317
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,560
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

318
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,630
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

319
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,570
Come on, Peter, stand up. Here we go...

320
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,830
Shut the fuck up!

321
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,210
All right, now people are really upset.

322
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,440
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

323
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,340
- You shut up!
- Hey, watch the game!

324
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,310
Honey, he just moved to LA.
He barely knows anyone.

325
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,780
He's an architect.

326
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,580
His mother says
he's so excited to meet you.

327
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,090
Robbie told me not to have dinner
with any of these guys.

328
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,560
Your brother's a crazy person.
One dinner won't kill you.

329
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,560
- Doug?
- Peter?

330
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,570
- So you just moved here, huh?
- I did. Pretty recently.

332
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,570
A couple of weeks.
Fresh off the boat from Chicago.

333
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,270
Chi-Town.

334
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,900
- Windy City.
- Oh, yeah.

335
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
Da Bears.

336
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,170
Those sports guys.

337
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,650
You know what else, the other old
Saturday Night Live one I love? The...

338
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,780
What's the one Dana Carvey does
with the old lady who's like...

339
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,160
- Church Lady?
- Yes! Yes!

340
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,090
"Isn't that special?"

341
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,160
"Isn't that special?"

342
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,730
That sounded
kind of more leprechaun-y.

343
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,670
- It did?
- It did a little. Like a leprechaun.

344
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,210
Nice to meet you, too, Mel Stein.

345
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,240
The picture's from
a couple of years back.

346
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,780
Have a seat. I'm so happy
to meet you in person, you know.

347
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,090
Me, too. How long have you been
using the Internet?

348
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,220
Three or four years.

349
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,820
I didn't know anything about it
until a couple of years ago.

350
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,860
- You're good at it now.
- Thank you.

351
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,870
- And the big dog!
- There it is!

352
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,160
Let me ask you guys.
Let me ask you guys.

353
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,670
Beatles, Stones. On a count of three.

354
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,400
- One, two, three. Beatles.
- All in.

355
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
- Fuck you.
- I don't care.

356
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,070
- All in.
- You're an idiot.

357
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,230
That's you, pal.

358
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,300
I will call in.

359
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,510
- Too much for me.
- You're in.

360
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,010
- Anybody else? Just me and you?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,740
That's it? Pot right? Trip queens.

362
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,810
- Nice.
- Three ladies. Three ladies.

363
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,650
- Nice hand.
- Finally. Fucking finally.

364
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,990
- Wait, let's see what he's got.
- Yeah, let's see what he's got.

365
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,080
I have nothing. I have five spades.

366
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,320
- That's a flush.
- Yes, one, two, three...

367
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,830
Flush!

368
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,060
He's a fucking asshole.

369
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,430
- Relax.
- I'm not gonna relax.

370
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,630
- What?
- I said you're an asshole, Peter.

371
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't take it too seriously.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,040
What are you staying in
with seven deuce suited?

373
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,310
With a fucking rainbow rag flop!
Take the fucking chips. I'm buying in.

374
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,810
- I'm sorry...
- Just give me some more chips.

375
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,310
I didn't know it was a rainbow.

376
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,080
- Is the wine treating you well?
- It opened up beautifully. Thank you.

377
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,020
- Excellent.
- Come on.

378
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,090
- Hot. Hot.
- Oh, my God.

379
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,390
- She's so hot.
- She's smoking.

380
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,490
All right, Pete,
you done a boat race, right?

381
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,000
- No.
- Just drink the fucking beer,

382
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,970
- and you'll get the hang of it.
- I've got it. I will...

383
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,520
Doesn't matter who's winning.

384
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,590
It comes down to you and me.

385
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,140
- It's gonna be anchors.
- We're the anchors.

386
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,140
- Let's boat... Let's boat race! Race it up!
- Ain't no luck in boat racing.

387
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,800
One! Two! Three! Go!

388
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,710
Come on, Pete! It's all you, Peter!

389
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,250
Go, go, go!

390
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,480
Take him down!

391
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,950
- One more time!
- Let's go!

392
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,720
Come on! Go, Barry!

393
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,850
- Barry! Damn it, Barry!
- Fuck!

394
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,530
Yes! In your face! In your...

395
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,260
Holy shit!

396
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,810
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of my house.

397
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,870
- I'm so sorry.
- Just get out of my fucking house.

398
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,510
- I'm sorry.
- This is not cool! Get the fuck out!

399
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,490
I gotta tell you, Doug,
I really enjoyed this.

400
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,250
You know, I've been out
with so many jerks recently.

401
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,190
It's nice to meet somebody
I can have an actual conversation with.

402
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,690
- Let's do it again.
- I'd love to.

403
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,530
Okay. Tomorrow night. Matsuhisa, 8:00.

404
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,220
- I will see you there, sir.
- Awesome.

405
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,440
You've been so busy.

406
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,350
I've hardly seen you
these past couple weeks.

407
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,320
I know. I've been crazy at work.

408
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,550
I'm happy to see you now.

409
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,830
- Have you been kissing someone?
- No.

410
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,240
Peter, your mouth tastes like an ashtray.

411
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,980
Yes. I went to dinner with this guy,
and he kissed me.

412
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,940
What the fuck are you talking about?

413
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,510
My mom set me up with this guy,

414
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,710
and he thought I was gay,
and it was just...

415
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,380
It was a whole misunderstanding.

416
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,290
- Your mom set you up with a guy?
- Yeah.

417
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,090
You told me you were going to dinner
with a client.

418
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,460
- No.
- What the hell is going on?

419
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,050
Look, I overheard you
talking to the other girls

420
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,000
on your girls' night and...

421
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,130
I knew it.

422
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,170
Look, I know that you're stressed out
that I don't have any close friends,

423
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,730
so I've been trying to meet someone.

424
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,810
Right, you've been...
Okay, so that explains a lot.

425
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,870
I thought it was so weird
that you wanted to hang out with Barry.

426
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,610
- Yeah, exactly. That guy's a dick.
- Yeah.

427
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,950
- I threw up in his face.
- Yeah, I know. Denise told me.

428
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,250
- I threw up in his... A lot.
- Yeah.

429
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,480
- Projectiled.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,990
- That's a real thing.
- Yeah.

431
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,090
Well, I don't think I'm gonna
meet anybody by June 30th,

432
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,220
so our wedding party's
gonna be a little uneven.

433
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,830
Peter, I don't care.
I just want you to be happy

434
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,600
and to stop kissing strange men.

435
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,470
Wow, it's really smoky in there.

436
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,240
Yeah, he got up in there.

437
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,870
- Tongue?
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,880
You wouldn't mind brushing your teeth,
would you?

439
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,780
No. I've already done it
a couple of times.

440
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,780
I'll do the mouthwash again.

441
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,190
- There's some Tom's in the top cabinet.
- No, I gotta go with chemicals on this.

442
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,460
- I love you.
- I love you, too. I might use Comet.

443
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,010
It's a pleasure to meet you.

444
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,150
I live down there.

445
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,290
I like it. I'm liking it.

446
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,920
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

447
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,520
It's a good space, you know?
It's a good vibe.

448
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,120
- Yeah? Terrific.
- Yeah.

449
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Well, when the Santa Anas
come through, it is majestic.

450
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,860
- Thanks.
- I'm excited.

451
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,960
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

452
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,090
Thank you.

453
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,200
- Hello.
- Hi.

454
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,170
- lf you need any help, just let me know.
- Thanks.

455
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,400
Sure.

456
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,550
Thank you for eating.

457
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,150
- I'm the first one, huh?
- Yeah.

458
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,250
I never understood why people
are so afraid to eat at an open house.

459
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,620
I know.

460
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Why's Ferrigno selling?

461
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,590
He bought a place in Jackson Hole.

462
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah, I think he's tired
of the Hollywood grind.

463
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,690
Right.

464
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,670
You know, I've always wanted a pad
with a giant Lou Ferrigno statue,

465
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,860
so I think I've found it.

466
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,140
He's got one.

467
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,270
You're wasting your time
with that couple. Just FYI.

468
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,340
Why do you say that?

469
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,140
I saw the guy pull in.
He's driving a Saab 9.3,

470
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,550
which, I'm not a snob, it's a great car,
but it costs $30,000.

471
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,950
This house must be,
what, 4, $4.2 million?

472
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,750
Doesn't quite compute, right?

473
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,090
Well, I hope that's not the case.
He told me he was gonna make an offer.

474
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,500
I think he's trying to impress that girl
he hasn't slept with yet.

475
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,230
- The feng shui.
- Yeah.

476
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,060
How do you know that?

477
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,170
Well, it's body language, you know?

478
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,840
Look, that guy needs to fart.

479
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,880
It's pretty clear,
but he doesn't know her well enough

480
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,540
to do it in front of her,
so I assume they haven't slept together.

481
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,050
- I like it. You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm good.

482
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,850
- He does seem to be clenching.
- Yeah, he doesn't wanna fart.

483
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,360
Watch. When he gets enough space,
he's gonna let one rip, I guarantee you.

484
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,450
That's a good move.

485
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,790
"Hey, go check out the kitchen, honey.
I'll meet you in there."

486
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,950
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now watch.

487
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,960
He's making his move slowly.
Slowly but surely. Watch the leg.

488
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,470
Wait for it. Wait for it. Fart.

489
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,770
- Boom. That's a fart, motherfucker.
- Oh, my God.

490
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,470
- That's a fucking fart.
- Oh, my God!

491
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,980
Look at him crop-dusting across
your open house. It's a disgrace.

492
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,210
- He farted in my open house.
- He sure did.

493
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,370
You know what, guy?

494
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,720
I like it, but I'm thinking
it might be a little bit small.

495
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,190
Totally, and it smells like fart.

496
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,520
- What?
- Never mind.

497
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,020
Let's take off, baby. Come on.

498
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,960
Roll down the windows
in that car, sweetheart.

499
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,050
You called that.
That was like a play-by-play.

500
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,360
That's amazing. You called that!

501
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,660
- Yeah. Well, I know my farts.
- Unbelievable.

502
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,360
Well, listen, just full disclosure.

503
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,570
I have no interest in buying this house.

504
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,070
Well, then why are you here?

505
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,080
To eat your free food
and to try to meet a divorcée.

506
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,540
- Are you serious?
- I am.

507
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,010
Yeah. I've found
that at the classy open houses,

508
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,550
the spread is usually pretty decent,

509
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,780
and there's a beautiful bevy of attractive
and newly-single women.

510
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,280
I don't know what to say.
Thank you for your honesty.

511
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,260
Thank you for the sun-dried tomato aioli,
because it's a revelation.

512
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,290
- Wow. Hey, thanks for noticing.
- Yeah.

513
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,300
All right,
I'm gonna take this panini for the road.

514
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,360
There's an open house in Bel Air that
promises to be replete with cougars.

515
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,430
- You don't wanna miss that.
- No, sir.

516
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,570
- It was nice to meet you. Yeah.
- You, too.

517
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,740
Hey, you know what, here,
let me give you my business card.

518
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,300
- All right.
- In case you're looking for,

519
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,610
you know, a new home or anything.

520
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,780
I actually specialize in smaller houses,
bungalows, that kind of thing.

521
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,910
- Lovely. Let me give you mine, as well.
- Okay.

522
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,750
- "Sydney Fife."
- That is my name.

523
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,880
There you go.

524
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,790
Well, thank you
for the great open house.

525
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,620
- My plezh. Okay.
- All right.

526
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,320
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too, Sydney.

527
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,530
Hello.

528
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,670
I can't just call him.

529
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,000
Why are you being such a chickenshit?

530
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,340
He gave you his card.
It's an open invitation.

531
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,780
Engage your core.

532
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,080
It's beach season. It's beach season.

533
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,450
I hate this.
There's no rules for male friendships.

534
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,710
What are you freaking out about?
You went out with those other guys.

535
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,220
- I'm really nervous about this one.
- 'Cause you really like him.

536
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,250
All right, buddy, great set.
Take five, I'll come rub you down.

537
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,890
Look, if he does call,
no more dinners, okay?

538
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,300
- It's sending the wrong message.
- I know, I know.

539
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,360
Hey, Peter! I got an extra ticket
to the Galaxy game tonight!

540
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,270
You know what? Thanks, man,
I'm sorry, I can't. I got a function.

541
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,300
I got season ticks.
I'll get you on the flip side. Here we go.

542
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,680
Hey, thanks a lot
for hooking me up with Elmo over there.

543
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,240
- That was a blast.
- What? That guy's cool.

544
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,440
Here we go. Here we go.
Come on, push it out.

545
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,790
Everything you got! Everything you got!
Everything you got!

546
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,630
Yeah.

547
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,470
Just to...

548
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,100
Hey... Pathetic.

549
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,040
Sydney, how you doing?
It's Peter Klaven.

550
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,470
Hey, Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.
We met at the open house last week.

551
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,380
Get some guts, would you?
I got some cheese. Give me a break.

552
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,150
No. Oh, my God.

553
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,720
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Carolyn.

554
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,260
Sorry.

555
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,800
Fife. You know what to do.

556
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,460
Hey, Peter. It's Sydney Klaven.
No, that's not right.

557
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,610
Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.

558
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,240
I met you last week at an open house,

559
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,910
and I had a showing and...

560
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:18,250
Anyway, I was wondering
if you ever wanted to get together

561
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,660
and talk about real estate and whatnot.
Or whatnot. And...

562
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,530
- Hey, sugar.
- Hey.

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,970
I'm sorry, I forgot what I was gonna say.
What was I saying?

564
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,950
Yes, the open house and we met...
Anyway, no rush.

565
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,750
You call me back
whenever you get a mo. Get a moment.

566
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,720
And we will talk when I talk to you.

567
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,190
All right.
Hope you're having a great day.

568
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,820
Okay. Bye, now.

569
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
Fuck.

570
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,140
I'm fine with a little mercury poisoning
as long as it means I get to eat raw fish,

571
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,910
'cause I love it so much.

572
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,170
My doctor said it's really bad
if you're trying to get pregnant.

573
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,810
I heard that.

574
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,210
Which Barry and I are doing.

575
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,490
Oh, my God, that's so exciting!

576
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,210
- I'm sorry.
- What?

577
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm sorry.
I just pictured you and Barry having sex.

578
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,150
And he's so big and you're so tiny,
and I just...

579
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,820
- Hailey...
- Like, I totally imagined Barry just like...

580
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,890
Okay, hold on, wait.

581
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,360
Why are you even imagining us
doing it anyway?

582
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,800
- I'm seeing it again.
- Well, stop! Stop! Cut it!

583
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,170
No, I love Barry.

584
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,530
- Hey!
- Hey!

585
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,470
- Hey! Hey!
- Hi!

586
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,910
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

587
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,270
I just had a meeting downtown
with the owners of the development site,

588
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,840
so thought I'd stop in
and say hi on my way back to the office.

589
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,310
So, Peter,
how's your little manhunt coming?

590
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,540
Really, you told them? Shocking.

591
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,020
Well, I mean, Barry and his friends

592
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,950
said they had a great time with you
the other night.

593
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,580
- Seriously?
- No.

594
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,020
Well, I just...
I don't drink that much and they pound.

595
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,190
They were pounding drinks.

596
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,790
Yeah, you're not used to drinking
that much.

597
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,960
Excuse me just a second.

598
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,520
Peter Klaven.

599
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,870
Excuse me just one...
Hey, Sydney. How are you?

600
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,430
Is that a man or a woman?

601
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,530
I don't know. I've never heard of Sydney.

602
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,610
I could be in Venice by 5:00, yeah.
I can do that.

603
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,780
It's a man-date. It's a man-date.
This is a man-date.

604
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,380
James' Beach Bar and Grill.

605
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,250
I look forward to it. Sounds great.

606
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,750
All right. I'll see you in a jiff.

607
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,230
- "See you in a jiff"?
- I don't know why I said that.

608
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,990
I've never said that expression before
in my life. I just said, "See you in a jiff."

609
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,660
Honey, you're all flustered.
Who was that?

610
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,800
It was just this guy
that I met at my open house.

611
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,860
- Sydney something or other.
- Sydney. I like it.

612
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,880
- Oh, my God. Peter's got a boyfriend.
- And I don't.

613
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,170
Oh, God, why does everything
have to be about you?

614
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,270
Because I'm single.

615
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,060
I'm meeting him right now.

616
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,290
Dude, no dinner.
He'll get the wrong idea.

617
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,860
You don't wanna get another
tongue-fucking at the valet stand.

618
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,870
Yes, Robbie, I promise. No dinner.

619
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,670
Dude, I'm pumped about this.
Call me when you get home.

620
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,900
Yeah!

621
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,100
Thank you, bro.

622
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,110
All right, so you break it off
with your ex-girlfriend...

623
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,150
Yeah, and I met Zooey
the very next day.

624
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,410
Man, no laj between the vag?

625
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,750
- What does that mean?
- No lag time between vaginas.

626
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,650
Yeah, no. I don't...

627
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,360
I mean, I didn't plan for it
to be like that, you know,

628
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,760
with no laj, but it just happened.

629
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,060
All right. How's the sex?

630
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,330
That's a little private, wouldn't you say?

631
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,340
Look, it's something we think about
on a second-to-second basis,

632
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,710
and yet we're not supposed
to talk about it? Why?

633
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,510
Well...

634
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,310
I guess no one's ever really asked me
before, but it's good. Sex is good.

635
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,350
- Oh, boy.
- What, "Oh, boy"?

636
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,010
Well, your voice went up
when you said that.

637
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,350
So?

638
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,260
It means you weren't
being entirely truthful.

639
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,700
Look, I don't know this girl,
so you can talk to me. What's the deal?

640
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,170
I don't know, I guess maybe sometimes
I wish that she enjoyed, you know...

641
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,670
- Getting it in the tush?
- No. No, no, no.

642
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,870
- That's my bad.
- Oral sex.

643
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,580
She doesn't like to put it in the mouth?

644
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,150
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
I don't even know you. Forget it. Look.

645
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,090
Zooey's awesome,
and we have a great sex life.

646
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,720
We really do. I can't...
I don't even know why I said that.

647
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,850
Because you're speaking honestly,
all right? Relax.

648
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,530
And what about you?

649
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,960
- You ever been married?
- No.

650
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,190
For what I'm looking for,
divorcées are perfect, you know?

651
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,240
They don't want anything serious,
and neither do I.

652
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,170
Well, hey, man.
You know, if it works for you.

653
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,230
Believe me, Pistol, it is the best.

654
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,370
- "Pistol"?
- Yeah. Pistol.

655
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,640
- Because you're Pete. So Pistol Pete.
- Pistol Pete.

656
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,780
Excuse me,
you guys finishing up here soon?

657
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,380
No, sorry, chief,
we're actually staying for dinner.

658
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,120
No, actually, I already have
a dinner plan with my fiancée.

659
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,420
No, dude, this place
has the best fish tacos in the world.

660
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,290
Literally. Ranked.
You gotta have one or two.

661
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,470
It's the pico de gallo, man.
Just use your hands.

662
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,560
We're barbarians after all, men.

663
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,130
Every once in a while,
I go down to the Boardwalk

664
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,270
and I just throw my own feces
like a gorilla.

665
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,210
You all right?

666
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,980
How can you disagree with me on this?
I mean, look, my...

667
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,750
It's bad for the whole world.

668
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,230
My lease is gonna be up and I think...

669
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,690
- Are you talking about hybrid cars?
- Yes. Yes.

670
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,160
I thought you were talking
about hybrid animals.

671
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,630
- Hybrid animals?
- Yeah.

672
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,400
What the fuck is a hybrid animal?

673
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,910
It took Andre the Giant a barrel of beer
to get drunk, sometimes two.

674
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,200
- "Hello, pretty lady."
- "Anybody want a peanut?"

675
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,380
Should we get a third order
of fish tacos?

676
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,180
Hands down,
best fish taco I've ever had in my life.

677
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,880
God, those tortillas were incredible.

678
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,250
Yeah, they make them in-house.
It sets up the flavor for the whole dish.

679
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,410
You know what?
I just realized something.

680
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,650
I never even asked you
if you were interested in buying a house.

681
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,090
No. No, why would I be?

682
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,350
Well, it's just when you called me back,

683
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,630
I didn't know if you wanted
to talk about real estate or not.

684
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,930
You just seemed like a good dude.

685
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,230
I thought I'd see if you wanted
to grab a beer. That's all.

686
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,790
I'm glad you called.

687
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,270
- You get home safe, Pistol.
- You got it, Joban.

688
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm sorry, what?

689
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,840
Nothing.

690
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,410
- No, what'd you say?
- I don't know.

691
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,050
You... You nicknamed me Pistol,
and I just called you Joban.

692
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,790
It means nothing. I don't...
I'm drunk. I'm gonna call a cab.

693
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,220
All right, man.
You have my number, yeah?

694
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,990
I got you stored in my iPhin.

695
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,870
- All right. If you need me, call, okay?
- Man, I'm golden.

696
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,600
- Yeah. All right, man.
- All right, bud.

697
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
Have a good night.

698
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,740
I don't know the number for a taxi.

699
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,890
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

700
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,450
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, we did. Yeah.

701
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,790
Sydney's a cool guy. Got kind of drunk.

702
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,130
- Really?
- Yeah, I had to take a cab home.

703
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,830
- Really? Did you...
- Throw up in his face?

704
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,960
- Yeah.
- No.

705
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,270
- Good.
- So that's good.

706
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,970
That's good. So is he your best man?

707
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,070
It's way too early to tell,
but it's very sweet of you to ask.

708
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,570
Go back to sleep.
I'll be in, in a second, all right?

709
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,350
I just wanna see
if I got any hits on Ferrigno.

710
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,540
Okay.

711
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,030
- Whoomp! There he is! There he is!
- Stop it. Stop it.

712
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,390
- Ass, ass and titties.
- Stop it. Fucking stop it.

713
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,900
- Fuck, I'm ticklish, Tevin.
- Okay. Uncle. Uncle.

714
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,590
Hey. How was the open hizzy?

715
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,430
- The what?
- The open house.

716
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,060
The open house. It was great.

717
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,870
- Yeah? Did you flip that bitch yet?
- Yeah.

718
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,140
No. I mean, I've had a few nibbles.
No bites.

719
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,010
Nibbles? Me no likey nibbles.

720
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,980
- Peter, can I talk to you as a friend?
- Sure.

721
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,210
You're dealing with the house
of a major Hollywood celebrity,

722
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,690
Mr. Louis Ferrigno,
The Hulk from television.

723
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,890
Of course. I know that.

724
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,260
How badly
do you wanna sell this house?

725
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,960
- I need to. You know, for...
- I know you need to.

726
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,360
You gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

727
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,960
You gotta network.
You gotta meet a lot of people.

728
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,470
You gotta get them some leave-behinds.

729
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,530
- I have brochures.
- Brochures are totally different, okay?

730
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,870
- How?
- You see this picture right here?

731
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,380
- Yeah.
- Do you know who took it?

732
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,170
- No.
- M. Night Shyamalan,

733
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,650
the director of The Village.

734
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,120
- Okay.
- What's your bus-bench ad situation?

735
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,020
- I don't have any.
- What about urinal cakes?

736
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,580
- How about urinal cakes?
- Do you use them?

737
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,590
- When I pee.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

738
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,320
Go into any Olive Garden,
P.F. Chang's Chinese Bistro,

739
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,760
T.G.I. Friday's, Fuddruckers.

740
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,960
What do they have in the bathroom?
Urinal cakes with my face on it.

741
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,740
Does it... I don't see how that would...

742
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,500
I've had people come up to me
on the streets and say,

743
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,040
"I know you from somewhere."

744
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,080
"Yeah, you do.
You pissed on my face, friend."

745
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,610
I don't see how
having somebody piss on my face

746
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,080
is gonna be able to sell
Lou Ferrigno's house.

747
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,780
Peter, you got the steak,
but I got the sizzle, my nizzle. Right?

748
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,980
Why don't we split the listing. Okay?

749
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,620
Let me wet my beak on this action.
We'll both be winners.

750
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,660
I appreciate it, but I'd really like to try
and do this myself.

751
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,820
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'm just putting on my friend hat here.

752
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,890
- I appreciate it. All right.
- Whoomp! There he is!

753
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,000
- Oh, jeez.
- Watch yourself, big girl.

754
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,120
- Fife.
- Hey, Sydney. It's the Pistol.

755
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,450
Who?

756
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,550
Peter Klaven from
the James' Beach thing the other night.

757
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,630
Hey, yeah, what's going on, man?

758
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,060
Yeah. Not much. I'm working like a dog.

759
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,060
But, you know, usual... The yoozh stuff.

760
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,630
I was just calling to say, hey,
I had a great time the other night.

761
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,910
Yeah, I had a nice time, man.
Those fish tacos are the tits.

762
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,510
Yeah, you know, if you ever wanna
grab lunch or something, nothing major.

763
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,110
Yeah. Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna take my puggle

764
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,050
for a little jaunt
on the Venice Boardwalk.

765
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,380
- You should come meet me.
- All right. Yeah, great.

766
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,980
Cool. Why don't you meet me
at Muscle Beach at like,

767
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,290
- I don't know, in a half an hour?
- Muscle Beach, half an hour.

768
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,090
I will see you there,
or I will see you on another time.

769
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,070
That was very confusing.
I don't know if you're gonna come or not.

770
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,630
- No, I'll be there. I'll be there.
- All right, I'll see you then, buddy.

771
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,610
All right. Laters on the menjay.

772
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,840
What did I just say?

773
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,540
He's a cross
between a beagle and a pug.

774
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,780
- The most beautiful dog in the world.
- He's cute. What's his name?

775
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,180
Anwar Sadat,

776
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,350
after Anwar Sadat,
former president of Egypt.

777
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,020
Right.
Because you're a fan of his policies or...

778
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,620
No, because they look exactly alike.

779
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,030
Hey, so how's Ferrigno coming?
You got any offers yet?

780
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,570
Not yet, no.

781
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,770
This guy that I work with, Tevin Downey,
he wants to share the listing with me.

782
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,340
What? And split the commission?

783
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
What about the land
you told me you wanted to buy?

784
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,640
It would put a delay on that,
but I gotta sell the place, you know?

785
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,580
Tevin's a total cheeseball,
but he markets himself like crazy.

786
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,180
He's on bus-bench ads all over town.

787
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,750
You know,
he says the place is out of my league.

788
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,660
Hey, that is bullshit. All right?

789
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,920
That open house was understated.
It was classy and elegant.

790
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,160
I've been to a million of those things
and nobody,

791
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,860
nobody puts out
rosemary flatbread paninis.

792
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,400
Now hold on, my dog needs to shit.

793
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,630
Well, I'm trying to sell the place,
believe me, but...

794
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,370
Hey, no, Pete.
Trying is having the intention to fail.

795
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,780
You gotta scrap that word
from your vocab.

796
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,540
Say you're gonna do it and you will.

797
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,910
Come on, buddy. Good boy.

798
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,710
- You need a plastic bag or...
- No, I don't clean up after my dog.

799
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,550
Dog poop is like a compost.

800
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,560
It's got a ton of nutrients
that enrich the soil.

801
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,850
But we're on pavement.

802
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,990
God damn it!
How about cleaning up after your dog?

803
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,190
You mind your own fuckhole!

804
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,470
What the fuck? Psycho.

805
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,740
What was that?

806
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,940
I'm a man, Peter.

807
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,850
I've got an ocean of testosterone
flowing through my veins.

808
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,650
Society tells us to act civilized,
but the truth is we're animals,

809
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,310
and sometimes you gotta let it out.
Try it.

810
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,450
I'm not gonna start screaming
in the middle of the Venice Boardwalk.

811
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,990
Come with me.

812
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,690
- This is silly.
- Indulge me.

813
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,730
That was really good.

814
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,700
Now gently remove your tampon
and try again.

815
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,270
Respect the process.

816
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,270
Why do you wanna mock the process?

817
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,680
- Because it doesn't do anything.
- No.

818
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,620
If you don't yell,
I'm gonna punch you in your stomach.

819
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,290
That was really good, man.
That was terrifying.

820
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,290
You just scared my dog.

821
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,700
- Yeah? You feel better?
- Yeah.

822
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,900
- Want to get a corn dog?
- Yeah!

823
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,270
Let's go.

824
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,320
...the span of this, like, I don't know,
30 pages. It's insane. It's crazy.

825
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,480
I know. I read it in college, and I loved it.

826
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,490
What a great house.

827
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,530
Thanks, man.
Yeah, come check out the back.

828
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,790
Yeah.

829
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,930
- This is a bumper car I got on eBay.
- Wow.

830
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,430
I was in a bidding war
with CarnivalKid 32,

831
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,300
so I had to go on the "Buy It Now" price,
but I got it.

832
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,930
- Coolness.
- And you remember Marlena.

833
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,030
Hey, Lenish.

834
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,800
Now let's check out
the pièce de résistance, bitch.

835
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,570
I wanna do it. Separate garage.

836
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,740
- Mr. Klaven.
- Very nice.

837
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,480
Welcome to the Temple of Doom.

838
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,480
Holy shit, Sydney. This place is insane.

839
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,050
Holy fuck. Oh, my God.

840
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,150
- Thanks, man. I try.
- This is amazing.

841
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,250
- Thank you, sir.
- You got some TVs.

842
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,950
I do. I do.

843
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,960
Photographs.

844
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,860
- Beer?
- I'll snake a brew.

845
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,170
- Put on some tunes.
- Is that you?

846
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,170
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me in ninth grade, man.

847
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,940
- Are you that little kid?
- Yeah, I was a late bloomer.

848
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,640
"Wrecking Crew."

849
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,140
- Come and take a load off, bud.
- Oh, man.

850
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,840
Pop a squizz nut.

851
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,610
What's going on over there?

852
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,190
This is where I jerk off.

853
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,120
And the condoms?

854
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,060
- I wear them when I masturbate.
- Are you kidding me?

855
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,660
I always get this reaction,

856
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,600
but the fact is they decrease sensitivity
so I can last longer.

857
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,370
And there's no sticky mess to clean up.

858
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,610
And when your divorcées come over,
you put them away?

859
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,880
Pete, this is the man cave.
There's no women allowed in here.

860
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,680
I got a jerk-off station, for God's sakes.

861
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,250
Sit down, man.

862
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,720
What about when your guy friends
come over? Aren't you embarrassed?

863
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,390
Masturbation is a part of life, Pete.
Dudes masturbate. So do chicks.

864
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,460
You never talked about masturbating
with your friends?

865
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,130
- No, I haven't.
- All right.

866
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,190
When was the last time you did it, Pete?

867
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,430
I'm not gonna tell you that.

868
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,240
Hey. Listen, you think of this place
as a Cone of Silence, all right?

869
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm not gonna tell anybody
any of the things you say in here.

870
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,970
You have my word.

871
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,380
Zooey went to the Pasadena flea market
with her friends last weekend,

872
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,250
and I did it then.

873
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,220
Well, that sounds lovely.

874
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,850
What'd you use? Internet or DVD?

875
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,060
How do you get me
to tell you these things?

876
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,360
Come on.

877
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,960
I used a picture of Zooey in a bikini

878
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,230
that I took when we were on vacation
in Cabo San Lucas.

879
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,430
Wait, you jacked off
to a picture of your own girlfriend?

880
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,000
You... That... Wow. That is sick.

881
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,810
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

882
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,940
What's wrong with that?

883
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,510
Pedro, there is so much wrong with that,
I don't even know where to begin. It's...

884
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,620
- That is sick, man.
- Someone's ears were burning.

885
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,720
Heard you say you jacked off
to her picture, sicko.

886
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,130
Hey, babe.

887
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,570
Good. Yeah, I'm over here at Sydney's.
We're just chillaxing.

888
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,570
We're in the chill station.

889
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,430
Yeah, I'm kind of playing hooky
from work.

890
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,700
No, I'll see you at home later on.

891
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,670
Love you, too. Bye-bye.

892
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,510
Hey, why'd you tell her
you bailed from work?

893
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,280
I didn't wanna lie to her.

894
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,010
You're one of the most honest people
I've ever met. You can understand that.

895
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,450
Yeah, I never lie to women,

896
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:32,120
but, I mean, there are some things
I choose not to share with them.

897
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,020
- I don't really see the distinction.
- Really?

898
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,590
So you've told Zooey that you jacked off
to her picture last weekend.

899
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,790
Well, no, but...

900
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,460
All right. Well, you shared
that information with me, didn't you?

901
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,530
So there are dividing lines.
That's all I'm trying to say.

902
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,130
Like, I love to take a girl out to dinner,

903
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,070
but I'm not gonna go golf 18 holes
with her.

904
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,010
You know what? Zooey and I played golf
together a couple of months ago.

905
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,740
- It was really fun.
- That sounds like a fucking nightmare.

906
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,910
What do you play?

907
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,110
I play a little bit of everything,
but if I had to narrow it down to one,

908
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,120
I guess I'd say I'm an axman.

909
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,190
- Sweet. Guitar.
- What about you? You play anything?

910
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,930
I used to slap the bass
in a high school jazz band.

911
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,760
- All right.
- Rush. I love Rush.

912
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,960
Dude, Rush is the greatest band
of all time.

913
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,130
Yeah, no, how about of all time?
All time.

914
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,580
You know what? We should
jam together sometime, man.

915
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,310
Yeah. Totally.

916
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,510
Totes McGotes. Cool.

917
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,290
Well, you know what?
I should probably hit it to it.

918
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,590
All right, yeah.
I gotta get to bed early, anyway.

919
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,070
I'm doing a big day hike
with my buddies in Malibu tomorrow.

920
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,690
Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. It was a really...
It was a good hang.

921
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,900
- Yeah.
- Sweet, sweet hanging.

922
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,670
- Well, adiós, Pistol.
- Take it easy, Siddy Slicker.

923
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,510
- I'm sorry.
- What?

924
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,680
I called you Siddy Slicker.

925
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,540
- That sucks.
- No, it was pretty close.

926
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,780
It's a lame nickname.

927
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,080
I thought it was good.
It was better than Joban.

928
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,320
Yeah, right. I'm gonna get it.
I'll get a better one.

929
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,190
- Dude, it was fine.
- I'm gonna get you.

930
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,320
- Get out of here. Get out of here.
- I'm gonna get you, sucka.

931
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,200
Later on, my...

932
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,240
Peter, I have a Lou Ferrigno for you
on line three.

933
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,910
Put him through.

934
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,020
Mr. Ferrigno. Hey, it's Peter Klaven.

935
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,060
Peter, what the hell's going on?

936
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,890
Yeah. If you just go past the first area
to the left, he's right there.

937
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,020
- Sure. What's your name?
- Leanne.

938
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,160
Leanne. That was my mother's name.

939
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,170
- Really?
- I don't know. Was it?

940
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,430
Peter, it's been on the market
for three weeks...

941
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,230
- Yes.
- ... and we haven't gotten one offer.

942
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,300
And that's why we're having another
open house this weekend.

943
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,170
Hello, mystery woman.

944
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,510
I think it was very beneficial,
very beneficial.

945
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,410
Beneficial? It was beneficial?

946
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,420
So you're telling me
we're gonna sell this house?

947
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,180
Absolutely,
and I've gotten many nibbles this week.

948
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,310
- Nibbles?
- Yes, sir.

949
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,980
It's all about food with you, Peter.

950
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,550
No one cares about
the stupid sandwiches you put out.

951
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,560
No, sir. No, I absolutely agree with you.

952
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,570
You want to sell a house
and not a panini.

953
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,470
- Paninis? Paninis?
- Yes, sir.

954
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,590
Don't make him angry.

955
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,660
Enough with the cold cuts,
the condiments.

956
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,400
- You wouldn't like him when he's angry.
- What the hell you think this is?

957
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,170
No, I understand.
It's an open house and not a deli.

958
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,370
- Peter? Hello? You need to focus.
- Yeah. Yep. I think...

959
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,310
- I think...
- Let people know my house is for sale.

960
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,550
Forget about the sandwiches
and focus on selling my fucking house.

961
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,610
- Let's do this, okay?
- Yes, sir.

962
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,780
- Okay?
- Okay.

963
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,620
- Goodbye.
- All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

964
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,460
You all right?

965
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,460
- Hulk busting your balls?
- Yeah.

966
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,900
- What are you doing here?
- My blood bank's a few blocks away.

967
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm AB negative. It's extremely rare,
so I try to donate every couple of weeks.

968
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,510
That's really nice, Sydney.

969
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,600
There's also this nurse there
who I wanna fuck so badly.

970
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,650
Oh, boy, here we go.
Should have guessed.

971
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,580
Hey, weren't you supposed to go hiking
with your friends today?

972
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,280
Yeah, a couple of them had to bail,
but we'll reschedule.

973
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,550
Anyway, listen, I got a house full
of leftover Koo Koo Roo,

974
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,560
so I was thinking maybe you
and me could go grab some lunch

975
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,990
and squeeze in a little jam session?

976
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,360
Leftover Koo Koo Roo?

977
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,120
Well, that sounds
about as appetizing as

978
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,000
a big pile of...
A plate of dirt, or something.

979
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,770
I'm... I was... I'm kidding.

980
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah. I still want to hang out
despite that joke.

981
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,910
- That was a bad joke.
- Yeah. You're better than that.

982
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,150
That's it.

983
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,090
- How's that feel?
- It feels tasty.

984
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:06,430
- Yeah? You sound pretty good, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

985
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,020
Here we go.

986
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,540
Wow, that's a good one, bud.

987
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,180
Hey, check out these two.

988
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,880
I call them bowsers. It's my nickname
for people who look just like their dog.

989
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,020
Good boy.

990
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,030
Bowsers?
Where'd you come up with that?

991
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,650
It sounded right.

992
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,260
Shit. Hey, geek!
I just stepped in your dog's shit.

993
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,570
Now I'm gonna make you eat it.

994
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,570
Peter, run!

995
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,140
- Yeah!
- Take it.

996
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,680
It's a bit of a throwback, but it comes
with the built-ins. It's wired for sound.

997
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,910
This is fun.
This is a pair of jeans that he actually...

998
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,980
This house is exquisite.

999
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,020
I'd like to make an offer.

1000
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,030
What do you think, hon?

1001
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,440
Yeah, I don't like that,
but for the most part, I mean...

1002
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,870
- Take it.
- Really?

1003
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,440
Yeah, take it.

1004
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,720
Sydney, what's up, man?

1005
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,110
What happened? What?

1006
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,310
Shut up! No.

1007
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,350
Did it smell weird? Is it discolored?

1008
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,830
Shut the fuck up!

1009
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,300
So how long have you guys
known Sydney?

1010
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,670
- It feels like forever.
- What?

1011
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,010
Remember that time
we tripped acid together

1012
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:02,640
- and he made us watch the news?
- That was a remarkable night.

1013
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,740
- Dude. Dude. Don't. Dude.
- Don't be scared.

1014
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,010
- Stop it. Stop it. Drive! Drive!
- Don't lean! Don't lean!

1015
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,780
Yeah, Pistol.

1016
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,490
Dude, Peter is on fire.

1017
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,920
- Boo-yah! Yeah!
- Fuck me raw!

1018
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,020
That's what I'm talking about.

1019
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,400
- Sweet lunge, Peter.
- Yeah, Pete.

1020
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,630
Suck it, Gil!

1021
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,540
I love it!

1022
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,700
Marvin Berry.

1023
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,040
"You remember
that new sound you were looking for?"

1024
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,750
Pete!

1025
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,530
- Are you all right?
- My fucking ass.

1026
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,590
- Hey, you did great today though, man.
- You did. You made it up.

1027
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,190
- I made it to the top. First time.
- Good job, bro.

1028
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,770
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you guys.

1029
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,700
- All righty, Syd.
- Wait, where you going?

1030
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,930
It's Sunday night.
Tina's nephews are coming over.

1031
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,140
We're gonna watch
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1032
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,180
No, it's just, I thought
we were all gonna have dinner together,

1033
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,040
so I ordered us a 6-foot sub.

1034
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,810
But I gotta bolt, too. I promised the kids
I'd take them to Cheeseria.

1035
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,940
A little pizza action.

1036
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,350
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna be stuck
at home grading papers tonight,

1037
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,250
but thanks anyway. All right?

1038
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,810
Fun day, guys.

1039
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,020
- Pete?
- Man, you know, on Sunday night,

1040
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,260
Zooey and I usually watch HBO.

1041
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,460
Right. Yeah, yeah, of course. Cool.

1042
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,660
But I can't let you eat
a 6-foot sub all by yourself.

1043
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,190
- Do you want some?
- No,

1044
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,430
I had like a foot and a half
back at Sydney's. I'm golden.

1045
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:40,210
So, what do you guys do for, like,
seven straight hours?

1046
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,480
Whatever. I mean, like, we'll just
hang out, you know. Shoot the shit.

1047
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,280
Sometimes we jam a little bit.

1048
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,410
- You play an instrument?
- Yeah.

1049
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,350
I can't believe I've never told you.
I play bass.

1050
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,750
- Really?
- Yeah. I slap the bass big time.

1051
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,990
What do you... What is that?
You sound like a leprechaun.

1052
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,790
- No, that's a reggae guy.
- What is that?

1053
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,800
- I just did reggae.
- It doesn't sound...

1054
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,090
- It doesn't sound reggae?
- No.

1055
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,100
- Slap the bass.
- No.

1056
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,040
- How does it...
- It's like, big time, big time.

1057
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,070
- Big time.
- Big time. Slap the bass big time.

1058
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,540
Slap the bass.

1059
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,040
- That sounded like Borat.
- Yeah.

1060
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,670
- Slap the bass. Big time.
- That's better. That's better.

1061
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,610
Syd and I have gotten pretty good
at a couple of Rush songs.

1062
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,850
What do you mean, like,
fast-paced rock?

1063
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,580
No, like, Rush. Like the band Rush.

1064
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,060
- I don't know them. The...
- The holy triumvirate.

1065
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,250
- Wait, you don't know Rush?
- No.

1066
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,850
- You don't know Rush, the band?
- No.

1067
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,870
- "Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer"?
- No!

1068
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:39,130
All right, I'm gonna hit you up
with a little iTunes acción.

1069
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,230
I cannot believe
you've never heard Rush.

1070
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,570
So when am I gonna meet this guy
who's stolen you away from me?

1071
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,770
Pretty soon, actually.

1072
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,140
I invited him
to that little engagement party

1073
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,510
my parents are throwing for us.

1074
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,450
Wow, Peter! This is serious.

1075
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,010
It's mellow. Besides,
I wanted to introduce him to Hailey.

1076
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,850
- That's interesting. Yeah, I like that.
- Right?

1077
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,860
Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you ready to get your world rocked?

1078
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,120
Ready! Yes.

1079
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,930
- Are you ready to get your mind blown?
- Do it!

1080
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,430
Do you want to get some Neil Peart
all up in you?

1081
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,930
I don't know.

1082
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:13,500
Well, prepare to be Rushified!

1083
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,810
- Sounds better on big speakers.
- I could see that.

1084
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,020
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

1085
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,460
- Do you do it that high when you do it?
- Well, in real life, I do it low.

1086
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,330
- But air bass works best up here.
- Right.

1087
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,000
This is exactly what I look like
when I jam out, man.

1088
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,040
When I jam with my bass.

1089
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,600
Slap the bass, man.

1090
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,670
- There you go. There you go.
- I'm slapping the bass, man.

1091
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,610
Slap the bass, man. I slap the bass.

1092
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,840
Please don't do that.

1093
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,980
- Slap the bass.
- Please?

1094
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,350
Slap the bass.

1095
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,850
- For the sake of our relationship.
- Slap that bass.

1096
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:07,380
Please stop. Please. Please stop!
Thank you.

1097
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,360
I'm slapping the bass.

1098
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,230
I'm so glad
you're celebrating at my restaurant.

1099
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,200
Of course, Mr. Chu.
We wouldn't go anywhere else.

1100
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,930
Hey, this is my brother, Robbie.
Robbie, this is Sydney.

1101
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,640
- Hey, Bro Namath.
- Nice. Nice to meet you.

1102
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,150
- Peter, you remember Alan.
- From the gym.

1103
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,570
- Yeah, hey, man.
- Hi, good to see you again.

1104
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,520
- Alan, I'm Sydney.
- Sydney, nice to meet you.

1105
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,710
It's a pleasure, man.

1106
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,150
All right.
We're gonna grab some drinks.

1107
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:41,220
- Cool, sweet.
- All right. Show them your stuff, fellas.

1108
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,160
- Hi.
- Hey.

1109
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,290
Zooey, this is Sydney.
Sydney, this is my fiancée, Zooey.

1110
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:51,630
Sydney, I'm so happy to meet you.
I've heard so many great things.

1111
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,030
Same here. And let me tell you,

1112
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,270
this guy, he's gaga over you.
It's adorable.

1113
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,400
- Honestly.
- It's true. It's true.

1114
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,810
- It's true.
- Guilty as charged.

1115
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,400
Hailey. Hailey.

1116
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,340
Sydney, this is my oldest friend
in the world, Hailey.

1117
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,610
- All right.
- Hi. I'm good.

1118
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,250
You didn't ask, but I'm good.

1119
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,090
- Nice to meet you, Sydney.
- It's a pleasure.

1120
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,190
Great. I told you we were early.

1121
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,730
- Would you shut up?
- It's supposed to be...

1122
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,390
The minute we get in
you have to start bitching already?

1123
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:20,690
- You told me it was a drop-by.
- You know what?

1124
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,260
- This isn't a drop-by.
- This is not a drop-by.

1125
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,960
It's a damn engagement party.
What is wrong with you?

1126
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,020
Can I have a Belvedere on the rocks,

1127
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,090
- please?
- You're such an asshole.

1128
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,600
Could you just shut up
and not talk to people tonight?

1129
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,730
And something
with sour mix in it for her.

1130
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:30,470
I'm sorry they didn't cater this to you
and your liking.

1131
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,700
- Hey, guys.
- No...

1132
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,740
- Hi, you look beautiful!
- Hey.

1133
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,400
- Hello, sweetie. How you doing, baby?
- Hi.

1134
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,950
- Thanks for coming.
- Hi.

1135
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,610
- You guys know each other.
- How you doing? Yeah, we do.

1136
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,910
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So...

1137
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,780
- What do you got there?
- Sex on the beach. Yeah.

1138
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,220
You never know! Gotta be prepared.

1139
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,850
- The possibility.
- Wow.

1140
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,290
I'm just saying, you know.

1141
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,460
- What is going on over there?
- Yeah, let me tell you.

1142
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,970
- Is that her date?
- I'll give you the whole lowdown.

1143
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,470
Should we...

1144
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,440
What's up?

1145
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,580
Hey, I don't remember.
Do you play an instrument?

1146
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,480
- No.
- Because Syd and I, my buddy Sydney,

1147
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,850
- we've been jamming a lot...
- I don't play any instruments.

1148
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,790
I slap some bass,
and then Sydney's an axman.

1149
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,950
'Cause I was gonna say
if you wanted to jam with us,

1150
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,920
you know, that'd be cool.
But you don't have...

1151
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,930
You have a piano in your house, though,
don't you?

1152
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:27,490
- Yeah, I don't play.
- Really? Why do you have a piano?

1153
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,860
The decorator put it there.

1154
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,700
Your... Does he... I thought...
No one plays?

1155
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,070
- I'm gonna go check on the table.
- All right. Yep.

1156
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,730
- Hi. I'm Denise.
- Hi.

1157
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,040
- Denise.
- I'm Zooey's friend.

1158
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,240
I've heard so much about you.

1159
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,510
- It smells like a fucking pet shop in here.
- Hi. How are you? Okay.

1160
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,780
- Mrs. Klaven, the banquet room is ready.
- And who's Mr. Sunshine here?

1161
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,050
Hi. This is my husband, Barry.

1162
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,520
Come on back, everybody.
The banquet room is ready.

1163
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,020
Well, I'm filling myself up.
I need to undo my pants.

1164
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,950
There's a lot of protein, but I love it.

1165
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,200
If I may, I think it's only fitting
that we're eating tonight at Hop Louie's

1166
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,900
because this is, after all,

1167
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,870
Peter's favorite restaurant
to bring all of his dates.

1168
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,740
So of course he would bring Zooey here
their first night out.

1169
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,010
- Just like the rest of them.
- No.

1170
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,810
I remember that night when Peter
got home, he called me and he said,

1171
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,880
"Mom, this is the girl I'm gonna marry."

1172
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,190
And it's not just because she wanted
an extra order of slippery shrimp.

1173
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,790
On the first date?

1174
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,020
- Hey, now.
- Sometimes.

1175
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,230
But the point is,
here we are eight months later.

1176
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,430
Peter, Zooey,

1177
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,840
we love you,

1178
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,510
and we wish only the best for you both.

1179
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,410
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1180
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,970
- To Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1181
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,140
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Mom.

1182
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,550
- Cheers, bro.
- Thanks.

1183
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,610
Well, I promised Denise
we'd be gone after appetizers, so...

1184
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,990
You know what?
I'd actually like to just say a few words

1185
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,550
- if it's cool with the table.
- Wow.

1186
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:12,430
What an honor it is to be sitting here
with Peter and Zooey's friends, family,

1187
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:17,600
Hailey, Robbie's lover,
Robbie, Oz, Joyce.

1188
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,580
Thank you
for hosting this beautiful dinner.

1189
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,610
You got this guy
with the smoking hot wife.

1190
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,980
And finally, we got Zooey.

1191
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,350
Zooey, you are about to marry
one of the most honest,

1192
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:36,330
kind and fun-loving people
I've ever had the honor of knowing.

1193
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,520
The Pistol is a pleasure-giver,
that's for sure.

1194
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah. A fucking puke pistol.

1195
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,590
And the thing about a man like that,
a man like Peter,

1196
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,760
is that he never asks
for anything in return,

1197
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,810
and that's why I'm here.

1198
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:55,010
I'm here as Peter's friend,
as Peter's confidant,

1199
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,920
just to say to you, beautiful Zooey,

1200
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,350
give it back. Yeah?

1201
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,420
Return the favor.

1202
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,590
And if you do,

1203
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:20,540
I guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasure-filled union.

1204
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,970
- I don't think she sucks his dick.
- Watch your mouth.

1205
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,770
With that, I'd like to raise a glass
to Pete and Zooey.

1206
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,010
Cheers.

1207
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,610
- Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1208
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,290
What the hell did you tell Sydney
about me?

1209
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,590
Nothing.

1210
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,900
I mean, aside from how much I love you.

1211
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,160
So, what was with all that
pleasure-giver stuff?

1212
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,330
I don't...

1213
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,730
I might have mentioned in passing
or something

1214
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:58,040
that you don't like doing oral sex.

1215
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,200
- Peter, that stuff is private.
- Is it? Really?

1216
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,110
And telling Hailey and Denise
about the hot tub in Mexico isn't?

1217
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,810
- That is so different. They're...
- What? How?

1218
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,650
- I've known them forever.
- So?

1219
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,550
Peter, see, Sydney's like a stranger.

1220
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,590
Hardly. He's become
a really good friend of mine,

1221
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:16,560
and now you know how I feel
when there's no privacy

1222
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,600
- between you and your girlfriends.
- I thought you loved those guys.

1223
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,960
I do, I love them, but, you know,

1224
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,200
some things I want to remain
between you and me.

1225
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,400
Okay. Okay.

1226
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,000
By the way,
it's not that I don't like doing it.

1227
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,180
It's just that
Rodney just hated getting them.

1228
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,790
Wait, what guy hates getting blowjobs?

1229
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,590
He had some weird
intimacy problems, okay?

1230
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:52,660
By the end of our relationship, he would
literally shiver when I touched him.

1231
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:56,060
But before that, I always liked it.

1232
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,300
I liked it.

1233
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,230
Great. That's great.

1234
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,480
Perfect. I mean, no pressure.
It's not like I'm saying,

1235
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,780
"Hey, let's go home tonight
and get some BJs." But, you know...

1236
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,750
Look, if Sydney hadn't asked me
about our sex life,

1237
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,150
we wouldn't even be talking about this.

1238
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,920
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1239
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,460
You're right.

1240
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,850
- And Hailey was really into him.
- She was?

1241
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,160
Yeah, she liked how honest
and direct he was with her.

1242
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,560
And, yeah, I know, that's the way he is.
That's his thing.

1243
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,700
- The four of us should go out.
- Yeah. That'd be great.

1244
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,900
Yeah.

1245
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,440
Sweet.

1246
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,770
- Well, have a good Pilates class.
- I will.

1247
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,410
- Be sure to drink lots of water.
- Yeah.

1248
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

1249
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,410
- Hey, Pete, let's go out back, yeah?
- Yeah.

1250
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,960
- She was very nice-looking.
- Yeah, I fucked her.

1251
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,290
I wonder if my pineapple
matches your pineapple.

1252
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,270
Hey, you want to check?

1253
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,360
Nope. Yours is short and fat
and mine is long and skinny.

1254
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:10,830
Yeah.

1255
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,900
Pete, can I talk to you about something?

1256
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,440
- Yeah, what's up?
- Will you put down your treat

1257
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,040
for a minute?

1258
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:24,420
I feel really horrible about that toast
I gave at your engagement dinner.

1259
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,010
It was ridonculous.

1260
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,460
I was really excited to meet Zooey
and your family,

1261
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,760
and then I showed up there
and I was just... I got so nervous.

1262
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,560
It wasn't so great.

1263
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,360
I want you to know I'm really sorry.
Everybody must hate me.

1264
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,000
No, no, no.
Look, you had good intentions.

1265
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,130
- I did.
- I know one person that didn't hate you.

1266
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:46,140
Was it Benji's wife?
She's a hot piece of ass.

1267
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,080
- No, Hailey.
- Yeah. She was funny.

1268
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,420
I think she likes you.
We should all go out.

1269
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,610
She seems great, Pete, but honestly,
within five minutes of meeting her,

1270
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:58,120
she was telling me how she can't wait
to get married and have kids.

1271
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,850
Look, she was kidding around.

1272
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,790
I made reservations to play golf
on Sunday for the four of us.

1273
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,160
No, Pete, I told you,
I don't play sports with women.

1274
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,320
Look, man, you told my fiancée
that she needs to give me blowies

1275
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,730
in front of my whole family, all right?
You owe me.

1276
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,030
- You make a valid point.
- It's golf. It's fun!

1277
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,500
I never have a beer until the ninth hole.

1278
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,340
Maybe we can change that rule.

1279
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,940
- Okay. All right.
- Keep your head down and fluid.

1280
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,780
- Okay. Okay.
- Great, come on. You got it.

1281
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,660
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

1282
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,220
- Zooey, that was a great shot.
- Great shot.

1283
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,730
Really, really good. I'm really impressed.

1284
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1285
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,130
- Fuck!
- Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry, Sydney. Sorry.

1286
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:55,040
Motherfucker!
Fucking cock in my fucking shit! God!

1287
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,540
- Mary.
- You okay, man?

1288
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,020
- I'm sorry.
- This is my nightmare!

1289
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,290
- Whack it up.
- Whack it, Hails.

1290
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,450
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, it is. It's really nice.

1291
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,690
It's kind of frustrating.

1292
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,930
Yeah. My shin hurts.

1293
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,090
I didn't realize
my skin could bruise that quickly.

1294
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,360
- You're good.
- Guys, you're killing us here. Seriously.

1295
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,730
- Let's get the ladies moving.
- Listen, just give me a second.

1296
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,500
Rate of play, rate of play, rate of play,
rate of play, rate of play.

1297
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,510
Hailey, you know what, why don't we just
pick it up and move down the fairway?

1298
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,910
- No, this is fine.
- Because she won't have a chance

1299
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,680
- to practice, right, Peter?
- I got it.

1300
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,220
He's kind of got a point. I mean,
we're really holding these guys up.

1301
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,550
You're being an asshole.
Hailey, just take your time, okay?

1302
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,710
He's really not being an asshole.
There's a protocol.

1303
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,720
The marshals come by,
and there is some time pressure.

1304
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,820
- You know, I'm done. This sucks.
- Hailey, please...

1305
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,290
- I'm out of here.
- Please don't go.

1306
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,590
- Where are you going?
- Come on, Hailey. It's okay.

1307
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,430
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- I mean, we'll... Come on, Hailey.

1308
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,560
- Please come back.
- Where are you going?

1309
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,030
- Did you say something?
- No.

1310
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,670
Thank you.

1311
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,520
- Hey, man.
- Dude Von Dudenstein,

1312
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,950
- what are you doing tonight?
- I just left you half an hour ago.

1313
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,560
I'm watching HBO with Zooey.

1314
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,720
I know, but I just got an e-mail alert
from the Rush fan club.

1315
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,320
The Holy Trinity is playing
a small club gig tonight at the Avalon.

1316
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,430
Dude, it's Sunday night.
I can't bail on her again.

1317
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,830
Dude, you have your whole life

1318
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:27,060
to sit around
and watch premium cable with Zooey.

1319
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,070
Whatever, it's our ritual. It's HBO.

1320
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,470
It's not TV, it's HBO.

1321
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,980
Have you ever watched Sunday night
programming on HBO? It's spectacular.

1322
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,510
It's fucking Rush.

1323
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,910
I haven't seen them
since the Signals tour.

1324
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,390
Can I invite Zooey?

1325
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,520
- Slapping the bass!
- Slapping the bass!

1326
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:01,290
What the fuck?

1327
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,120
Yeah!

1328
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,720
My God. We could practice every day
for six months, and I'm planning on it,

1329
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,990
and we'll still suck. Yeah.
I'll give you a call.

1330
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,660
All right. Take it easy, Magooch.

1331
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,460
- Were you spying on me?
- Yeah, I was.

1332
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,000
Because I'm totally weirded out
about what's going on between you two.

1333
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,270
What are you talking about?
We were just going over the set list.

1334
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,540
- I mean, what's the big deal?
- The big deal is

1335
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,740
that we were supposed to have
a date night,

1336
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,040
and you took me to this concert,
which is cool,

1337
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,240
but then we get there
and it's like I don't even exist.

1338
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,550
You don't even look at me.
You're licking Sydney's bass guitar.

1339
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:02,420
There were tons of guys
that were licking each other's basses.

1340
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,090
I just...
I feel like I'm losing you a little bit.

1341
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,590
What? We were just doing
a recap of the set list.

1342
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,560
- What? Zooey.
- Okay.

1343
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,200
I was going over the set list.

1344
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,770
So the big day's coming up.
How are you feeling?

1345
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:19,500
Well, you know,
I was feeling really good,

1346
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,670
but Zooey and I have been
fighting a lot recently.

1347
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:25,510
All right, let me ask you a question.
Why are you marrying her?

1348
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,380
What kind of question is that?

1349
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,440
Well, it seems to me like you've gone
from relationship to relationship,

1350
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,420
so is Zooey the one
or is she just the next one?

1351
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,020
No, she's the one.

1352
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,750
All right, well, how come?

1353
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,060
Because.

1354
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,760
I don't know. We're in love.

1355
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,290
And...

1356
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,370
That's a hard question to answer.

1357
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:53,040
Listen, I'm not trying to push you at all.
It's just for me,

1358
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,380
sometimes talking this stuff out helps
to clarify things. That's all.

1359
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,880
Let's go try on some penguin suits.

1360
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,580
Thank you, lovely. What's your name?

1361
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,280
- Raquel.
- That was my mother's name.

1362
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:10,850
So I'm thinking about asking Tevin
if he wants in on the Ferrigno house.

1363
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,900
Dude, I pissed on that guy's face
at a Bennigan's.

1364
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,430
You do not need
to be splitting commission

1365
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:18,020
with that frosty-haired chode.

1366
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,370
I have to face facts, Syd.
I'm a flats guy, you know?

1367
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,380
Tevin's got the flash needed
to sell the place.

1368
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,140
What do you think?

1369
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,580
You look fucking stiff.

1370
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,010
We're shopping for tuxedos
for your wedding, man.

1371
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,280
Let's have a good time.
Loosen it up a little bit.

1372
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,320
I wanna take a photo.
Now, give me an action pose.

1373
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,020
Like what? What do you mean?

1374
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,680
Well, you're wearing a tuxedo.
What do you think I mean?

1375
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:47,630
When have you ever seen
anyone in a tuxedo do that move?

1376
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,260
Besides Runaway Bride.

1377
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,460
The ESPYs.

1378
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:53,130
You're wearing a tuxedo.
Think James Bond, all right?

1379
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,230
Give me some James Bond.

1380
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,640
No.
It just looks like you're pointing at me.

1381
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:08,680
- You look ridiculous, man.
- What am I... How can I... I can't...

1382
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,310
- Think Timothy Dalton.
- T-Dalt.

1383
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,850
Hey, that's pretty good.

1384
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,530
Tell you what.
Give me your best Bond impression.

1385
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,790
Why don't you get off your board

1386
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,390
and get on...
"Get out of my dreams and into my car."

1387
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,220
You looking for your pot of gold?

1388
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,360
Why does everything I do
sound like a leprechaun?

1389
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,340
You tell me. He speaks
like the coolest man on earth.

1390
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,200
- The name is Bond. Oh, yeah.
- There you go.

1391
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,610
The name is James Bond.

1392
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,540
James Bond.

1393
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,840
I'll have a margarita.

1394
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,790
Well, hey there, Miss Moneypussy.
Wanna jump on my jetpack?

1395
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,520
All right, enough of that.
Let's just take the picture, all right?

1396
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,190
Arch an eyebrow for me. Other eyebrow.

1397
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,600
No, you just look confused.

1398
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:00,030
Arch your eyebrow up.
No, not both, just one.

1399
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know how...

1400
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,140
All right, maybe I was wrong.
Let's see the back.

1401
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,840
You know what?
I'm not sure I'm in love with the drape.

1402
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,210
What's wrong with the drape?
Does the vent move funny?

1403
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,050
You should wear something
with a little more pizzazz, right?

1404
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,590
- A little more flash.
- You don't like the split panel?

1405
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,550
- Peacock it out a bit.
- No.

1406
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,750
- Let's try...
- What are those? Checkers?

1407
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,350
- Here. Give this one a try.
- Give me a break.

1408
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,450
- No way, man.
- Come on.

1409
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:24,720
I can't fricking pull that off. It's blue.

1410
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,820
Look at me.

1411
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:30,060
You have this image of yourself
as this straight-laced, tight guy,

1412
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,430
but I've seen you cut loose
in the man cave, and it is fantastic.

1413
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,840
Well, yeah. Slap a little bass.

1414
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, it's the same
with the Ferrigno house.

1415
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,510
You have all of the skills in the world,
and you have no confidence.

1416
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,550
Now, sack up, man.

1417
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:46,210
Put on the fucking suit.

1418
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,350
I can't believe you just touched my balls.

1419
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,850
Hey, so listen, I also wanted
to talk to you about something.

1420
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,920
This investment opportunity
has come up. It's a total winner.

1421
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,300
The only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities,

1422
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,500
so I'm cash poor right now.

1423
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,700
So I was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels?

1424
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,510
How much are we talking about?

1425
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,840
You know, 8.

1426
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,420
$8,000. That's... That's a lot of...

1427
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,850
That's a lot of quiche, you know?
A lot of cake.

1428
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,130
It just... It might be a little tricky,

1429
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:37,530
just 'cause Zooey's dad
is out of the picture,

1430
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,730
and, you know,
we're paying for the wedding ourselves.

1431
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,070
You know what? Enough said.

1432
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:45,540
An opportunity came up.
I thought I would ask. No big deal.

1433
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:47,940
Can you tell me about the investment?

1434
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,710
I can't, actually.
It's confidential in nature, so...

1435
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,440
Okay. Let me think about it.

1436
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,110
Yeah, of course, buddy.

1437
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:58,280
Hello, Peter.

1438
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,820
Doug!

1439
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,150
- This is my...
- Sydney.

1440
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,960
Sydney. This is Sydney.

1441
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,560
You know, it takes a lot of nerve

1442
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,690
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone

1443
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,100
and then never call them again.

1444
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,170
Doug, I can explain.

1445
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,470
I just wish I could take back that kiss,

1446
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,010
because I felt something
that I haven't felt in years,

1447
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:25,380
and now I know
it was the taste of betrayal.

1448
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,110
It wasn't the taste of betrayal.

1449
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,710
- It was the taste of betrayal.
- No, it really wasn't.

1450
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:32,050
It was the taste of betrayal,
you fucking whore.

1451
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,190
- Doug.
- Good day.

1452
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,780
Doug, wait.

1453
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,860
- I can actually explain what just...
- I would love to hear that.

1454
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,000
Wow. I mean, I knew when I got
the nod for the engagement dinner

1455
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,500
you didn't have a ton of friends,
but I had no idea it went that far.

1456
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,100
Truth is, I never even thought about it
until Zooey and I got engaged.

1457
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,230
It's like,
you were basically just using me

1458
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,210
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party.

1459
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,750
Dude, no. Not it at all.

1460
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,010
I'd actually given up
on meeting someone,

1461
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:06,390
and then you wandered
into that open house, we hit it off,

1462
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,620
and three-quarters of the Rush
songbook later, here we are.

1463
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:13,660
- I just wish you'd have told me.
- Well, I was embarrassed.

1464
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,760
I mean, you've had a close group
of male friends your whole life. I haven't.

1465
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,500
I started feeling
like some kind of weirdo.

1466
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,600
I get it. But I just want you to know
that you're my friend,

1467
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,310
and you can tell me anything.

1468
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,810
Thanks, Sydney. I appreciate that.

1469
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,170
Hey, man, look, about that investment...

1470
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,380
Pete, please,
forget I even brought it up, honestly.

1471
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,850
I've been saving my whole life,

1472
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,790
and you were right.
I'm gonna sell the Ferrigno place.

1473
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,820
Fuck, yeah, you are.

1474
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:45,130
I'd be happy to lend you the money.
I know you're good for it.

1475
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,560
Pistol, that is great. Thank you.

1476
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:52,760
It's the least I could do
for the best man at my wedding.

1477
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,160
What are you talking about?

1478
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,600
I want you to stand up there with me.
Are you cool with that?

1479
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,970
Am I cool with that?

1480
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,640
Of course I'll be your best man!
That's an honor! It's...

1481
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,050
You're a whore, Peter.

1482
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,930
- I think we're almost there.
- I think we're almost there, too.

1483
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:20,690
I think it's just about putting
the random people together.

1484
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,820
- Yeah.
- We should talk about the main table,

1485
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:26,530
because if Hailey doesn't find a date
before the wedding,

1486
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:29,800
which, let's be honest,
it seems pretty likely that she won't...

1487
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,340
I know.

1488
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,170
...we have an extra seat at our table.

1489
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,700
Well, I was thinking that maybe
Sydney would sit at our table.

1490
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,040
I asked him to be my best man.

1491
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:43,020
Great! That's awesome.
That was the whole thing.

1492
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,880
I'm not an idiot.
You're not psyched about this at all.

1493
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,620
No, it's just...
I feel like he has some issue with me.

1494
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,390
What? No. You guys just haven't
spent any time together.

1495
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:54,860
- We've spent some time together.
- I'll talk to him.

1496
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,160
Peter, do not talk to him.

1497
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,170
He's gonna think
I'm saying stuff behind his back.

1498
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:02,470
- You are saying stuff behind his back.
- No. I'm just sharing a feeling with you.

1499
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,900
And I want you to.

1500
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,910
But, Peter,
please don't say anything to him.

1501
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,600
Okay, I won't.

1502
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,140
So, we still have
to pick up the marriage license.

1503
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,210
- Can you meet up tomorrow afternoon?
- Totally, yeah. Perfect.

1504
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,050
So, what'd she say
about me being your best man?

1505
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:19,950
She was pumped.
She thought it was awesome.

1506
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,510
Come on, dude.

1507
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:25,290
I'm the worst liar.
I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

1508
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,630
Well, what is it?

1509
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,290
She thinks you don't like her.

1510
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,930
What? That is... No, of course I like her.
Are you...

1511
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,340
We've only hung out a few times,

1512
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,570
but she's gonna be your wife.
Of course I like her.

1513
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:41,610
This dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever.

1514
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:45,100
Oh, man!

1515
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,890
Dude, why is Ferrigno eating
with that urinal-cake-faced fuckhead?

1516
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,010
We gotta confront him. Hold this.

1517
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,220
No, wait. Sydney, wait, wait.
Wait. Sydney!

1518
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:59,790
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck is going on here?

1519
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,360
- Do I know you?
- No, you don't know me,

1520
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,560
but I believe you know
my friend Peter Klaven,

1521
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,860
who has an exclusive listing
on this man's property.

1522
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,060
Lou, you promised Peter
the commission to your house.

1523
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,700
I know, but he's not doing shit with it.

1524
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,540
That is total crap, Hulk, all right?

1525
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,840
Listen, this kind of stuff
doesn't happen overnight.

1526
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,040
Peter, who the hell is this guy?

1527
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,010
Hulk, let me tell you something
about Peter...

1528
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,240
Look, please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me Hulk.

1529
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,440
I'm a person, okay?

1530
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,880
I'm a person, okay.

1531
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,110
- I warned you.
- You warned me?

1532
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,210
- Hello?
- Hey.

1533
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:27,620
I'm on my way to the marriage bureau.

1534
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,180
Fuck you, Lou Ferrigno!

1535
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,280
Is that Sydney?

1536
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,220
- Hey!
- Fuck you, Hulk!

1537
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,530
Oh, shit.

1538
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,530
What the... What are you doing?

1539
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:38,970
- What's going on?
- Sydney. He's fighting Lou Ferrigno.

1540
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,130
Peter! He's so strong!

1541
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,600
- Easy. Don't fight it.
- The Hulk has me in a sleeper hold,

1542
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,970
- and I don't think I can take him...
- Easy. That's it.

1543
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,240
Peter!

1544
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,170
- Wow.
- Peter!

1545
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,080
Why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with Lou Ferrigno?

1546
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,640
Sydney's a hothead.
He thought he was standing up for me.

1547
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,240
To The Incredible Hulk?

1548
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:02,020
No, that's just a character he played.
In real life, Lou's actually a sweet man.

1549
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,830
So, what does that mean
for your development property?

1550
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,190
It means it's over.

1551
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,090
Without the Ferrigno commission,
I'm not gonna be able to afford it.

1552
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:12,330
You have some money saved up.

1553
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:16,000
Can't you just write them a check,
you know, to show your good faith?

1554
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,440
Between the wedding, and then,
you know, I lent Sydney some money.

1555
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,070
I mean, it's just I'm gonna be short.
That's it.

1556
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,980
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You lent Sydney money?

1557
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:29,680
For an investment.
All his money's tied up in equities.

1558
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,480
- He's gonna pay me back.
- Peter, that's not the point.

1559
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,220
We're getting married. You can't
just keep stuff like this from me.

1560
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,320
Can I ask you a question?

1561
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,150
Why do you think we're getting married?

1562
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,170
What are you talking about?

1563
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,290
No, it's just... Sydney asked me
that question, and I couldn't...

1564
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:50,700
"Well, why Zooey?"
And I didn't know how to answer it.

1565
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,400
- Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?
- Yes.

1566
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,380
Two weeks before our wedding

1567
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,070
and you don't know
why you're marrying me?

1568
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:02,140
Just forget it. It was a stupid question.
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1569
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,880
Just forget... Take it back 10 seconds
before I asked it,

1570
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,360
and let's live in that time.

1571
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,050
The thing is, Peter,
I get why you would wonder that. I do.

1572
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:15,330
But I wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me.

1573
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:18,060
That's the thing.
Before I didn't even think about it.

1574
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,130
That came out bad, too.
I didn't... I'm so...

1575
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,730
I'm confused.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1576
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,600
Let me just make this
a little simpler for you.

1577
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,800
I'm gonna go stay
with Denise and Barry,

1578
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,680
and you and your bud Sydney
can hang out and beat up Lou Ferrigno

1579
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,080
and go to Rush concerts

1580
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,670
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the Venice Boardwalk for all I care.

1581
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:37,410
- We never rode bicycles.
- Goodbye!

1582
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:41,390
Zooey, come on! This is ridiculous!
Zooey! Zooey!

1583
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:14,920
Oh, my God.

1584
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,630
My God.

1585
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,740
All right, he put up some billboards.
Put up some billboards.

1586
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,110
Oh, my God.

1587
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,240
Oh, God! No!

1588
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:44,810
Fuck me over. Fucking fucking fuck!

1589
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,020
Are you kidding me?

1590
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,560
Come on!

1591
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,630
Yeah, it's open.

1592
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,200
Hey.

1593
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,670
That's what you borrowed $8,000 for?

1594
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,610
You saw the billboards.
Pretty awesome, right?

1595
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:07,670
Pretty awesome?

1596
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,180
My buddy Dave sells ad space,
so he got us a great deal.

1597
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,870
Pretty awesome? They're idiotic.

1598
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:15,280
You put my face on a 10-foot dick
over Santa Monica Boulevard.

1599
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,120
Yeah. It's hilarious.

1600
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,060
Well, in one day you managed to screw
my career, you ruined my relationship...

1601
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,220
What are you talking about?
Ruin your relationship?

1602
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,320
Zooey walked out on me

1603
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,300
because I asked her
why we were getting married.

1604
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,230
Why would you ask her that?

1605
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:33,360
Pete, that conversation
was between you and me.

1606
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,000
You can't have that talk with her. I just...
Look, I assumed you understood that.

1607
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,040
God, I am so sick
of your ridiculous rules.

1608
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,740
I like it that I can share things
with Zooey.

1609
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,580
I like it that if I can't sleep at night,
she's there to talk to.

1610
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,750
Do you know the best night
I've had in the last five years

1611
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,980
is the night
that Zooey and I split a bottle of wine,

1612
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,990
we made a summer salad,
and watched Chocolat together.

1613
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,820
- You mean Chocolate?
- Chocolat.

1614
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,860
- Chocolate with Johnny Depp.
- Chocolat.

1615
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,950
You're not fucking French, Pete.
It's called Chocolate.

1616
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,060
Chocolate has got an "E" on it.

1617
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,500
- That was your favorite night?
- Yes.

1618
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,330
Your best night in five years is
watching Chocolate with Johnny Depp?

1619
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,430
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1620
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:10,870
The combination of wine
and summer salad and Chocolat, yeah.

1621
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,000
You should be embarrassed.

1622
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,040
You know, I think you're threatened
by what Zooey and I have

1623
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,170
because you're afraid
I won't be able to hang out every night.

1624
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:18,740
Hey, you know what?
I have a ton of friends, all right?

1625
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,870
Yeah, who are all moving on
with their lives.

1626
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:24,750
They're in relationships. They have kids.
They're growing up.

1627
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,950
Hey, let's not forget.
You were the one using me.

1628
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:29,750
- I think we were using each other.
- Whatever.

1629
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:33,730
I really don't understand
what's going on right now.

1630
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,230
I think we should spend
some time apart.

1631
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:43,930
Okay.

1632
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:48,070
So if I actually do
wind up having a wedding,

1633
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,670
it's probably best that you not be there.

1634
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,140
Yeah. Sounds good to me, Pete.

1635
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,880
And if you could have
those billboards taken down...

1636
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it'll take
a few days, but I will get on that.

1637
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,850
And I'll also make sure you get
your money back as soon as possible.

1638
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:08,730
Also, I think you have
my season 2 Lost DVDs. If you...

1639
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:14,540
- lf you haven't watched them yet...
- It's fine, Pete. They're right here.

1640
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:18,500
- Thanks.
- Yep.

1641
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,740
It's just Zooey hasn't seen them all yet,

1642
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,910
and she's really curious as to what
was going on inside that hatch.

1643
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:26,110
Yep.

1644
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:32,340
- I wish you the best of luck, Peter.
- You, too, Sydney.

1645
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,490
Bye, Anwar.

1646
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:52,570
- Hey, Denise. Sorry to bother you.
- It's... I'll go get Zooey.

1647
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:54,700
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1648
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:00,850
- Hey, Barry.
- Poker night.

1649
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,820
- Full table.
- That's okay.

1650
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,320
I'm here to talk to my fiancée.

1651
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,410
Nice face.

1652
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,020
Thank you.

1653
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,220
- On the billboards.
- Right. Yeah.

1654
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,420
- Yeah, my friend Sydney, he...
- I don't give a shit.

1655
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,260
- Hey.
- Hi.

1656
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:26,210
- Could I talk to you outside?
- Yeah.

1657
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:31,540
- License to sell.
- Yeah.

1658
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:34,050
Look, that's what Sydney borrowed
all that money for.

1659
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:35,810
He thought it would help my career.

1660
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,150
Well, it got your name out there.

1661
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,420
Besides, you look pretty cute
with a thick mustache.

1662
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,390
Zooey, look,
I'm so sorry that I asked you

1663
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,830
why you thought we should get married.

1664
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,830
It's just that I've been talking
about this stuff with Sydney,

1665
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,920
and, you know, it made me nervous.

1666
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,460
Peter, I'm nervous, too, okay?
It's a big deal.

1667
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,600
I couldn't believe actually how sure
you seemed about the whole thing,

1668
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,540
which is why I freaked out when you
all of a sudden started questioning it.

1669
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,210
Well, I'm sure about us
for so many reasons.

1670
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:08,310
Truth is, I've been a girlfriend guy,
but out of all those girls,

1671
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,650
you're the only one
that wanted me to have my own life.

1672
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:14,660
You know? You want me
to have friends for me, not you.

1673
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,630
It's, like, one of the most romantic
things I could ever think of.

1674
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:20,220
What's up?

1675
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,700
Dude, come on.

1676
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:28,030
Zooey, I love you, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

1677
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,930
Can we get this engagement
back on track?

1678
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,030
Okay.

1679
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,510
- Please?
- Yes. Yes.

1680
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,310
- Come on, it's poker night.
- So?

1681
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,850
So just take her out for a cup of coffee
or something.

1682
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,110
I'm not taking her out for a cup of coffee.

1683
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:43,480
Why don't you take the boys
to fucking Starbucks and play poker?

1684
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,820
Because it's poker night here.
It's always poker night here.

1685
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:46,910
Yeah, that's my best friend.

1686
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,690
I'm not leaving her, ever.
How about that?

1687
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:51,190
She can stay here for five years
if she wants to.

1688
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,420
You're gonna dress up like
a cheerleader tonight for me, all right?

1689
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,930
Fine. Get the fuck out of here.

1690
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:58,760
Hey, Zooey, you can stay here as long
as you want. You are always welcome.

1691
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,270
- Thank you.
- Okay? Hey, by the way,

1692
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,330
Peter, they've got plenty of room open
on the poker table.

1693
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:06,430
They were lying.
They'd love to have you play poker.

1694
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:08,410
- I'm not going to.
- Okay.

1695
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:11,640
Oh, my God.
Barry and Denise fight all the time,

1696
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,610
and then they have really loud,
intense make-up sex.

1697
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,710
Please get me out of here, please.

1698
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,380
- Let's get your stuff. Come on.
- Okay.

1699
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,440
By the way, I ended things with Sydney.

1700
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,790
Peter, really?
I hope that's not because of me.

1701
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:25,230
No, no. He can be a great guy. It's just...
It wasn't really working out.

1702
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:31,260
Then you process your purchase.

1703
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,590
That sounds riveting.

1704
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:41,240
I just stepped
in your dog's crap, asshole!

1705
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:45,110
Aren't you gonna pick up
your dog's shit, shit giant?

1706
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:47,410
Pick up your shit like a man!

1707
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,310
Nice scarf, dickwad!

1708
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,510
- Okay, so what should be our last song?
- Into the Mystic.

1709
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,090
That's perfect. That is perfect.

1710
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:59,360
Okay. Okay, so we have to go
through the place cards one more time,

1711
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,420
'cause I'm a little bit...

1712
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:05,200
Why don't you just call him?

1713
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,130
Because guys don't do that.

1714
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:15,940
E, Ethan. What's up, my man?
E. Bone Capone.

1715
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,810
I'm just hanging out, man.

1716
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,280
I wanted to see if you wanted to come
over and watch TV or something.

1717
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,110
Again you're gonna watch
the Wonder Emporium?

1718
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:27,250
Dude, what the fuck is there
to do at LEGOLAND

1719
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,150
that you take these kids there
every weekend?

1720
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:34,460
I understand that
that's not the point of teaching,

1721
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,960
but just give them all B pluses.

1722
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:38,960
Can I... Could I come with you?

1723
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:43,500
What do you mean,
the kids think I'm creepy?

1724
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,200
- Good to see you, Peter.
- You, too, Mel.

1725
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,680
You know, I haven't had a real friend
since my wife passed.

1726
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,410
I'm really glad you called.

1727
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:59,250
Hey, do you have any plans
on June 30th?

1728
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,580
I'm 89 years old. What the fuck
kind of plans would I have?

1729
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,420
Just needed an adjustment.
I hope it'll be better now.

1730
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:16,170
My mother knew Roux's return
had nothing to do with the silly old door.

1731
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:20,900
So did I.

1732
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,830
Stupid.

1733
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:24,350
My favorite, hot chocolate.

1734
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,340
Davis Dunn, how may I direct your call?

1735
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,440
- Hey, Leanne.
- Peter. Where have you been?

1736
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,820
Well, it's my wedding this weekend,

1737
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:34,350
so I've been helping my fiancée
with all the last-minute preparations.

1738
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:36,020
They broke the mold
when they made you.

1739
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,080
Yeah.

1740
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,320
Go check your voice mail.
You got like a million messages.

1741
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,230
Yeah, is this Pistol Pete?

1742
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,430
I have a home in Los Feliz,
and I've been trying to sell it,

1743
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:51,600
and I saw your billboards.
I'm very impressed with your ads.

1744
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,770
License to sell? That's hysterical!
It's like James Bond.

1745
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:57,010
Hi, I'm interested
in buying the Ferrigno estate.

1746
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:58,440
- lf you could give me a call.
- Oh, my God.

1747
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,110
I love the one with you in the bed.
My number is 310...

1748
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,280
- My husband and I saw your ad...
- Stop. Slow down.

1749
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:06,950
Hello, Peter. It's Doug.

1750
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,260
Saw the billboards. They are wonderful.

1751
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:15,030
Wouldn't expect anything less from you.
And sorry about calling you a whore.

1752
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,860
And hello to Sydney
if you guys are still together.

1753
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,900
Otherwise, you can Facebook me.

1754
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,640
Peter, hi. It's Lou Ferrigno.
Wonderful billboards.

1755
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,870
Listen, I'm sorry
if I ever doubted you, man.

1756
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,840
I told that douchebag Tevin

1757
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,210
that I want you to have
the exclusive back on my house.

1758
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,410
- Excuse me, Mr. Ferrigno?
- Yeah.

1759
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:33,450
- Ten-minute warning.
- Okay. Thank you.

1760
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:35,850
So just call me or just text me.

1761
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,880
Goodbye, my friend.

1762
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,350
There's my dog!

1763
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:48,090
Hey, me rikey the billboards.

1764
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,630
I completely underestimated you,
my brother.

1765
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:53,290
What say we go down to Houston's,
get a burger and a beer

1766
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:56,810
and talk about how we can tag-team
the Ferrigno deal?

1767
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:04,910
Why are you slapping me?

1768
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:07,140
Because I wanted
to cause you some physical pain,

1769
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:10,580
but I have never actually hit anybody
in the face. It freaks me out.

1770
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,120
And I didn't really know what to do.

1771
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,120
Tevin, stay the fuck away
from my listing.

1772
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:26,090
- Hey, Carolyn.
- Hey, Pete.

1773
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,670
Good luck, Peter.

1774
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:43,580
I'm so excited to see who Peter chose
for his wedding party.

1775
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1776
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,470
Honestly, that has to be
the most random

1777
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:08,910
collection of groomsmen
in the history of weddings.

1778
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:11,240
- I'm great. You know, I just got to...
- Okay.

1779
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,610
I'll see you at the wedding.

1780
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,710
I'm gonna get another mimosa.

1781
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:17,150
Do you want to finish the one...

1782
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,770
Hello?

1783
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:43,600
Hey. Wow,
I didn't expect to hear from you.

1784
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,520
No, I wouldn't want to impose.

1785
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,020
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe if I hurry, I can make the end of it.

1786
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:54,280
Okay, I gotta go.
I gotta find something to wear.

1787
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:08,130
Which one of these men has the ring?

1788
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:12,740
I actually don't have a best man, so...

1789
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:18,140
Robbie, I want you
to hold the ring for me.

1790
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,120
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1791
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:27,010
- Okay.
- Unless you don't want to. I mean...

1792
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,450
Thanks, Peter.

1793
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:32,490
So sweet.

1794
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:37,360
Hey, I want you boys to know,
you're both my best friends

1795
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,940
and Hank Mardukas.

1796
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,530
Hey, Hank.

1797
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,910
Awesome tux.

1798
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,070
- Thanks. It's blue.
- Yes, it is.

1799
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,410
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1800
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:34,180
Good afternoon.
We are gathered here today

1801
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,890
to join Peter Klaven and Zooey Rice
in matrimony.

1802
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:42,320
If anyone can show just cause
why they may not marry...

1803
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,460
You son of a bitch!

1804
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,260
No, no, Mr. Ferrigno,
I don't wanna object.

1805
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:50,330
I just wanted to make it in time
for the vows. That's all.

1806
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:52,140
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1807
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,070
Sydney, come up.

1808
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:55,870
No, I'm fine back here.

1809
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:58,440
- Please, yes. Yes.
- Are you sure?

1810
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,320
I hope you don't mind.

1811
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,080
You invited him?

1812
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,580
Well, I saw you walking
on the lawn looking all sad,

1813
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:16,890
and I realized I couldn't let you
get married without your best man.

1814
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,040
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

1815
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:25,260
Zooey, thanks so much for inviting me.

1816
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,240
Of course. You got here really fast.

1817
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,070
Yeah. You know what,
I was on the Vesp,

1818
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:33,380
so I just did the old weaveroo.

1819
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,950
Dude, you're lying.
Your voice went up when you said that.

1820
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:38,850
His voice got high.

1821
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:42,190
Look, I was on my way
when Zooey called.

1822
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:45,920
Invite or not, there was no way
I was gonna miss your wedding,

1823
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,330
and I wanted to give you this.

1824
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,200
Man, you don't have to do this.

1825
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,400
You know what?
I know you don't believe me,

1826
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,130
but I'm actually
a pretty successful investor, so...

1827
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:59,400
Look, the billboards
were my wedding gift to you guys.

1828
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,630
Man, they worked.

1829
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:03,540
Yeah, I figured when I saw the Ferrigs
that they must have worked.

1830
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,380
- That's great.
- Lou's the best.

1831
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:06,940
I can only imagine.

1832
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:13,310
I put him in a sleeper hold. Out.

1833
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,610
Sydney, I'm really sorry
for all the stuff that I said.

1834
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:19,650
Pete, you called me
on a lot of my issues. I appreciate it.

1835
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:23,160
And for the record, I saw Chocolat.

1836
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,800
Just delightful.

1837
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,360
It is, right?

1838
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,060
- I love Chocolat.
- I love that movie.

1839
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,970
- Chocolat? What the fuck is that?
- I have no idea.

1840
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:33,670
It's a beautiful movie.

1841
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:37,050
I'm really glad you're here, Sydney.

1842
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,310
Me, too.

1843
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:42,650
I can't even imagine getting married
without you.

1844
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,980
I love you, man.

1845
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,490
I love you, too, bud.

1846
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,060
- I love you, dude.
- I love you, Bro Montana.

1847
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,790
- I love you, holmes.
- I love you, Broseph Goebbels.

1848
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,360
- Love you, muchacha.
- I love you, Tycho Brohe.

1849
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:06,310
Okay. Okay. Right. Let's continue here.

1850
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,970
- I so wanna marry you.
- You will.

1851
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,240
I'm going to.

1852
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,680
Zooey, repeat after me.

1853
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,180
- I, Zooey Rice.
- I, Zooey Rice.

1854
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:17,240
- Take you, Peter Klaven.
- Take you, Peter Klaven.

1855
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:21,260
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.

1856
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,090
I'm really sorry
about that dumb toast I gave.

1857
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:12,760
It was out of line. I got really nervous
to meet you and I'm...

1858
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,740
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm sorry.

1859
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:18,170
Sydney, it's fine. Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

1860
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:21,770
For the record, I like giving blowjobs.

1861
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:24,870
Well, that's good to hear. You know,
I was just looking out for my buddy.

1862
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:25,970
I hear you.

1863
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:28,450
I had to make sure that
he's getting blowies on a regular basis.

1864
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:30,920
Yeah, I'm not really comfortable
with this conversation.

1865
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,820
- Honey.
- We're all friends now.

1866
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,720
- Friends do this.
- No, they don't.

1867
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:42,830
- Wow, you have a nice singing voice.
- Thanks.

1868
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:45,130
- Are you in a band?
- Not yet.

1869
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,390
- Hailey.
- Lonnie.

1870
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

1871
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:54,610
That's awesome! That's awesome!

1872
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,540
Excuse me, Peter.

1873
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:02,540
Get my wife on up here!

1874
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:07,360
You've been Rushified!

1875
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:13,560
- You should be...
- You've never called me an asshole?

1876
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,260
No, I've said you act like an asshole.

1877
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,300
So, you get away with it
because it was the act of.

1878
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,490
- That's your behavior.
- Right.

1879
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,540
I'm not saying you're an asshole.

1880
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,630
Oh, my God.

1881
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:23,830
Shit. What?
Do I have a fucking sign on me?

1882
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,470
- No, it's not my fault.
- How is it not your fault?

1883
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:28,410
Because I'm pregnant.

1884
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:32,750
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1885
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:36,450
- Are you still mad?
- Try to make it a boy.

1886
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,570
Thank you.
I'd just like to make a quick toast.

1887
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,700
No!

1888
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:12,700
