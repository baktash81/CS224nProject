1
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,236
Hey, everyone,
it's Bobby Leiber.

2
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,031
And welcome to your favorite
podcast, <i>The 11th Brick at Stonewall</i>.

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,784
Because we all know a butch
lesbian or a trans woman of color

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,869
probably threw the first
brick at Stonewall,

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,122
but it was a cis, white, gay
man who threw the 11th brick.

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,836
And today, as always, I will take you
on a journey throughout LGBTQ+ history,

7
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,464
and much more importantly, my own problems
and whatever I feel like talking about.

8
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,715
And this is a big day,

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,846
because, as of today, <i>The 11th Brick</i>
is celebrating one million subscribers.

10
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,183
And in honor of all this exciting
news, I am taking your questions live.

11
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,268
First question.

12
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,812
<i>Hi, Bobby. Any chance for
more children's books?</i>

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,564
Oh, not at the
moment, but thank you.

14
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,983
As some of you know, I wrote
a series of children's books

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,319
to help parents teach kids about
gay history, which no one bought.

16
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,864
Turns out a four-year-old didn't
want to hear a bedtime story

17
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,323
about Martina Navratilova.

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,493
Hey, parents. Thanks for teaching
your kids about Santa Claus,

19
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,953
a straight man
that doesn't exist,

20
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,706
and not Martina Navratilova,
a lesbian who does.

21
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,916
In other news, I
finally got the footage

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,586
from my audition to be part
of the next cast of <i>Queer Eye</i>,

23
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,547
and you can watch that
on the app right now.

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,009
{\an8}- Oh, no.
- Oh, my...

25
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,850
{\an8}I'm sorry. This is not
sad. It's just not sad.

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,894
{\an8}You gave him a haircut
and a pair of pants.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,438
{\an8}I mean, he looks fine.

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,356
{\an8}- Not great.
<i>- Next caller.</i>

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,317
<i>What happened to
that movie you wrote?</i>

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,484
Oh, yeah. The movie.

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,368
These big movie producers
came to me and said…

32
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>"We want you to write a
rom-com about a gay couple.</i>

33
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,718
<i>Something the whole
world would enjoy.</i>

34
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,660
<i>Something a straight guy might even
like and watch with his girlfriend."</i>

35
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,663
<i>I said, "Something a straight guy
might like? Like what exactly?</i>

36
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>Am I gonna be in the middle
of some high-speed chase,</i>

37
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,418
<i>and then all of a sudden
fall in love with Ice Cube?</i>

38
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,045
<i>Am I gonna get butt-fucked by
Jason Momoa while we're both,</i>

39
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,423
<i>I don't know, worrying
about a volcano?"</i>

40
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:15,427
<i>And he said, "Bobby, we just want
to make a movie that shows the world</i>

41
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,721
<i>gay and straight
relationships are the same.</i>

42
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
<i>Love is love is love."</i>

43
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,433
<i>I said, "'Love is love is love?'</i>

44
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,310
<i>No, it's not. That's bullshit.</i>

45
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,270
<i>That is a lie we had to make up</i>

46
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>to convince you idiots to
finally treat us fairly.</i>

47
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>Love is not love.</i>

48
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,485
<i>Our relationships are different.
Our sex lives are different."</i>

49
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,530
<i>And he said, "Bobby, we were
just trying to make a nice movie</i>

50
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,948
<i>about nice gay people."</i>

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,325
<i>And I said, "Well, there's
your first mistake,</i>

52
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>because not all gay
people are nice."</i>

53
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,246
<i>And I got up and left.</i>

54
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,622
<i>Anyway, it's totally fine.</i>

55
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm not the right person
to write a rom-com anyway.

56
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,917
<i>Why not?</i>

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,002
Um… I don't know.

58
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,005
I mean, I'm 40 years old.
I've never been in love.

59
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,424
I've never even had a serious
relationship, which is fine.

60
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,469
You know, I love my life. I love
my freedom. I love my independence.

61
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,304
But… …you know,

62
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,015
probably means I'm not the right
person to write a love story.

63
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,852
In exciting news, I
remain very horny,

64
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,814
and tonight I am being honored
at the LGBTQ+ Pride Awards.

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,113
Being in the NFL, I never
thought I could come out.

66
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,990
For years, I had to suffer

67
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,785
as a hot, ripped, gay person,
living my life in private.

68
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,454
But this last year
has really shown me

69
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:29,293
how amazing life can be when
you are finally publicly hot.

70
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,836
Thank you.

71
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>And now, please welcome Emmy and
Tony award winner, Kristin Chenoweth.</i>

72
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,719
Good evening.

73
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,638
What an honor for me
to be here tonight.

74
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,517
On my head is a hat depicting
the Stonewall riots,

75
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,936
where the queer
liberation movement began.

76
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,691
And now, the award for cis,
white, gay man of the year.

77
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,236
Please welcome Bobby Leiber.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,529
Thank you.

79
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,991
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, New York.

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,702
Thank you. Thank you.

81
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,624
Meet Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum,
the Bert and Ernie of Ancient Egypt.

82
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,667
Many scholars believe

83
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,463
that they are the first recorded
same-sex couple in history.

84
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,923
Yet to this day,

85
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,010
there are historians who refuse to
believe that these men were lovers,

86
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,346
and insist that they
were brothers instead.

87
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,600
Thus began 5,000 years
of queer love stories

88
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,185
erased from the history books.

89
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,105
No gay love stories to teach us about
love and how to love each other.

90
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,984
Well, I'm happy to say
this erasure ends today.

91
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,528
And I am thrilled to announce

92
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,405
I have accepted a position
as the executive director

93
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,326
of the first national
LGBTQ+ history museum,

94
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,453
right here in New York City.

95
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,290
Thank you, New York. Thank you.

96
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,625
Thank you so much.

97
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,928
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

98
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,557
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

99
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,768
<i>Looking? Into?</i>

100
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,436
<i>Bottom here.</i>

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,733
<i>Versatile.</i>

102
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,694
Sure you are.

103
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,574
Hey, what's up?

104
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,741
Hey, what's up?

105
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,840
Thank you.

106
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,594
You want to finish?

107
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,223
Uh… I think I'm good, actually.

108
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,391
Okay, I'll get you
something for that.

109
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,476
Thanks.

110
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,449
{\an8}<i>For me, the cold and
awkward Grindr hookup</i>

111
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,744
{\an8}is often followed by a walk
around the city by myself.

112
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,079
Anyone else do that?

113
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,083
{\an8}<i>It's weird, because you still
had this romantic encounter.</i>

114
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,837
<i>Even though it was odd or unsatisfying,
and you don't even know the person,</i>

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,758
you're still feeling this, kind of,
post-sex warmth and wistfulness.

116
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,969
<i>So I usually walk
around for a bit,</i>

117
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,597
<i>and I kind of coast on that warm
feeling as long as it lasts.</i>

118
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,892
<i>And between the weird sex with
strangers that you don't like</i>

119
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:18,021
<i>and conversations with friends you love
that you would never have sex with,</i>

120
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:23,986
you know, you cobble together a
version of a romantic single life.

121
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,031
And it's good, you
know? It works.

122
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,995
It's a lot more than what a lot of
other people have in this world.

123
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,123
And you try to remember that.

124
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,296
As always, this podcast is
brought to you by Career Donkey.

125
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,469
Hi. Hi, I'm sorry.
I know. I'm sorry.

126
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,139
What's going on? What did I
miss? How are you guys, Lucas?

127
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,435
Well, our surrogate just hit three
months, and, not only that, but we are...

128
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,020
Having triplets.

129
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,858
- Oh, my God, congratulations. Oh, my God.
- That's amazing. Yeah.

130
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,986
I'm sorry, you guys. I have to
go. A late shift at the bar.

131
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,089
- It was great meeting you guys.
- Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,531
- And congratulations.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,490
Bye, Marty.

134
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,867
- Bye, y'all.
- Text us.

135
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,244
So what's happening? Didn't
you guys have an announcement?

136
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,749
Okay, so, I totally know this is
a little weird and unexpected,

137
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,127
but the reason we've been
hanging around with Marty so much

138
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,671
is that we are kind of…

139
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,798
dating him.

140
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:27,883
Okay.

141
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,802
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.

142
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,804
What do you mean,
you're dating him?

143
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,599
I mean, together. Like, as
a couple. We're seeing him.

144
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,852
I guess it's kind of like
a throuple situation.

145
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,648
Hold on. So, wait, what
does that mean exactly?

146
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,942
Like, are you guys just having
threesomes or something?

147
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,904
Well, we hooked up, but then we started
spending a bunch of time together after.

148
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,781
It turns out we have
a lot in common.

149
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,926
It's more than just sex. We
genuinely like each other.

150
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,952
Wait, wait. So, how long
has this been going on?

151
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,453
Six months?

152
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,248
You're in a throuple for six
months, and you didn't tell me?

153
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,767
We didn't know it'd
get that serious.

154
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,751
How serious is it gonna
get? You're in a throuple.

155
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,729
What are you gonna do next,
tell your grandparents?

156
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,046
Hi, Grandma.

157
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,589
Oh, hi, honey.

158
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,508
- I have some news.
- Yes?

159
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,719
Peter and I are jointly
fucking a third person.

160
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,305
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

161
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,726
It's Paul. He and Peter are
jointly fucking someone else.

162
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,105
Oh, how wonderful.
It's a throuple.

163
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,358
We'll be fine. We really trust
each other enough to do this.

164
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,442
Just be careful.

165
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,921
I know a lot of guys who've done
this, and it's a slippery slope.

166
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,697
These things are fragile.

167
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,699
And, you know, we're men.
Okay? Men dating men.

168
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,202
Love is not love. We are horny
and selfish and stupid. I am too.

169
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,289
Someone called into my show the other
day and asked me why I'm still single.

170
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,582
I said, "You want to know why?

171
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,169
Because I've been gay my whole life, and
I don't trust these gay motherfuckers.

172
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,045
I support them, but
I don't trust them."

173
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,297
And are you happy?

174
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,091
- Who's so happy all the time?
- Uh, a lot of people.

175
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,775
Well, I really don't
trust those people.

176
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,094
Mr. Leiber?

177
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,722
Sorry. I love your podcast.
Can I get a selfie?

178
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,307
Oh, sure.

179
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,226
Thank you.

180
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,104
Shit. I told Henry I'd meet
him at this launch party.

181
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,815
Ugh. I wanted to go
home and change first.

182
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,002
Aren't you guys just gonna
take your shirts off anyway?

183
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,069
No, we're not just gonna
take our shirts off.

184
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,279
It's not 2003.

185
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,490
You have a very clichéd view
of what gay men do at a party.

186
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,251
What app is this for again?

187
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,795
It's this new hookup app
my company is launching.

188
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,715
We've got Grindr. We've got
Tinder. This is Zellweger.

189
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,760
It's for gay guys who just want to
talk about actresses, then go to bed.

190
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,844
Oh, I'd use that.

191
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,514
Bobby, I had sex
with a 65-year-old.

192
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,140
Sixty-five?

193
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,184
He didn't have an
age on his profile.

194
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,895
He was really nice, he
had an amazing body,

195
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,647
but he had this
big, white beard.

196
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,315
I felt like Mrs. Claus.

197
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,650
I kind of love that.

198
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,652
There's that guy Aaron.

199
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,539
Oh, yeah, I don't
know who that is.

200
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,457
He's at the gym sometimes.

201
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,835
Very hot. Very boring.

202
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,711
Well, what else is new?

203
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:13,757
Oh. Also, today I had sex
with a guy who peed on me.

204
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,967
Oh, are you into that?

205
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,469
- Not really, but what else was I doing?
- Fair enough.

206
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,137
It was honestly kind of boring.

207
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,014
Hey, what's up?

208
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,475
Hey.

209
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,352
- Well, hello, Aaron.
- Hey.

210
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,478
This is Bobby.

211
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,273
Do you boys need another drink?
I'm getting a shitrocket.

212
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,524
What the hell's a shitrocket?

213
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,943
It's like a Red Bull
but with protein.

214
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh. Shitrocket and
vodka, I guess.

215
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,322
Move, boys. Daddy needs a drink.

216
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,490
Thank you.

217
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:47,958
You look angry.

218
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,376
Me?

219
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,296
Well, I'm not. That's
just the way I look.

220
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,425
I know. People always come up to
me and tell me that, but I'm not.

221
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,759
I'm not angry.

222
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,470
I listen to your podcast.

223
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,680
Oh, really?

224
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,265
That's cool.

225
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,102
I hear you're boring.

226
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,979
Who said that? I'm not boring.

227
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,899
I don't know. A lot of people.

228
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,859
Cool.

229
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,737
I'm sorry. That was mean.

230
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,490
I'm very bad at flirting.

231
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,202
And I'm also the type of person
who tells you I'm flirting,

232
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,037
which is so sexy.

233
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,288
It's okay.

234
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,791
What do you do?

235
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,378
For work? I do probate law.

236
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,089
I'm an estate planner. Basically,
I write people's wills.

237
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,508
Do you like it?

238
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,134
Oh, sure. When I was a kid,

239
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,378
first thing I would think
when I would meet someone is,

240
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,805
"Who's that person gonna leave
their shit to when they die?"

241
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,518
I really wanted to be part of
the legal logistics of that.

242
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,687
That's funny.

243
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,858
That guy's hot, right?

244
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,986
Oh, yeah. He is.

245
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm supposed to fuck him
and his husband later.

246
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,994
Cool.

247
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:07,913
Very good.

248
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,000
- Oh, I love this song.
- What is this?

249
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,045
Old-school Mariah. How
do you not know this?

250
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,508
I'm more of a country guy.
You know, like Garth Brooks.

251
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,468
Garth Brooks?

252
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,595
Who are you?

253
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,812
Actually, Carrie Underwood
blocked me on Twitter...

254
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,109
What the fuck?

255
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,777
Where the fuck did he go?

256
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,405
I don't know. This is
why I hate these people.

257
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,782
Oh, my God. That's
the 65-year-old.

258
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,285
Jesus, he's ripped.

259
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,288
I know. It's like they injected
steroids into Dumbledore.

260
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,589
Hey, what's up?

261
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,467
- Thanks.
- Hey. Where'd you go?

262
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,344
I don't know. Nowhere.

263
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,768
Yas, live your lives,
queens! Okurrr!

264
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,522
Gay guys are so stupid.

265
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:16,982
Oh, my God, I know.

266
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,568
Gay guys are usually
the absolute smartest

267
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,862
or the dumbest
people I've ever met.

268
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,032
We've been smart enough to brand
ourselves as being smart and clever.

269
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,658
I've hooked up with guys,

270
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,120
and afterwards I'll make a joke
or I'll say something sarcastic,

271
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,364
and the guy does not understand
that I'm making a joke.

272
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,584
Literally does not
understand satire.

273
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,920
I know. And straight people
think we're all smart,

274
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,005
but a lot of these
guys are dumb as shit.

275
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,089
Yes.

276
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,510
To our little secret.

277
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,731
Actually...

278
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,444
Are you fucking kidding me?

279
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,780
Hey.

280
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,115
Hey. What were you talking
to Aaron about for so long?

281
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,826
Just about how a lot of gay guys
are secretly incredibly stupid.

282
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,994
Oh, how fabulous.

283
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,830
I don't understand. We're having a
good time, and then he ghosts me.

284
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,624
He just fucking disappears.

285
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,338
Bobby, don't. Let
it go. He's a dick.

286
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,466
No, I am not letting it
go. I do not let things go.

287
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,468
- Why aren't you dancing?
- I am dancing, okay?

288
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,752
What do you want me to do,
the fucking <i>Nutcracker Suite</i>?

289
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,890
Hey.

290
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,058
Hey, what's up?

291
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,537
I tried to kiss you and you
didn't kiss me back is what's up.

292
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,062
I'm sorry. I'm shy.

293
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,522
Please. What are you into?

294
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,732
One of these boring, ripped
idiots with no opinions?

295
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:45,070
No, I'd like someone who's physically
very frail and won't stop talking.

296
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,247
Come home with me.

297
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,957
I can't.

298
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,083
Why?

299
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,670
'Cause you have to fuck the fake
baseball player and his husband?

300
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,256
I don't know what to tell you.

301
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,509
- Goodbye.
- Hey, wait, wait. Take my number.

302
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,219
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

303
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,221
Because I'm one of the
smart ones, asshole.

304
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,307
Oh, are you emotionally
unavailable?

305
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,851
No one's more emotionally
unavailable than me. No one.

306
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,686
I pride myself on that.

307
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,063
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Henry has my number.

308
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,358
See you on Grindr or Zellweger or
whatever the fuck the next one is.

309
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,027
I'm not on any of those.

310
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,862
Then how do you meet people?

311
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,448
I'm not really looking.

312
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:31,617
Yeah.

313
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,702
Me neither.

314
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,333
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

315
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,670
Oh, my God, they cannot stop
voguing. They cannot stop voguing.

316
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:47,257
Excuse me, I know you're voguing,
but can I please go home? Please?

317
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,844
<i>I had a gut feeling you
would be online now.</i>

318
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,471
<i>Hi.</i>

319
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,892
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

320
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,478
<i>Not much. You?</i>

321
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,898
<i>No. Okay.</i>

322
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,775
<i>But us texting each
other anonymously,</i>

323
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,487
<i>I never realized how much Grindr was
just like</i> You've Got Mail<i>. Smiley face.</i>

324
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,571
<i>Ha ha. LOL. Dick pic?</i>

325
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,866
<i>No dick pic. Sorry.</i>

326
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,242
<i>Think about</i> You've Got Mail.

327
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,079
<i>Meg Ryan would never send you
a picture of her genitalia.</i>

328
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,623
<i>Ha ha. LOLOL. Can
I see your ass?</i>

329
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,084
<i>Don't have ass pic. Sorry.</i>

330
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>Need to see ass pic though.</i>

331
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,170
<i>Don't have ass pic!</i>

332
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,257
<i>Not gonna meet up
unless you send ass pic.</i>

333
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,342
<i>Must see pic of ass!</i>

334
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,403
Ow! Fuck!

335
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,280
I'm bleeding!

336
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,115
How am I gonna shit now?

337
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,284
I can't fuck. I can't shit.

338
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm not a person, goddamn it!

339
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,001
It's too fucking flat.

340
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,681
<i>Took this just for you, bro.</i>

341
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,854
Did he block me?

342
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,856
Motherfucker!

343
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:30,235
<i>Hallheart proudly presents our
first bisexual holiday film,</i>

344
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,696
{\an8}<i>the award-winning</i>
Christmas with Either<i>.</i>

345
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:38,452
{\an8}<i>Hallheart. Always on the
cutting edge… of Christmas.</i>

346
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,288
People.

347
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,834
Okay. Okay, people! People,
please! It's getting late.

348
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,879
We still need to find a donor to
fund the exhibit in the final wing.

349
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,965
As you know, Pier 1 Imports was
supposed to make a big donation,

350
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,235
but they went bankrupt and have
been bought by the Taliban.

351
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,721
- Taliban.
- So we are short five million dollars.

352
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,640
We can't afford to
push our opening again.

353
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,484
People will think we're in trouble.
This whole place could fall apart.

354
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,246
We need new ideas for what goes in
the final wing, and we need them now.

355
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,271
Cherry, go.

356
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,233
You know the blue whale hanging
in the Museum of Natural History?

357
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,526
- Yes.
- What about that,

358
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,111
but instead of the blue whale,

359
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,530
it's a lesbian?

360
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,116
- Oh, no. No.
- Well, yeah, we can't do that.

361
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,245
What about a transgender woman
from an Indigenous nation?

362
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,955
Goddamn it, Wanda!

363
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,124
What about the 400 lesbians
who fought in the Civil War?

364
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,168
Shut up, Cherry. They
were not all lesbians.

365
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,586
Some of them were trans men.

366
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,092
Okay, stop. This building is a rare chance
to legitimize the history of bisexuals.

367
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,218
Oh, God. Here we go.

368
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,222
We say LGBTQ, but we
always skip over the B.

369
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:44,434
I want a hall of bisexuals. Like
Disney's Hall of Presidents.

370
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:49,106
I want a stage full of
animatronic, talking bisexuals.

371
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,942
Talking and moving and
gesturing bisexuals.

372
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,487
You know what? This happens
to be Bisexual Awareness Week,

373
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,365
and no one has acknowledged it!

374
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,367
- I acknowledged.
- That is true. My bad.

375
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,537
Lesbian History
Month was in March.

376
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,497
Nobody said a goddamn thing!

377
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,999
It's June!

378
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,500
It was in March!

379
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,003
Of course lesbians get a
month, and we get a week.

380
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,379
- Robert.
- What?

381
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,673
I want you to know
that I hear you.

382
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,842
I see you, and I'm
holding space for you.

383
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,011
There she go. There she go.

384
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:23,348
She never has any ideas of her own,
but she's always "holding space."

385
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,726
A lesbian wrote
"America the Beautiful."

386
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,227
God, no. I can't.

387
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,688
Katharine Lee Bates wrote
the lyrics on a napkin.

388
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,650
If you go to her house in
Virginia, they have the napkin!

389
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,946
What if the final exhibit was a
recreation of a queer wedding?

390
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,781
- I like that.
- Okay, that I don't hate.

391
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,576
Tamara, that is so
sweet. I love that.

392
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,859
And people can come and
register for wedding gifts here.

393
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,038
Oh, my God. And...

394
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,121
No!

395
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,750
That is old-fashioned,
heteronormative nonsense.

396
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,753
We need to get people to rethink
history through a queer prism,

397
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,231
not comfort them with another
fucking gay wedding, all right?

398
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,840
It's a museum. It's
not <i>Schitt's Creek</i>.

399
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,092
- I like <i>Schitt's Creek</i>.
- Love <i>Schitt's Creek</i>.

400
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,385
That show has layers.

401
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,137
Everyone loves
<i>Schitt's Creek. </i>Okay.

402
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,723
That's who you remind
me of. Eugene Levy.

403
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,891
Yes.

404
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,644
Okay, Mr. Funk.

405
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,771
How can I help you today?

406
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,689
I need to adjust my will.

407
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,608
Okay. Can I ask you why?

408
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,444
Because I'm dying.
I have cancer.

409
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,196
I'm so sorry to hear that.

410
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,865
I just need to figure out
where my money's going.

411
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,576
Okay, do you have a
partner or spouse?

412
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,245
No and no.

413
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,371
- Children?
- No.

414
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,122
- Family member?
- No.

415
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,206
Close friend?

416
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,667
Not anymore.

417
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,961
Okay, um…

418
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,547
Well, sometimes it
helps to close your eyes

419
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,633
and think about who means
the most to you in the world.

420
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,597
Who is it?

421
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,599
Cher.

422
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,645
Okay, so you want
to leave $100,000…

423
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:53,647
to Cher?

424
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,775
Do you really think
that she needs that?

425
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,027
She has a huge staff.

426
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,029
- O-Okay.
- Mr. Shepard, I...

427
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:04,074
Sorry to interrupt.
Mrs. Bailey passed away.

428
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,662
Oh, God. This is so depressing.

429
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,331
I'm so sorry. I can only imagine
what you're going through.

430
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,500
No, I mean your job.

431
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,793
What a downer.

432
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,050
<i>It's Aaron. How's Grindr?</i>

433
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,514
<i>A dream. I spent 45 minutes
taking a picture of my own ass.</i>

434
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,059
<i>How are you? How was group sex
with that faux Chicago Cub?</i>

435
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,103
<i>It was fun. They invited
me back tomorrow.</i>

436
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,907
<i>Their surrogate is pregnant, and
they're having a gender-reveal orgy.</i>

437
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,733
<i>A gender-reveal orgy?</i>

438
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,610
<i>James Baldwin would be so proud.</i>

439
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,365
<i>LOL.</i>

440
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,493
<i>I woke up laughing about you so
rudely calling me out on my shit.</i>

441
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,995
<i>Well, you deserved it, bitch.</i>

442
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,373
<i>Honestly, I was impressed. You may be
more emotionally unavailable than I am.</i>

443
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,043
<i>Well, maybe we can be
emotionally unavailable together.</i>

444
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,670
<i>"Maybe we can be emotionally
unavailable together"?</i>

445
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,923
<i>Who's writing your
texts? Maroon 5?</i>

446
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,674
- <i>Fuck off.
- </i>-<i>Kidding!</i>

447
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,801
<i>We can go out. Are
you asking me out?</i>

448
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,678
<i>- I'm down for whatever.
- Yeah, same.</i>

449
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:07,804
<i>- Cool.
- Sounds good.</i>

450
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,806
<i>So, tomorrow? Or
we can do whenever.</i>

451
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,892
<i>Yeah, I can do whenever,
and I can do whatever.</i>

452
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,602
- <i>I don't care what we do.
</i>- <i>Me neither.</i>

453
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,604
<i>We can do whatever, and
we can do it whenever.</i>

454
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,624
<i>- Does that work for you?
- That definitely works.</i>

455
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,234
<i>- Great. Whatever, whenever.
- Cool. Whatever, whenever.</i>

456
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,027
<i>GIF of Michael Scott dancing.</i>

457
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,028
That's good.

458
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,739
<i>Office</i> GIF? This
person isn't gay.

459
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,659
<i>Heart. Ugh, no.
Un-heart. Thumbs up.</i>

460
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,078
- <i>Peace.
</i>- Peace?

461
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,204
<i>Later.</i>

462
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:35,040
Can't you heart my later, bitch?

463
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:36,792
<i>Bye!</i>

464
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,675
You're from here, right? Your
parents still live in the city?

465
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,261
No. My parents both
passed away, actually.

466
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,345
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,514
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
It wasn't recent.

468
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,393
My mom died when I was in college,
and my dad died ten years ago.

469
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,644
A bee! A bee! A bee! A bee!

470
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,771
Whoa, whoa! Stop swatting!
You're gonna kill it.

471
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,655
That's what I'm trying
to do. It's on my neck.

472
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,971
Bees are dying. Don't you read?

473
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,526
Yes! About gay stuff and movies.

474
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,112
- Can you do something?
- Yes, yes, yes. Here. It's okay.

475
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,823
- You're touching the bee!
- I know. Okay.

476
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,578
Wow. Thank you.

477
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,580
You're like a grown-up
gay Boy Scout,

478
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:18,000
and I'm like whatever ends
up happening to Evan Hansen.

479
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,877
Let me see what's playing.

480
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,964
What's your favorite
movie of all time?

481
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,800
What's my favorite movie
of all time? I don't know.

482
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,664
Why? What's your favorite movie?

483
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,345
<i>The Hangover</i>.

484
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,432
<i>The Hangover</i> is your
favorite movie of all time?

485
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,267
How many movies
have you seen? One?

486
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,393
It's a funny movie.

487
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,477
Yeah, kinda.

488
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,897
And you remember one of the
first lines of that movie?

489
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,774
- "Paging Dr. Faggot." Remember that?
- Yes.

490
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,776
"Paging Dr. Faggot" is
one of the first lines

491
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,322
of the highest-grossing comedy of
2009, and no one talks about it. Right?

492
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,408
And it wasn't that long ago. We're
just supposed to laugh it off.

493
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,244
It doesn't bother me. I'm
not sensitive like that.

494
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,128
I think you just like
getting angry at things.

495
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,165
Getting angry at things
is like your brand.

496
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,876
What? No, it's not! Fuck you.

497
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,504
Getting angry at things is
my brand? No, no, no, no.

498
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,547
You just don't like to complain because
that means your feelings were hurt.

499
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,426
And that means admitting you're
weak. And that's too vulnerable.

500
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,970
And as much as we go around
saying men should be vulnerable,

501
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,097
you and I both know
that is such bullshit.

502
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,599
Because for a lot
of these gay guys,

503
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,935
sweetness and vulnerability
are wonderful and lovely,

504
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,978
but they can also be
a real boner killer.

505
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,481
You're very intense.

506
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:24,733
Yes.

507
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,486
I was kidding, by the way.

508
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,239
- About what?
- <i>The Hangover</i>. It's not my favorite movie.

509
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,324
No, you weren't.

510
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,160
Yeah, I was. I just like
seeing you get riled up.

511
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,829
- I don't believe you.
- I was kidding.

512
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,083
Hmm.

513
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,043
I don't like this.

514
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:50,592
Okay. Let's see what
we have here. Mm-mmm.

515
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,595
Oh, <i>The Treasure Inside</i> is supposed
to be really good, actually.

516
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,847
What's that about?

517
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,184
It's about two closeted gay frontiersmen
in the California Gold Rush of 1849.

518
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,388
But really, it's about two straight actors
playing gay, trying to win an Oscar.

519
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,357
I never tire of watching
two very straight actors

520
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,068
really transform themselves
into being sad and gay.

521
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,279
Gay actors playing gay.
That's not even acting.

522
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,613
Oh, I totally agree.

523
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:14,825
If they ever make a movie about my life,
they'd better hire a straight actor.

524
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,035
I like to think of my life
story as just another way

525
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,037
for Benedict Cumberbatch
to really score.

526
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,332
Okay, if we don't see this
movie, what are we gonna do?

527
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,209
I didn't say I didn't
want to see the movie.

528
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,653
- Oh!
- I'll see the fucking movie.

529
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,337
I'm dying to.

530
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,216
I'd put it way above
<i>Call Me by Your Name</i>

531
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,594
but sort of below <i>Dallas Buyers.</i>

532
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,053
Well, it got me in the end.

533
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,347
Yeah, but why does it
always have to be so tragic?

534
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,808
I don't know. <i>Philadelphia</i>,
<i>Milk, Brokeback.</i>

535
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,518
Happy endings don't win Oscars.

536
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,520
Straight people love
seeing us miserable.

537
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,898
- Mmm.
- Wait, Aaron Shepard?

538
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,234
Josh Evans? Holy shit!

539
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,296
- Hey, man. Bro! Nice to see you.
- What is up, dude?

540
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,779
It's been for-fucking-ever.

541
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,623
Aaron and I, we played
hockey in high school.

542
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,949
This is my fiancée, Samantha.

543
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,618
- Hey!
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

544
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,411
This is Bobby.

545
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,495
- Hey.
- Hey.

546
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:04,124
We just saw <i>The Treasure Inside</i>.
It's about closeted gay frontiersmen.

547
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,209
Oh. Okay. Nice.

548
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,377
It's just some dumb movie.

549
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,422
Oh, wait. I wanna see
that. Gay guys are my jam.

550
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,717
So, what are you
guys doing here?

551
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,596
Just a little trip. It's her first time
in New York City. This city is sick.

552
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,681
- It really is.
- Yeah.

553
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,975
Well… awesome!

554
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,227
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Bob.

555
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,686
Nice to meet you guys.

556
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,815
That is crazy. I never run
into anybody from my hometown.

557
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:32,319
Oh, yeah, bro. Totally, bro.
Just some dumb movie, bro.

558
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,030
I had the biggest crush
on him in high school.

559
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,782
Yep. That tracks.

560
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:42,454
Well, like the bearded lady in
<i>The Greatest Showman</i>, this is me.

561
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:45,999
Oh.

562
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,961
The faux Chicago Cub?

563
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,754
Yeah. His husband
just sent me that.

564
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,924
Wow. They are extremely hot.

565
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,207
Yeah, Mike and Doug. They're
these roided-out meatheads.

566
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,020
They're not the brightest,
but they're sweet.

567
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,514
Do you wanna go over there?

568
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,015
Wait. Are you ditching me again

569
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,393
to go fuck the baseball
cosplayer and his husband?

570
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,687
No, I'm not ditching
you. I'm inviting you.

571
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,399
Why don't you just
come upstairs?

572
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:14,111
Uh… I don't really do the whole
relationship thing very well.

573
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,737
Relationship?

574
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,782
When did I say I wanted to be
in a relationship with you?

575
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,534
We literally hung out one day.

576
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:24,037
Yeah, but if I go upstairs, it
becomes like a whole thing and…

577
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,498
Whatever. We should just go
over there. It'll be fun.

578
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:29,262
I'm not gonna go, but you should
go. Can I ask you one thing though?

579
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,628
Why did you text me if
you didn't wanna hook up?

580
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,964
I'm not angry. I'm
just honestly curious.

581
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,508
I didn't say I
didn't wanna... I...

582
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,729
I guess I had fun talking
to you at the club,

583
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,973
and I wanted to say,
"Hey, what's up?"

584
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,267
"Hey, what's up?" So
basically you texted me

585
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,603
when you were feeling hungover
and lonely in that moment,

586
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,772
but you're not actually into me,
but you went on the date anyway.

587
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,941
Why are gay guys so weird?

588
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,693
Actually, you know,
we're not weird.

589
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,362
We're just constantly catering
to our own whims and needs,

590
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,781
which can change on a dime,
but we never even think about

591
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,742
the emotional consequences
of the other person.

592
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,537
Anyway, it's been a blast
catering to your whims.

593
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,873
And, honestly, I can't
really say anything about it

594
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,751
because I do the same thing
to people all the time, so…

595
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,546
- Fun day.
- Fun day.

596
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,423
- And, um…
- Yeah.

597
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,176
- Have fun with those guys.
- Okay. Bye.

598
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,347
Bobby, wait.

599
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,483
I had a really nice time today.

600
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:35,692
Me too.

601
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,861
I never go on dates,
but that was really fun.

602
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,030
Yeah. I had a really
good time too.

603
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,876
Hey, I'm gonna go.

604
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,337
Oh, really?

605
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,797
Yeah.

606
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,257
Is everything okay?
Is this weird?

607
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,677
Oh, no, no, no. No, it's fun.
It's great. I'm just gonna go.

608
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,387
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll see you.

609
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,931
- All right. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

610
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,975
Hey, guys. I'm gonna
go. Thank you so much.

611
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,852
- No. You're leaving?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

612
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,163
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too. It was lovely.

613
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,605
- Thank you. Night.
- All right.

614
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,607
Okay. Okay.

615
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,735
Thanks for coming. We're
convinced Brian's gay,

616
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,139
and I think it's good for him
to have his gay uncle around.

617
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,700
Oh, my God. Of course. I'm always here
to be a good "guncle" to my "g-nephew."

618
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,704
Uncle Bobby, will you read my
report? It's about Freddie Mercury.

619
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,455
He's obsessed with
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>.

620
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,582
Oh, my God. I love this.

621
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,945
And like that movie, does your report take
a story about one of the great gay icons

622
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,442
and make it about that one time
he maybe had sex with a woman?

623
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,673
- I thought Freddie Mercury was bi.
- He had a wife.

624
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,758
Yeah, well, so did
Jesus, and he was gay.

625
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:45,596
This is excellent and an
improvement on the film. Good job!

626
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,390
What are those GIFs
from <i>The Hangover</i>?

627
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:51,560
Nothing. This guy I went out
with won't stop texting me.

628
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,978
A guy?

629
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,730
Really? Like a Grindr guy?

630
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,357
No, shockingly. I actually
met this one in real life.

631
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:01,528
Bobby! That's fantastic! You
think you're gonna see him again?

632
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:04,531
No. He told me he prefers
group sex to one-on-one

633
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,409
because one-on-one is too intense
and makes it a whole thing.

634
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,786
We went on one date, and we
had sex with three people.

635
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,372
Gay relationships these
days are like a clown car.

636
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,958
Oh, there's another one. Oh,
look, another one. Another one.

637
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,503
It's ridiculous. Plus, I
don't think I'm his type.

638
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,296
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

639
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,133
He told me he likes country music, and
his favorite singer is Garth Brooks.

640
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,657
What kind of gay man says his
favorite singer is Garth Brooks?

641
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,720
That scares me.

642
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,431
Plus, I see the guys he likes.
They all look exactly like him.

643
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:34,645
They're all these big, hot,
straight-acting dudes. It's just not me.

644
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,397
- Is he a top or bottom?
- What does that have to do with anything?

645
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,441
Maybe you're both bottoms,
and that's the problem.

646
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,485
I'm not always
the bottom, Edgar.

647
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,986
Bottom dance!

648
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,488
- Yeah!
- Ooh! Bottom dance!

649
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,823
Ooh-ooh. Uh-uh-uh.

650
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:47,991
Oh, my God.

651
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,326
Gay sex was more fun

652
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,411
when straight people were
uncomfortable with it.

653
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,496
Fucking <i>Schitt's Creek</i>.

654
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,666
Maybe we should stop talking about
anal sex in front of your children.

655
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,669
- Oh, please. It's a natural part of life.
- Nah.

656
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,631
Bobby! Ask him out again.
You never like anyone.

657
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,547
He is so handsome.

658
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,882
- So are you.
- Dude, you're a hottie.

659
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,593
He is on another level.
He's like gay Tom Brady.

660
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,679
When I'm with him, I feel
like friggin' Elphaba.

661
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,430
I bet he's as intimidated by you

662
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,699
- as you are by him.
- Oh, yeah.

663
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,976
I'm telling you. He's
scared of being vulnerable.

664
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,604
Gay guys from your generation still have
all these pent-up masculinity issues.

665
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,128
You all need to get
over it already.

666
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:21,191
Half the kids in Brian's
class are nonbinary.

667
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,152
Well, it's not fair, Tina. We
had AIDS, and they had <i>Glee</i>.

668
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,658
But there is a work thing I was thinking
of maybe inviting him to. Maybe.

669
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,579
What, a work thing? With lots
of celebrities and fancy people?

670
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,414
Now, are you gonna
peacock to impress him?

671
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,624
No! It's just a big
fundraiser for the museum,

672
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,917
and I need to bring someone.

673
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,294
Are you gonna be onstage?

674
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,504
No, I am not going to
be "onstage." Okay?

675
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,007
I am not some sort of
narcissistic sociopath.

676
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,467
Thank you, Doja Cat.

677
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:53,640
Everyone, there are rock paintings in
Zimbabwe which depict homosexuality

678
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:57,019
that date back to
the year 2,000 BCE.

679
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,439
If only the men on those paintings
had lived another 4,000 years

680
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,067
to see a character come out on
<i>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>.

681
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,195
Who did your chin?

682
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,571
Oh, no. It's real.

683
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,574
Yeah. Mine too.

684
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,743
Please continue
to give generously

685
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,705
so the museum can tell all the stories
in between that have never been told.

686
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,249
Thank you very much. Good night.

687
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,834
Yeah, all right!

688
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:25,440
Hey, I'm so sorry I left you
alone. Things got a little crazy.

689
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,591
No. Hey, dude, you were awesome.

690
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,092
I mean, I could never do that,

691
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,136
speak in front of a bunch
of people like that.

692
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,347
You move in some pretty
fancy circles. I had no idea.

693
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,474
Trust me, it's not
always this glamorous.

694
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,019
- Bobby, that was amazing, as always.
- Oh. Thank you, Charles.

695
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,782
- Congrats on everything.
- Thank you so much. Thank you for coming.

696
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,482
- Thank you.
- Great speech, Bobby!

697
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,108
Hi. Thank you so much.

698
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,712
Hey, do you wanna see the museum?
I can give you a private tour.

699
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,197
Oh, sure. I don't wanna drag
you away from all this though.

700
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,366
- Oh, no. It's fine. Here. That way.
- Yeah. Okay.

701
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:57,204
{\an8}This is The Legends Pavilion.
Unsung heroes from LGBTQ+ history.

702
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,207
Marsha P. Johnson
and Sylvia Rivera.

703
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,794
Usually Stonewall is the only thing
straight people know about queer history.

704
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:07,214
Truthfully, no one really knows who
threw the first bricks at Stonewall,

705
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,550
but it was trans women of
color like Marsha and Sylvia

706
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,135
who drove the earliest days of
the queer liberation movement.

707
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,848
So what do you think? It's
pretty incredible, right?

708
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:18,809
Yeah! I mean, it's
really impressive.

709
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:20,643
But?

710
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,521
But it's kinda depressing.

711
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,648
It's depressing? It
made you depressed?

712
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,193
It's AIDS and Nazis
and homophobia.

713
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,987
All of it's just...
It's kind of a downer.

714
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,283
Okay. Well, what were you
expecting? A <i>Night at the Museum</i>?

715
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,951
Honestly, my family
loves that movie.

716
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,370
- Oh, okay.
- Oh! What if you did something like that?

717
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,831
Where the things, they come
alive, and they talk at you.

718
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,585
"Where the things come
alive, and they talk at you"?

719
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,253
- Yeah.
- Like, what exactly?

720
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,672
Oh, oh. What if we had a bust
of Eleanor Roosevelt, right?

721
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,108
- Yeah.
- And you get really close.

722
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,177
And then all of a sudden, you
realize that's not Eleanor Roosevelt.

723
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,262
- It's Amy Schumer.
- Oh.

724
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,891
No! It's a museum. It's
not supposed to be fun.

725
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,562
Bobby! We've got Debra
Messing's agent on the Zoom.

726
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,022
It's urgent.

727
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,399
Debra's worried that she's on
the verge of being canceled.

728
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,194
She said in an interview that
she was the Viola Davis of Tufts,

729
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,571
and people are mad.

730
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,866
Her agent is saying that she may give
a very big donation to the museum

731
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,284
to save face.

732
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,368
Who's Debra Messing?

733
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,495
From <i>Will & Grace</i>. Oh, my God!

734
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,699
Okay, wait. This is amazing.

735
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,582
Stay here. I'll be
back in five minutes.

736
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:24,958
- Sure. Yep.
- Okay.

737
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,917
Aaron?

738
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:10,712
Aaron?

739
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,345
What the fuck?

740
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,016
<i>Say hi to your brother.</i>

741
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,518
- <i>Sup.
</i>- Sup.

742
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,062
<i>Jason's staying here while
he figures out where to live.</i>

743
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,939
<i>Never get divorced, Aaron.</i>

744
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,023
<i>Never get married.</i>

745
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,652
Okay, Mom. I'm sorry, I'm at work,
so I should probably get going.

746
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,988
<i>Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.</i>

747
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,906
<i>Do you remember Josh Evans?</i>

748
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,867
Yeah, Josh Evans
from high school.

749
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,661
I actually ran into him and his
fiancée on the street the other day.

750
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,581
<i>Well, they just broke up.
And you wanna know why?</i>

751
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,499
<i>Because he's gay.</i>

752
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,336
Josh Ev... No.

753
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,798
<i>I'm definitely embarrassed about
how long this has taken me,</i>

754
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,926
<i>but I'm told people do
this in their own time.</i>

755
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,221
<i>I've been empowered by my
hero, Colton Underwood,</i>

756
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,973
<i>to say that, as it turns out,</i>

757
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,058
<i>I'm gay.</i>

758
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,479
{\an8}<i>And like this post if you
like that I'm gay. Peace.</i>

759
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,649
Holy shit.

760
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,694
So we started going back
and forth for a while,

761
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,906
and then at the end, I was just like,
"Why don't you call the album <i>Lemonade</i>?"

762
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,620
Bobby? When you're ready.

763
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,955
- What?
- When you're ready.

764
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,290
Sorry.

765
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:32,711
Okay. People wonder if America is
ready for its first gay president.

766
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,422
I say, we already had one.

767
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:37,341
For the final wing,
please consider,

768
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:40,802
The Lincoln Letters: A
Gay American Love Story.

769
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:44,348
For years, historians have
speculated about Lincoln's sexuality.

770
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:48,393
He shared a bed and exchanged intimate
letters with multiple men over the years,

771
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,729
including Joshua Speed
and David Derickson.

772
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:52,356
Okay, I'm stopping you.

773
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,608
Bobby, it won't work. You
can't say Lincoln was gay.

774
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,692
Why?

775
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:58,057
There's no way to confirm those
were sexual relationships.

776
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,738
There's no evidence of love.

777
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,949
Of course there's no
evidence of love, Robert.

778
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,868
We weren't allowed to exist. How
would we have enough evidence?

779
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,412
Lincoln was married to a
woman and had four children.

780
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,665
He was not gay, Bobby.

781
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,832
He might have been bi.

782
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:11,917
I am telling you!

783
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,629
We have let the world erase gay love
stories since the beginning of time.

784
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,550
This is our chance to reject
the shame and restore the truth.

785
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,513
And if we don't do this,
we're letting them win.

786
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,595
We're letting the
heterosexual terrorists win.

787
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,639
- The heterosexual terrorists?
- That's right.

788
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,558
There are also gay terrorists.

789
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:31,228
And there are bi terrorists, okay?
There are many bisexual terrorists.

790
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,980
Okay, there are
trans terrorists too.

791
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,064
Caitlyn Jenner.

792
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,650
Enough, people.
Let's vote on it.

793
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:40,237
Okay.

794
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:45,242
Looks like we have two votes for
The Great Bisexuals of the World.

795
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,702
Thank you, someone.

796
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:48,954
And three votes for The
Lincoln Letters. Lincoln wins.

797
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,331
Yes! Thank you. Thank you.

798
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:56,086
Debra Messing is
in the building.

799
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,130
Yes, my girl.

800
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,134
- Are you okay? Debra Messing.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

801
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,761
Okay. Wish me luck.

802
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,639
Ms. Messing.

803
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,808
Oh, please call me Debra.

804
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:13,812
Oh! I love this space.
How did you find it?

805
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,565
Oh. God. How did we find it?

806
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,151
Um… I don't know. I'm sorry.

807
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,319
Are you okay, dear?

808
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,779
You seem a little flustered.

809
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:25,991
Trust me. I know I'm Debra
Messing, but I'm only human.

810
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:29,494
Right. Um, no, I'm
fine. It's a...

811
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,378
I'm so sorry. It's boy
problems. It's nothing.

812
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,456
- It's stupid.
- Oh.

813
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,166
Yeah. He was actually
here last night.

814
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,960
He came to the fundraiser with me,
and then out of nowhere, he left.

815
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,938
And I keep texting him and
he doesn't text me back.

816
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,964
I don't know. It doesn't
matter. How are you?

817
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,300
I am so excited for this tour.

818
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,843
Can I just ask you
really quickly?

819
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,513
Because I actually think you're
the perfect person to ask.

820
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:48,680
What is going on?

821
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:52,684
You know, is he not interested in
me or did something really come up?

822
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:55,437
And why am I thinking about it so
much? That's what's so annoying.

823
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,524
Because I'm never distracted
like this. This is not who I am.

824
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,693
And it's like, what do I do now?
Do I text him again? Do I call him?

825
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,613
Do I go to his house, you know?

826
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,406
What do I do, Debra?

827
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,409
You know, for the last 25 years,

828
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:14,206
I have been listening to every
gay man on earth complain to me.

829
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:18,085
I am not my character. I am not
every gay man's best friend.

830
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:23,382
I am simply out in the world thinking
that I'm gonna get a tour of a museum,

831
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,716
but no. No!

832
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,387
Did I waltz in here and
lay all my shit on you?

833
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,639
Answer me! Answer me!

834
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:31,825
- I'm just... I...
- Shut up!

835
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,184
I am a divorced single mother.

836
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,853
You wanna hear what that's like?

837
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,980
I'm so sorry about this.
I'm terribly embarrassed.

838
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,147
Please let me start again.

839
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,358
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on in here?

840
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,653
Do you have some personal shit
you wanna complain to me about?

841
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,446
- No.
- Of course not.

842
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,492
Because lesbians have
their shit together.

843
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,120
I gotta go. I lose
my sitter in an hour.

844
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,205
Ms. Messing, please
come back. I'm so sorry.

845
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,750
I am not Grace.

846
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,253
It is a character.

847
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,964
I won an Emmy for it.

848
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:07,968
I even beat Sarah Jessica
Parker! People forget!

849
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,511
I'm shaving my head.

850
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,598
What the fuck is
this doing here?

851
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,683
Bobby! What is
going on with you?

852
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,602
Debra Messing just
told you to fuck off.

853
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,395
The door's fucking locked.

854
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,558
Oh, please let me help you.

855
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,023
No. I want her.

856
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:28,238
<i>Don't call him.</i>

857
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,658
<i>Don't call him. Don't call him.</i>

858
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:34,786
<i>Do not call him.</i>

859
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:41,710
<i>Just watch </i>Ozark. Ozark.
<i>Like a normal person.</i>

860
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,012
Hey, it's me.

861
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:57,267
Um… Call me when you're
around. Okay, bye.

862
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:01,897
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

863
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:03,899
<i>What's up?</i>

864
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,819
<i>Sorry I haven't replied.
I've just been busy.</i>

865
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,030
<i>No worries. Same.</i>

866
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,120
<i>You wanna hang out this weekend?</i>

867
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:28,841
<i>Hey, Bobby. I have to be honest. I
really like hanging out with you.</i>

868
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:31,426
<i>You're so smart and funny,</i>

869
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,221
<i>but I'm not sure I'm
the right match for you.</i>

870
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,557
<i>I'm not sure I'm at your level.</i>

871
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,643
<i>Maybe your friends were right
when they said I was boring.</i>

872
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,062
<i>Good luck with everything.</i>

873
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:45,774
Oh, come on.

874
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:56,493
<i>Sure.</i>

875
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:06,336
Why are you sitting on the grass
and not this gigantic blanket?

876
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,590
I like grass.

877
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,010
Mmm. Cool. Cool.

878
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,934
So, what's up?

879
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,853
What's been going on?

880
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:25,063
Oh, wait. Crazy story.

881
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,858
Remember that guy I ran into?
That old buddy from high school?

882
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,027
- Yeah.
- Yeah. He just came out.

883
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,320
What?

884
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,155
Broke up with his
fiancée. I had no idea.

885
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,490
- Wow.
- Crazy.

886
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:38,118
- Good for him.
- Yeah, it's cool.

887
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,831
Very cool.

888
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,087
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on?

889
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,714
What do you mean?

890
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,966
The other night. Leaving
me at the museum like that.

891
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,730
And then you didn't
return any of my texts.

892
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,137
Well, you texted me 15
times. It was a little scary.

893
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,681
Okay, I need you to
be honest with me.

894
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:01,183
You're not attracted
to me, right?

895
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,727
It's okay. I can handle
it. I won't be insulted.

896
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,980
I just need to know. Just be honest
with me so I don't waste my time.

897
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:08,565
I'm not your type, right?

898
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,235
Bobby, it's not that. You
are a very attractive guy.

899
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,736
Okay. Well, thanks.

900
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,447
So why are you being so
weird and passive-aggressive?

901
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,115
Look, you're being
very loud, actually.

902
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,201
- You like dumb guys.
- What?

903
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:21,286
Yeah, you heard me.
I see what you like.

904
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:26,625
You like these big, fuckin'
bro-ey meathead idiots.

905
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,628
Is that what you
like, Aaron? Yeah?

906
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,964
- You wanna play with the big boys, huh?
- Yep.

907
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,967
Look, Aaron, they're fighting.
You wanna be in the fight?

908
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,594
You wanna be back in the old
high school locker room, huh?

909
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:42,933
With your hockey friends stealing a
glance at fucking Josh, right? Huh?

910
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,309
- Yeah, you like that?
- Hey.

911
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:45,811
- Yeah, I can be tough.
- Wow.

912
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,312
I can be tough like your boys.

913
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,523
- That's what you like?
- You stop that. Listen to me.

914
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:50,750
Now you're on my blanket, bro.

915
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,460
- Get on my blanket.
- Now I'm on your blanket.

916
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:53,944
Now you wanna get
on my big blanket?

917
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:55,612
Now you wanna be
on my big blanket?

918
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,865
- I can be aggressive.
- I can be way more aggressive.

919
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,616
- Yeah?
- Yeah? Yeah.

920
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,535
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

921
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:02,744
I'm all over your blanket.

922
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:03,829
Boys? Oh.

923
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,708
- Okay, man.
- My bad.

924
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:08,834
I would've helped him.

925
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:09,918
My place is near here.

926
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,753
- Let's go the fuck home.
- Yeah.

927
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,756
Ow! Ow! Oh, ow!

928
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:19,720
- Whoa, whoa!
- Yeah.

929
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:21,597
Yeah.

930
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:27,311
Yeah. I like that. I like that.

931
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,580
- You like that?
- I like that.

932
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,898
You're gonna take that?
Yeah, that's what you like.

933
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,649
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Dirty.

934
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:33,734
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God.

935
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:38,739
Oh, yeah.

936
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:43,827
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

937
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,495
Uh-huh.

938
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:49,666
- You like that? Yes, okay.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

939
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,168
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

940
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,711
Yeah.

941
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:55,339
Okay. Good? Yeah?

942
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:58,467
- Ooh, yeah? You gonna tap out?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll tap out.

943
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,511
- Yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- I'll tap out.

944
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,471
- Say, "Tap out." Tap out!
- I'll tap out!

945
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,389
- Are you good? Are you good?
- I tapped out.

946
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:05,974
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- I tapped out.

947
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,979
Oh! Oh!

948
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,190
- Great. Yeah, you like that?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

949
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,399
- You like that?
- Uh-huh.

950
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,568
- You like that? You like that?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

951
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:19,005
- You like that? Oh, yeah. You like that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,309
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

953
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:22,157
- You like poppers?
- Yeah.

954
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,242
Okay.

955
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:27,955
Uh-huh.

956
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,572
- That was crazy.
- Yeah.

957
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,080
I like how your chest
goes in like that.

958
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,875
Oh. Thank you.

959
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,419
It's called a concave chest.

960
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:17,796
Well, I like it.

961
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,174
It's like a tiny birdbath.

962
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,177
It's like a birdbath?

963
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:28,473
Great. I always wanted my chest to
look exactly like a tiny birdbath.

964
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:29,892
It's what every man wants.

965
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,563
I like how hairy you are.

966
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,065
You're like Austin Powers.

967
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,695
Thank you.

968
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,614
God, I never thought
I would date someone

969
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:47,201
who gets more excited about
Austin Powers than Debra Messing.

970
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,328
Where did I go wrong?

971
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,289
Wait. Are we dating?

972
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:56,585
No.

973
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:01,298
We're not dating.
Please. I was joking.

974
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,092
You don't date people.
I don't date people.

975
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,677
We don't date people.

976
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:08,805
- Remember?
- I remember.

977
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:14,102
Ow! What are you doing?

978
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:30,744
So annoying how good a warm body
feels laying on another warm body.

979
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:40,838
Ugh.

980
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:46,218
- Hmm?
- I hate getting work emails on a Sunday.

981
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:49,972
Your job is really intense.

982
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,682
Yes, and I hate it.

983
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,521
It's fucking stressful and depressing
and so fucking boring. I...

984
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,690
I fucking hate it.

985
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,026
I'm sorry.

986
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,904
Was there something
else you wanted to do?

987
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,284
Bobby, I need to
tell you something.

988
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,791
When I was younger…

989
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:22,963
- What happened?
- I...

990
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,385
You can tell me.

991
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,686
When I was younger, I wanted
to make little chocolates.

992
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,150
You wanted to make…
little chocolates?

993
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:46,528
Yes. I used to tell my parents that I
was going to the arcade at the mall,

994
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:48,655
but I would sneak off to Godiva.

995
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,782
I just loved how all the
chocolates were wrapped.

996
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,106
And I thought about how I
would design my own chocolates.

997
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,747
How each little chocolate has its
own specific, unique design on it.

998
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,416
And that little design tells you
what they're gonna taste like.

999
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:04,004
So, I would draw my own
chocolates in a notepad.

1000
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:05,714
It's all I thought about,

1001
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,674
tiny little pretty chocolates.

1002
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:09,927
That's good.

1003
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,680
What was I gonna do with that,
though? What was I gonna be?

1004
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:16,725
A chocolatier?

1005
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,937
Bobby, I wasn't gonna be
a fucking chocolatier.

1006
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,688
I don't know. Why not?

1007
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:23,440
It seemed kinda faggy.

1008
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,567
Oh, my God, Aaron.

1009
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,694
Faggy?

1010
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,739
It's not faggy to spend your life
making pretty little chocolates.

1011
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,659
- Bobby.
- Okay, fine. But so what?

1012
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:36,119
So you're a big fag.
So am I. It's great.

1013
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,247
Did you not realize
that a few minutes ago

1014
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,333
when you were sticking your
enormous penis into my tiny anus?

1015
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:44,169
Okay, yeah. It's kind of
cliché, don't you think?

1016
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:46,672
I'd rather be a cliché
than be miserable.

1017
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:52,010
Well, my 15-year-old brain in
1995, that is all I thought about.

1018
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:56,139
That was right around the time
that my brother caught me.

1019
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,641
Hooking up with a guy?

1020
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,977
No. No, I was making
little chocolates.

1021
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,061
Oh.

1022
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,480
I lied, and I said that I was…

1023
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,527
making chocolates for this girl
that I had a crush on at school.

1024
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,155
I'm sorry. This is the
cutest thing I've ever heard.

1025
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,658
I guess you just have
this big, exciting life.

1026
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:18,579
I just didn't want you to think
that I was some boring schlub.

1027
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,540
I don't think you're boring.

1028
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:23,333
Your friend said I was boring.

1029
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:26,628
Oh, my God. You
were mad about that?

1030
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:29,173
I was joking. I'm sorry.

1031
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,424
But I don't understand.

1032
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:33,135
You don't have to be stuck in
that miserable office all day.

1033
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,639
You could be out in the world, I
don't know, making fudge. You know?

1034
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:40,225
You're like a Keebler elf
with internalized homophobia.

1035
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:43,145
You have to do this. You
have to become a chocolatier.

1036
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,229
Oh, Bobby.

1037
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,481
You have to become a
chocolatier. I'm telling you.

1038
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:48,942
You make that sound so easy.

1039
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,611
Well, no. It's not easy.

1040
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,404
Nothing's easy.

1041
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,616
My God. You know what I
have to do this weekend?

1042
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:59,369
I have to drag my concave chest up to
Provincetown and beg donors for money.

1043
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,873
I need five million dollars
or else the museum can't open.

1044
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,083
And it's Pride up there,

1045
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:08,253
so the museum has to have a float in
the parade, and that's a whole thing.

1046
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:12,007
I'm telling you, it is not
easy. It is never easy.

1047
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,053
But it's worth it.

1048
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:19,264
Hey, maybe I can come.

1049
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,017
To where?

1050
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:24,353
Provincetown?

1051
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:26,647
Oh.

1052
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:29,441
Yeah.

1053
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:39,743
Well, come, come, come.
Welcome. I'm Louis.

1054
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,453
Let me show you your bedroom.

1055
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:44,831
Thank you. Oh, my God.
This house is so beautiful.

1056
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,142
How long have you
had this place?

1057
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,253
I've been coming up
to P-town since 1976.

1058
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,337
Wow.

1059
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,547
Who are all these guys?

1060
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,841
Well, actually, that's me.

1061
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:57,427
Oh, my God. Louis,
you were so hot.

1062
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,762
Yeah, I know.

1063
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,014
Wow. Do any of these guys
still come up here too?

1064
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:03,058
No.

1065
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,395
By 1996, four of the
seven of them were gone.

1066
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,439
I got this place in 1999
when I realized that somehow,

1067
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:11,525
miraculously, I
was gonna survive.

1068
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:12,818
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1069
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:15,153
So, tell me. What are
you boys up to today?

1070
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:19,074
Well, I have a work thing this
afternoon, so I don't really know.

1071
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,993
- Probably just lay low.
- Lay low?

1072
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,079
You're in P-town.
Go out. Have fun.

1073
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,081
You'll be dead soon
enough. Come on.

1074
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:27,764
- Let me show you your room.
- All right.

1075
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,293
Here's your bedroom.

1076
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,087
Oh, my God!

1077
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:33,630
Oh, wow.

1078
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,216
- And if you wanna fuck, you let me know.
- Oh.

1079
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:38,677
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

1080
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:42,681
Hey, I need to grab something.

1081
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:44,349
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
- Bobby.

1082
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:47,313
- Why are you walking in here?
- Sorry. I thought you were in the shower.

1083
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,063
It's not steroids.
It's just testosterone.

1084
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,941
Isn't that dangerous for your
liver and balls and stuff?

1085
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,402
No. Half the guys I
know do this stuff.

1086
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,821
Yeah, but half the guys you
know are roided-out morons.

1087
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:01,450
Yeah, that doesn't seem to bother you
when you're obsessing over my body.

1088
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:09,833
Okay, that's fair.
I'm gonna shower.

1089
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:47,955
You have a really nice voice.

1090
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:49,039
What?

1091
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,791
I heard you singing
in the shower.

1092
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,251
Well, that's mortifying.

1093
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,588
Wait, so you're asking this guy to
donate the remaining five million?

1094
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:59,550
No. If I can get one million
out of him, I'll take it.

1095
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,969
You can't scare these people
off by seeming too needy.

1096
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:03,512
Kind of like with you.

1097
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,348
Who's Lawrence Grape?

1098
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,309
Larry Grape. Biggest gay
TV producer on the planet.

1099
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:13,272
He's made all this groundbreaking
queer content. He's major.

1100
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:16,733
Mr. Grape, I'm thinking the final
wing should be about Lincoln.

1101
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,402
Love that. Love Lincoln.

1102
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:19,611
Very few people know this,

1103
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:22,739
but our most popular president
was also our first gay president.

1104
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:26,368
Sorry. This is a Lincoln museum?
Is this a Lincoln museum, sir?

1105
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:29,454
This is actually an
LGBTQ history museum.

1106
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:31,975
It's the first of its kind on a
national level. We actually...

1107
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,250
That fucking bush!

1108
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,334
Come on.

1109
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:37,045
My neighbors planted that
bush, and it blocks my view.

1110
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,630
Can you believe that?

1111
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,090
Let's go take care of this.

1112
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,760
- Again with this?
- This is my property, Maurice.

1113
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,220
This is a shared borderline!

1114
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,464
This is a fucking disaster.
He won't even listen to me.

1115
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,641
He's too busy getting his
rottweiler ready for Pride.

1116
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:51,518
Okay. From my
experience at my job,

1117
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:53,687
weird rich people just
want to be listened to.

1118
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,272
Ask him what he's interested in.

1119
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:58,168
But I don't care what he's interested
in. I'm here to pitch him my idea.

1120
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:01,403
Well, then pretend like you're
interested. Just do a listening face.

1121
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,530
- Do a listening face?
- Yeah.

1122
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:07,159
- Mmm. Yeah.
- I can't.

1123
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,577
Yes. Come on. Go.

1124
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:10,162
Okay.

1125
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:13,332
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

1126
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,666
That looked like I'm listening?

1127
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,584
Totally.

1128
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,378
- …on my property!
- It's an indigenous bush!

1129
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,088
- Are you going to Pride?
- Of course.

1130
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:21,649
- See you there. Love you.
- I love you too.

1131
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:23,675
All right. Listening.
I'll try it. I'll try it.

1132
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,511
Sorry. I have to
get going, boys.

1133
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:28,347
Oh, Mr. Grape, let
me ask you something.

1134
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:34,478
Um, what would you like
to see in the museum?

1135
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:40,651
A haunted house of gay trauma.

1136
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,402
A haunted house of gay trauma?

1137
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,405
Yeah. It's a cart on a
track, and there's...

1138
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:46,823
I'm sorry. This is a ride?

1139
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:50,702
Yeah, it's a fucking ride. So
you think a ride is too much?

1140
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,789
Um, no. No.

1141
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,959
No, no, no, no. It's
perfect. Please, keep going.

1142
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:00,087
Okay. We find ourselves
in an intimate little bar

1143
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:04,258
with some young,
hot animatronic men.

1144
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,677
The men turn to dance with
each other when suddenly, boom!

1145
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,429
A cop car smashes
through the wall.

1146
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,431
Police storm out of the cars.

1147
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,184
There's sirens and batons
and voices screaming.

1148
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,388
And suddenly, the car takes
off like a roller coaster,

1149
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,564
and there's blood everywhere,

1150
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,775
and a monster with Reagan's face on it
is chasing you down the hallway saying,

1151
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,278
"Shining city on a hill.
Shining city on a hill."

1152
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,405
And then we shoot
out into the light.

1153
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:28,323
And it ends on something happy,

1154
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:31,827
like Lil Nas X working
out with pink dumbbells.

1155
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,871
Wow.

1156
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,040
A gay trauma coaster.

1157
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,334
I mean, it's... it's
very provocative.

1158
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:42,629
I just don't think we can afford
that sort of thing, unfortunately.

1159
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:45,132
Right. Well, okay, it was
so lovely meeting you g...

1160
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,092
Mr. Grape. Mr. Grape.

1161
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:49,529
- I'm not a creative guy. I'm a money guy.
- No, no, no, no.

1162
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:50,554
No, no.

1163
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,806
I can tell you, to
accomplish what you want,

1164
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,641
we need more than just
a little donation.

1165
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:55,726
No, Aaron...

1166
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,020
We need five million dollars.

1167
00:57:58,103 --> 00:57:59,903
And you won't just get
the gay trauma coaster.

1168
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,316
You get the Lincoln
exhibit. You get all of it.

1169
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:08,363
You rewrite history for
an entire LGBTQ community.

1170
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:13,035
You're a storyteller, Lawrence,
and this is the ultimate story.

1171
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:18,165
You already pushed the
museum opening back twice.

1172
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:19,416
Is it really happening?

1173
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:24,213
Yes! It's definitely happening. I promise.
My entire life has led up to this.

1174
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:29,134
Right, well, five million dollars is
nothing to rewrite history. I'm in!

1175
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,470
- Wait, really?
- Yes! Yes!

1176
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,055
Oh, my God!
Mr. Grape, thank you!

1177
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:36,183
Of course. Congratulations
on my money.

1178
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,018
- Happy Pride.
- Happy Pride!

1179
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:42,231
Now I have to go to a Pride party, and
you're both too old to be in the pool.

1180
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:43,315
Please leave.

1181
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:48,403
Aaron! Oh, my God!

1182
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:52,282
You're a genius! "You're a storyteller"?
Where did that even come from?

1183
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,660
I told you I'm good at
talking to weird rich folk.

1184
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,161
I could tell he
had money to spend.

1185
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,914
I don't know what
to say. Thank you.

1186
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:00,624
Sure.

1187
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,376
Oh, my God.

1188
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:05,259
Shit! I've gotta go to the parade.
I've gotta get on that stupid float.

1189
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:06,296
I'll see you after.

1190
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

1191
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,216
Thank you.

1192
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,057
Okay.

1193
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,646
I kissed you! Are we
kissing each other now?

1194
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:23,939
I don't know! Bye!

1195
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,618
Bobby!

1196
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,821
You're gorgeous.

1197
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:15,616
What? You are.

1198
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:21,246
I still can't believe what
you did with Lawrence today.

1199
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,498
That was amazing!

1200
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,125
Five million dollars!

1201
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,835
It's not that big a deal.

1202
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:29,254
It is a huge deal.
Are you kidding me?

1203
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:34,593
I always have to do everything for myself.
No one ever does shit like that for me.

1204
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:37,846
You know, what you did for
me, you could do for yourself.

1205
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,848
Open a chocolate
shop. I don't know.

1206
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,476
I'm not opening
a chocolate shop.

1207
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,020
I'm not as confident as you.

1208
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:47,272
Oh, please. I'm
not that confident.

1209
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:51,568
You are the most confident
person I know, like, to a fault.

1210
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,363
It's actually...
It's kind of scary.

1211
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,575
Trust me. It's all an act.

1212
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,996
Confidence is just a choice you
make. It's a decision like any other.

1213
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,831
Usually born out of necessity.

1214
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:08,210
You think I have a
good singing voice now?

1215
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:11,505
You should have heard me when
I was a kid. I was even better.

1216
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:12,881
Had <i>American Idol</i> existed then,

1217
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:15,968
I would've been the gay guy with an
amazing voice who comes in second.

1218
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,889
And then let's see.
Then I went to college.

1219
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,725
And my musical theater teacher,

1220
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:28,480
he told me that I had a "gay
walk" and a "flamboyant quality"

1221
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,441
which would "limit my options."

1222
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,236
And then for grad school,

1223
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,679
I went to one of the best
journalism schools in the country.

1224
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:41,201
And my teacher there, this old, closeted
queen who was married to a woman,

1225
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:44,746
pulled me aside and thought
he was doing me a favor

1226
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,630
when he told me that I
should stick to writing

1227
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:49,585
because my voice sounded too
gay to do the news on TV.

1228
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,336
True story.

1229
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,965
And then I did stick to writing
and my gay history books.

1230
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,343
Every single publisher,
every single one,

1231
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,846
told me there wasn't enough
of an audience for it.

1232
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,183
I was always too gay,
or I was too niche.

1233
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:07,060
Or, you know, I made
people uncomfortable.

1234
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:11,023
Even my dad, who was so
wonderful and supportive,

1235
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,941
I remember him saying,

1236
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:16,987
"You know, not everyone wants to
hear this gay stuff all the time."

1237
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:20,908
But what was I supposed to do?

1238
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:23,577
I mean, I'm a writer.

1239
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,498
I wanted to write about my
life, my friends, my world.

1240
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,545
And I'm telling you, enough
people tell you things like that,

1241
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:36,256
no matter how confident you are,

1242
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,342
when you're alone at night,

1243
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,636
you start to think that
maybe they're right.

1244
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,016
So…

1245
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:49,811
I just put my head down.

1246
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:53,232
And I just worked really hard.

1247
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,818
And I just hoped that, somehow,

1248
01:02:56,902 --> 01:03:00,531
all these other
people were wrong.

1249
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,999
And they were.

1250
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,631
And they were.

1251
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:23,554
I mean,

1252
01:03:23,637 --> 01:03:29,434
I spent years watching a wave of
mediocre straight men passing me by.

1253
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:32,855
Men with half the talent,
who worked half as hard,

1254
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:36,358
who didn't care as much as I did,
and they got twice as far. Always.

1255
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:38,318
I mean, that's an
old story, but…

1256
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,530
And, you know, the
world caught up with us.

1257
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,491
Didn't catch up fast enough.

1258
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:47,828
Didn't catch up fast enough

1259
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,914
for my parents to see all these
great things happen for me.

1260
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,250
Right?

1261
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,254
Didn't catch up fast
enough for a lot of people.

1262
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:58,755
That's the truth.

1263
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:01,675
Let me tell you,

1264
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:06,346
confidence is just knowing you're the
only person left you can count on.

1265
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,806
That's all that is.

1266
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:10,601
That's all.

1267
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:15,981
Want another beer?

1268
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:19,902
Sure.

1269
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,245
Sorry. That was a lot.

1270
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,581
Did that weird you out?

1271
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,485
I love this song!

1272
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:09,952
That is a weird dance.

1273
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,829
Excuse me. At least I dance.

1274
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:13,789
I can dance.

1275
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,958
I have never seen you
dance. Literally no one has.

1276
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,042
- Really?
- No.

1277
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,836
- Wanna see me dance?
- Yes.

1278
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:21,255
Uh-oh.

1279
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:29,596
Very good. There you go!

1280
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,806
Come on.

1281
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,327
I want you to fuck me.

1282
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:54,746
Are you sure?

1283
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,333
When was the last
time you did that?

1284
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,751
It's been a while.

1285
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,212
But I want you to.

1286
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:05,299
- Okay.
- Good.

1287
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:50,427
All right. Here you
go. Merry Christmas.

1288
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:51,845
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

1289
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:53,096
Okay. All right.

1290
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,807
- Okay. Great. Fine.
- Okay. Ready? Let's go.

1291
01:06:57,643 --> 01:06:59,019
Okay, it's gonna be good.

1292
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,063
- It's all worth it. It's all worth it.
- Yeah.

1293
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:06,401
What's up? Aaron!

1294
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,196
- Wh...
- What's up, man?

1295
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,990
I was wondering when I
was gonna run into you.

1296
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,116
…seven of us.

1297
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,285
Hey, congratulations
on everything.

1298
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,246
Yeah, thank you. Yeah,
it's been crazy, man.

1299
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,790
Cool. So, yeah, what
have you been doing?

1300
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:22,167
Louis was like, "No, I
need to see options."

1301
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:24,169
And then he started
sending me Airbnb options.

1302
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:25,671
- Am I boring you?
- No, no, no.

1303
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:26,954
I'm like, "No, we deserve..."

1304
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:29,716
Mistletoe, bitches!

1305
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,139
- Bobby!
- What do you want?

1306
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,391
I want you.

1307
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,185
What's up?

1308
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,398
Um, where do we stand on this?

1309
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:46,024
Where do we stand on what?

1310
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,484
- Momogany.
- Oh.

1311
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,361
On "momogany"?

1312
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:52,072
Are we open? What are we
into? What are we doing?

1313
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:54,283
This is just like
<i>When Harry Met Sally…</i>

1314
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,617
What do you mean?

1315
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:58,662
That classic scene where Billy Crystal
runs to Meg Ryan on New Year's Eve

1316
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:01,832
and asks her if she wants to
have an open relationship.

1317
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,001
Bu... But...

1318
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:08,088
I mean, I'm not into
monogamy, you know.

1319
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,608
But I don't think we should be
constantly fucking other people.

1320
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,717
No.

1321
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,177
Why do you ask?

1322
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,973
Oh.

1323
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:21,225
- You wanna fuck your little hockey friend.
- No, I wanna fuck you.

1324
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,394
Oh, that's nice.

1325
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,688
But maybe he's there too.

1326
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,072
He's very hot.

1327
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:37,283
Hi, Joshua.

1328
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:38,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

1329
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:41,830
Hi.

1330
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:44,707
I'm Steve.

1331
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,502
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey, Steve.

1332
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:48,795
Hi, Steve.

1333
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,475
Hi, Steve.

1334
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:03,477
Hey.

1335
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,746
Sorry.

1336
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:24,622
Hey.

1337
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:28,961
Pillow fight!

1338
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:32,548
Can I have a massage?

1339
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:33,631
Like…

1340
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,553
Sure.

1341
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:39,136
I got really tight hamstrings.

1342
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,221
Cool.

1343
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,140
Oh, yeah. Right there.

1344
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:53,861
Ignore me! I think I
left my scarf in here.

1345
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:55,279
Henry!

1346
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:56,363
Get out!

1347
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:57,489
Bobby Leiber!

1348
01:09:57,573 --> 01:09:58,866
You made some friends.

1349
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,576
- Hi, Henry!
- Hey, Steve.

1350
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,244
Oh, sure.

1351
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:06,707
I am so hungover.

1352
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,713
Thank you.

1353
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:27,144
So, I may have been wrong about the
whole hooking up with other people thing.

1354
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:30,939
- Okay.
- I don't know. I just...

1355
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,610
I want to be cool and free,

1356
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:37,237
and I don't want to be lame,

1357
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:41,200
but actually seeing you...
I don't know. It just...

1358
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:43,952
It wasn't working for me.

1359
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:47,998
Yeah, no, totally. I get it.

1360
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,292
You sure?

1361
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:52,252
Yeah.

1362
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:53,837
Okay.

1363
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,299
Thank you.

1364
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,681
Sorry, my mom will
not stop texting me.

1365
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,433
When do your folks
get here again?

1366
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:10,521
The 21st. She wants to do the whole
"magical Christmas in New York" thing.

1367
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:14,107
They love sightseeing. I have
no idea what to do with them.

1368
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:18,153
Well, if you need me, I'll be home
hate-watching Hallheart Christmas movies.

1369
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,866
Hey,

1370
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:27,913
do you maybe want to spend
Christmas with me and my folks?

1371
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:29,748
Really?

1372
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,376
Because, honestly, I
am totally fine alone.

1373
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:33,961
That is very sweet
of you though.

1374
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,712
No, you shouldn't be
alone. That's crazy.

1375
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:38,799
Okay.

1376
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:39,967
Yeah, that'll be fun.

1377
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:43,178
And, honestly, no one knows
New York City better than me.

1378
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,472
I will plan the ultimate
New York City Christmas,

1379
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,391
as only a New York
City Jew could.

1380
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:48,475
Amazing.

1381
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,728
But just keep in mind, you know,
they're quiet folks from a small town.

1382
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:55,065
Aaron, I understand. You and
I come from different worlds.

1383
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:58,235
I'm from New York City,
you're from upstate New York.

1384
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,988
I mean, they're sweet, but just…

1385
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:05,826
If you could just
be, like, chill.

1386
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:08,620
I promise I won't embarrass you.

1387
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,849
And Mrs. Shepard, these are
the first holiday windows

1388
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:12,958
to ever feature a
sex-positive Tiny Tim.

1389
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,042
And it's so important.

1390
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:16,726
We don't get queer characters in
the stories that we read as kids.

1391
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:19,756
There's no gay Cinderella,
there's no lesbian Rapunzel,

1392
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,842
there's no nonbinary
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1393
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,677
Bobby, I think they get it.

1394
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,012
Guys, we've gotta go.

1395
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,222
I told Josh Evans
we would meet him

1396
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:29,975
at the Hallheart Christmas
movie pop-up village.

1397
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:32,811
- We're seeing Josh Evans?
- I didn't know.

1398
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:34,813
Let's do it.

1399
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:36,732
Are you a Hallheart fan?

1400
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,275
I dabble.

1401
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:43,780
This is so beautiful.

1402
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:44,948
I know, I love it.

1403
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,116
There's Josh.

1404
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,493
Wearing shorts in winter,
like a total psychopath.

1405
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:49,786
Oh, my goodness.

1406
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,457
They have Rachael
Ray edible tinsel.

1407
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,918
Josh! Evans!

1408
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,587
Hey, fellas. How's Hallheart
Village treating ya?

1409
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,671
Hey.

1410
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:02,299
Did you see the gay movie that
they did? It was kinda dope.

1411
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,886
Yeah, for years they ignored us, then
their audience got 10% less homophobic,

1412
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:08,430
so they decided we're a new
demographic they can sell shit to.

1413
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,765
I mean, look at these movies.

1414
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,267
{\an8}<i>Have Yourself A Heteronormative
Little Christmas</i>,

1415
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,770
{\an8}<i>Miracle on 34th Street
But With One Gay Guy</i>,

1416
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:17,731
{\an8}<i>Home Alone But With Sarah
Paulson</i>. I mean, it's absurd.

1417
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:19,358
- Josh.
- Hey.

1418
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:21,068
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, man.

1419
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,486
Come get skates.

1420
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:27,074
I want to see you and Aaron back
out on the ice for old time's sake.

1421
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:30,744
Bobby, Josh and Aaron played
hockey together in high school.

1422
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,037
Oh, I know.

1423
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,373
- Come on.
- Hey, man, what's going on? How you doing?

1424
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:35,916
Dude, what is your problem?

1425
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,000
What?

1426
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,127
Could you just maybe
tone it down a notch?

1427
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:41,004
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1428
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:42,728
We've been with my
parents for two hours,

1429
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:45,634
and you've already talked about
transgender mannequins, HIV prevention,

1430
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,554
and you pointed out the
route to the 1976 Dyke March.

1431
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:52,099
They're having fun. They're
totally fine. What is your problem?

1432
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:54,893
I'm nervous, okay? I've never
introduced them to anybody.

1433
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:56,687
I just don't want them
to get weirded out.

1434
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,690
I want them to have
a chill, normal time.

1435
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,275
So now I'm not normal?

1436
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:02,860
Bobby, you know what I mean.

1437
01:14:02,943 --> 01:14:05,237
I'm just being myself.

1438
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,242
Okay, but maybe you could just be a
little less yourself for three hours.

1439
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,994
I want them to like you.

1440
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:17,040
Oh. Yeah. No, sure.

1441
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,959
Of course, yeah. I'll just...

1442
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:21,086
I'll just be quiet.

1443
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:23,297
Okay, thank you.

1444
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,924
Bobby! Oh, my God, hi!

1445
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:27,092
Hi.

1446
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:28,302
Jesus Christ.

1447
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:30,804
We have to go anyway. We
have a dinner reservation.

1448
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:31,889
Where's dinner again?

1449
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,741
Hey, Dad, how are the
Polar Bears doing?

1450
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,534
That's the team Josh
and I used to play on.

1451
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:54,203
They haven't won all year.

1452
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:57,164
I told Josh they need
you boys to come back.

1453
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:03,420
Bobby, you seem quiet tonight.
Is everything all right?

1454
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:06,173
Oh, yeah. I'm
totally fine. Yeah.

1455
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:09,009
You know, I'm sorry if
I spoke too much today.

1456
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:10,677
I just... I think I got nervous.

1457
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,930
This is actually more
like how I usually am.

1458
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:17,100
I'm very quiet. Very quiet
and just weirdly normal.

1459
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:21,230
Well, thanks again for
planning such a lovely day.

1460
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:23,190
Oh, you're so
welcome, Mrs. Shepard.

1461
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:26,151
You sound like one of my
students. Call me Anne.

1462
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,778
Okay, I will.

1463
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:31,323
Mom's been a second-grade
teacher for almost 40 years now.

1464
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:34,952
Oh, my God, that's amazing. We need
good teachers, now more than ever.

1465
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,287
Thank you. I agree.

1466
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:42,376
And Aaron says you're working
at an American history museum.

1467
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,088
Yes. Yes, it is.

1468
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:47,923
It's an American history museum.

1469
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:50,384
Mm-hmm.

1470
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:53,929
Well, it's actually an
LGBTQ history museum.

1471
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:56,682
It's the first major queer
history museum in America.

1472
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,445
Do you teach your
students any gay history?

1473
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:01,077
'Cause I know in a few states,
they're finally starting to do it.

1474
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:06,066
Well, I teach
second grade, so no.

1475
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:09,236
Oh. Right. No, I
understand. Yeah.

1476
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:15,534
Out of curiosity, why not?

1477
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:16,702
Well,

1478
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,788
I just think they're a
little young for that.

1479
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:23,000
Of course. Yeah. No,
I understand that.

1480
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,214
- I don't think so though.
- Bobby.

1481
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:31,925
No, no, no, I'm just saying.
If I may disagree respectfully.

1482
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:34,529
That's actually the best time to
teach them, when they're young.

1483
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:37,222
You know, that way they develop
an appreciation for queer people

1484
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:40,809
before they all start bullying each other
or hating themselves if they're gay.

1485
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:42,477
Maybe you're right.

1486
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:48,400
Feels a little young though.

1487
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:50,277
Right.

1488
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,237
Totally. I get it.

1489
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:55,824
- I will drop it. Agree to disagree.
- Yeah.

1490
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,618
- Cheers to that.
- Yes.

1491
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,184
So when are you
guys heading home...

1492
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,998
It's not really that young
though. It's not that young.

1493
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:04,833
Bobby, can you please drop it?

1494
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:08,170
No, I can't, because we're talking
about gay kids here, and it's important.

1495
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,922
One of the things that saved me

1496
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,549
is that my parents exposed me
to gay stories when I was a kid.

1497
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,676
When I was 12 years
old... this is true...

1498
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,096
My parents took me to see a Broadway
play called <i>Love and Compassion</i>.

1499
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,558
It was about a group of gay men spending
the summer together in Provincetown.

1500
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,560
And all of a sudden
the curtain goes up,

1501
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:27,189
and there are seven completely
naked gay men on stage.

1502
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:31,401
And there I am, sitting between
my mom and dad at age 12,

1503
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:34,071
looking at seven soft penises.

1504
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:35,155
Shit.

1505
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:37,491
And all of a sudden, two of
the guys start making out,

1506
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:39,743
and then one of them starts
talking dirty, you know?

1507
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:41,578
And I remember this so vividly,

1508
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,747
there was a sex scene and
one of the guys is like,

1509
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:47,835
"Pound my prostate. Pound my prostate."
You know, "Milk me. Milk me."

1510
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,504
And I didn't even know what
that was. I mean, now I do.

1511
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:52,756
But, you know, it
was incredible.

1512
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,510
You know, to know that I could
sit there, between my mom and dad,

1513
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:58,303
looking at seven penises.

1514
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:01,181
Seven penises, Anne. I was 12.

1515
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:05,352
And to know that they were okay with that,
I mean, that had a profound effect on me.

1516
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:08,275
All I'm saying is, we need to remove
the stigma from that type of thing,

1517
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:11,113
so that gay kids can feel good about
themselves. That's all I'm saying.

1518
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,086
I mean, look at Aaron and
how much he hates his life.

1519
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,403
- Bobby.
- All I'm saying

1520
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:17,447
is there's a direct correlation between
how unhappy you are with your life

1521
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,801
and what you weren't taught
about your potential as a child.

1522
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,702
Bobby, stop talking.
Seriously, enough.

1523
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:23,245
I will kill you.

1524
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:26,081
Aaron, you hate your life?

1525
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,896
Your brother's a
real chatterbox.

1526
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,108
Hey, are you mad?

1527
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:54,234
Me? No, I'm great.

1528
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,945
Josh just texted me. I'm
gonna meet him at that bar.

1529
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:58,381
I think we should
go home and talk.

1530
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,615
Really? You want to talk more?

1531
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:01,342
I think it's better
than partying with Josh,

1532
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,553
the self-loathing meathead
who took 40 years to come out.

1533
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:04,786
Not everybody's you, Bobby.

1534
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,748
Okay, but 40 years? J.R.R. Tolkien
took less time with his journey.

1535
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:09,958
God, you are fucking relentless.

1536
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,294
"Aaron hates his life"?

1537
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,129
God.

1538
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:16,882
Hey.

1539
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:18,675
Hey!

1540
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:21,929
Fuck!

1541
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:42,491
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Big man.

1542
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,498
Dude. No.

1543
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:50,999
Hey. Just kiss me.

1544
01:19:57,756 --> 01:19:58,757
Aaron.

1545
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:01,134
Hey, Bob.

1546
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:03,095
Shit, Bobby, we were
just playing around.

1547
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:05,681
You were just playing around?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1548
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:06,765
Bobby, Bobby.

1549
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:08,559
- Josh, leave.
- I'm sorry.

1550
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:11,395
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Bobby, calm down.

1551
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:14,231
Oh, my God, I knew
it. I fucking knew it.

1552
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,859
Just say it. Can you
please just say it?

1553
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,945
Finally, just fucking say
it, because I already know.

1554
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:23,115
- You're not attracted to me.
- What?

1555
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:26,118
I see the guys you look at,
at the gym and the club.

1556
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,036
Everywhere. Everywhere we go.

1557
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,120
Okay, Bobby...

1558
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:30,722
Go be with him if
that's what you want,

1559
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:32,916
but I will not let you drag
me into this any further.

1560
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,480
And I will not let you break my
heart. I am too smart for that.

1561
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:38,422
Bobby, why did you say that shit
about me in front of my parents?

1562
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:41,633
I begged you not to embarrass me,
but you couldn't help yourself.

1563
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,012
What is wrong with you?

1564
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,973
What is wrong with me?

1565
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:51,143
"Tone it down, Bobby.

1566
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:52,811
Be quiet, Bobby.

1567
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:55,480
Can't you be a little
bit less of yourself?

1568
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:56,565
Just for a few hours."

1569
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,819
You don't think I
know what that means?

1570
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,071
You don't think I know
what that's code for?

1571
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:06,450
You don't think I've been hearing
that my whole fucking life?

1572
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,037
That's what you think about me?

1573
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,626
I'm not apologizing for myself.
I will leave that to you.

1574
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:38,482
Hey, question for you
because you know everyone.

1575
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:39,566
I need a makeover.

1576
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,944
Oh, yeah. Let's go
to a spa weekend.

1577
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:44,821
No, I want steroids or
testosterone or HGH or something.

1578
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:46,615
<i>I keep working out but
I don't get bigger.</i>

1579
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:48,378
I want to look like a
fucking action star.

1580
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,578
Forget Provincetown. I want people to
think I have a summer share on <i>Jumanji</i>.

1581
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,956
I'm sick of being niche.
I want to be Thor.

1582
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,479
You know that steroids don't
make you big on their own, right?

1583
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:57,751
You still have to work out

1584
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,545
- and you can't miss the window.
- I know.

1585
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,176
Let's fucking go.

1586
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:08,053
Ow.

1587
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:13,225
No. Fuck!

1588
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:18,313
Stop. What are you
doing? Stop that.

1589
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:19,439
Bobby!

1590
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:21,084
- The Lincoln exhibit is canceled.
- Why?

1591
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:23,708
People are threatening a boycott,
they're pulling their donations.

1592
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:24,862
There's not enough proof.

1593
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,656
Okay. You want to put
Lincoln back in the closet?

1594
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,033
Fine. I'll put him
back in the closet,

1595
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,244
- I'll put him back in the fucking closet.
- Bobby!

1596
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:33,620
Here.

1597
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:34,705
There you go.

1598
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:37,666
Lincoln is back in the closet
where you all need him to be.

1599
01:22:37,749 --> 01:22:39,126
I'm on steroids.

1600
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:40,711
Okay, Bobby, just calm down.

1601
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:44,548
So, Angela and I have proposed that
the final exhibit be called "Post-Gay."

1602
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:45,757
Post-Gay?

1603
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,969
Yes, because just
being gay is old news.

1604
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:52,389
Okay, so, now I'm too gay for
Aaron, but I'm too straight for you?

1605
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:57,311
Will somebody please tell me
exactly how gay I'm supposed to be?

1606
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,730
Poor Abraham Lincoln
can't even be gay now?

1607
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,356
Because he wasn't gay, Bobby.

1608
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,817
- He was bi, and I have...
- Okay, enough.

1609
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:07,237
You want to get rid of our stories?
Fine. Let's get rid of them.

1610
01:23:07,905 --> 01:23:09,448
I have roid rage.

1611
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:10,574
Are you insane?

1612
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:11,825
Enough, Bobby. No.

1613
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:14,620
It's for you.
Bye-bye, Buttigieg.

1614
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:16,955
- Stop it, Bobby.
- No.

1615
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,498
Bobby.

1616
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:20,209
No. Give it to me.

1617
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,544
- Put the flag down.
- Give it to me.

1618
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:28,050
- Angela and the lesbians, hold him down.
- No.

1619
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:31,553
You're on steroids?

1620
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:32,638
You can't tell.

1621
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:34,806
You know what, I
don't need this shit.

1622
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,434
Me neither. Lesbians, disperse.

1623
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,062
I hate the museum,

1624
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:43,774
but most of all, I really
fucking hate storytelling.

1625
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,402
She doesn't like
telling stories.

1626
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:49,905
Maybe the final wing
should be a big, empty room

1627
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:52,574
where people can go to
just shut the fuck up!

1628
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:56,245
Okay. Yeah. Leave. All of you.

1629
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:59,456
Oh, shit. My window.
My workout window.

1630
01:24:30,696 --> 01:24:32,197
Hey, bro.

1631
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,324
- Hey, bro. What's up?
- What's up?

1632
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:35,617
I'm Joel.

1633
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:38,203
I'm… Rob.

1634
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:40,163
Hey, can you help me
with this set, bro?

1635
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:42,583
Yeah, sure, bro. Yeah.

1636
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:43,876
Nice.

1637
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,462
- You doing chest?
- Yep.

1638
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:49,715
- Leg day for me, bro.
- Oh, nice.

1639
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:51,216
Gotta work on those hammies.

1640
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,594
Yeah. Go put them all on.

1641
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:55,053
I'm doing a superset today.

1642
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:56,430
- Oh, superset?
- Yeah.

1643
01:24:56,513 --> 01:24:57,639
Yeah, superset.

1644
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:00,225
- Pack it up, bro. Lots of plates.
- Yeah.

1645
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:04,271
I haven't seen this many plates
since the Jewish holidays, bro.

1646
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:05,731
- Nice, nice.
- Yeah.

1647
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:09,526
We should hang out
again sometime.

1648
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:11,361
Maybe watch a game?

1649
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:14,072
Yeah, I'd love that.
I'll give you my number.

1650
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,033
Holy shit, dude. What
happened to your voice?

1651
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,242
Oh, fuck.

1652
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:20,204
Um… Okay, I'm really sorry.

1653
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:23,957
But, um, I know this is
very strange, but when I...

1654
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:28,337
When I walked up to you in the gym,
I just did this voice, you know?

1655
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,547
You know, like, "Hey,
bro. What's up?"

1656
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:32,508
I don't know, I
just was trying it.

1657
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:34,176
Holy shit, are you
a serial killer?

1658
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:36,059
Are you going to fucking
kill a bro right now?

1659
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,016
No, no, no. I'm not killing
a bro. I'm so sorry.

1660
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:39,765
No, this is weird.
I'm sorry. I'll go.

1661
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,517
Yeah, you need to
leave right now.

1662
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,995
But it kind of worked, right?
That's what's weird about it...

1663
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:45,103
Dude, hurry up, man.

1664
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,427
But just the fact that I was
like, "Hey, bro. What's up?"

1665
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:49,525
Okay, I'm leaving. I'm so sorry.

1666
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:51,944
I'm going through a very
hard time right now.

1667
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:53,278
I didn't ask for all that.

1668
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,322
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm
going. I'm going.

1669
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:57,199
Can I just ask you
one thing though?

1670
01:25:57,282 --> 01:26:00,661
If I had come up to you
and used my real voice,

1671
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:02,184
would you have been
attracted to me?

1672
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:03,580
Wow,

1673
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:05,582
that is really sad, but…

1674
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,627
yeah, I think so.

1675
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:11,547
- Oh.
- But not now.

1676
01:26:12,548 --> 01:26:13,590
Okay.

1677
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:15,634
I'm really sorry.

1678
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:22,140
Streisand?

1679
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:23,851
Of course. I love her.

1680
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,686
She's the best.

1681
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:26,812
Streisand fucking rules.

1682
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:29,231
This is actually kind of like
<i>Yentl</i>, if you think about it.

1683
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:31,567
- Dude, get the fuck out.
- I'm so sorry.

1684
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,611
Later.

1685
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:35,946
Sorry.

1686
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:38,657
<i>And now, Hallheart

1687
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,410

01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:45,706
<i>Look, it's snowing.</i>

1690
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:48,458
- It's snowing on
all seven of us.

1691
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:50,043
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1692
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:54,131
<i>Guys.</i>

1693
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:08,687
Hey.

1694
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,272
Hey.

1695
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:13,066
Can we talk?

1696
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:15,652
Okay.

1697
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:23,619
So what's up?

1698
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,540
Bobby, I am so sorry I told
you not to be yourself.

1699
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:31,710
I know I fucked up, but
this is new for me too.

1700
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,379
And when you blew up in front
of my parents, honestly, it...

1701
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:38,842
It felt like you were
doing it on purpose.

1702
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:40,594
I was.

1703
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:42,554
And I'm sorry.

1704
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:45,265
I shouldn't have handled
it like that. You're right.

1705
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:47,518
I'm sorry.

1706
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:51,396
But, Aaron,

1707
01:27:52,606 --> 01:27:57,444
that doesn't change the fact that
you like a certain type of guy.

1708
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,322
And that isn't me,
and that's okay.

1709
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:03,492
You're right.

1710
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:07,496
I always pictured
myself with a guy...

1711
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,248
- Like Josh.
- Yeah, a guy like Josh.

1712
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:10,707
Yeah, he's hot.

1713
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:13,252
Yes, he's simple,
conventional, basic as hell,

1714
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:15,504
and not somebody that
actually makes me happy.

1715
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:19,633
Bobby, you are so
different from me.

1716
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,929
You're not afraid to take up space
in the world. You challenge me.

1717
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,681
Which at first,
it freaked me out

1718
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,268
because who the fuck wants to
be challenged all the time, but…

1719
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:34,857
But I love it.

1720
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:38,443
You're what's been missing.

1721
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,572
I know I fucked up, but
please give me another chance.

1722
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:43,699
I miss you so much.

1723
01:28:43,782 --> 01:28:45,576
I miss you too.

1724
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:48,954
A lot.

1725
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:53,417
I didn't realize until
after we broke up

1726
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,253
there were actually a couple
of months there where I was…

1727
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,297
What do they call it?

1728
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:00,966
In a good mood.

1729
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:17,983
But I can't.

1730
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:25,532
My whole life, I have prided
myself on being self-aware

1731
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:28,160
and self-reliant
and self-possessed,

1732
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:29,953
and it didn't matter.

1733
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:32,039
It didn't matter

1734
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:34,791
because, at the end of the day,
I just ended up in the street

1735
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,294
looking at you and
looking at Josh

1736
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:40,255
and thinking, "I'm
not enough for him."

1737
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:41,882
I know, and I feel awful.

1738
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:44,259
But do not throw this away
because of one mistake.

1739
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,553
What do you want me to do?

1740
01:29:46,637 --> 01:29:49,056
- Say you'll give me another chance.
- I can't do that.

1741
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:51,308
Why not?

1742
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:54,186
'Cause I don't trust you.

1743
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,776
I've been alone so
long. Who knows?

1744
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,945
Maybe that's the only
way I know how to be.

1745
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:04,446
I don't know.

1746
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:13,997
I'm going.

1747
01:30:21,213 --> 01:30:23,841
It's good.

1748
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:25,717
Hey!

1749
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:30,848
If you don't trust
me, that's fine.

1750
01:30:32,516 --> 01:30:35,352
But if for some reason, underneath
all that strength and confidence,

1751
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:37,521
you still don't trust that
you are lovable enough,

1752
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,356
I'm living proof…

1753
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:42,234
that you're wrong.

1754
01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:09,136
First of all, thank you
all for letting me do this.

1755
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:11,138
I really appreciate it.

1756
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:16,810
Look, I know I've been a very
angry, judgmental person, obviously.

1757
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:19,134
And sometimes anger can be
good. I know you all know that

1758
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:21,982
because for years, it was the
fuel we all needed to keep going.

1759
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:24,544
It wasn't that long ago that the
straight gatekeepers of the world

1760
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:27,738
didn't allow for all of us to
really succeed in a big way.

1761
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:30,282
Oh, my God. Do you guys
remember straight people?

1762
01:31:30,365 --> 01:31:32,367
Yeah. They had a nice run.

1763
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:34,870
Look, Bobby. I'm a
Black trans woman,

1764
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:37,497
and I don't need you to come
here and lecture me about anger.

1765
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:40,125
But I get it.

1766
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:43,420
I am brimming with anger.

1767
01:31:44,505 --> 01:31:46,590
And if I were to let
just an ounce of it out,

1768
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:48,800
I would probably explode
and kill every one of you.

1769
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:52,429
But, Bobby, I want
you to know something.

1770
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:53,514
I hear you.

1771
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:56,225
And I forgive you.

1772
01:31:56,308 --> 01:31:57,726
You do?

1773
01:31:57,809 --> 01:31:59,102
Yes.

1774
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:02,731
Look, this is the only community
I've ever loved being a part of.

1775
01:32:02,814 --> 01:32:06,109
And we fight like crazy,
and we always have…

1776
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:09,404
but you're my people.

1777
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:15,536
And I am so sorry that I was
so rude and spoke down to you.

1778
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:17,538
I should've shown you
much more respect.

1779
01:32:18,163 --> 01:32:22,793
There is truly no group of people on
earth that I love and respect more.

1780
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,546
Well, I am not going to
lie. I am still angry.

1781
01:32:26,255 --> 01:32:27,631
But I insist on progress.

1782
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:30,133
Not just for our LGBTQ heroes,

1783
01:32:30,217 --> 01:32:33,136
but for our LGBTQ assholes.

1784
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:34,972
Like you.

1785
01:32:35,973 --> 01:32:36,974
Thank you, Robert.

1786

You're posting this?
Can you please...

1788
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:47,234
No, okay. Yeah. No, you
should definitely post this.

1789
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:48,485
Everything should...

1790
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:51,089
Everything should be posted, and
thank you for teaching me that.

1791
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:21,018
Hey. I've decided to quit.

1792
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:23,770
- I just quit too!
- You did?

1793
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:27,065
I do this Kamala Harris impression
online, and it's really taking off.

1794
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:28,442
- Oh.
- Yeah,

1795
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:31,987
like, "I'm Kamala Harris. Okay."

1796
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:36,742
Good luck with that.

1797
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:38,785
Yeah. Good luck with
whatever you're doing.

1798
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:39,995
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1799
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:53,133
<i>Hey, Bobby. I wanted you to be
the first person to see this.</i>

1800
01:33:53,217 --> 01:33:57,137
<i>This is Aaron Shepard's Chocolate
Factory. I made these little chocolates.</i>

1801
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:59,264
<i>I also made some special treats</i>

1802
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:02,893
<i>to celebrate the opening
of the LGBTQ+ Museum.</i>

1803
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:04,895
<i>These are Harvey Milk Duds.</i>

1804
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:08,482
<i>And instead of a heart-shaped
Valentine's Day box</i>

1805
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:10,234
<i>filled with chocolates,</i>

1806
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:14,154
<i>we have a pink "silence equals death"
triangle filled with chocolates.</i>

1807
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:17,241
<i>And a tribute to my favorite
gay television character,</i>

1808
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:18,951
<i>this is…</i>

1809

<i>a "Tirami-Susan" from </i>Friends<i>.</i>

1810
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:24,081
Of course Aaron likes <i>Friends</i>.

1811
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:26,124
<i>Of course, all the
profits go to the museum.</i>

1812
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,877
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

1813
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,064
Dude, thanks for
letting me crash here.

1814
01:34:49,147 --> 01:34:52,526
I know Mom pressured
you into inviting me…

1815
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:54,820
but it's cool of you.

1816
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:57,447
Yeah, sure.

1817
01:34:58,365 --> 01:35:00,742
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1818
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:02,995
I'm a very happy chocolatier.

1819
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:07,958
I mean, there was that guy.

1820
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:12,045
But it's over.
Whatever. I'm fine.

1821
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:13,714
Yeah, totally.

1822
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:16,758
Jesus, how do you decapitate?

1823
01:35:17,426 --> 01:35:20,345
Seriously, that's all you're gonna
say? "How do you decapitate?"

1824
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:22,710
What do you want me to say?
How do you remove their heads?

1825
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:24,850
What about, "Hey, bro.
How are you holding up?"

1826
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:27,227
I'm sorry, bro. We don't
talk about this shit.

1827
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:30,314
I'm crashing here because I'm
in the middle of a divorce,

1828
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:32,065
and you haven't asked
me about it once.

1829
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:34,484
I'm sorry.

1830
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:37,946
So how's the divorce?

1831
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:39,781
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Okay.

1832
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,326
So…

1833
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,412
what happened to you?

1834
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:48,582
Okay, you remember at Christmas
when Mom and Dad came?

1835
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,542
I asked Bobby to...

1836
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:54,213
I asked him to tone it down.

1837
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:57,758
I know. I know. I
fucked up. I panicked.

1838
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:02,179
Did you try to get him back?

1839
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:05,557
Yes! I mean, Bobby is the best, but
he is a stubborn son of a bitch.

1840
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:10,521
And do you love this
stubborn little bitch?

1841
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:19,780
Whatever. It's over.

1842
01:36:19,863 --> 01:36:21,949
Bobby's strong. He
doesn't need me.

1843
01:36:23,325 --> 01:36:24,868
He doesn't need anyone.

1844
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:33,126
Hey, guys. It's your girl, Tamara.
We're opening the LGBT Museum tonight.

1845
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:37,172
Tonight is our grand opening, and
we're gonna have a wonderful time!

1846
01:36:37,256 --> 01:36:39,091
Yeah! What's up?

1847
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:40,592
What's up?

1848
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:44,763
<i>Hi. I'm Leonardo da Vinci.</i>

1849
01:36:44,847 --> 01:36:49,810
<i>I changed the world with my work as
an inventor, scientist and artist.</i>

1850
01:36:49,893 --> 01:36:53,188
<i>But most importantly,
I may have been bi.</i>

1851
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:55,732
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

1852
01:37:01,822 --> 01:37:05,117
<i>Congrats. You've made it to
the Obama Administration.</i>

1853
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,119
<i>But what's that
around the corner?</i>

1854
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:15,335
Okay, seriously, this
place is incredible.

1855
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:17,254
Are you happy?

1856
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:19,298
I don't know. It's
weird, you know?

1857
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:22,217
This place was my
dream, and it happened.

1858
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:26,430
Why can't I answer
your question?

1859
01:37:26,513 --> 01:37:28,432
- Okay, can I just say one thing?
- Yes.

1860
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,017
I know that what
he did was wrong,

1861
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,900
but you didn't have to
argue with his parents.

1862
01:37:31,977 --> 01:37:34,062
I did though.
Plus, I apologized.

1863
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:35,647
And he apologized too.

1864
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:37,274
I just don't know
if I can trust him.

1865
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:38,984
He fucked up. People fuck up.

1866
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,987
Is there no part of you that
wants to give him a second chance?

1867
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:44,656
You know what it is?

1868
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:48,160
I just don't want to want
someone else this much.

1869
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:49,244
But you do!

1870
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:51,663
It doesn't make you look
weak to love someone.

1871
01:37:51,747 --> 01:37:54,041
Vulnerability is
not a boner killer.

1872
01:37:54,124 --> 01:37:56,335
I know you.

1873
01:37:56,418 --> 01:38:00,047
I know that you've had a million reasons
to keep your guard up all these years.

1874
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,841
But there are people out there
worth letting your guard down for.

1875
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:06,386
Were you happier with
him or without him?

1876
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:08,013
That's all that really matters.

1877
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:11,557
Can I tell you something extremely
embarrassing that I would only tell you?

1878
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,851
Yes.

1879
01:38:13,435 --> 01:38:15,020
I wrote a song about him.

1880
01:38:15,103 --> 01:38:18,440
I know! That's the only time I'm gonna
talk about it. We're not talking about it.

1881
01:38:18,524 --> 01:38:20,359
I didn't send it, and
I'm not sending it.

1882
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:22,819
Okay. Fine.

1883
01:38:23,487 --> 01:38:25,697
I've just never seen
you that happy, is all.

1884
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:28,033
And I love seeing it.

1885
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,454
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

1886
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,331
- Ready to go dance? Let's go.
- Yeah.

1887
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:15,831
Holy shit. He texted me.

1888
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:16,915
Bobby texted me!

1889
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:18,000
What did he say?

1890
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:20,294
He said, "Hey, what's up?"

1891
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:23,046
"Hey, what's up?"

1892
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:24,930
Fuck yeah, bro! That's
what I'm talking about!

1893
01:39:24,965 --> 01:39:26,091
- That's good?
- It's great!

1894
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:28,135
- "Hey, what's up?"
- "Hey, what's up?"

1895
01:39:28,218 --> 01:39:29,738
- "Hey, what's up?"
- "Hey, what's up?"

1896
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:31,471
- No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1897
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:34,808
Okay, yeah. I'm gonna wait to
text him back though, you know?

1898
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:36,310
Shit. I gotta get to the gym.

1899
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:40,814
Aaron, what the fuck is up with you
and the CrossFit every day? Jesus!

1900
01:39:40,898 --> 01:39:43,192
What are you people all
training for? You going to war?

1901
01:39:43,775 --> 01:39:45,194
Stop playing it so cool.

1902
01:39:45,277 --> 01:39:47,654
Just go and tell
him how you feel.

1903
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:49,406
What about you?
What about divorce?

1904
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:50,929
What about keeping
it young and fun?

1905
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:51,992
Whatever.

1906
01:39:52,075 --> 01:39:54,161
Straight people, we're
so set in our ways,

1907
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:57,414
but gay people, you guys are
all so... You're so smart.

1908
01:39:57,497 --> 01:39:59,416
You're gonna figure it out.

1909
01:39:59,499 --> 01:40:02,211
My story is not your story.

1910
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:04,379
Go write your own damn story.

1911
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,758
- Go! Now!
- Okay. Yeah.

1912
01:40:09,259 --> 01:40:10,302
Hey.

1913
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:15,742
- "Hey, what's up?"
- "Hey, what's up?"

1914
01:40:15,766 --> 01:40:17,142
- "Hey, what's up?"
- Yeah!

1915
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:40,165
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

1916
01:40:40,249 --> 01:40:42,042
- It's time for the toast.
- Okay, great.

1917
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,126
Okay.

1918
01:40:53,303 --> 01:40:55,973
One of the hardest parts of
putting the museum together

1919
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:59,309
was figuring out what the
final exhibit would be.

1920
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:02,813
The message we'd leave
people with about who we are.

1921
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:06,108
But the truth is we
are not one thing.

1922
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,610
We are not a monolithic group.

1923
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:13,574
We are some of the smartest and most
self-reliant people you will ever meet.

1924
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,325
And we are so stupid.

1925
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,161
And we are a total mess.

1926
01:41:18,245 --> 01:41:19,997
And we are great.

1927
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:23,584
We've been around since the
beginning of time, of course,

1928
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:26,003
and yet it still feels like
we're at the very beginning

1929
01:41:26,086 --> 01:41:27,838
of being able to
tell our own stories.

1930
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:31,758
In many ways, I think we're still
getting to know each other, really.

1931
01:41:32,259 --> 01:41:34,845
Now, I'm just a boring
old cis white gay,

1932
01:41:34,928 --> 01:41:36,346
but…

1933
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:41,435
…one thing I have learned from my
trans and bi and nonbinary family

1934
01:41:41,518 --> 01:41:47,441
is that happiness for all of us comes from
staying fluid, staying open to change.

1935
01:41:47,524 --> 01:41:51,028
Open to being more than just
who you thought you were

1936
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:53,906
or more than what other
people assume you are.

1937
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:56,241
So this is a toast to all of us.

1938
01:41:57,075 --> 01:41:59,077
We've come a long way.

1939
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:04,041
And there are a lot of people who deserved
to live long enough to be here tonight.

1940
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:08,504
And we are here,
and they are not.

1941
01:42:10,047 --> 01:42:12,049
And we are very lucky.

1942
01:42:14,885 --> 01:42:16,803
We are very lucky.

1943
01:42:19,014 --> 01:42:20,807
I have no complaints.

1944
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:30,526
Hey.

1945
01:42:33,862 --> 01:42:34,863
Hey.

1946
01:42:36,406 --> 01:42:37,407
Um…

1947
01:42:38,909 --> 01:42:39,910
Sorry, um...

1948
01:42:40,577 --> 01:42:42,829
Just, um... One more
thing. Sorry, hold on.

1949
01:42:42,913 --> 01:42:45,040
I'm gonna do it. Let's
do it. Let's do it.

1950
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:50,212
What's going on?

1951
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:54,883
Hi.

1952
01:42:57,761 --> 01:42:58,929
So, um,

1953
01:42:59,012 --> 01:43:02,140
this is a little special
something I wrote for tonight,

1954
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:06,478
and I didn't think I would
actually have a reason to sing it.

1955
01:43:06,562 --> 01:43:09,773
And I haven't sung in front of people
in a very long time, so forgive me.

1956
01:43:09,857 --> 01:43:12,025
But tonight is about love

1957
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:15,070
and we've seen a lot
of tortured gay cowboys

1958
01:43:15,153 --> 01:43:17,781
played by a lot of straight
actors over the years.

1959
01:43:19,116 --> 01:43:23,036
So, this is a love song from
one gay cowboy to another

1960
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:26,790
inspired by everyone's
favorite LGBTQ+ icon,

1961
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,042
Garth Brooks.

1962
01:46:32,226 --> 01:46:33,560
Bobby, I just have
to tell you...

1963
01:46:33,644 --> 01:46:35,812
In all my years, I never
thought I'd say this.

1964
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:38,482
But, Debra Messing,
it'll have to wait.

1965
01:46:47,574 --> 01:46:49,117
What's wrong?

1966
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:51,453
I just really love you.

1967
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:54,248
I love you too.

1968
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:55,707
You like love, bro?

1969
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:56,792
Oh, yeah.

1970
01:47:00,087 --> 01:47:01,129
- Wait.
- Wha...

1971
01:47:01,755 --> 01:47:03,841
Oh…

1972
01:47:05,342 --> 01:47:06,342
What are you...

1973
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:07,761
Just let me do this.

1974
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:11,139
Um… Oh, shit. I need a ring.

1975
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:13,600
Bob... Bobby...

1976
01:47:13,684 --> 01:47:15,561
- Tamara, can I borrow your ring?
- Yeah.

1977
01:47:15,644 --> 01:47:16,645
Thank you.

1978
01:47:16,728 --> 01:47:18,730
- Bobby, I...
- Aaron Shepard,

1979
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:21,608
I know we're not
relationship people,

1980
01:47:23,569 --> 01:47:26,321
but will you date me for three
months, and then we'll reassess?

1981
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:30,450
Yes, Bobby Leiber,

1982
01:47:30,534 --> 01:47:33,203
I will date you for three
months, and then we can reassess.

1983
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,751
Mommy, what's happening?

1984
01:47:39,835 --> 01:47:40,919
It's a miracle.

1985
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:43,422
Uncle Bobby's gonna date
someone for three months.

1986
01:47:58,145 --> 01:47:59,188
<i>Hey, queers!</i>

1987
01:47:59,271 --> 01:48:01,148
<i>I'm the museum guard here.</i>

1988
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:03,609
<i>Just gonna do some dusting.</i>

1989
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:07,863
<i>Hello. What are you
doing dusting me?</i>

1990
01:48:08,614 --> 01:48:11,992
<i>I'm lesbian First Lady,
Eleanor Roosevelt.</i>

1991
01:48:13,911 --> 01:48:16,997
<i>Hi, I'm Seth Meyers
as Harvey Milk.</i>

1992
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:21,835
<i>Hello, I'm Kenan Thompson
as James Baldwin.</i>

1993
01:48:21,919 --> 01:48:25,214
<i>It's a Night at the Gay Museum.</i>

1994
01:48:25,297 --> 01:48:26,298
Come here.

1995
01:49:06,129 --> 01:49:07,339
Aaron?

1996
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:08,632
Mom.

1997
01:49:09,258 --> 01:49:11,385
- Bobby.
- Hi.

1998
01:49:11,468 --> 01:49:14,346
- Bobby, this is spectacular.
- Thank you.

1999
01:49:14,429 --> 01:49:15,764
And the kids are loving it.

2000
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:16,849
I'm so glad you're here.

2001
01:49:16,932 --> 01:49:20,078
It means so much to me that you would
make it part of your trip, it really does.

2002
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:22,855
You were right. Of course,
they should see this.

2003
01:49:22,938 --> 01:49:24,773
It's their history too.

2004

Any time!

You know, we just
hit three months.

2012
01:49:45,627 --> 01:49:47,004
How do you think it's going?

I think it's going
pretty well too.

You want kids someday, right?

2020
01:50:00,851 --> 01:50:01,894
No.

2021
01:50:01,977 --> 01:50:03,645
- Bobby.
- Absolutely not.

2022
01:50:03,729 --> 01:50:04,855

- Come on. Bobby.

2024
01:50:06,648 --> 01:50:07,649
Where are you going?

2025
01:50:07,733 --> 01:50:09,484
I'm not having children
wherever I'm going.

2026
01:50:09,568 --> 01:50:11,320
- Come on. I want kids.
