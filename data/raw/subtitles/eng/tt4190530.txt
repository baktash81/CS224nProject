1
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,825
Where's the equipment?

2
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,300
Kurva!

3
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,269
What happened?

4
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,661
Caught on one of the branches on the way down.

5
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,741
Can you walk?

6
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,786
You'll need stitches.

7
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,021
Hey.

8
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,981
You didn't hide your parachutes very well,

9
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,983
and you left a blood trail for half a kilometer.

10
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,389
Follow me.

11
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,949
I live not far from here.

12
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,548
Dik! Come!

13
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,620
Ignác.

14
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,026
Ignác!

15
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,822
Hot soup. Come.

16
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,740
Come in.

17
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,708
I take it you are heading for Prague.

18
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,906
How far is it?

19
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,105
Thirty kilometers.

20
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,661
I have a special delivery permit for my truck.

21
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,230
I could take you.

22
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,786
Thank you.

23
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,389
You rest here tonight.

24
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,548
I will take you in the morning.

25
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,029
Enjoy your soup.

26
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,028
Please, sit.

27
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,590
How much do the Germans pay you?

28
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,540
For turning in your fellow countrymen, huh?

29
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,625
Drop the gun.

30
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,300
I said, drop the gun.

31
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,543
Drop it.

32
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,666
Drop the gun!

33
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,461
Gun.

34
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,106
You get him?

35
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,382
We'll take that truck.

36
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,699
Come on.

37
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:35,908
They had made their choice, Jan.

38
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,625
Sometimes you have to pick a side.

39
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,985
Would you prefer it was us?

40
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,703
Should be the next left.

41
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,504
Pull over here.

42
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,381
Mirek, come away from the window.

43
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,471
Anna, get the door!

44
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes?

45
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,181
We are looking for Oldrich Novák.

46
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,866
The Novákovi no longer live here.

47
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,301
Who is it?

48
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,986
Just somebody looking for directions.

49
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,301
I am sorry, but that's all I know.

50
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,225
Please.

51
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,870
Can you help us?

52
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,139
There is a veterinarian in the next row of shops up the street.

53
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,221
I hear he is a good man.

54
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,580
One that may help.

55
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,664
Thank you.

56
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,665
He normally only barks at Germans.

57
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,586
Mmm-mmm. Germans and anyone giving him a rectal examination.

58
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,023
Thank you, Dr. Eduard.

59
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,948
Come along, Benés.

60
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,148
Look after him, Mrs. Lukešová.

61
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,188
Normally, for a dog bite, you would go to a hospital, not a vet.

62
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,667
Did you know Oldrich Novák?

63
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Yes.

64
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,822
And what if we were to say that Oldrich Novák was our contact here in Prague?

65
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,780
Then I would have to wonder

66
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,591
if you are ill-informed Czech patriots

67
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,100
or Gestapo spies trying to infiltrate what remains of the resistance.

68
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,028
I don't detect a German accent.

69
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,182
The decoding papers in your bag, they don't have a German font.

70
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,181
And given that this wound

71
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,070
has more tree bark than dog bite,

72
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,143
I would have to guess that you were parachuted back into Czechoslovakia

73
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,745
with information that was somewhat out of date.

74
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,106
You're a clever man.

75
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,023
We were also told you were a good man.

76
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,462
How long have you been away?

77
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,423
It's been a while.

78
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,386
Rewards are given to people who inform on anti-Nazi activity.

79
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,588
Heydrich has all but crushed the resistance.

80
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,268
He has executed thousands.

81
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,587
I can put you in contact with the miller.

82
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,106
Maybe he can help you.

83
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,750
You can stay here tonight.

84
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,022
I'll contact the miller in the morning.

85
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,664
My friend here says that you are a clever man.

86
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,870
I agree.

87
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,149
Don't do anything that would change our opinion.

88
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,110
Go easy on the foot.

89
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,786
You will be dancing the tango within a week.

90
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

91
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,230
This is Břetislav.

92
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,750
The miller.

93
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,909
Eduard told me you were looking for Oldrich Novák.

94
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,907
Yes.

95
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,787
Would you like to take a drive with me?

96
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,229
Don't move.

97
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,071
Please sit.

98
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,941
You were looking for Oldrich Novák.

99
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,828
Who gave you this contact?

100
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,225
London.

101
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,462
And you tell us this because?

102
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,466
You are not giving us much choice and this doesn't look like Gestapo headquarters.

103
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,860
You, where are you from?

104
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,465
Your accent, Bohemia?

105
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,702
No, Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia.

106
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,067
So you must know the railway station at Vladislav?

107
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,187
Yes.

108
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,830
What's so special about it?

109
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,662
I presume you are talking about the large bed of colored roses

110
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,424
that when seen from above is in the shape of our national flag?

111
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,024
Is it still there?

112
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,783
Seems the Germans have still not looked at it from above.

113
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,870
I am Vanek.

114
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,783
Ladislav Vanek.

115
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,668
This is Uncle Hajsky.

116
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,629
We are the head of the Jindra Organization.

117
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,905
Czech resistance.

118
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,350
I am Jan Kubiš.

119
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,350
I am Josef Gabčík.

120
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:45,422
From Slovakia.

121
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,471
You must not be surprised by our lack of trust.

122
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:54,067
The Gestapo have been very successful in infiltrating our network.

123
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,230
Oldrich Novák.

124
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,427
He was taken away several months ago.

125
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,423
Why wasn't London informed?

126
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,903
We lost contact with the Czech government in exile in London some months ago.

127
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,221
We need replacement crystals for the transmitter.

128
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,140
We've been waiting for them to send someone to re-establish contact.

129
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,347
Is that you?

130
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,581
There were other men on the plane.

131
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,821
They were dropped elsewhere.

132
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,424
It's possible they have orders

133
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,309
to re-establish contact with London but that...

134
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,825
That is not our mission.

135
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,384
What is your mission?

136
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,469
Operation Anthropoid.

137
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,350
Anthropoid?

138
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,187
What is Anthropoid?

139
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,630
We are here to assassinate

140
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,988
SS Obergruppenfűhrer Reinhard Heydrich.

141
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,745
Are you completely mad?

142
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,145
- We have our orders, comrade.
- But this is madness.

143
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,830
We have our orders, comrade.

144
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,059
Heydrich?

145
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,750
Why stop with Heydrich?

146
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,184
Why not have a go at Hitler as well?

147
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,299
He is only 300 kilometers down the road in a small village called Berlin.

148
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,423
So we inform London that you are refusing to cooperate with our mission.

149
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,990
How dare you question us?

150
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
How dare you question us?

151
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,101
You know what we have sacrificed for the cause here?

152
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,506
What you have sacrificed?

153
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,786
What has Czechoslovakia sacrificed?

154
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,068
You have no idea what we've sacrificed!

155
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,784
Sit down. Please.

156
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,622
You kill Heydrich and Hitler will tear Prague apart.

157
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,585
I take it you have family in Czechoslovakia?

158
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,863
Father? Mother?

159
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,182
You kill Heydrich, then you can consider them and everyone that ever knew you dead.

160
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:49,830
All Czech patriots should be ready to die for their country.

161
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
That includes my family.

162
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,346
Well, I'm not.

163
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,148
I want to carry on fighting.

164
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,951
We don't have that many left that are willing to do that.

165
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,421
We are what's left of the Czech resistance.

166
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,339
I suggest a lesser rank should be assassinated.

167
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,625
Perhaps a few of them.

168
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,940
Heydrich is the head of the secret police.

169
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,148
Only Hitler and Himmler are above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

170
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,381
Exactly my point.

171
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,820
You really think you'll ever get close enough to assassinate Heydrich?

172
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,500
Our orders have come direct from the Czech government in London.

173
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,344
So this is about the Czech government in London trying to impress the allies?

174
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,307
It was the allies that gave us to the Germans in the first place.

175
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,461
Munich was a betrayal,

176
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:32,305
but it is also now history.

177
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,309
I think what the Czech government in London is asking is this.

178
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,064
Is Czechoslovakia

179
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,986
still ready and willing to resist Nazi Germany?

180
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,184
Josef Gabčík.

181
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,064
And Jan Kubiš.

182
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,182
You are both most welcome here.

183
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,984
And please call me Auntie Moravec.

184
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,862
Ata. Ata.

185
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,105
Ata is my son.

186
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,705
He is studying to be a violinist.

187
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,342
Ata, this is Josef and this is Jan.

188
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,705
Pleased to meet you both.

189
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,463
So, try not to go outside,

190
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,508
but if you do, never walk together.

191
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,624
If you're stopped, you will need an excuse for why you're not at work.

192
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,226
We'll try to get you medical certificates as soon as possible.

193
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,786
Always use our code, three knocks, then a single knock.

194
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,105
In the meantime,

195
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,865
lay low and I will use Ata to make contact.

196
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,148
Good luck.

197
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,267
Thank you.

198
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,421
Goodbye.

199
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,902
Come on through, please.

200
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,663
Josef.

201
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,144
There is a way off the roof?

202
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,944
There is a fire escape to the left.

203
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,262
To the right it continues to the building next door.

204
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,269
It's good enough.

205
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,465
I'm sure you both would like a glass of Becherovka.

206
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,260
Thank you.

207
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,461
- It's okay.
- Mrs. Moravec?

208
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,865
- Hey.
- Hey.

209
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,942
There was so much people at the market.

210
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,625
But I didn't find the bread that you like.

211
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,861
Come.

212
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,386
- Who is it?
- It's okay, Marie.

213
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,944
This is Josef and this is Jan.

214
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,304
They will be staying with us while they are looking for work.

215
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,461
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

216
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,664
Josef and Jan are not registered with the police

218
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,982
as being residents here, so, remember, please keep it strictly to yourself.

219
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,461
I'll put the shopping in the kitchen.

220
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,782
Welcome.

221
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,304
Mrs. Kovárníková's daughter.
I pay her for helping out.

222
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,304
Dinner will be at 6:00.

223
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,786
Please sit.

224
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:52,385
Ata, dinner is ready.

225
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,266
And finally the fiddler is silent.

226
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,470
He is a violinist, Alois. A violinist.

227
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,023
You two boys looking for work, then?

228
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Yes.

229
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:24,029
We are always looking for men to clean the cinders out of the locomotives.

230
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,386
Thank you, Mr. Moravec.

231
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,189
We'll keep that in mind.

232
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,304
So, what do you do when you aren't helping out here?

233
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,221
You don't have a boyfriend?

234
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:58,067
No.

235
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,982
How's life in occupied Prague, Marie?

236
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,502
I guess, not being registered with the police as residents

237
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,230
has something to do with this question?

238
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,829
I hate the Germans.

239
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,308
And tell me, do you have a friend

240
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,951
as lovely as you that...

241
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,749
That you can trust?

242
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,909
Why?

243
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,665
It would be less conspicuous if Jan and I were not seen out alone.

244
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,750
Young love flourishes under German occupation.

245
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,548
That sort of thing.

246
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,028
But you're not that young.

247
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,107
Knowing that you are trustworthy is one thing, Marie.

248
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,310
But doing this could get you shot.

249
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,026
Perhaps you should think about it...

250
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,464
My friend, Lenka.

251
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,304
She sometimes carries messages for Uncle Hajsky.

252
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:19,626
Good.

253
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:26,662
We are going to a New Year's Eve dance tomorrow night.

254
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,788
Would you like to go?

255
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,025
Look at them.

256
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:47,943
It's like...

257
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,182
It's like some old ritual that's lost its joy.

258
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,865
Maybe there's hope in the pretense.

259
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,026
Hello.

260
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,823
It looks like you've landed on your feet with Lenka.

261
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,384
This was a mistake.

262
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,944
Hello.

263
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,864
Lenka, this is Jan and Josef.

264
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,269
- You know, it's not very polite...
- Please sit down.

265
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,464
You are the most beautiful women in the room.

266
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,304
Congratulations.

267
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,064
But you fail to understand this is...

268
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,830
This is not a night off for us.

269
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,663
This is not some game.

270
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,503
Josef, maybe you're overreacting a little...

271
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,901
Jan, take a look around.

272
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:01,709
We appreciate the effort, but the point was not to attract attention.

273
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,300
We needed you as plain as possible.

274
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,105
Do you understand?

275
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,625
You know, for most girls,

276
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,347
a little lipstick is the only way to forget what's happening here.

277
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,582
Even if it's just for a few hours.

278
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,580
Yes.

279
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,391
Your lipstick gets you noticed,

280
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,023
and that gets us noticed,

281
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,546
and us being noticed gets us all shot.

282
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,267
This little scene needs an ending.

283
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,470
Slap my face.

284
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,785
Slap my face.

285
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,345
I'm not a whore.

286
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,229
I think that went well.

287
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,990
Nine... Eight... Seven...

288
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,589
Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One.

289
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,069
A British Sten Mark II machine gun.

290
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,343
One hundred rounds.

291
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:41,222
And Model 73 anti-tank grenades with pencil fuses.

292
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:45,785
That's everything we could retrieve from the drop canister.

293
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,349
Uncle says he has made some progress with the information you asked for.

294
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,263
There is a meeting at Café Moravia on Vodičkova Street.

295
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,262
Tuesday. 2:00.

296
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,509
I just wanted to apologize about the other night.

297
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,980
You were completely right to do what you did.

298
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,069
Marie didn't fully inform me about the situation.

299
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,865
She is very young,

300
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:21,230
she still has romantic ideas about the war.

301
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,066
And you?

302
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,223
War is not romantic.

303
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,144
We cross here.

304
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:46,711
After our last date, I thought you might both show wearing potato sacks.

305
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,981
I don't know what I'm doing.

306
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,189
You are doing fine.

307
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,107
Take a seat here. Order a drink.

308
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,945
We won't be long.

309
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,109
Josef.

310
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:21,625
- Jan.
- Opálka.

311
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,588
Valčík.

312
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,624
I see you are no strangers to one another, but we don't have much time.

313
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,623
We all trained special operations together.

314
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,781
Valčík here was even on the same drop.

315
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:36,068
Yes, dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course.

316
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,982
Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A,

317
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,950
we have finally re-established communications with London.

318
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:45,228
I have orders to send and receive any communications between you and London.

319
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,631
You have your own decoder book, right?

320
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,701
Yes.

321
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,425
Second Lieutenant Opálka and Warrant Officer Curda

322
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,990
have completed Operation Out Distance, so both are now available to assist you.

323
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,901
Second Lieutenant Opálka is the senior officer here.

324
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,869
Yes, this is true, but your mission objective supersedes my rank.

325
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,028
We had word from London. Anthropoid.

326
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,545
Utmost priority.

327
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:07,748
We assist with everything possible.

328
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:08,820
So...

329
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,946
This is your show, bratři.

330
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,301
So, we know that Heydrich returns to his family

331
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,462
every day at Panenské Břežany.

332
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,260
But, both his chateau and the castle are both heavily guarded.

333
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,865
They are not feasible targets.

334
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,180
But once a month,

335
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,469
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

336
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:31,029
And we can predict this

337
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:34,945
because his personal carriages are prepared several days in advance.

338
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,267
But, again, the station and the train are both heavily guarded.

339
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,787
What about derailing the train outside of Prague?

340
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:46,830
We can derail the train, but that is no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

341
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,744
I have made contact with an ex-pupil of mine

342
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:56,267
who works as a repair man inside the castle.

343
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,148
He's willing to help,

344
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,223
but he only knows when Heydrich arrives in the morning

345
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,825
and when he leaves.

346
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,263
What good is that?

347
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:08,306
You can build a picture

348
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,904
of his routine.

349
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,109
Sometimes he travels with an armed escort and sometimes he does not.

350
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,943
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

351
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,986
There is a safe house near the castle.

352
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:23,382
The repairman could drop off the timetable every day before work.

353
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,426
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

354
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,705
Good.

355
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,906
And Jan and I will follow the route from the chateau to the castle.

356
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,108
Gentlemen, this operation

357
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,508
will involve almost everyone we have left in the resistance.

358
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:41,866
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

359
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,387
If you are arrested, you will face some harsh facts.

360
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,622
There will be no escape.

361
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,670
You'll be tortured until you reveal everything you know,

362
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,349
and then you will be executed.

363
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,426
You must protect your fellow comrades

364
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,627
by shutting down any links you have to them.

365
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,105
Operation Out Distance has re-supplied us with these.

366
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,190
Carry the cyanide capsules at all times.

367
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,259
We have to end our meeting.

368
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:27,101
Use the window.

369
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,746
Clear.

370
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,141
Looks like there's a whole garrison there.

371
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,304
That's our man.

372
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,423
Five minutes after 9:00.

373
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,023
He's riding solo today.

374
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,666
Wait.

375
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,869
Armed escort.

376
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,668
Thirty seconds behind.

377
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,710
Thirty seconds.

378
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,260
Thirty seconds, 30 seconds.

379
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:37,909
If we can use a rope or a steel cable to stop the Mercedes,

380
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,304
then 30 seconds...

381
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,144
Then 30 seconds would be all we need.

382
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,347
Even if a rope can stop the car,

383
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,661
we still need more than 30 seconds to escape from here.

384
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,942
And we'd have to face the armed guard here in the open.

385
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,181
It would not be my first choice.

386
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,023
And if it's our only choice?

387
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,268
The point of the mission is to succeed. Yes?

388
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,945
I'm more worried that we haven't planned what to do if we are successful.

389
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,943
What happens afterwards is not important.

390
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,822
Let's follow the route to the castle.

391
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Well?

392
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,262
Arrived 9:15, left 5:15,

393
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,420
with an armed escort.

394
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,065
Armed escort?

395
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,061
There's only one person in Prague that travels with an armed escort.

396
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,143
Are you going to assassinate Heydrich?

397
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,545
What?

398
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,065
Heydrich is the target?

399
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,907
For your own safety, it's best that you don't ask too many questions.

400
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:17,387
It's a bit too late for that now.

401
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,827
Well, you agreed to help the resistance.

402
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,862
Who the target is should not concern you.

403
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,385
We are about to help you assassinate Reinhard Heydrich.

404
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,588
- Of course it concerns us.
- Okay.

405
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,788
Everyone just relax.

406
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,942
Maybe it was a mistake not to inform you of the danger.

407
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,389
- Murder Heydrich?
- No, no.

408
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,030
Assassinate Heydrich.

409
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,501
Murder implies he has a life worth living.

410
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,710
So you think we are just two little girls

411
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,829
who are here to follow the important parachutists around?

412
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,670
Whoa. Lenka.

413
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,141
We've been resisting here from the beginning in our own way.

414
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:03,349
I personally don't have any reservation to killing a Nazi pig.

415
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,666
But don't treat us like what you are about to do doesn't affect us.

416
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,019
It does and it will.

417
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,670
And you should keep your weapon clean because it's filthy.

418
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,340
Marie?

419
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,186
Where are all my pots and pans?

420
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:08,670
This exit here, is this.

421
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,307
You see?

422
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,030
It's the slowest part of the route.

423
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:14,750
Anywhere else is impossible.

424
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,628
So we do it here.

425
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,304
Agreed?

426
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,030
Yes.

427
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,182
Perhaps not perfect, but it's the best option.

428
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,704
Good.

429
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,670
9:17 to 4:41.

430
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:21,786
Without.

431
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,231
Are you really going to go through with this?

432
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,905
We have our orders.

433
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,701
So, you kill Heydrich.

434
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,391
What then?

435
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,706
You think there aren't more like him?

436
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,784
They come and the killing continues even worse than it did before.

437
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,146
When does it stop?

438
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,987
I wish I had an answer for you.

439
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,708
You think any of this makes sense to me?

440
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,389
Then walk away now.

441
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,824
And go where, Marie?

442
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,141
You think we can escape from what is happening here?

443
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,865
Pretend this madness is not real?

444
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,670
Some days I'm not even sure it is real.

445
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,382
Heydrich chokes the people of this city with a blanket of fear.

446
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,110
People are shot for what?

447
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:18,822
Their race? Their religion?
Their cigarettes?

448
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,666
You hear the stories about Poland.

449
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,625
Marie, it's okay.

450
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,630
Just tell me we are doing the right thing.

451
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,583
I think it is my turn to apologize to you about the other morning.

452
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:46,190
You were right to be angry.

453
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,471
We should have told you what was at risk.

454
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:50,871
Given you the choice to walk away.

455
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,425
My father was a captain in the army.

456
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,628
Wanted sons, got three daughters.

457
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,382
He and many others were arrested in '39

458
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,509
when Germany took control over Czechoslovakia.

459
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,710
And when Heydrich took over here last September,

460
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,710
his first order was to execute all the prisoners.

461
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,909
My father was among 5,000 shot in the first week by Heydrich.

462
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,382
For me there's no walking away.

463
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,349
Heydrich is worth the risk.

464
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,231
We have checked the route.

465
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,708
We think we know how to do it.

466
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,144
I will arrange a meeting.

467
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:50,460
At the cafe, the day after tomorrow.

468
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,465
3:00 p.m.

469
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,826
Our original contact, Oldrich Novák.

470
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:01,949
Who was his direct handler?

471
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,429
Ladislav Vanek.

472
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,907
He is the one who's most opposed to what we have to do.

473
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,789
All I'm asking is what is he so afraid of?

474
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,831
Jan?

475
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:00,905
Sorry.

476
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:58,784
So he approaches here.

477
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,585
Corner of Kirchmayer and Holeschowitzer Street.

478
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,826
Here.

479
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,221
Yes, his car will have to really slow down to take that corner.

480
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,065
Yes, he slows to about 10 miles per hour.

481
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,507
We've averaged out his morning arrival times.

482
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,429
We can expect him at approximately 9:30 a.m.

483
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,581
And the weapons?

484
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:17,385
At that range the Sten gun should hit everything within the car.

485
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,423
And the armed escort?

486
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,822
We have found no pattern.

487
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,664
Some days, yes. Some days, no.

488
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,987
If there is an armed escort,

489
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:36,422
we stand down and await the next day.

490
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,146
You know I have been against this action from the start.

491
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,023
Yes, that's been clear.

492
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:44,105
I cannot give the go-ahead without asking London to reconsider.

493
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,706
Ladislav, this is a military operation.
It's not your order to give...

494
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,902
Without the resistance, this mission doesn't exist.

495
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,981
Do you want to put...

496
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:51,186
I am with Ladislav.

497
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,420
We should get London to rethink our position here in Prague.

498
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:56,708
We have our orders, Curda.
And nothing has changed.

499
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,269
It's easy for London to give orders.

500
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,501
It's our lives on the line...

501
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:01,184
Let's wait for re-confirmation.

502
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,545
We waited four months.

503
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:03,701
Four months.

504
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,150
London needs action.

505
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,585
Then a few more days won't make a difference.

506
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:11,027
Valčík, how long before you can get to the transmitter?

507
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,626
I can get to the transmitter the day after tomorrow.

508
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:17,543
Then a couple of days for London to transmit back the answer.

509
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:25,581
Happy birthday.

510
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,708
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

511
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,668
- Happy birthday, Ata.
- Thank you.

512
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,945
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

513
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,101
Cheers.

514
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:46,150
Cheers.

515
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,902
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

516
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:58,621
Uh...

517
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,550
Ata, I know this is your party,

518
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,501
but we have a little announcement to make.

519
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,789
I have asked Marie to marry me and she has said yes.

520
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:17,108
Congratulations.

521
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,023
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

522
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:23,023
Thank you.

523
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:39,505
Congratulations.

524
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:42,786
Thank you.

525
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,902
Why are we here?

526
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
Hmm?

527
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,744
I know.

528
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:56,471
I know.

529
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,105
Who's to say it won't happen?

530
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,186
London calls it off.

531
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,228
You're lying to yourself, my friend.

532
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:10,990
Because it is easier.

533
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:24,266
I have to believe there is a way through this.

534
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,025
That there is a normal life waiting for us.

535
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:28,340
The way things used to be.

536
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,507
Marie makes me feel that there is hope.

537
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,831
I love her.

538
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:48,670
I do. I love her.

539
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,471
I had the idea to transfer the 73

540
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:18,184
into a water canteen for better mobility.

541
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,141
Rigged for impact detonation.

542
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,391
Don't drop them, eh?

543
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,431
That was the empty one.

544
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,661
No, not funny, Jan.

545
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,539
Not funny.

546
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,621
"Anthropoid proceed.

547
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,746
"Stop.

548
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,751
"Upmost importance."

549
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,465
Nothing about getting us out afterwards.

550
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,664
There's a problem.

551
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,387
One of our contacts inside the castle has seen correspondence

552
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,621
ordering Heydrich back to Berlin.

553
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,751
And there have been conversations in the household

554
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:38,110
about a new posting to Paris.

555
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:43,030
It means that once he goes to Berlin, he may not be back.

556
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
When does he leave?

557
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,550
Day after tomorrow.

558
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:51,664
Then we have no choice.

559
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,699
We do it tomorrow.

560
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,590
We do it tomorrow.

561
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,945
What? What is it?

562
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,788
Ladislav has received a new transmission from London.

563
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:08,780
And?

564
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,387
They agreed with my request to stand down the mission.

565
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:18,943
We believe we see the situation clearly, therefore, given the situation,

566
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:22,023
any actions against officials of the German Reich

567
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,387
do not come into consideration.

568
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,264
Let the Jindra group know.

569
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,503
No.

570
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,465
Ladislav,

571
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:41,467
I've just decoded a message from London.

572
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,340
"Proceed. Upmost importance."

573
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,503
But this clearly states you must stand down.

574
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:50,106
You are deluded. This is for Jindra.

575
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:51,385
So how can we recognize this?

576
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,269
Then at least wait for us to clarify it.

577
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,148
It may have superseded your order.

578
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,983
We have no time.

579
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:00,188
After tomorrow Heydrich will be gone.

580
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,224
I agree with Josef.

581
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:09,264
I don't think this is a direct command.

582
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:13,867
I believe its purpose is to calm the nerves in Jindra.

583
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,101
I know you all doubt me.

584
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:17,507
- No, Ladislav...
- Please stop.

585
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,186
Suspect me of collaboration.

586
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,590
I know you've had me followed.

587
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:29,387
I understand you don't trust me, but,

588
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:32,226
if I was an informer for the Gestapo, do you think you would still be here?

589
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,380
Do you?

590
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,702
Then you tell me, Ladislav.

591
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,389
What are you afraid of?

592
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:56,869
I fear Czechoslovakia will be wiped from the map.

593
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,429
You ask me if I'm afraid?

594
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,070
Yes, I'm afraid.

595
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,467
Jan, Uncle, we do it tomorrow.

596
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,221
As planned.

597
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,510
May God be with you.

598
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,186
Jan.

599
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,987
I've shot at men in the field.
Never killed one up close.

600
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,344
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

601
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,148
- I don't want to die tomorrow.
- Give me the gun.

602
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:03,181
Breathe. Breathe.

603
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,626
Now...

604
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:09,226
Thank you, Mrs. Moravec. Thank you.

605
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,025
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

606
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:13,704
Breathe. Breathe, Jan.

607
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,860
Good.

608
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,740
Now, as we were trained.

609
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,228
As we were trained.
Concentrate on the detail.

610
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:36,541
Good.

611
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,340
Good.

612
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:41,226
Good.

613
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:44,943
We are not afraid.

614
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:47,590
Jan, we are not afraid.

615
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,150
Czechoslovakia is not afraid.

616
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,221
Huh?

617
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,387
I will wait for you up the street.

618
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:21,543
Uncle said we weren't needed for a while.

619
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:23,304
Is it today?

620
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,501
Promise me.

621
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:56,903
We have plenty of time.

622
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,311
8:25.

623
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:01,740
Where's Curda?

624
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,670
Never mind.

625
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:12,061
Valčík, you take this street behind me.

626
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:16,666
We have some sun, so take this.

627
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:21,900
If he approaches without an armed escort, then use it to signal.

628
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,981
And if he does?

629
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:26,702
Then... Then light a cigarette.

630
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,221
When the car slows to take the corner,

631
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,427
I will step out and open fire with the Sten gun.

632
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,547
This will signal the attack.

633
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,385
Jan, you stand behind the attack point

634
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,588
so you can throw grenades at the armed escort if there is one.

635
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:47,110
Opálka, you try a slow walk across here.

636
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:50,784
As he approaches, maybe you can slow him down before he takes the corner.

637
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,824
Is that clear?

638
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,947
Yeah.

639
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:57,740
Good luck.

640
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,708
- All good?
- Good.

641
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:54,748
As we were trained.

642
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:02,224
Let's move!

643
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,389
Stop!

644
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,579
Where were you, Curda?

645
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:54,027
I didn't think that you were really going to do it.

646
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:55,784
It's all over the radio. You shot him?

647
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,748
The radio said 20,000 SS troops have been drafted in to look for us.

648
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,309
I need to get my family out of Prague.

649
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,380
No, Curda.

650
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,382
No one is going anywhere, Curda.

651
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,510
You try and run now and they will pick you up before you reach the city limits.

652
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:11,867
You go home to your family, you stay calm, you shut your mouth.

653
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,902
- You think you can do that? Huh?
- Yeah.

654
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,751
- We failed, Curda.
- Failed? No.

655
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,181
We failed.

656
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:42,746
Jan?

657
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:44,820
Jan.

658
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:52,590
The Sten...

659
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:53,661
I'm sorry.

660
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,708
Karl Frank has temporarily taken Heydrich's place,

661
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:14,985
and has proclaimed a state of emergency and a curfew.

662
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:20,668
A reward of 10 million crowns will be given for any information

663
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,306
that leads to the arrest of the criminals.

664
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,701
Anyone caught aiding the criminals

665
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,579
will be shot, along with his entire family.

666
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:31,181
What went wrong out there?

667
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:51,786
We didn't even kill him.

668
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:57,266
Wounded.

669
01:07:58,539 --> 01:07:59,701
How bad?

670
01:08:01,699 --> 01:08:02,940
It's hard to say.

671
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,384
The SS still have the hospital surrounded,

672
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,543
so presumably, he's still alive.

673
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,945
It seems like the Germans have more men and guns up there

674
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,908
than on the Eastern Front.

675
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:23,940
They have taken several thousand hostages.

676
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:27,265
So, what do we do now?

677
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:32,305
Nothing is leaving or entering Prague.

678
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:36,622
They are searching door to door.

679
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:41,220
We have no safe houses left.

680
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:43,945
So, where do we go?

681
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,706
I've asked Father Vladimir Petrek.

682
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,149
He has agreed to hide

683
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,747
all the parachutists that are still here in Prague

684
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,585
until we can return you to London.

685
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:00,511
Wait here, a few hours.

686
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:03,550
I will find a safe route to the cathedral.

687
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:37,024
Hey.

688
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,021
Tell me.

689
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,342
Tell me.

690
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,149
- Marie. Marie.
- Marie.

691
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,301
- Marie. Marie.
- Marie.

692
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,701
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

693
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,466
The Germans were rounding up hostages off the street and...

694
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,667
She tried to escape.

695
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,430
It's okay.

696
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,541
It's okay. It's okay.

697
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,671
- Josef.
- Jan!

698
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,703
Stop. Stop. Josef, stop.

699
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:54,708
- Stop! Josef.
- It's my fault.

700
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:56,305
- Josef, it's not your fault.
- It's my fault.

701
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,666
Josef, listen to me!

702
01:10:57,739 --> 01:10:59,423
- Listen to me.
- It's my fault.

703
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:02,145
Stop! Listen to me. Listen to me.

704
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:05,503
You're risking the lives of everyone.

705
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:08,423
For what? To shoot a few Germans?

706
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,104
She's gone. Josef, she's gone.

707
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,264
It's not your fault. Huh?

708
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,427
- It's my fault.
- It's not your fault.

709
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:21,465
- It's my fault.
- It's not your fault, Josef.

710
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:23,429
It's not your fault, okay.

711
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,061
I am sorry, Jan.

712
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:51,622
I'm sorry, Marie.

713
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,421
Mrs. Moravec, I'm sorry.

714
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:05,780
Hey.

715
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,507
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

716
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:12,305
It's okay.

717
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,547
Father Petrek will meet you in there.

718
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,020
I'll send food with Ata. Go, go.

719
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,466
Thank you.

720
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:52,582
I regret nothing.

721
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,904
You are the bravest men I have ever met.

722
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:46,189
I'm Father Petrek. Welcome.

723
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,783
Please, come with me.

724
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,668
This is our hidden crypt.
You will be safe there.

725
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:05,742
Thank you, Father.

726
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:41,505
You made it.

727
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:45,819
Josef.

728
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:47,780
Gentlemen.

729
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:50,591
This is Švarc, Bublík and Hrubý.

730
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:52,787
They are from the airdrop this spring.

731
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,945
Boredom may be the biggest enemy we have here.

732
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,389
I'm suggesting three men on guard duty in the nave balcony at all times.

733
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,507
We rotate every six hours.

734
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,422
These three take first watch.

735
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,944
I'm sorry it wasn't the outcome we all hoped for.

736
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,182
None more than us.

737
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,824
Reinhard Heydrich has died in hospital.

738
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,025
A direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack.

739
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:46,189
Yesterday, the Germans went to a village, Lidice,

740
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,024
and shot every man over the age of 16.

741
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:54,386
The women and children have been taken to camps,

742
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:56,548
and the buildings were razed to the ground.

743
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:02,029
There has been talk that the village aided you somehow.

744
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,747
I've never even been to Lidice.

745
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:11,426
These are dangerous times.

746
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,981
Mere gossip wipes a whole village from the face of the Earth.

747
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:19,390
Today Karl Frank issued an amnesty broadcast.

748
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,899
A full pardon for any person and their family

749
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,706
in exchange for any information about the assassins,

750
01:18:26,859 --> 01:18:29,466
even if they did not come forward before.

751
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,828
But there is a deadline of five days.

752
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:39,302
After that, they plan to execute 30,000 Czechs.

753
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,868
- This must stop.
- What do you propose?

754
01:18:52,779 --> 01:18:55,590
Me and Josef will go to a park,

755
01:18:55,659 --> 01:18:58,105
place placards around our necks saying that we killed Heydrich

756
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,579
and commit suicide.

757
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:00,661
- Jan.
- Stupid talk.

758
01:19:00,739 --> 01:19:02,344
This is stupid talk.

759
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,787
As a soldier, it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting.

760
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,426
Do you understand that, Warrant Officer Kubiš?

761
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:21,023
The responsibility does not rest with you.

762
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,101
We know who is responsible.

763
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:26,942
They will have to answer eventually, and they will.

764
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,948
If I didn't believe that, I would not be here now.

765
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:35,030
Thank you, Father.

766
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:08,344
Ata.

767
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:12,588
Have you seen Marie?

768
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,670
Is she well?

769
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,703
Beyond this brickwork and masonry,

770
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,942
there is a large main sewer that empties into the river.

771
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:11,905
How do you know?

772
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:14,823
I found some plans in Father Petrek's office.

773
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:18,541
Now, if we can chisel through this, we have a means of escape.

774
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:19,740
Escape to where?

775
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:22,706
Well, until the British send plans for our rescue, we are stuck here.

776
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:24,747
But should we be discovered, there is no way out.

777
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:27,106
I would like us at least to have this option.

778
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,747
We would then take our chances in the streets.

779
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:31,868
Two men should be working here at all times.

780
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,586
What's her name?

781
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:06,780
Lenka.

782
01:22:15,579 --> 01:22:18,345
Earlier, what Jan said...

783
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,466
About taking your own lives.

784
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,949
Was he serious?

785
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:40,350
Maybe.

786
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,542
"Cowards die many times before their deaths.

787
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:00,622
"The valiant never taste death but once."

788
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,501
Shakespeare.

789
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,029
You say you know the men who assassinated

790
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,706
Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich,

791
01:23:27,819 --> 01:23:29,822
but you didn't take part in it.

792
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,020
You say you don't know where they are, but you know the family who sheltered them.

793
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,101
No, please... Please, no.

794
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:53,148
You walked in here on your own accord to give us this statement.

795
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,224
You say you are a true patriot and the reason for doing that

796
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,304
is because you want to protect your family

797
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,462
and for the killing of innocent Czechs to stop.

798
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,623
And you say your name is...

799
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:09,385
Karel Curda.

800
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:44,820
Chalupský.

801
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,984
Ah!

802
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,944
Where are the parachutists?

803
01:26:06,939 --> 01:26:09,511
I know nothing.

804
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:12,027
You must be confusing us with other Moravecs.

805
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,421
Where are the parachutists?

806
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:57,064
Please, let me clean myself up before I leave.

807
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,109
Go on, then.

808
01:27:03,859 --> 01:27:06,180
My son is a violinist.

809
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:11,140
Tell them he knows nothing of this. Please.

810
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:01,024
In the toilet.

811
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:36,860
Something triggered it.

812
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:38,783
Maybe other members of the church found out.

813
01:28:38,859 --> 01:28:42,023
Opálka. What did I miss?

814
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,023
Bishop Gorazd has talked to Father Petrek.

815
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,427
Apparently our presence here is endangering the church.

816
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,467
He wants us to leave.

817
01:28:48,539 --> 01:28:52,386
But Petrek has talked to Hajsky and there is a plan to get us all out.

818
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,029
When?

819
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,948
Two in the coffins, two under the dummy floors

820
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:04,182
and the other three disguised as pall bearers.

821
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,386
That's the seven.

822
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:14,782
How soon can you be ready?

823
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,064
You like to play the violin.

824
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:16,110
Maybe you would like to see your mother again.

825
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,546
Yes, we managed to save her.

826
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,229
No. No.

827
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,908
- No.
- We saved her head.

828
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:30,181
Where are the assassins?

829
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,511
Where are the assassins?

830
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:37,420
Where are they hiding?

831
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,229
Please stop.

832
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,747
Where are the assassins?
Where are they hiding?

833
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:44,543
- Stop.
- Where are they?

834
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:46,622
They're in the church.

835
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:55,270
In the Cyril and Methodius Church.

836
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:22,301
The Germans are surrounding the church.

837
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,461
We have to warn the others.

838
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,382
No, no. There is no time.

839
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:27,462
Take up defensive positions.
We hold them from here.

840
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:29,349
Bublík, take the upper gallery.

841
01:33:01,579 --> 01:33:02,819
Go back.

842
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:09,100
Back! Go back!

843
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,711
- The church is surrounded.
- We have to help them.

844
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:16,868
We must not give ourselves away, Josef.

845
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:23,020
- Jan!
- Hey!

846
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,546
- Jan!
- Keep quiet, please.

847
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:20,470
Block the stairwell.

848
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,386
That's our only way out.

849
01:35:31,619 --> 01:35:33,270
It's also the only way up.

850
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:10,780
Bublík!

851
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:15,622
Bublík!

852
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,021
- I don't want to die.
- Bublík, look at me.

853
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,067
- I don't want to die.
- Breathe.

854
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,630
Breathe with me. With me.

855
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:32,980
Big breath in. Big breath out.

856
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,507
I don't want to die today.
I don't want to die today.

857
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:39,060
- I don't want to die today.
- As we were trained.

858
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,823
- As we were trained.
- As we were trained.

859
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:43,862
Here. Look.

860
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:47,900
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

861
01:36:47,979 --> 01:36:49,903
Concentrate on the detail. Come on.

862
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:52,822
- That's it.
- I'm sorry, Jan.

863
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,984
Okay?

864
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,671
Nice and easy.

865
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,228
Yeah.

866
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,502
We're all here with you.
And Czechoslovakia is here with us.

867
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,264
Cover the stairwell!

868
01:40:14,539 --> 01:40:16,622
Bublík, the stairwell!

869
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,145
We've lost the stairwell!

870
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:44,106
Stairs!

871
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,301
I'm out!

872
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:56,506
Last one.

873
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,345
Bublík!

874
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,141
This is Jan Kubiš.

875
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:09,429
That's Adolf Opálka.

876
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:11,585
And him,

877
01:45:11,859 --> 01:45:15,386
I don't know, but it's not Josef Gabčík or Valčík.

878
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,703
Wait. Wait.

879
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,671
Hrubý, reload.

880
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,983
You should get your friends to surrender.

881
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:12,506
Josef?

882
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:15,550
You should surrender now and save yourselves.

883
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,788
- There's Curda.
- Do you hear me?

884
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,222
- Curda!
- Curda!

885
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,706
You will be treated humanely as prisoners of war.

886
01:46:25,899 --> 01:46:27,105
We are Czechs.

887
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:30,905
We will never surrender!

888
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,261
Hey.

889
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,301
We save the last one...

890
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,140
For us.

891
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,626
We dig! We dig!

892
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,826
Keep digging! Don't stop!
