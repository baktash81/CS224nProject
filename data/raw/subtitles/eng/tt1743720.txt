1
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,737
Everywhere you look these days,

2
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,403
it seems like someone's trying
to sell you something.

3
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,775
On billboards, posters, stickers,
elevators, gas pumps, airplanes,

4
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,476
cups, napkins,
coffee holders, wire hangers.

5
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,314
Even bathrooms.

6
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,480
See, it used to be that when someone
really wanted to sell you something,

7
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:04,718
they could rely on the good
old fashioned 30-second TV spot.

8
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,050
He likes it! Hey, Mikey!

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,061
But thanks to the invention
of this...

10
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,620
And this...

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,223
There's a revolution going on
called "Internet."

12
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,801
Fewer and fewer of us
are actually sitting through these.

13
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,235
Anything is possible

14
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,331
when your man smells like Old Spice
and not a lady.

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,636
So how's a poor struggling
multimillion-dollar corporation

16
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:24,734
supposed to let you know
they even exist?

17
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,906
Hey, welcome to Morning Joe,
brewed by Starbucks!

18
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,142
We do have a special guest...

19
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,445
Excuse me, I'm just going to
have a sip here of my Starbucks.

20
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,645
There you go.

21
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:35,484
Welcome to the brave new worid
of brand integration.

22
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,419
But you may know it
by its old school name...

23
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:41,251
Converse All Stars,
vintage 2004...

24
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,456
Product placement.

25
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,793
You can use a Guinness.

26
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,494
Today, product placement
is a multibillion dollar industry

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,663
that generates hard cash for movies,
creates new identities for brands,

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,470
but most importantly, delivers
the holy grail of marketing, co-promotion.

29
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,644
You see, co-promotion
is what takes a regular movie

30
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,306
and turns it into a blockbuster.

31
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,012
Take Iron Man.

32
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,813
That movie had
more than 14 brand partners.

33
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,345
Everything from a Whiplash Whopper
to Iron Man Dr Pepper cans,

34
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:11,221
to Tony Stark himself
driving of in an Audi commercial.

35
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,685
These types of partnerships

36
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,524
deliver millions of dollars
of free advertising for the movie

37
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,157
while also raising visibility
for the companies themselves.

38
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,868
But do all these co-promotions
actually work?

39
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,302
Do they have that much influence
over the choices we make?

40
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,206
Does Shrek make me want to take
a Royal Caribbean Cruise

41
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,208
or Burger King make me
wanna go see Twilight?

42
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,204
Is the only thing missing from my movie
achieving Iron Man status

43
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,714
a little co-promotion?

44
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,414
Well, if that's true,

45
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:40,352
then I can't wait to get some of that
sweet Hollywood ad money.

46
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:45,493
Last year, more than $412 billion
were spent on marketing and advertising.

47
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,319
And out of that
$412 billion,

48
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,488
just four companies
controlled over 75% of it.

49
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:53,031
If I'm gonna make a doc-buster

50
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:56,035
it seems like these companies
are a great place to start

51
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,398
So what I wanna do,

52
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:03,239
is make a film all about product placement
marketing and advertising,

53
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,869
where the entire film is funded

54
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,347
by product placement, marketing,
and advertising.

55
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:10,280
So the movie will be called
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

56
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,717
So what happens
in The Greatest Movie Ever Sold

57
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,347
is that everything from top to bottom,
start to finish,

58
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,119
is branded from beginning to end.

59
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,887
You know, from the above-the-title sponsor
that you'll see in the movie

60
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,088
which is brand X...

61
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:25,564
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,
the Staples Center...

62
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:28,425
These people will be married to the film
in perpetuity, forever,

63
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,596
- So the film explores this whole idea...
- It's redundant.

64
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:31,798
- It's what?
- It's redundant.

65
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,772
In perpetuity forever?
I'm a redundant person,

66
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:35,638
I'm just saying...

67
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,905
That was more for him.
It's in perpetuity, period, forever.

68
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,071
But not only are we going to have
the brand X title sponsor,

69
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:43,878
but we're gonna make it so we can sell out
every category we can in the film.

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,975
So maybe we sell a shoe,

71
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,486
and it becomes
"The Greatest Shoe You Ever Wore,"

72
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,147
"The Greatest Car You Ever Drove,"
from The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

73
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,156
You know,
"The Greatest Drink You've Ever Had"

74
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,282
courtesy, The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

75
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,620
So the idea is beyond just showing that
brands are part of your life,

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,222
but actually get them to finance the film.
Is that it?

77
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,289
Get them to finance the film

78
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,266
and actually we show the whole process
of, "How does it work?"

79
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,429
The goal of this whole film
is transparency.

80
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,734
You're going to see the whole thing
take place in this movie.

81
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:09,502
So that's the whole concept.
The whole film, start to finish.

82
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,668
And I would love for CEG
to help make it happen.

83
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,407
Hey, you know, it's funny
'cause when I first hear it,

84
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:18,981
it is the ultimate respect
for an audience.

85
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:23,418
I don't know how receptive
people are going to be to it, though,

86
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,090
Do you have a perspective, or...

87
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,822
I don't want to use "angle" cause that
sort of has a negative connotation...

88
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,591
- Do you know how this is going to play out?
- No idea.

89
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,433
How much money
does it take to do this?

90
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:34,792
- $1.5 million.
- $1.5 million,

91
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,859
Okay,

92
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,500
I think you're going to have
a hard time meeting with them,

93
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,974
but I think
it's certainly worth pursuing

94
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,705
a couple of really big, obvious brands,

95
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,006
Who knows?
Maybe, by the time your film comes out

96
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,877
we'll look like
a bunch of blithering idiots.

97
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,346
What do you think
the response is going to be?

98
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,511
The responses
mostly will be no.

99
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,949
But is the toughest sell because of the film
or is the toughest sell because of me?

100
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,147
Both.

101
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,618
That meeting, not so optimistic.

102
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,056
So can you help me? I need help.

103
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,060
- I can help you.
- Okay.

104
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:07,157
- Good.
- Good.

105
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:08,992
Awesome!

106
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,800
- We got to figure out which brands.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,471
That's the challenge.

108
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,568
When you look at the people
you deal with, or...

109
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,872
We've got some places we can go.

110
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:20,208
- Okay. Okay.
- Turn the camera off,

111
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,976
I thought "turn the camera off" meant
"let's have an off-the-record conversation."

112
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,318
Tums out it really means,
"We want nothing to do with your movie."

113
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:32,218
Luckily, I've got an old friend in the industry
who might be a bit more receptive,

114
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,385
Richard Kirshenbaum
has worked in advertising for years

115
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,829
and has made a name for himself
and his agency

116
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,594
by not thinking like an agency.

117
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,092
If anyone out there is
going to get in its him.

118
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,569
So ultimately what
we want to try and do,

119
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,334
is create what is the Iron Man
of documentaries.

120
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:49,340
The documentary that when it comes out,
has so many partners

121
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,571
has so many brands involved...

122
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:55,673
I love the idea that you're actually
selling out, you're admitting selling out,

123
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,686
- and therefore not selling out.
- And therefore not selling out.

124
00:05:58,742 --> 00:05:59,743
It's genius,

125
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,420
And the story, also,
is talking to people

126
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,458
who say this is a problem with the industry,
this is wrong.

127
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:06,390
But then there's people
who are like, "How could it be wrong?

128
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,759
"It's where we started in television.
It's where we started in film."

129
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:12,425
So the film is about
the marketing of movies,

130
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,195
and I want to be a sponsor.

131
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,200
You guys can tell me
better than anyone else

132
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,899
what the, kind of like,
"Here's what we pay you for these things,"

133
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,703
and so you start to see these things
come to fruition

134
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:21,970
- over the course of the film.
- Right.

135
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,978
So you're willing to sell out completely,
personally, to do this?

136
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,074
- Whatever it takes.
- Great.

137
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,713
So what do we do now?

138
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:32,246
I think the thing to do
is go get a client.

139
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,577
Get one.

140
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,644
- Thank you.
- Great to see you.

141
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,382
- This is going to be fun.
- Yeah, thanks, guys.

142
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,421
To get my first client,
I need to understand two things.

143
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,592
Who would actually sponsor this movie?

144
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,722
And how I'm supposed to talk to them.

145
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:45,960
Britt Johnson is the president
of Media Placement,

146
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,831
one of the most successful
product placement agencies in the country.

147
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,971
And David Wales is the president
of the Ministry of Culture

148
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,634
and makes his living,
predicting the next big trends in advertising.

149
00:06:55,832 --> 00:07:00,247
If we were going out to sell somebody
to be a product or brand in the film,

150
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:01,471
what's that worth?

151
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,414
It depends on
how many people you reach,

152
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,481
- Dozens.
- Dozens?

153
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,816
This movie is going to reach
dozens of people.

154
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:08,912
It would depend how
many people you reach.

155
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,916
How do I figure out
who I should go after?

156
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,084
I would just go for everybody.

157
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,591
- As long as the check clears.
- Yeah, as long as the check clears.

158
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,653
The one good thing is,

159
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,993
you might be able
to get a lot of the things paid for,

160
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,122
That's a good question,

161
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,669
so what are the things we should be
looking for to try and get for free?

162
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,862
I think you might be
able to get a beer brand,

163
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,698
hotels, air service, computers, car.

164
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,940
You definitely
should have a sports car.

165
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,506
What about clothing?

166
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,314
- Yeah! Clothing?
- Can you get clothing?

167
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,473
Yeah, clothing would be easy,

168
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,275
How do I make a company
want to be in this movie?

169
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,977
You start by acknowledging
that you yourself are a brand. Right?

170
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:42,722
What's your brand collateral?
What are you bringing to the table?

171
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,482
I guess that's what
you need to figure out

172
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,616
in terms of making yourself
appealing to them.

173
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,658
How would you guys describe your brand?

174
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,860
My brand?

175
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,969
I don't know like...

176
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,363
I like really nice clothes.

177
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,472
'80s revival meets skater punk.

178
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,740
Unless it's laundry day.

179
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:07,842
The brand that I am is...
I would call it "Casual Fly,"

180
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,482
If Dan were a brand,

181
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:14,920
he might be
a classic convertiblr Mercedes-Benz.

182
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,826
Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl?
I don't know.

183
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,663
Failed writer, alcoholic brand?
Is that something?

184
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,656
I think most Of Hollywood
has that brand covered.

185
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,430
For me to get any companies on board,

186
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:30,663
I first need to understand
what I'm offering them.

187
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,602
That's where
Olson Zaltman comes in.

188
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,406
By using an intense
form of psychoanalysis,

189
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,570
they've helped companies
like Hallmark, Nestle, and Febreze

190
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,945
better understand
what they call their brand personality.

191
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,211
- You brought your pictures, right?
- I did.

192
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:48,845
The very first picture,
is a picture of my family.

193
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,013
So tell me about how it relates

194
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,956
to your thoughts and feelings
about who you are.

195
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,595
These are the people who shaped
the way I look at the world.

196
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,262
Tell me about this world.

197
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:59,765
I think your world is the world
that you live in.

198
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,802
The people that are around you,
your friends, your family.

199
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,734
The way you live your
life, the job you do,

200
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,601
All those things stemmed
and started from one place.

201
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,370
And for me, they stemmed and started
with my family in West Virginia.

202
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,604
What's the next one
you wanna talk about?

203
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,873
The next one...
This was the best day ever.

204
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,246
How does this relate to your thoughts
and feelings about who you are?

205
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,943
It's like, "Who do I wanna be?"

206
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,714
I like things that are different,
I like things that are weird.

207
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,248
I like weird things.

208
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,717
Tell me about the "why" phase.
What does that do for us?

209
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,156
What is the machete?
What pupa stage are you in now?

210
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,627
Why is it important to reboot?
What does the red represent...

211
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:32,461
Tell me a little bit about that harp.
What is it about you that's not who you are?

212
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,269
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks for your patience,

213
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,105
- Great job. Thanks a lot.
- All right.

214
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,603
Yeah, I don't know
what's going to come of this.

215
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,782
There was a whole lot of crazy
going on in there.

216
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,172
The first thing we saw

217
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:53,948
was this idea that you had two distinct
but complementary sides

218
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,683
to your brand personality.

219
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,418
The Morgan Spurlock brand
is a mindful play brand.

220
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,620
Those are kind of juxtaposed
very nicely together,

221
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,594
and I think there's almost
a paradox with those.

222
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:06,657
And I think some companies
will just focus on one of their strengths

223
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,996
or the other, instead
of focusing on both.

224
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,538
Most companies tend to,
and it's human nature,

225
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:15,709
to avoid things that they are not sure of,
avoid fear,

226
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,607
those elements,
and you really embrace those,

227
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,705
and you actually turn them into positives
for you, it's a neat thing to see,

228
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,441
What other brands are like that?

229
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,781
The first one here is a classic, Apple.

230
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:30,847
And you can see here, Target, Wii,
Mini from Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.

231
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,187
Now there's playful brands
and mindful brands,

232
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,353
those sorts of things
that have come and gone,

233
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:38,398
but a playful mindful brand
is a pretty powerful thing.

234
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:39,956
Awesome.

235
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,303
That's good. That's a good thing,

236
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,130
Now that I know what type
of brand personality I have

237
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,674
it's time to figure
out what other companies

238
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,007
would want to be in business with someone
as mindful and playful as myself

239
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,877
Time for a little brand recon.

240
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,688
Nothing like a cold call...

241
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,689
to show exactly how
little power you have.

242
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:10,487
This movie is brought to you by Apple Zings,

243
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,359
Crisco. Kenneth Cole.
Prada. Paul Smith.

244
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:17,100
Welcome to the Johnson & Johnson
Company's world headquarters.

245
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,330
Starbucks Coffee?

246
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:19,599
Thanks for calling Target Corporation.

247
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,034
Ben & Jerry's...

248
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,197
Licefreee!

249
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,400
Carmex...

250
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,671
This film is brought
to you by B complex.

251
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,280
Documentaries are not as seen
as feature films.

252
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,750
I can't do it. I'm the Director
of Public Relations for Guess.

253
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:37,620
We will never put Morgan, your average Joe,
on a billboard, ever.

254
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,416
You're making a film about that?

255
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:40,515
- I am.
- Okay.

256
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:45,894
We would love it for JetBlue
to be the official airline.

257
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:47,627
What is the greatest
car you could drive?

258
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,224
I think it's got to be a Ford.

259
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,269
The Volkswagen.

260
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,031
The Lexus hybrid being the official car.

261
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,129
BlackBerry phone...

262
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:54,229
Seventh Generation...

263
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,468
Huge fan of Fluevogs...

264
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,975
We got a fax from Volkswagen.

265
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,046
"It is my understanding
that you discussed with our agent,

266
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:03,273
"DDB Entertainment International,
the possibility of our involvement

267
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:05,783
"in an upcoming documentary film
directed by Morgan Spurlock

268
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,286
"that will explore product placement
in the movies.

269
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,719
"After due consideration,

270
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,453
"Volkswagen Group of America Incorporated
and DDB

271
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:17,758
"have determined that it is not
in Volkswagen's best interest

272
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,097
"to be involved in this documentary
in any manner. In any manner."

273
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,795
Diet Coke. Levi's.

274
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:25,735
Be stupid, Diesel.

275
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:27,271
It's not something that we do.

276
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,139
Think how great it would be.
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold video game.

277
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,609
We're just unable to participate.

278
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,613
What about if in the film,
we had either a cowboy

279
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:37,149
or an animated camel
smoking your brand?

280
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,311
My response is, we really don't wanna
be in the film.

281
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,854
I mean, it doesn't sound like a movie
that I would be excited about going to,

282
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:46,357
Right. So why wouldn't you want
to go see this movie?

283
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,428
It goes against everything that we do.

284
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,087
What if we loaded it with nudity?

285
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,153
Yes, that would help.

286
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,460
Indian Vegetable Korma.

287
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,832
The official grandpa slipper.

288
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,529
I've got too many other things
to think about.

289
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,100
Can we please get Mane 'n Tail
to be the sponsor?

290
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,876
If it's good enough for your horse,
it's good enough for you.

291
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,381
Mane 'n Tail.

292
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,182
I want this. This is the best.

293
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:21,484
You gotta love a product that says,
"Directions for human use."

294
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,657
And then, it says,
"Directions for animal use."

295
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:34,902
Smells like a pretty horse.

296
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,140
We're calling Mane 'n Tail.

297
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,348
Hey Morgan, its Richard.
I've got some great news.

298
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,408
It looks like we have a client
who would love to hear your pitch.

299
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,578
Give me a call back.

300
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,664
It's our first big pitch,
with a real brand.

301
00:13:58,353 --> 00:13:59,991
Richard Kirshenbaum
hooked the whole thing up

302
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,898
with one of his clients.

303
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:06,161
So this is it. It's on!
It's real right now.

304
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,207
- I want to introduce you to Morgan.
- Hi.

305
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,908
- Hi, how are you? I'm Morgan Spurlock.
- Beth Jones.

306
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,107
I have friends who make great,
big, giant Hollywood films

307
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,616
and I have friends who make
little independent films like I make.

308
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,343
And the friends of mine
who make big giant Hollywood movies

309
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,286
say that the reason their films
are so successful

310
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,187
is because of the brand partners
that they have.

311
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,453
And then my friends who make
small independent films say,

312
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,686
"Well how are we supposed to compete
with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"

313
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:34,359
And the movie is called
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

314
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:37,363
So now how specifically
will we see Ban in the film?

315
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,963
See anytime I'm getting ready to go,
anytime I open my medicine cabinet,

316
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,269
you will see Ban Deodorant-

317
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,572
While anytime I do an interview
with someone,

318
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:49,041
I can say,
"Are you fresh enough for this interview?

319
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,806
"Are you ready? You look a little nervous.

320
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:53,145
"I want to help you calm down,
so maybe you should...

321
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,111
"Maybe you should put some on
before the interview."

322
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,281
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents,

323
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,552
Whether it's a Floral Fusion
or Paradise Winds,

324
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,752
they'll have their chance.

325
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:03,954
We'll have them geared
for both male or female,

326
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,290
solid roll-on or stick, or whatever it may be.

327
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:09,097
That's the two-cent tour.

328
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,898
So now I can answer any of your questions
and give you the five-cent tour.

329
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:13,962
We are a smaller brand,

330
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,305
much like you talked about being
a smaller movie.

331
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,969
We're very much a challenger brand

332
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,240
so we don't have the budgets
that other brands have.

333
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:24,647
So doing things like this,
remind people about Ban,

334
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,650
is why we're interested in it.

335
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,584
What are the words you would use
to describe Ban?

336
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:30,017
Ban is blank.

337
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,951
That's a great question.

338
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,292
Ban is superior technology.

339
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,335
Technology's not the way
you want to describe

340
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,426
something somebody's
putting in their armpit.

341
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:46,972
We talk about bold. Fresh.

342
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:50,700
I think fresh is a great word that really
spins this category into the positive

343
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,175
versus the "fights odor and wetness."

344
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,941
It keeps you fresh.

345
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:58,108
How do we keep you fresher longer?
Better freshness, more freshness.

346
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,444
Three times fresher.

347
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,454
Things like that that are,
you know, more of that positive benefit,

348
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,354
When it comes down to cost
and things like that,

349
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,187
do we have to have
a sideline conversation about that?

350
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,228
About what things will cost
in this film, or what?

351
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,456
- Yeah, to participate.
- No, we can talk about it now.

352
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:12,996
Okay. What do you project?

353
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,031
We're trying to sell
the above-the-title sponsorship,

354
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:17,467
the naming rights for a million dollars.

355
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,298
All the way down to brand partners

356
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:23,705
who will come in for anywhere
from $25,000 to $100,000.

357
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,971
What about concerns that you would have,

358
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,070
or things that you would be worried about?

359
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,877
You have a somewhat
controversial reputation.

360
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:33,976
How can you assure us
that it'll be done in a positive light?

361
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,486
I think, when it comes to
all of the brand partners...

362
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,318
Like the way that Ban
will be portrayed in the film will be...

363
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,925
There's no way
I would disparage Ban

364
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,721
because, again, at the end of the day
you are my partner.

365
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,559
- I think that was the main concern.
- Yeah.

366
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,394
I don't know that we have...

367
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,264
We're pretty excited about it.

368
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:50,768
Is there a number that you guys want to hit

369
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,066
that's the amount you'd want
to commit to something like this?

370
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,735
I think in that 50-range.
I think you were talking...

371
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,343
- Amazing! That's great. Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

372
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,744
- Great meeting you.
- Great presentation.

373
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,338
- Thank you,
- We're really looking forward to it.

374
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,576
One down, about 15 to go.

375
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:09,852
But I mean, as they say,

376
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,415
smells like a brand new day.

377
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,786
With Ban on board,

378
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,362
Richard thought I should talk
ta an old lawyer friend of his.

379
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,794
That way I know exactly what I can
promise folks,

380
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,060
not to mention, what I can
and can't say about them.

381
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,567
- Hey, Rick?
- Yes.

382
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,036
- Hi. I'm Morgan Spurlock.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

383
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,299
- Good to see you. How've you been?
- Good.

384
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,467
Richard called you, told you
about the film we're about to make

385
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:32,306
and we need some real legal advice.

386
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,938
We're making a movie called
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

387
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,208
The most important question,

388
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,945
what's going to keep me
from getting sued in making this movie?

389
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,451
I think you'll probably be okay

390
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:44,319
because the whole set up of the film
establishes the context.

391
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:47,882
So I can say something's the "greatest"
and not have an issue with it?

392
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,286
Yes.

393
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:53,389
Film can be a documentary,
in which case everything should be real,

394
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,228
and film
can be completely fiction.

395
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,171
And most commercials, most advertising
is slice of life, it's completely fictional.

396
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:03,902
The flip side of that,
we sometimes call "faction."

397
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,239
So wait, What's "faction"?

398
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,606
Faction is when you've combined
documentary,

399
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:14,018
or factual, or historical information
with speculation or notion.

400
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:17,620
Where you've got a mix of fact

401
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,990
and then something that you as a director,
or an author writing a book,

402
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,824
really has an obligation
to indicate to the audience

403
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:32,761
what is the historical fact and what is
the speculation in a typical work of faction,

404
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:36,775
If I say that these are the greatest sunglasses
anybody could ever wear,

405
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:38,137
in The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

406
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,143
Can I... On the inverse,

407
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:43,613
can I say that every other sunglasses
are the worst sunglasses ever made?

408
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:47,014
You know, if you're saying everything
that's a sponsor is the greatest

409
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,315
and everything else is trash,

410
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:52,119
people seeing the film are going to get
that you're making a point

411
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,022
and that it's not a
personal endorsement.

412
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:59,394
So, you're a very powerful attorney
here in New York City.

413
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,160
You're a partner in the firm.

414
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,300
So how much did this hour just cost me?

415
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,895
My rate's $770 an hour,

416
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,973
But, advertising has its value
so this is advertising for me,

417
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,910
so the question is how much
does it cost me to be in your movie?

418
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,345
All the big Hollywood blockbusters have
tie-ins with fast food restaurants.

419
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,154
Cups, toys, you name it.

420
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,180
None of those guys would call me back.

421
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,517
Bu! I did find one
Central Pennsylvania staple

422
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,650
who thought this could be right
up their alley.

423
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:33,557
They were so excited they even flew me
to their offices in their private plane.

424
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,667
As I said, I am a fan of Sheetz.

425
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,000
I love Sheetz,

426
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,165
- Are you blowing sunshine up our ass?
- I am.

427
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,503
- Okay.
- In a great way.

428
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,273
Shameless marketing.

429
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,540
More shameless plugs,
that's what we want to do for Sheetz,

430
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,944
We're going to be traveling around talking

431
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,951
about the impact of product placement,
marketing and advertising,

432
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,851
talking to people along the way.
And where better to talk to people,

433
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,086
- than at a Sheetz?
- True.

434
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,590
At a gas pump,

435
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:01,752
I want to hear people,
what they think about products.

436
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,021
What do they think about Sheetz?

437
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,722
And again,
when we're going to interview people

438
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,790
we wanna make sure we interview people
right inside of a Sheetz location.

439
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,227
We want to sit down and have interviews
with someone who...

440
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,601
- Have a sandwich.
- Yeah, we'll have a sandwich.

441
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,604
Here I am enjoying a meatball sub
talking to this gentleman.

442
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,904
We're talking about product placement.

443
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:20,976
And so maybe we'll talk to somebody
who's against product placement,

444
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,379
who's against advertising,
against marketing in films.

445
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,415
We'll talk to them inside of a Sheetz.

446
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,315
- While they have the product in their hand.
- Of course. That's the best part.

447
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,218
Cool. All right, yeah.

448
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,915
And for me, what I'm really excited about,

449
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,426
is to have Sheetz be the home
of our collector cups.

450
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:40,425
Of course, the fleet truck,
for The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

451
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,628
There's the cup where you'll get
The Greatest Floozie You'll Ever Drink,

452
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:44,726
Right inside there...

453
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:47,739
And of course, "Holy Sheetz,
I can't believe how many choices there are!"

454
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:50,733
"Collect all four at your Sheetz."

455
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:54,174
See? First time ever,
documentary with collector cups,

456
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,307
They're going to be on
that like a wet T-shirt,

457
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:59,646
That's right. That's big right there,
that's big.

458
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:02,845
What do you think are the probability
of negative press is?

459
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:07,256
Is that, like,
"Here's this jerk who's making

460
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:11,525
"this horrible, horrible marketing movie

461
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,597
"with the assumption
that Americans are idiots."

462
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,931
Okay? And then that's what they talk about
on E! or something.

463
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:22,202
"Morgan is an idiot and he
thinks all of Americans are idiots

464
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,936
"and all the people who sponsored
this film are idiots.

465
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,775
"They're bigger idiots."
What does that do to our brand?

466
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,180
This film will literally talk
about this thing that is in front of all of us.

467
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,479
That is, literally,
right there every day

468
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,521
and bring it home in a way
that just makes us think about it,

469
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,988
recognize it. I don't think
people will look at you like you're stupid,

470
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,959
I think people will look at you like,
"These people were brave enough

471
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,186
"to be a part of this because
they're not afraid of their brand."

472
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:44,285
Is there a plot?

473
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,359
Or is it just shameless marketing?

474
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:51,994
No. The plot is literally me trying to find
the people to support a film like this,

475
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,796
that talks about the topic. This is the...
This is the movie right now.

476
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,407
This is it. it's happening,

477
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:00,967
Is there a base number, though,
of what you guys are comfortable saying,

478
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:02,875
- "We'll commit to this"?
- Yes.

479
00:22:03,003 --> 00:22:06,075
A hundred.
We had said we'd commit to 100 as a base.

480
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,311
- Thank you. It was a pleasure.
- It was a pleasure to meet you.

481
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:11,488
Can we take these mics off?

482
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,556
Couldn't have gone any better than that.
I don't think.

483
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:15,418
Or maybe it could have,

484
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,560
I don't know
if he's blowing sunshine up our ass

485
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:21,656
trying to get money out of us, or...
You know, I mean, what's going on here?

486
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,066
This is all about marketing,
you know what I mean?

487
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:26,700
Are we really friends yet?

488
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:29,036
I don't know if we're friends yet.

489
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,902
Meanwhile, on the other
side of the country,

490
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:33,443
I think I may have
finally found a drink sponsor.

491
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:35,877
It's not Coke or Pepsi.
They wouldn't call me back either.

492
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:39,110
It tums out; though, that POM Wonderful
100% Pomegranate Juice

493
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:44,053
is filled with antioxidants,
is apparently 40% as effective as Viagra,

494
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:48,685
and is a multimillion dollar corporation
that takes a unique approach to marketing.

495
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:51,889
The way that I wanna see POM,
or when we first see POM in the movie,

496
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:54,294
or find out you are on,
is we get the call.

497
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:57,359
Maybe you guys are gonna be in,
"We're gonna do it.

498
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:58,732
"We wanna be the official beverage."

499
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,863
And so then every other beverage
in the movie is blurred out.

500
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,970
We will never see
another beverage in the movie.

501
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,067
Every other thing will start to become blurry
except for POM.

502
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,807
There's been all those times where

503
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,404
there's been product placement in movies

504
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,279
and integration.
We want to take it one step further

505
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:16,081
where we want to be the first movie ever
to actually have 30-second commercials

506
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,451
right in the middle of the film.

507
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:21,983
So we're gonna shoot commercial spots.
There'll be three spots throughout the film,

508
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,959
as I said, our top three sponsors.

509
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:25,221
The above-the-title sponsors

510
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:27,162
and the other two which
will have 30 second spots

511
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:29,131
of which POM would
be a great commercial.

512
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:31,463
We have some really good ideas
that we could do something with that.

513
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,936
There's no better marketer than NASCAR.

514
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:37,800
NASCAR does a great job about showing
their loyalty to brands,

515
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:40,137
showing their partners
with brand sponsorships,

516
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,146
and one of the things they do so well
is the NASCAR suit.

517
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,146
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold
needs to have a suit,

518
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:48,082
so then, when I go out and go
on the late night programs,

519
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,179
of course I'll be wearing
my Greatest Movie Ever Sold suit,

520
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,282
which of course will have
a giant POM Wonderful logo on it,

521
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,793
Other sponsor logos, you know,
covering it throughout.

522
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,187
And so that's the end,

523
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,128
as you can see
I'm at the end of my POM bottle...

524
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:01,427
Look how happy I am...

525
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:05,028
And so we would love to have you
guys be the official beverage,

526
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,503
What questions do you have for me?
What can I answer for you?

527
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:12,703
We're an extremely high quality product
with a real brand image to uphold.

528
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,970
How do we know that the other sponsors
you're gonna put in the film

529
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:17,447
are compatible with that?

530
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,278
The brands we wanna go after
are the brands that really reflect

531
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,546
what I think the movie stands for,
what I stand for.

532
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:26,350
Doing something different,
doing something innovative.

533
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:31,395
We think that you represent POM in a way,
and POM represents you.

534
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:33,327
We're compatible together.

535
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,461
So that's why I'm attracted to it.

536
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:39,066
The other thing is full transparency
is very important to us.

537
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:42,236
I think it's important that people
know how much we spent

538
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:46,300
to get in this movie
and that we actually paid for it, because...

539
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,140
- Why not?
- Do you have any concerns?

540
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:49,744
Of course!

541
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,178
I wouldn't be a Jewish mother
if I didn't have concerns.

542
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:58,916
But part of being out there and being
successful is taking chances,

543
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,183
you know?

544
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:03,157
So this is uncharted territory,
which is exciting for us.

545
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:05,193
- POM was uncharted territory.
- Right.

546
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:10,059
So on your title card, it said
"Brand X - The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

547
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:13,397
Is Brand X what you're going to put on there
or are you open to...

548
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:15,063
No, it's going to be POM Wonderful,

549
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:17,766
- Is it gonna be POM Wonderful?
- Well, I mean, it could be...

550
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:21,209
- If we make a deal.
- Now we're getting down to brass lacks,

551
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:25,872
If you want to be Brand X,
which I would love for POM to be Brand X...

552
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,019
POM Wonderful presents
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

553
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,553
We wanna sell the above-the-title
sponsorship for a million dollars.

554
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,525
Does a million dollars come
with 100% complete satisfaction guarantee?

555
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,192
For me? Yes.

556
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:53,205
Talk about the amenities
that the Hyatt has to offer,

557
00:25:56,536 --> 00:26:00,916
In the film, I'll come visit you guys
and pitch you about being in the film.

558
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:03,420
Have you ever done any product placement
or anything like this?

559
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:04,477
No.

560
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:06,887
And now I'd rather know what we get?
What do we get?

561
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:08,615
- So, are you in?
- We're in.

562
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,656
Mini Cooper,
official car of The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

563
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:14,823
Are we getting seven?

564
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,916
Maybe I shouldn't be celebrating just yet.

565
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:37,080
Even with all these brands signed
on to the movie,

566
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:39,419
believe it or not
POM just won't give me the million dollars.

567
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:42,659
For that to happen, I have to accomplish
a lot of other things.

568
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:45,252
Like show on over 250 screens worldwide,

569
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:47,423
sell 500000 downloads and DVDs,

570
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:49,965
generate more than 600 million
media impressions,

571
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:52,594
and make more than $10 million
at the box office.

572
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:55,100
And then there's
what's in all other contracts!

573
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:58,939
I can only stay at a Hyatt,
have to pump gas at a Sheetz,

574
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,170
I can only eat Amy's Pizza,

575
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,770
I can't disparage
the entire country of Germany

576
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,874
and I have to conduct an interview
in one of JetBlue's aircraft.

577
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:09,010
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

578
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,518
As all these contracts are coming in,

579
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:16,026
I'm just a bit overwhelmed,
at a loss, confused.

580
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:20,826
So with POM, based on this contract,
can I drink anything else in the movie?

581
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:21,957
I don't think you can,

582
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:25,127
and I would certainly recommend against it
because, I think it sort of goes...

583
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:27,501
Even if there's not an
explicit prohibition,

584
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,337
you've got to show some deference
to this sponsor and this product.

585
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:34,475
It says here we're gonna give them the right
to use content of the film.

586
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,810
Do we get to decide
what content that is?

587
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:41,679
Most of these sponsors are looking
for sort of a reciprocal quid pro quo thing

588
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:46,324
where you're gonna use their brands,
but they do want a piece of this movie

589
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,390
and to be able to associate themselves
with the movie

590
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,984
and with the valuable name
and image of Morgan Spurlock,

591
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:54,528
They're asking for final approval of the film.
Do we have to show them the whole movie?

592
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:55,894
If they have final
approval of the whole film,

593
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,730
yes, you'd have to show them
the whole movie.

594
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,565
But do... We don't have to...

595
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,367
Do we have to do that
or can we just show them pieces of the film?

596
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,338
This is a multi-national brand,

597
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:07,941
and they're very protective
about how they're going to be perceived,

598
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,411
and how their brand is
going to be perceived.

599
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:11,443
I feel like we're losing...

600
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:14,018
I'm gonna lose the ability
to actually have control over the movie.

601
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:18,018
And I just need you to tell me...

602
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:20,453
Or you tell me if I am,

603
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:23,255
I just wanna know that
I can still make the movie I wanna make.

604
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,123
How much influence
are they gonna have over the movie?

605
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,955
It depends on the movie
that you wanna make.

606
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,062
At the end of the day, it's your voice

607
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,602
and it's gonna be your reputation
as a filmmaker that you have to protect.

608
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:40,302
You have to stand up
for what you believe is working for the film

609
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,573
and what isn't working for the film.

610
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,280
- You have a couple of choices,
- Okay.

611
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,250
One choice is to allow yourself
to be co-opted a little bit.

612
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:51,986
That's you know...
You dip your toe in the water.

613
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,288
Pretty soon you're putting your foot
in the water,

614
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,757
pretty soon you're swimming,

615
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:57,624
and you don't think you're changing,

616
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,895
You just say, "Okay,
I'll do a little more."

617
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,893
You end up swimming,
that's what they're anticipating,

618
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:05,297
The other option is to resist,

619
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:09,635
and maybe end up in Montana
growing your own food.

620
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:13,910
This movie is actually
documentary evidence

621
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,680
of how fucked up marketing is.

622
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:20,144
It's shrill, it's ever-present.

623
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:26,018
Whatever... If there was ever anything
pristine about the world we live in,

624
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,284
it no longer is, right?

625
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:31,955
Because you can't go anywhere
without encountering this stuff.

626
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,458
First thought,
what's it gonna do to Morgan Spurlock?

627
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:38,659
And what's it going to do
to the satire and the spoof?

628
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:42,529
Because you can satirize and spoof yourself
out of your objective.

629
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:47,272
But out of this film might come
a transformed, commercialized,

630
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,944
corporatized Morgan Spurlock,

631
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,950
And you'll never be able
to shake the identity.

632
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,947
That's your peril.
That's your challenge.

633
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,615
Well, have you got a pair of these?

634
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,990
- They're giving you products, too?
- These are Merrells.

635
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:05,359
You're gonna be completely clothed
with their products?

636
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,294
Absolutely. And this is a fantastic shoe.

637
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:09,299
- What is it?
- This is a Merrell,

638
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,400
- Merrell?
- Merrell, yeah.

639
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,466
- Where is it made?
- Merrell, they're made in America.

640
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:15,562
- Wow.
- Yeah.

641
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:17,731
Right here in the US of A.

642
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:20,202
- Is it new?
- They've been out a few years.

643
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,506
I've had a pair of these before,

644
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,807
and so we called them because actually,
I'm a fan.

645
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:26,509
- Yeah, how's the arch support?
- it's great.

646
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:28,480
- And the water?
- The waters good.

647
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:30,646
They make boots that are waterproof as well.

648
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,417
- So where are they sold?
- They're sold in outdoor stores and...

649
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:35,925
- Catalogs?
- And catalogs.

650
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:37,688
Merrell.com, at their website.

651
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,659
- I'll have to look at that.
- Yeah.

652
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,757
- Yeah. This is a good shoe.
- Yeah.

653
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:01,047
Tell you one thing I'm glad of,

654
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:04,179
is that I'm not driving some
piece of shit Volkswagen right now.

655
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:07,187
Like, this car runs so good.

656
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:10,126
It is, like, the greatest machine
you could have on the road.

657
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,389
Gets the best gas mileage.
It looks amazing,

658
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:15,058
How good do these cars look?
They look incredible.

659
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,729
Everybody seems to have
a differing opinion.

660
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:21,099
Can you still have credibility
once a brand gets involved?

661
00:31:21,194 --> 00:31:22,764
I would argue it depends
on what kind of show it is.

662
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:27,106
If it's like a Grammy,
an Emmy Award winning drama,

663
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,612
- like, I don't know, ER...
- Law & Order.

664
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:33,115
Law & Order:
I would say that's a little more foreign,

665
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,584
If it's more of a breezy show,
or a reality show...

666
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,779
Reality and sports, all
bets are off already.

667
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,254
It's already off.
Another question is comedies and dramas,

668
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,054
That's the prime
real-estate of network TV.

669
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,992
What is the most egregious
product placement you've ever seen?

670
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:50,090
In the last two years, we're seeing people
say things in dialog

671
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:51,601
that was intended for the show.

672
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,260
"I couldn't have been here
without Dr. Pepper!"

673
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,135
Maybe if you stopped drinking
so much Dr. Pepper.

674
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,229
We're on a road trip.

675
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:58,435
Drinking Dr. Pepper
is practically a requirement.

676
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:00,068
"I love that Subway $5 Footlong!"

677
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,267
What can I do for you, son?

678
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,472
I got an extra Chicken Teriyaki Footlong.

679
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,243
I thought someone
would be interested in.

680
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:08,679
- I think that's really...
- That's fantastic.

681
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,152
Holy mother, what's going on there?

682
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:12,516
- No one says that, no one acts that way...
- Nobody acts that way.

683
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:15,650
No one acts that way.
It's always unnatural and it's forced-

684
00:32:15,748 --> 00:32:17,921
it's so forced that you go,
"I'm not watching a show,

685
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:20,362
"I'm watching a commercial."
And that ruins the whole experience,

686
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:23,996
Brian Steinberg may hate it
when product placement is too obvious,

687
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,592
but since I'm contractually obligated,

688
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:28,969
to do an interview in JetBlue's
new state-of-the-art Terminal 5,

689
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,935
I thought this would be a great place

690
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:33,034
to talk to someone who thinks
the bigger problem

691
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:35,668
is that people don't know
they're being advertised to.

692
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,636
Robert Weissman is the president

693
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,774
of the consumer advocacy group
Public Citizen,

694
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,681
and he's championing a radical way

695
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:44,310
to differentiate advertisements
from entertainment.

696
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,052
With product placement,
what do you think should be done?

697
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,224
In films and television...

698
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:51,327
The most important thing,
especially for television,

699
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,125
is to have simultaneous labeling

700
00:32:54,186 --> 00:32:57,326
that people are being hit with an
advertisement at the moment they are,

701
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:59,062
- Right.
- There should be some little pop-up

702
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,864
that comes on and says, "Advertisement."

703
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,633
It could be a scroll at the bottom,
a little pop-up, whatever.

704
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:05,231
At the moment that people
are being advertised to

705
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,310
they should know
they're being advertised to,

706
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:12,982
The advertisers in the television industry
say, "The horror! That'd be terrible."

707
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,880
Because it would create clutter
on the screen.

708
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,714
- Right.
- But anyone who's watched television

709
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,718
foe betweeen
three and 10 seconds

710
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,383
knows there's tons of clutter on the screen
almost all the time.

711
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,985
There's the logo for the network,
there's pop-up advertisements,

712
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:28,327
- there's emergency things going across...
- Yeah,

713
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:30,594
...different programs,
there's two streams going across,

714
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,498
and other stuff on the side,

715
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:35,071
so there's already tons of clutter.

716
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,439
If they can do clutter for advertisement,
they can do a little additional piece

717
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:46,574
to tell people that even in the core program,
they're being exposed to an advertisement.

718
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:51,086
Robert Weissman loooves JetBlue!
Happy Jetting!

719
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:53,222
Wow, gosh, Morgan.

720
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,558
Pretty clever.
Thanks for flying me here for that.

721
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,029
I guess you have more
power than I thought.

722
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:05,364
While Robert may be leading the charge
to get rid of product placement

723
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:07,265
another guy practically invented it.

724
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,706
In Hollywood, if you need a car,
you call Norm.

725
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:13,709
If you need a beer,
you call Norm.

726
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:17,971
In fact, if you need just about anything,
you call one man,

727
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,709
Norm Marshall.

728
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,543
If anyone can tell me how much influence

729
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,610
brands are going to have
over my movie, it's him.

730
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,112
Years ago, we represented Alka-Seltzer,

731
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:32,958
and we got a call from one of our friends
and he said,

732
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:35,497
"Hey, the director just called a shot

733
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,794
"and he wants the character, it's a comedy...

734
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,233
"And he wants the character
to chew an Alka-Seltzer tablet

735
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,896
"and then foam at the mouth."

736
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,772
We immediately jumped in the middle of it
and had a direct call to the director

737
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:49,938
who immediately started giving me
some push-back and I, you know...

738
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:51,269
We couldn't resolve it,

739
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:56,149
so I called the transportation coordinator
and said "Billy, bring all the cars back."

740
00:34:56,575 --> 00:35:01,820
So Billy went to the producer and said,
"How'd you piss off Norm Marshall?"

741
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,826
"Well, I just was talking to him
about this Alka-Seltzer thing."

742
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,486
"Well, he wants all his cars back."

743
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:09,759
And then he calls back and says,
"We've changed the Alka-Seltzer scene."

744
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:13,325
So those are the kinds of things
that you can't do from Madison Avenue,

745
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:17,931
or whatever, and that's how fluid
the industry is, it changes very...

746
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,440
- On a moment.
- Yeah.

747
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:24,191
Who has more power and influence
in Hollywood, writers or brands?

748
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:27,178
The individual writer on the individual show,
if that show is successful,

749
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,718
has more power than
the individual brand,

750
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:33,187
but overall there is going to be a moment,
and I don't think it's very far off,

751
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:37,351
where the larger brands,
meaning the larger advertisers,

752
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:41,123
can dictate to the network the conditions
under which they're prepared to advertise.

753
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:42,822
Do you guys ever
recommend script changes?

754
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,122
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

755
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:45,668
- Doesn't always happen, but--
- Right.

756
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,667
Thank you for calling
Straight Arrow Products.

757
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:00,141
I've gotta try to keep a straight face,

758
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,208
Are you there? Hello?

759
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,212
- Hello.
- Hey!

760
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:08,390
We just wanted to get a feel
for the idea of the scene

761
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,324
- and how you were gonna position...
- For us, the whole goal

762
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:14,694
is to try and put something in there...
Products that we think that are interesting,

763
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:17,700
that could be fun, that at the same time
represent an extension--

764
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:19,702
The extension of what we're
trying to make with this film...

765
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:21,667
That's good
'cause that's what we liked about it.

766
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,673
Because again, the image
is to keep Mane 'n Tail fun.

767
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:28,072
Yeah, I completely agree, and so for me,
in the scene that we wanna do,

768
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:31,170
you literally start off
on a close-up of the bottle.

769
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,339
Like, there's the bottle.

770
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:34,577
You pull out to see here, you know,
here we are in the bathtub.

771
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:35,913
I'm there washing my hair,

772
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,851
You pull out a little more,
you see me washing my little boys hair,

773
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,580
You pull out a little bit more,
and as I turn to the left

774
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,091
and there I am
washing my Shetland pony in the tub.

775
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:44,352
- There you go!
- There you go!

776
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:45,755
It works for us.

777
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,023
We'll probably see
a shot of it in the beginning,

778
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,930
maybe have something in the middle
where we have a phone call

779
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,764
talking about the placement
and then have it in the end.

780
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,293
Perfect.

781
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,206
Okay. That sounds good then.

782
00:36:57,395 --> 00:36:59,432
Anything else we can answer
for you guys right now?

783
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:00,737
No, that was just the concern.

784
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:03,609
I wanted to hear exactly
what you guys were gonna be doing with it

785
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:04,908
in the scenes
and that's about it.

786
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,473
We've been a genuine company
for the past 40 years.

787
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,548
- Right.
- And we do not...

788
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,484
And we do not just don't...
Hey, people have fun with us.

789
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:15,456
They enjoy us.
We have a well-rounded good will

790
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:18,050
between our equine business
and our human side.

791
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,594
I mean, this is truly a rare product

792
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,732
in the fact that it's crossed-over
as successful as it has.

793
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,059
I completely agree.

794
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:28,399
And it still continues to be used
by horse and people so that will...

795
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,670
And this is a worldwide product
so we try to keep it fun and protect it.

796
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,641
Well, guys, this is gonna be great.
Thank you so much,

797
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:36,269
and I'm so glad you guys
want to be in the movie.

798
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,244
No, thank you for
taking the time with us.

799
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:40,816
You know, and I'm glad
you liked the product.

800
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,643
It's my pleasure, thank you, guys,
All right. Bye-bye. Thanks.

801
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,254
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

802
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,153
Awesome!

803
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:51,518
The official shampoo of The Greatest
Movie Ever Sold. Mane 'n Tail,

804
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,688
My concern is storytelling,
not story-selling.

805
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:55,992
And I don't want to be someone

806
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,761
who's trying shove a product
down someone's throat...

807
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,700
I'm trying to make people believe
these characters are real.

808
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:03,136
I've never been told, you know,

809
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:07,833
"Have them hold it a little bit higher,
and get a little bit closer to his face."

810
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:09,275
I've never been told that.

811
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:13,678
Until I started directing movies,
I didn't realize how it worked.

812
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,220
And then two guys in suits come down
to the set with a product and, like,

813
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,313
"Yeah, you need to use this in the scene."
I'm like, "What are you talking about?"

814
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:24,859
I haven't done that much
product placement in my movies

815
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:28,294
because, for the most part,
I've actually been usually refused.

816
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,895
If I wanna use...

817
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,394
I think all my first scripts

818
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:36,537
always had some scene
that took place at a Denny's.

819
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:41,071
Because I had many scenes in my early 20s
that took place at a Denny's.

820
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,877
And Reservoir Dogs,

821
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,516
in the original script the opening scene
where they're all talking, at a Denny's.

822
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,645
All right, the opening scene in Pulp Fiction,
Pumpkin and Honey Bunny at a Denny's.

823
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,850
- Yeah.
- In both cases, Denny's goes, "No!"

824
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:58,661
Truthfully, I don't ever notice it
unless it's super obvious.

825
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,563
And then when it's super obvious,
it becomes ridiculously obvious

826
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:05,062
and then
it can break the reality.

827
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:07,002
- Pardon me?
- Is it advertising?

828
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:08,428
Oh, fuck yeah.

829
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:09,901
It's the movie business.

830
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:14,943
And the game now is,
"How cheap can you make that movie?"

831
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:16,410
And "how much profit can you make?"

832
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,345
For a long time, people would say
there's a line between art and commerce.

833
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,246
Is that line just getting
thinner and thinner?

834
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,846
There are still very, very powerful
and very talented artists

835
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,085
musically and in film.

836
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,525
Like, bands like Radiohead,
filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson,

837
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,694
who are clearly not interested
in this.

838
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,957
Artistic integrity, whatever,

839
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:41,762
I mean, you know,
how do you tell the story you intended to tell

840
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,061
without compromising?

841
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:45,267
Yes. There's a bit of compromise,

842
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:48,043
but, like I said, if
there's a car in a movie,

843
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:53,879
why not be a car that a brand is helping
reach your budget?

844
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,542
Do you think it's selling out?

845
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:58,550
To who? We're all selling out.

846
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,453
GE is my boss, really, okay?

847
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:06,791
They build jet engines and weapons systems
and all kinds of crazy electronic appliances

848
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:10,162
and they don't give
a flying fuck about art.

849
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,643
So we have three spots
that we're gonna look at.

850
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:28,241
The first one looks at the healthful aspects
of POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice.

851
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:32,652
Where you see me right there
in the middle of a pomegranate field.

852
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:34,916
There's only one problem.
You can't shoot that spot

853
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,081
because there are no pomegranates
on the trees.

854
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,327
Did we miss the season? Isn't it in May?

855
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:41,761
- Oh, yeah.
- We missed it.

856
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:46,658
So, this spot is
called "POM on My Mind."

857
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,670
I come out of the gym, it's hot in the city,
I rub my eyes.

858
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:54,641
As I look back out, everything
in the world has this red tint to it.

859
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,507
As I walk down the street,
I pass a donut shop,

860
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,945
where all the donuts are stacked
one on top of the other,

861
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:02,284
And I just look at that, it's a little weird,
and I walk past a fruit stand

862
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,479
where all the apples
are all stacked one on top of the other,

863
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,852
What is going on?
What alterior universe is this?

864
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:09,152
Suddenly, all the women that I see...

865
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:14,520
All of their breasts are like this
double stacked uni-boob

866
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,496
in the middle of their chest,
I open up the fridge,

867
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:17,794
there's what I want.

868
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:23,866
Then, it's POM Wonderful
100% Pomegranate Juice. Getcha Some.

869
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:27,375
Then all of a sudden I hear "Woof'
and I look down, and there's my dog,

870
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,339
looking up at me with two heads,

871
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,812
as he turns his heads,
and then that's the spot.

872
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:37,485
It doesn't talk about our product attributes
as much as the other one does.

873
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:42,150
Yeah, yeah. It plays to the icon of the bottle,
but right, doesn't talk about what's inside.

874
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,326
This spot starts off with me popping up
into the camera

875
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:47,924
and I tap onto the lens.

876
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:52,327
And it's like, literally it's a close-up
right on my face.

877
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:54,497
And the camera starts pulling out.

878
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,436
And I go, "I wanna tell you a secret.

879
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,770
"This is just between
me and you, okay?

880
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:05,439
"But I drink POM Wonderful
100% Pomegranate Juice.

881
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:09,178
"All right?"
Now, the camera keeps pulling back.

882
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,754
"Now, not only is it loaded with antioxidants,

883
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:16,886
"but it also improves blood flow
and increases prostate health.

884
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:18,688
"But, get this.

885
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:25,057
"50% of men with mild erectile dysfunction
experience stronger erections

886
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,796
"after drinking it for only four weeks."

887
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,362
And the camera keeps pulling back,
keeps pulling back.

888
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,568
And I say, "Now who wouldn't want that."

889
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:36,275
And there I am standing with
a giant erection.

890
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,744
POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice,

891
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,374
We'll be running that on TV.

892
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,952
- Yeah...
- I'm sure the FDA would love that one.

893
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,283
This is a great campaign.

894
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:50,217
This campaign on the web would
get you more attention

895
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:51,385
than you ever knew what to do with.

896
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:54,726
It could potentially turn off
some existing customers, no?

897
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:56,391
Maybe, I don't know.

898
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,798
I think you could be
a little more subtle about it.

899
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,064
From a commercial standpoint, do you
want us to come up with other concepts?

900
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,733
Wouldn't it be interesting if we
took the Minute Maid example?

901
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:08,801
Their juice has mainly apple juice.

902
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,748
Ours is 100% Pomegranate juice
and theirs is one-third of 1%.

903
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,510
- Wow.
- I wonder what you could do

904
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,248
with the content Lynda presented
in an advertising campaign.

905
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:24,487
Yes. We would be very
happy if you could.

906
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:29,097
Okay. I'll go back to New York
and I'll get to work on a new spot.

907
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:30,755
- All right. Great!
- Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

908
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:31,857
Thanks for your time.

909
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:38,629
So,

910
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:44,503
just had every idea that
I went in to pitch get shot down in the room.

911
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:47,646
One, after the other, after the other.

912
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:52,177
And then had them basically
tell me what they want me to pitch

913
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:57,157
which is basically their own takedown piece
of every competitor they have.

914
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,524
See part of this...
Part of this movie is, which is awesome,

915
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:08,194
is getting to see the inner-workings
of all this stuff happening.

916
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:11,332
But the other part of it, is like...

917
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:16,368
At what part...

918
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:20,372
At what part do I let myself
completely become a foil

919
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:24,710
to do everybody else's bidding, you know?

920
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,914
- Is there such a thing as truth in advertising?
- Yes.

921
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:58,951
Advertisements that say they're lying
are telling the truth.

922
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:02,115
What are some examples
of the most egregious offenders

923
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:05,092
of commercials or brands or products
that mislead you?

924
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:09,188
I have a lot in my memory,
but I lather them with amnesia

925
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:10,698
because they're so disgusting.

926
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,131
Remember how we
talked about eating better?

927
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,361
Well, it starts today.

928
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:21,736
What's deceptive about advertising
is the answer that it gives

929
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,039
to how we can be happy.

930
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:25,647
The answer that it
gives is that somehow,

931
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:29,650
products are connected
to our sense of well-being

932
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,115
and to our sense of happiness.

933
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:34,390
And I think that is kind
of, the ultimate lie.

934
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:36,721
'Cause what makes us happy
is not the products.

935
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:40,456
What makes us happy
is what the products are seen as a conduit to,

936
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:44,430
The whole spectacle is constantly
telling you that you're nothing.

937
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:49,404
You're nothing. You're inadequate.
You're a loser. You're ugly, You're stupid.

938
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,831
Unless you buy this thing.

939
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:54,100
Now, how long
does the feeling of contentment

940
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,838
you're supposed to get from that thing,

941
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:58,971
how long does that really last,
assuming it even happens at all?

942
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,141
It doesn't last. There
is no such contentment

943
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,413
You can't really be happy

944
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,354
because of some purchase like that.

945
00:46:08,446 --> 00:46:09,925
So advertising tells us a great deal...

946
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:13,690
Advertising tells us something very real
about where people are.

947
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,527
It's just that it's been disconnected
from how to achieve it.

948
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:35,440
The truth in advertising
is a big thing people keep talking about-

949
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,454
Is there truth in advertising?
Can we trust what the ads say?

950
00:46:41,012 --> 00:46:43,458
Bigger thing is,
can you trust what regular people say?

951
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,286
Take that fish right there.

952
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:49,054
That fish is Nemo 2.

953
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:54,327
Nemo 1 died in a terrible drowning accident,
apparently, in his own bowl,

954
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:55,971
a few days ago,

955
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:59,039
so while my little boy was still asleep,
I came downstairs,

956
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,701
fished him out, flushed him down the toilet,
went to the pet store,

957
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:04,973
got another one as close to
the exact color as I could recollect...

958
00:47:05,403 --> 00:47:06,404
Nemo 2.

959
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:08,742
How long can I keep this going

960
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,252
until my son actually realizes
that it's not the same Nemo?

961
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:14,245
I don't know.

962
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,854
Truth in advertising.

963
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,159
Is there truth in advertising?

964
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:23,995
Yeah, I think there's some.

965
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:28,666
Truth to me, honesty, integrity, character,
Just be real about it.

966
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,262
No robbery without a gun.

967
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:32,568
There's some honest advertising out there.
There is.

968
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:34,370
It does exist, and that's cool.

969
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,705
But I just don't like
stuff that lies.

970
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:38,676
There is definitely truth in advertising.

971
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:41,610
You just have to gloss it a little bit
to make people want to hear it.

972
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:44,880
When you read the labels,
the ingredients labels on food products

973
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,955
and if you have any knowledge
of what the stuff is that's in there,

974
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:50,514
it's shocking.

975
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:53,357
When you look at a juice bottle
that says 100%,

976
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:55,186
100% What?

977
00:47:55,353 --> 00:47:58,391
They think it's 100% real juice,
and it's not, it's only 10% juice

978
00:47:58,456 --> 00:48:01,232
and they buy it and drink it and they think
they're drinking something healthy,

979
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:02,862
but its not. That's offensive to me.

980
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,733
Check the label. That's what
they tell us to do when we go shopping.

981
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:07,706
But how much of what's on the label
can we really believe?

982
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,870
Take this juice. Label has a giant picture
of a pomegranate on it,

983
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:14,381
blueberries front and center.
Must be filled with all that good stuff, right?

984
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:15,539
Well, guess again,

985
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,586
99% of this juice is apple and grape.

986
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,710
So how much pomegranate and blueberry
is in it?

987
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:20,915
Less than 1%.

988
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,457
That's why I drink POM Wonderful.

989
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:24,219
It's 100% pomegranate juice.

990
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:26,886
You'd have to drink 90 of these,
that's 80,000 calories,

991
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,895
to get the same amount of pomegranate juice
that's in just one of these.

992
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,262
Check the label on that one.

993
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,960
POM Wonderful.
Get Real.

994
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:46,347
- Good morning.
- Hello sir. Good morning,

995
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,983
- welcome to Grand Hyatt Hotel, Sao Paulo.
- Thank you very much.

996
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,019
As a diamond member,
you have automatically

997
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:53,110
an upgrade to our executive rooms.

998
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:56,453
After flying all night,
I'm ready for a little sleepy time.

999
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:06,434
Sao Paulo is one of the largest cities
in the Western Hemisphere,

1000
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,492
and recently they've
done something radical.

1001
00:49:08,793 --> 00:49:11,774
Passing a bill outlawing
all outdoor advertising.

1002
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:15,136
No billboards. No banners, no posters.
Nothing.

1003
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,869
Mayor Gilberto Kassab
passed the bill into law.

1004
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:21,142
And Regina Monteiro, the director
for urban planning of the city

1005
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,481
was the one who originally
came up with the idea.

1006
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,782
What was the inspiration
for the clean city law?

1007
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:32,389
People became
more and more aware

1008
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,955
that the pollution in Sao Paulo

1009
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:37,296
was one of its main problems.

1010
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:42,528
And by "pollution" we not only mean air,
water, or sound,

1011
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:43,798
but also visual pollution.

1012
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,564
We could no longer see the city.

1013
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,642
We were just reading and reading.

1014
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:52,837
I try to do things to change the city

1015
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:55,975
so that Sao Paulo can
be seen in the world

1016
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,988
as something different since
it does not have natural beauty.

1017
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:01,885
It needs something else

1018
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:05,592
so that people
can sense it as something special.

1019
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:12,756
Research has shown positive feedback
from 90% of the city.

1020
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:14,358
Great.

1021
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:15,426
Thank you very much.

1022
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:27,039
So what was the city
like before the ban?

1023
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:31,744
There were billboards
all over the place.

1024
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:33,853
It would make people confused.

1025
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:39,187
The absence of outdoor advertising
has allowed us to see more of nature.

1026
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,523
Everything is much clearer.

1027
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:48,537
We are now able to focus
on things that we want to see and admire,

1028
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:53,406
without having other strong images
deviating our focus all the time.

1029
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:56,272
So this is the biggest shopping street
in the middle of Sao Paulo.

1030
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,947
The question is, if suddenly
all the advertising goes away,

1031
00:50:59,036 --> 00:51:00,242
how has their business been affected?

1032
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:02,577
So, we're gonna find out
from some of these shop-owners what's up.

1033
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:07,913
So how do people know about your business
if you don't advertise?

1034
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:11,894
Well, by Internet, by mouth to mouth,

1035
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:13,392
- Is there such an--
- Yeah.

1036
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:14,953
- Word of mouth?
- Yeah.

1037
00:51:15,453 --> 00:51:17,558
- Word of mouth?
- Word of mouth. Yeah, that's it.

1038
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:22,564
Did the way you advertise to get customers
change from before the ban to now?

1039
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:26,932
You have to change
the whole structure of the business.

1040
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:30,408
Today we work
instead of investing in advertising,

1041
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,648
to have something that attracts the customer.

1042
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:35,276
Our job is to look for referrals.

1043
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:40,919
Not one ad on that taxi.
Did you see that?

1044
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:46,091
No ads on the taxis. No ads on the buses.
There's no ads on the buildings.

1045
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:48,290
It's amazing.

1046
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:53,034
You might not need traditional advertising
in Sao Paulo

1047
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:57,765
but in this country, I still need to
generate 600 million media impressions.

1048
00:51:57,828 --> 00:52:01,935
To achieve that my movie is going to
need one pretty inspired ad campaign.

1049
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,442
Tony Seiniger is a Hollywood legend,
having pretty much invented the blockbuster...

1050
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:13,953
And Peter Bemis is responsible for some
of the most iconic movie posters today.

1051
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:16,951
If anyone can give me
some of that Hollywood marketing magic,

1052
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:18,352
it's these guys.

1053
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:23,464
Being of a certain age, I remember
The Greatest Story Ever Told,

1054
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:26,057
the story of Jesus.

1055
00:52:26,624 --> 00:52:28,661
- When was that movie made, mid-60s, right?
- Yeah.

1056
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:32,037
The first exercise I went
through mentally and creatively,

1057
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:35,235
was to go and do
religious take-offs, right?

1058
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:39,471
Which, I think that blasphemy
at least gets you some ink, okay?

1059
00:52:39,737 --> 00:52:42,308
The first comp

1060
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:45,082
will be you, Morgan.

1061
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,851
Only you...

1062
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:54,223
I've always wanted to rip this off.

1063
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,025
He's always wanted to rip off
The Last Supper.

1064
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:58,032
Rip off The Last Supper all right?

1065
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,666
So I figure...

1066
00:53:00,391 --> 00:53:04,862
This would be you
and you've just got a big bag.

1067
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:06,237
That's pretty fantastic...

1068
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,434
There you are, you're like this,

1069
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:11,707
You put everybody who was
iconographic of commercialism

1070
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:13,906
as the disciples coming in on you.

1071
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,177
- So, it's like the Oscar.
- Yeah.

1072
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,918
And in fact,
your legs would be posed,

1073
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:22,554
but not so close that my friends
at the Academy would sue us all.

1074
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:26,953
This is you, carrying the cross
that is covered with stickers like a NASCAR.

1075
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:29,528
That's as sick as it gets.

1076
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:33,291
Let's start with these six
and we'll trim from there.

1077
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:35,028
- Good, okay.
- In terms of title treatments,

1078
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,035
- these are both good ways to go.
- Yes.

1079
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:41,274
You should think about it, talk about it
and then we'll all talk.

1080
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:43,777
- These should be underground, right?
- That's a great...

1081
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:45,540
- You're talking about wild posting, right?
- Yeah.

1082
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:47,776
- Wild post these.
- Yeah, exactly.

1083
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,646
You put those up in New York,
Like real street art, you know?

1084
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,118
- A studio would go, "No... way,"
- I'm not touching them,

1085
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:55,450
I'm not going anywhere near that.

1086
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:59,391
I think everything is so spot on...
It's awesome.

1087
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,758
- Amazing.
- What a great client!

1088
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:02,922
- Thank you.
- All right.

1089
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:05,091
As important and great
as an iconic poster is,

1090
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:08,293
what's even more vital to a film's success
is its trailer.

1091
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,896
Using a new technique
called neuromarketing,

1092
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,301
Martin Lindstrom believes
he's unlocked the secret

1093
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:15,841
to creating a memorable one
each time.

1094
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:21,245
Trailers are now more and more produced
in Los Angeles based on neuromarketing.

1095
00:54:21,471 --> 00:54:25,419
A trailer is deadly important
for the survival of your movie.

1096
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:28,456
Now what do you do
to create the best scene?

1097
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:31,692
What you have to find out
is when is the emotional peak...

1098
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,255
The highs and the lows.

1099
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:36,626
How do you create such an engaging story
that people just have to see it.

1100
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,522
And that's exactly
what's happening now.

1101
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:42,328
So they're typically testing
five different trailers for each of the movies,

1102
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:46,167
the larger movies, and figuring out
which one is the most emotionally engaging,

1103
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:48,333
which one is creating
the most curiosity,

1104
00:54:48,431 --> 00:54:52,971
if it's a science fiction movie, which one
is creating the most fear, and so forth...

1105
00:54:53,102 --> 00:54:56,345
Is this whole thing,
because it sounds a bit crazy,

1106
00:54:56,439 --> 00:54:58,976
but is neuromarketing evil?

1107
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,449
It's like anything else...

1108
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,512
At the end of the day,
there will be people abusing it,

1109
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:06,458
which is the reason why it's fantastic
that you now dare to go through it

1110
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:09,053
and experiment like this
to show what really goes on.

1111
00:55:09,686 --> 00:55:11,461
To show how successful his technique is

1112
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:14,124
Martin is putting me through
a typical neuromarketing test

1113
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,633
strapping me down to an MRI
and blasting my head with commercials.

1114
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:19,737
Remember that scene in
A Clockwork Orange?

1115
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,068
It's kind of like that.

1116
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,648
There is three things
we're going to look at right now.

1117
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:29,149
One is fear...

1118
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,718
One is craving.

1119
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,718
And one is sex.

1120
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:36,984
Fear, craving, sex.

1121
00:55:37,046 --> 00:55:41,995
Fear, craving. Fear, craving, sex.
Fear, craving, sex.

1122
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:50,098
You may be dizzy,
so just sit for a minute, okay?

1123
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:56,172
Like, in between each one of the breaks,
I would doze off

1124
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,745
and literally, I would dream,
like in a commercial.

1125
00:55:59,669 --> 00:56:02,912
Like, the dreams would play out almost
in a 30 second commercial.

1126
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:04,211
It was kind of weird.

1127
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:05,251
- This is my brain?
- This is your brain.

1128
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,945
- This is my brain on commercials.
- Right.

1129
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:11,183
Let's take a look at the results.
This is your brain.

1130
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:14,751
There's an amazing amount
of brain activity going on.

1131
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:18,765
Did you feel like you wanted
to have a Coke after the scanning session?

1132
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:21,060
I would have liked to have had a Coke
after the scanning session.

1133
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,934
Because I remember,
you actually said that as you left the studio

1134
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,529
and I want to tell you why...
Take a look at this.

1135
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:29,233
- Okay.
- Basically, the red/yellow area

1136
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:32,609
shows that you are highly engaged
and there's a lot of activity going on.

1137
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:35,442
And not only that, we can
see you so emotionally engaged

1138
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:37,375
that something else is happening.

1139
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:38,984
The amygdala was also activated.

1140
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:42,215
This is actually an area responsible
for two activities.

1141
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,919
One is fear and the other one is the release
of a neuro-transmitter called Dopamine.

1142
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,084
And guess what?

1143
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:50,631
You got a release of Dopamine
when you saw the Coca-Cola ad.

1144
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,095
You actually wanted to have it.

1145
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:55,735
This is addiction. This is not anything else.
This is addiction.

1146
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,900
And this is really the reason why
neuromarketing is happening now

1147
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:02,465
because there's no way you could
explain that to me

1148
00:57:03,232 --> 00:57:05,508
when I was interviewing just after
watching the commercial, right?

1149
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:07,237
Yeah, no way.

1150
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:09,408
You think that
by doing stuff like this

1151
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:10,951
you're manipulating consumers
to make a choice?

1152
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:15,012
Let's get one thing right,
advertising, as a concept, is manipulation.

1153
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:18,152
But don't be fooled,
because if you go into a retail store

1154
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,785
and you think you're safe, that's the point
where you're most volatile,

1155
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:24,593
or you're the most vulnerable
in the whole process.

1156
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:30,196
Where should I be able to go
where I don't see one bit of advertising?

1157
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,201
To sleep.

1158
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:35,965
That's what it's coming down to.
It affords no limits.

1159
00:57:36,265 --> 00:57:38,108
And that's the nature
of the commercial instinct.

1160
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:39,942
It doesn't know boundaries.
It doesn't know limits.

1161
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:42,346
It goes into areas
that should be taboo

1162
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:44,145
like commercializing childhood.

1163
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:45,982
Corporations are raising our children...

1164
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:51,691
McDonalds feeds them. And Disney
and Time Warner entertains them.

1165
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,019
So, that's becoming a world,

1166
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:59,155
which is designed to create conditioned
responses just like Pavlov's dog.

1167
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:03,733
We're told that what makes children
happy are the things that corporations sell,

1168
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:09,408
and if we immerse kids in that from birth,
then it becomes what makes them happy.

1169
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:14,004
And it's not good enough to say,

1170
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:17,082
"Pick up a stick and make it
into a Harry Potter wand."

1171
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:20,154
You have to have the "real wand."

1172
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:22,687
From a young age,
you're buying into this identity...

1173
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:24,725
"This stuff makes me who I am."

1174
00:58:24,814 --> 00:58:27,488
Right. And what that does
is take away from creative play.

1175
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:32,496
Kids are learning about the world
based on what's best for corporations

1176
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:33,999
and they can't be objective.

1177
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:39,669
Now boarding:
Flight 755 to Aruba.

1178
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:43,504
Look at all the space!

1179
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,601
I've never had so much legroom!

1180
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:49,076
- Lookie here!
- There's a TV in every seat!

1181
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,681
I'm hungry,
I want something to eat!

1182
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:56,551
- Here's some free yummy snacks!
- Yummy! Yum, yum, yum, yum!

1183
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:57,955
What a nice lady.

1184
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:00,257
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

1185
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:08,034
Prince Dastan, have you wondered...

1186
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:11,702
It's almost impossible for a film
to become a blockbuster

1187
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:13,102
without reaching kids.

1188
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:15,071
Specifically high-school kids.

1189
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:18,872
And in 1989 one of the last barriers
to that audience was broken.

1190
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:23,075
For the past 20 years, Channel One
has been piping their news broadcasts

1191
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:25,642
into more than 8,000 schools
all across the country.

1192
00:59:26,075 --> 00:59:28,612
First up today, the topic of bullying.

1193
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:31,783
In exchange for providing free televisions
for each of the classrooms,

1194
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:35,894
Channel One shows their broadcasts
for 12 minutes a day every school day

1195
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:39,590
and reaches 6 million of one
of the nation's most coveted demographics.

1196
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:43,066
And because of that,
Channel One gets to charge a premium.

1197
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:47,602
Each 30 second TV spot
can cost upwards of $200,000.

1198
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,969
As much as a primetime TV show.

1199
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,839
Why do you think
there are commercials in there?

1200
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:56,246
All of the commercials are so like,
of course they would do them for teens.

1201
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:58,918
Thank you so much for
that acne commercial.

1202
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:01,786
I don't mind it,
because they're just pounding information

1203
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:03,983
into you the whole time,
the whole news broadcast

1204
01:00:04,246 --> 01:00:06,419
so that's like a break, turn,
talk to your friend for a little bit.

1205
01:00:06,582 --> 01:00:09,290
Like, we're here to learn,
not to buy, in my opinion.

1206
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:12,489
Some writer
during the late 1800s said

1207
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:15,933
that schools should teach you
how to think, not what to think.

1208
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:19,633
But I think that advertising
is really trying to tell you what to think,

1209
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:22,106
and so I don't think that should be
in a school environment.

1210
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,776
I feel like the amount of advertisement
that we already have is enough,

1211
01:00:25,968 --> 01:00:28,209
so if you added any more,
it would just be ridiculous.

1212
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:31,444
I don't want to have our school name
changed to "Red Bull High."

1213
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:33,978
Sure, who'd wanna go to Red Bull High?

1214
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,648
But The Greatest Movie Ever Sold High?
That sounds like a winner.

1215
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,653
You see, these days, every major brand

1216
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:42,025
is dying to get their name
an a building or a stadium.

1217
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:44,194
And I may not be able to afford a stadium,

1218
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:47,061
but in the cash strapped school district
of Broward County

1219
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:49,325
I may have found the next best thing.

1220
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,367
I've been in my job for 12 years,

1221
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:56,135
And I swear, eight of those 12 years,
we've sat down every year

1222
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:57,802
and said,
"Okay, what are we cutting this year?"

1223
01:00:57,867 --> 01:01:01,974
Our school board is looking
at every way to cut costs

1224
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:05,381
that doesn't affect the classroom
as they can.

1225
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:07,317
And, you know, it's very hard,

1226
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:12,189
I feel bad for what they have to
sit there and try and figure out what to cut

1227
01:01:12,348 --> 01:01:13,827
because you can't make everybody happy.

1228
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,088
We're not allowed to do
the outside of school buses...

1229
01:01:16,819 --> 01:01:19,663
We were looking at providing

1230
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:24,771
all of our work vehicles with the possibility
of putting advertising on them.

1231
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,034
What's been the reasoning for not
wanting to have it on the outsides of buses?

1232
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,370
That's a state law. We would love to have it
on the outside of buses,

1233
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:34,415
but it's the state of Florida
that has said "No."

1234
01:01:34,703 --> 01:01:36,410
It seems like with the school bus advertising,

1235
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:39,008
you'd have to advertise
on a ton of school buses-

1236
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,048
Otherwise you're hitting
the same kids every day.

1237
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,748
- It has to be a message.
- Right.

1238
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:46,122
Right, because like a community college,
it's great, go to college.

1239
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:48,695
Right. They still do
not want to do product.

1240
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:50,897
Would it be more lucrative
if it was products?

1241
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:54,958
If they could do their 69 cent whatever
in a school bus...

1242
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:56,535
Yeah, yeah.

1243
01:01:57,293 --> 01:01:59,252
But then, you're gonna
deal with the health issues,

1244
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,204
and with the parents that are upset
that you're advertising...

1245
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:04,209
- Fast food.
- ...that stuff to their kids

1246
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,439
- when they're captive on a school bus.
- Yeah.

1247
01:02:06,535 --> 01:02:08,776
Now, Tallahassee is cutting and cutting
and cutting,

1248
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:12,318
but you need to implement this program,
but we're not giving you any funding to do it.

1249
01:02:12,408 --> 01:02:14,285
- This is a law firm.
- Yeah.

1250
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:17,116
- Met-Rx.
- Orthodontics-

1251
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,150
Orthodontist.
Very applicable to high school kids.

1252
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:23,157
"Call us to place your business name here
for advertising."

1253
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:25,729
That would be my number.

1254
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:30,236
That's pretty much it.
We had some other ones up...

1255
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:33,903
The banner contract is a year.

1256
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:38,475
I love that it's a high school where I can
go get the home of the two-for-one tattoo.

1257
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:43,183
Well, I am not sure about that one.

1258
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:46,314
This is truly advertising.

1259
01:02:46,742 --> 01:02:49,655
Someone looks at this and they go
"Oh yeah, I saw these guys on the bus."

1260
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:52,351
With all the banners that are around here
and on the inside of the stadium,

1261
01:02:52,448 --> 01:02:53,950
how much revenue
does that generate a year?

1262
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:58,089
Probably under
five-seven thousand dollars.

1263
01:02:58,254 --> 01:03:01,497
I think I'm gonna have to come back
and get a banner.

1264
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:03,834
- All right, yeah, a couple!
- On the fence line?

1265
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:06,668
That's a deal,
we're gonna shake on that right now,

1266
01:03:06,762 --> 01:03:07,797
- All right.
- It's a deal.

1267
01:03:07,863 --> 01:03:09,103
Good. Who do I send the contract to?

1268
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,108
Maybe this is
as big as the wrap gets.

1269
01:03:13,169 --> 01:03:14,512
- That's still pretty big.
- Yeah.

1270
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,280
Really, so that's only 75 bucks a month?

1271
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,614
Why do you think so many people
are against advertising

1272
01:03:20,776 --> 01:03:24,223
in school districts and in high schools
and juniors highs, elementary schools?

1273
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:27,552
Well, because school is sacred.
And school is meant for learning..

1274
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,291
But when you're in a school
and your budgets are being cut--

1275
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,697
Right. How are you
going to make ends meet

1276
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:36,027
without letting people go
or cutting programs.

1277
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,627
- You gotta be creative.
- Yeah.

1278
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:40,299
- Right there.
- Yeah, right there.

1279
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:41,966
As low as $75 a month.

1280
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:45,374
- I think it's a really great way to advertise.
- I love it.

1281
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:46,878
- Yeah.
- Great. Done!

1282
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:50,913
Look at that, you're two for two.
We're doing great... We're doing great.

1283
01:03:51,006 --> 01:03:52,007
We're on a roll now.

1284
01:03:52,074 --> 01:03:53,712
Now if I can just convince them
to name our building.

1285
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,982
Oh, the building would be
the best thing ever.

1286
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,415
- We're gonna work on that next.
- We're really gonna work on that.

1287
01:03:58,514 --> 01:03:59,515
Yeah.

1288
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:07,330
So I'm David Laks
and I work with Morgan's team

1289
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:11,201
and my role here
is to help facilitate interaction

1290
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,432
between the sponsors

1291
01:04:12,928 --> 01:04:17,240
and all the people involved in helping
to promote The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

1292
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:20,839
This is what we're doing.

1293
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,573
This whole thing's a bit layered,

1294
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:25,174
because we're selling
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold

1295
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:29,344
but The Greatest Movie Ever Sold
will be selling all your products.

1296
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:33,515
What's good for you is good
for the movie, good for Morgan, good for us...

1297
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:35,550
It's all great...

1298
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,226
Okay, so we set
ourselves some objectives.

1299
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:41,857
They shouldn't be too contentious.
They begin fairly robustly, I think.

1300
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:44,699
Build buzz, for the
purpose of selling tickets...

1301
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:47,031
The audience is no longer an audience.

1302
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:50,702
It's a partner in whatever communication
you choose to create.

1303
01:04:50,965 --> 01:04:53,411
The first two weeks
in a movie are crucial.

1304
01:04:53,868 --> 01:04:55,074
There's a lot of reasons for this.

1305
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:58,049
There's just more movies,
there's more content...

1306
01:04:58,106 --> 01:04:59,881
There's more things in the world now,

1307
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:02,751
so the cultural decay rate of ideas
is much, much faster.

1308
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:04,887
So one of the lines we discussed

1309
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,555
the very first time we met with Morgan
and the team was "Don't sell out, sell up!"

1310
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:12,625
I kind of like that. Sounds good,
not sure what it meant, but I liked it.

1311
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,166
We wanted to extend that kind
of meta-narrative

1312
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:17,566
down to the audience themselves
and make them involved

1313
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:19,261
in the construction of the marketing.

1314
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,566
There's a hope that when you sit down
in a theater to watch the movie,

1315
01:05:23,064 --> 01:05:27,410
you will see and understand
the flip-side of everything we did

1316
01:05:27,502 --> 01:05:30,608
to get you there because you would have
been involved with it in some capacity.

1317
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:34,947
Hopefully making the whole experience
kind of, pleasingly circular.

1318
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:37,779
Well, we wanted to either name a building

1319
01:05:37,845 --> 01:05:42,157
or we saw the mural she wanted to paint
on the back court of her school

1320
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,854
which, to paint a mural there
would be fantastic.

1321
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:45,987
The banners that she has
are amazing.

1322
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:49,291
I told him my school is for sale.

1323
01:05:50,758 --> 01:05:52,101
and say, "Well, boy, each of our sponsors
reaches 15 million people,"

1324
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,134
We love the idea of the Board of Ed,
wrapping something here.

1325
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,702
It's just, we're open to anything.

1326
01:06:00,802 --> 01:06:04,944
We have 12 sponsors,
and if we average out all the sponsors

1327
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:08,453
and say, "Well, boy, each of our sponsors
reaches 15 million people,"

1328
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,117
that is a lot of people to reach
with one viral promotion.

1329
01:06:14,115 --> 01:06:15,719
Since we do have
a television station,

1330
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:20,061
since I'm gonna have to pitch
our education television station

1331
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:24,159
which represents a wonderful opportunity
for the film to co-brand,

1332
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:26,296
we could maybe do
a student film festival...

1333
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:28,699
- A student film festival!
- A student film...

1334
01:06:28,796 --> 01:06:31,037
I thought about that idea
on the way to the meeting

1335
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:37,708
so that could be a way to integrate and
to co-brand the film with our school system.

1336
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:42,413
So, we're putting a sticker
on our bestselling pizzas

1337
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:46,386
and that's gonna be a drive-to-web,
that'll be our micro-site

1338
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:51,521
and we'll link up to the movietickets.com site
and whatever else works out.

1339
01:06:51,652 --> 01:06:56,032
And we're gonna have a portion
of the proceeds of the sales of the pizzas

1340
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:00,163
gonna go to feeding
people at a food bank.

1341
01:07:00,495 --> 01:07:03,999
It's really up to you. If you wanna
do exposure on a building

1342
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:07,444
- which then locks you into that...
- I think a building is one thing.

1343
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:09,845
- Okay.
- To do a building would be great.

1344
01:07:10,104 --> 01:07:13,574
To do, you know, a mural and some banners
would be fantastic.

1345
01:07:13,674 --> 01:07:15,119
To do the film festival
would be amazing.

1346
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:17,720
Morgan did film
a video for us.

1347
01:07:17,945 --> 01:07:21,085
For everyone who has flown JetBlue,
you know that we have individual TVs

1348
01:07:21,182 --> 01:07:24,686
in each seat-back,
so we will run the welcome video...

1349
01:07:24,752 --> 01:07:28,290
I believe it's four to six weeks
leading up to the premiere.

1350
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:30,767
How did you get financing
for the production?

1351
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:34,067
It's being paid for by the companies,
it's being paid for by sponsors.

1352
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:36,640
- Oh! Excellent!
- Yeah. Yeah.

1353
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:38,933
Can you turn us over
your sponsor list?

1354
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:43,138
Maybe after the movie opens
we can talk about that.

1355
01:07:43,237 --> 01:07:44,168
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1356
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:46,151
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1357
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:51,280
What I've started to realize
over the course of making this film

1358
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:57,728
is that once you open the door
to being what one person said,

1359
01:07:57,985 --> 01:08:00,625
one person called me, which is being
quote unquote "brand friendly,"

1360
01:08:00,922 --> 01:08:02,595
then that door is open.

1361
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:07,297
The floodgates are open and suddenly,
all of these opportunities,

1362
01:08:07,395 --> 01:08:09,932
different opportunities,
whether it's for promoting the film

1363
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:13,570
like we're trying to do right now
or it's being tied to somebody else's product,

1364
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:17,776
all these different opportunities
that represent real difficult

1365
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:21,580
moral and artistic dilemmas
start popping up.

1366
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:23,653
Here's a case in point.

1367
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:27,157
Morgan, it's Ben Silverman
giving you a call.

1368
01:08:27,248 --> 01:08:31,162
I've set up a new business
with Witt Arnett and Jason Bateman

1369
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:33,596
that is focused on
advertising production.

1370
01:08:34,088 --> 01:08:36,932
And we've got a really great idea
were working on

1371
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:39,095
in and around the
world of male grooming.

1372
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,833
We want it to be funny and capture the tone
that you do so well

1373
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:47,504
and we thought of a fantastic brand partner
to work on it with us.

1374
01:08:47,602 --> 01:08:51,948
Give me a call back and we'll set something
up to introduce you to Will and Jason.

1375
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:53,481
Thanks, buddy. Bye.

1376
01:08:53,774 --> 01:08:54,946
How do you say no to that?

1377
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:56,680
What's a sell-out?

1378
01:08:56,777 --> 01:09:00,156
A sell-out is someone that has no honor
and does something just for money

1379
01:09:00,314 --> 01:09:02,988
and doesn't take anything else
into consideration.

1380
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:09,526
A sell-out is when, to attain a certain level
you give up some of those principles

1381
01:09:09,657 --> 01:09:11,898
that formed your identity
to begin with.

1382
01:09:12,026 --> 01:09:15,303
So I'm making this film that's actually
being paid for by advertisers,

1383
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:17,739
- by companies, about advertising.
- Right.

1384
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:21,139
- Yeah. So am I selling out by doing that?
- I don't think so.

1385
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:28,047
I mean, unless the point you're making
is that advertising is a bad thing.

1386
01:09:28,142 --> 01:09:30,315
Are you doing it with integrity?

1387
01:09:31,846 --> 01:09:36,591
- I hope so.
- And with a viewpoint of being objective?

1388
01:09:37,084 --> 01:09:41,032
Or are you doing it slanted,
for the side of the advertiser

1389
01:09:41,155 --> 01:09:43,658
as a puppet, doing whatever the
advertisement wants you to do?

1390
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:46,862
As long as you do
better than they do on it

1391
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:49,007
then you're not...
Then you're buying in.

1392
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:50,498
Is that right?

1393
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:52,741
Am I really not selling out?

1394
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:55,837
Or am I finally just buying in?

1395
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:29,241
Every sip gets you closer
to Justin Timberlake mp3s.

1396
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,316
- Hey.
- Hey to you.

1397
01:10:31,405 --> 01:10:34,386
Seems like pushing a product
is the new standard for gauging success.

1398
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:38,920
Today's superstar singers pitch for perfume,
action stars vouch for vodka.

1399
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,418
Even America's Sweetheart
is the new face for a make-up company.

1400
01:10:42,783 --> 01:10:45,457
For a filmmaker like me,
this is pretty uncharted territory.

1401
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:48,124
And to navigate these waters,
who better to turn to

1402
01:10:48,222 --> 01:10:51,135
than one of the most successful celebrity
spokesmen himself.

1403
01:10:51,425 --> 01:10:52,563
The Donald.

1404
01:10:53,227 --> 01:10:57,403
Is there a difference between selling out
and being a celebrity spokesperson?

1405
01:10:58,332 --> 01:11:01,142
Well, the question's been asked
because I do a lot of different things,

1406
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:04,580
I'll do commercials for different companies,
good companies.

1407
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:06,778
I did Oreo's cookies
with the Manning brothers

1408
01:11:06,841 --> 01:11:08,115
Peyton Manning and Eli Manning,

1409
01:11:08,476 --> 01:11:12,117
- Trump!
- And we're gonna be huge!

1410
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:16,286
I feel if the commercial is done properly,
if you watch what you're doing,

1411
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:19,294
it actually enhances your brand.
It doesn't hurt your brand.

1412
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:23,433
There are some people, that,
as an example there are certain singers,

1413
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:27,097
entertainers that would never, ever
do a commercial.

1414
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:30,768
I could name names, but I don't want to
because I've tried to get certain songs

1415
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:34,203
and I could offer them $10 million
to play a song once

1416
01:11:34,301 --> 01:11:35,302
and they would turn it down.

1417
01:11:35,436 --> 01:11:38,315
I mean, I think they're crazy,
but they'd turn it down.

1418
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:42,318
But there are people like that,
that would never partake in a commercial.

1419
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:44,447
I don't think they're helped or hurl,

1420
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:46,458
but I think they should take
the money and run.

1421
01:11:46,514 --> 01:11:47,857
- You take care of yourself.
- I really appreciate it.

1422
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:48,949
Thanks.

1423
01:11:49,617 --> 01:11:51,858
But some musicians have done just that.

1424
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,958
You see, brands have always known
that one of the fastest ways

1425
01:11:57,058 --> 01:12:00,631
to make their products seem cool
was to pair them with the hottest artists.

1426
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:32,334
And today more and more musicians
are finding out just how important it can be

1427
01:12:32,393 --> 01:12:34,896
to get their music
supported by brands.

1428
01:12:35,262 --> 01:12:39,870
What you have now is artists partner up
with different brands

1429
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:45,907
to kind of, get that extra push,
and you do anything from liquor sponsors

1430
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:49,215
to cell phone companies to car companies
all the way around,

1431
01:12:49,276 --> 01:12:52,052
to, kind of, round out the promotion
of your project.

1432
01:12:52,346 --> 01:12:56,385
The artists are competing
for impressions.

1433
01:12:56,617 --> 01:12:59,791
If they can do commercials,
if they can endorse a product,

1434
01:12:59,887 --> 01:13:03,460
anything that they can do
to get more impressions, the better.

1435
01:13:03,557 --> 01:13:07,027
After the Bacardi ad came out,
I don't know how quickly it happened,

1436
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:12,472
you could physically see one step away
from having a line chart of like,

1437
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:16,604
"This is how many more people
are starting to listen to your music."

1438
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:19,583
Licensing to the commercials and stuff

1439
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,587
now I know, just is a good way
for a lot of people to hear you.

1440
01:13:22,643 --> 01:13:25,749
And I just want everyone
to hear our music, that's all I want.

1441
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,288
What would you never put
your music in?

1442
01:13:27,414 --> 01:13:30,054
If somebody said, "We've got a commercial,
we're selling blank."

1443
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:34,298
Our sniff test for whether or not
it's all right to put a song in a commercial

1444
01:13:34,388 --> 01:13:36,265
is whether or not that commercial

1445
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:39,497
is likely to make you
feel worse about yourself.

1446
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,065
Is it honoring the music?

1447
01:13:42,163 --> 01:13:45,076
And I gotta say,
we have not always done this,

1448
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:47,009
there were times,
especially early in our career

1449
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:48,136
where we just needed the cash

1450
01:13:48,269 --> 01:13:51,113
and our songs were in some
pretty gross commercials.

1451
01:13:51,172 --> 01:13:53,914
They had the "Got milk?" ads,
and we never did a "Got milk" ad

1452
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:56,580
because Dre doesn't drink milk,
you know what I'm saying?

1453
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,351
It was as simple as that,
It was a big check and everything

1454
01:13:58,445 --> 01:14:00,584
you know, but Dre didn't drink milk,
so we never did it.

1455
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:05,290
I was going through all kinds of ideas
with the manager and were like,

1456
01:14:05,352 --> 01:14:07,491
"Weill, maybe it can be soy milk."

1457
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:10,330
You know, I mean, they were like
"No, it's gotta be milk." So we didn't do it

1458
01:14:10,424 --> 01:14:13,928
because that maintains our artistic integrity
of what we stand for.

1459
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:16,665
Are you trying to establish OK Go
as a brand?

1460
01:14:17,097 --> 01:14:20,306
Every band ever has had an identity.

1461
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:24,347
Every person has an identity
and, it's cool to have your own identity,

1462
01:14:24,471 --> 01:14:26,451
but when you call it a brand,
it's suddenly cheesy.

1463
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:29,315
Would you guys be
willing to do a song,

1464
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:32,117
create an original identity anthem
for the movie?

1465
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:34,384
- I'd love to. That sounds amazing,
- Yeah, awesome.

1466
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:36,017
Does that... Wait, hold on.

1467
01:14:36,116 --> 01:14:41,065
If we make the theme for
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold

1468
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:45,631
does that mean that we're the greatest
rock band ever to write a theme song?

1469
01:14:46,227 --> 01:14:47,228
Absolutely.

1470
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:51,199
I started this PR firm back in 1983

1471
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:57,706
and something occurred to me:
that we were living in wacky times.

1472
01:14:58,038 --> 01:15:00,848
- Right.
- And here is what was wacky about them.

1473
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:05,553
In the world we live,
there's this umbilical cord

1474
01:15:05,645 --> 01:15:09,889
between fame and credibility.

1475
01:15:10,216 --> 01:15:13,390
So, visibility equals credibility.

1476
01:15:13,586 --> 01:15:17,932
In the world we live in, you cannot
be credible unless you're visible.

1477
01:15:18,157 --> 01:15:19,932
And so you see what we're doing here.

1478
01:15:20,026 --> 01:15:21,164
Yeah, I do.

1479
01:15:21,227 --> 01:15:22,228
What do we do?

1480
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:26,738
- Well...
- What do I do to get the message out?

1481
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,210
Sell, sell, sell!

1482
01:15:28,334 --> 01:15:30,712
- That's it?
- What the hell do you think you do, son?

1483
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:33,611
Sell! You're in America!

1484
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:38,217
The path to salvation is not
through being quiet.

1485
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:39,618
- Okay.
- And being subtle.

1486
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:41,851
Not in today's world.
You gotta sell!

1487
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:50,397
This is where you really start
to see cause and effect.

1488
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:56,132
It's pretty amazing to
see behind the curtain

1489
01:15:56,462 --> 01:15:58,066
like we've gotten to on this film.

1490
01:15:58,798 --> 01:16:04,373
Now, what happens from this point on,
that's the real question.

1491
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:08,048
Now the movie's gonna
go out in the world.

1492
01:16:09,609 --> 01:16:11,111
And now's the point

1493
01:16:15,114 --> 01:16:19,494
where I start to wonder exactly
how affected I'll be by everything.

1494
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:22,599
This is it. This is the Stark.

1495
01:16:24,123 --> 01:16:25,431
This is the beginning
of the whole thing.

1496
01:16:26,559 --> 01:16:29,165
As much as the beginning of the process
was the beginning of this,

1497
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,905
with what our movie is about,
like, this is the beginning,

1498
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:34,273
This is literally
where it really starts.

1499
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:38,415
You know our next guest from his
prize-winning documentary, Super Size Me.

1500
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:41,281
His latest is called
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.

1501
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:44,581
It is brought to you by
Hyatt, POM Wonderful, JetBlue,

1502
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:47,591
Mini Cooper, Mane 'n Tail Shampoo,
the island of Aruba

1503
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:50,685
and Amy's Frozen Pizza.
It opens in theaters Friday.

1504
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:53,093
Please say hello to Morgan Spurlockl

1505
01:18:56,442 --> 01:18:59,286
What's happening right now
is in the movie?

1506
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:00,755
Is actually in the film
right now.

1507
01:19:00,947 --> 01:19:03,427
So we've actually in a way,
gone back in time.

1508
01:19:03,483 --> 01:19:05,724
We have. The space-time continuum
has shifted completely.

1509
01:19:05,785 --> 01:19:07,924
This is like the
Inception of documentaries.

1510
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:16,729
Man, these Old Navy
clothes look so good!

1511
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,436
So here's the trailers
you've done.

1512
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:21,737
We did Avatar, Alice in Wonderland,
Toy Story 3.

1513
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:25,010
And this is you, right here,
that we're doing today.

1514
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:26,105
And now The Greatest Movie.

1515
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:28,514
So you have a key to their brain.

1516
01:19:44,657 --> 01:19:46,694
Here we go, three, two...

1517
01:19:47,493 --> 01:19:49,666
And I'd like to welcome you
aboard JetBlue Airways,

1518
01:19:49,762 --> 01:19:51,673
the greatest airline
you'll ever fly.

1519
01:19:52,165 --> 01:19:55,112
Now that we're in the air I'd like to
tell you a little more about your flight.

1520
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:58,779
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold!

1521
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:47,392
You are a shameless whore
if ever I've met one, Morgan Spurlock.

1522
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:49,523
- Yes, I am.
- Morgan Spurlock, everyone.

1523
01:20:49,589 --> 01:20:52,365
The Greatest Movie Ever Sold
opens Friday! We'll be right back.

1524
01:20:52,425 --> 01:20:54,200
Yep, everywhere you look these days

1525
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,002
it seems like someone's
trying to sell you something.

1526
01:20:57,496 --> 01:20:59,601
Best I can do
is just show you that it's out there.

1527
01:20:59,865 --> 01:21:02,778
Because at the end of the day
marketing works.

1528
01:21:06,906 --> 01:21:09,011
But maybe we all don't have to buy in.

1529
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:12,247
Maybe there's still a place
free from all the advertising

1530
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,848
where we can actually think
for ourselves.

1531
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:20,187
So go outside!
Take a nice long walk, find that place.

1532
01:21:20,686 --> 01:21:24,600
And when you do it,
do it in a nice comfortable pair of Merrells.

1533
01:21:28,394 --> 01:21:30,305
Let's throw some rocks.

1534
01:21:58,557 --> 01:22:01,731
Oh, boy. Look at this.

1535
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:07,674
Oh, man! Payola!

1536
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,843
Not only that,

1537
01:22:14,607 --> 01:22:16,086
but I'll never be able to forget it.

1538
01:22:17,443 --> 01:22:21,585
After a million steps,
"Morgan gave me this."

1539
01:22:23,582 --> 01:22:26,927
Morgan Spurlock on the march!

1540
01:22:27,953 --> 01:22:30,797
Thank you very much, Morgan.
Really, it's very thoughtful of you.

1541
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,263
It's hard to get shoes that fit.

1542
01:24:38,484 --> 01:24:40,828
- Yeah. Ron.
- Hey, man, how are you?

1543
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,263
- I'm good. What's up?
- I'm good.

1544
01:24:42,321 --> 01:24:45,894
I just wanted to call you back, touch base
with you and hear what you were thinking.

1545
01:24:45,991 --> 01:24:49,234
Okay I think it's a little weird
I'm still talking about it with Tarssa,

1546
01:24:49,328 --> 01:24:51,467
and she's not quite ready to respond yet.
I don't think...

1547
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:52,975
- Okay
- Cool man.

1548
01:24:53,065 --> 01:24:56,012
'Cause the last couple of paintings I sold
sold for a $120,

1549
01:24:56,101 --> 01:24:58,138
- So, I don't know--
- I know you're big time.

1550
01:24:58,237 --> 01:24:59,614
I know that.

1551
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,309
Can I put you
on the phone with her?

1552
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:03,250
'Cause I wanna make a decision
and it's getting harder.

1553
01:25:03,309 --> 01:25:04,515
Do you have like 10 more seconds?

1554
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,521
- Sure.
- Hold on.

1555
01:25:06,612 --> 01:25:08,683
- Hey, Morgan,
- Hey, Tarssa, how are you?

1556
01:25:08,848 --> 01:25:09,986
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

1557
01:25:10,082 --> 01:25:13,586
So, I just wanted to talk to you guys
about the placement in the film...

1558
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,164
I was telling Ron,
we could have a card with his photograph

1559
01:25:17,256 --> 01:25:18,701
of him painting the painting.

1560
01:25:19,024 --> 01:25:22,130
So he could, so Ron English could be
"The Greatest Artist to Ever Paint"

1561
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:30,047
Yeah, I mean, the greatest artist
that ever lived or the greatest artist...

1562
01:25:30,436 --> 01:25:32,473
Yeah, he wants to be
the greatest living artist.

1563
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:34,017
The greatest living artist.

1564
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:36,211
Okay done, so we'll say,
"Ron English, The Greatest Living Artist"

1565
01:25:36,308 --> 01:25:40,017
and he'll be the only person in the credits,
that'll actually have a photograph of him.

1566
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:41,547
Cool.
