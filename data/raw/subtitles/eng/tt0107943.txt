1
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,240
<i>Dear Mr. Stevens:</i>

2
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,560
<i>You will be surprised to hear
from me after all this time.</i>

3
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>You've been in my thoughts since
I heard Lord Darlington had died.</i>

4
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,440
<i>We read that his heirs
put Darlington Hall up for sale...</i>

5
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,960
<i>... as they no longer wished
to maintain it.</i>

6
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,840
<i>As no one would buy
such a large house...</i>

7
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>... the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.</i>

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
<i>We also saw some rubbish in the
Daily Mail "which made my blood boil:"</i>

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,360
<i>"Traitor's nest to be pulled down."</i>

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
One hundred and eighty guineas?

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,440
One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

13
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,200
Lot 414...

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,600
<i>...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
A Portly Gentleman.</i>

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,400
I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

16
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,160
2000 guineas, thank you.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,360
2200.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,840
2400.

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
2600.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,000
2800.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,760
3000.3200.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
3400.3600.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
3800.

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,920
5000.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,360
And a half.

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,920
6000.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
And a half.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,640
7000.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,840
And a half.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,560
8000.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
And a half.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
9000.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
And a half.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,520
10,000 guineas is bid.

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,400
And a half.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
11,000.

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
And a half.

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,920
Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,040
All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>I was very relieved to read
how an American millionaire...</i>

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,960
<i>... named Lewis saved
Darlington Hall...</i>

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,040
<i>... so you wouldn't be turned out
of your home after all.</i>

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
<i>Is it the same Congressman Lewis...</i>

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,880
<i>... who attended His Lordship's
conference in 1936?</i>

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,840
<i>Mr. Stevens, I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>... when I was the housekeeper.</i>

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,720
<i>It was hard work...</i>

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>... and I have known butlers easier
to please than our Mr. Stevens...</i>

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>... but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life.</i>

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,240
<i>You must have a completely
different staff now.</i>

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,640
<i>Not many of the old faces
around anymore.</i>

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,440
<i>There's not much need
for the small army of footmen...</i>

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>... that Lord Darlington employed.</i>

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>My own news is not very cheerful.</i>

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,640
<i>In the 7 years since I last wrote,
I have again left my husband...</i>

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,200
<i>... and, sad to say,
my marriage seems to be over.</i>

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,680
<i>I'm staying at a friend's
boarding house in Clevedon.</i>

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,920
<i>I don't know what my future is.</i>

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,720
<i>Since Catherine, my daughter, got
married, my life has been empty.</i>

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,160
<i>The years stretch before me and
if only I knew how to fill them.</i>

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,320
<i>But I would like to be useful again.</i>

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,640
- Burned again?
- Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,440
The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,360
...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

66
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,040
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

67
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

68
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,640
A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

69
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,240
A faulty one, unfortunately.

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
Sir, quite recently...

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,040
...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

72
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
...around the country.

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,040
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,040
When did you last see the world?

76
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,920
The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,600
You may say so.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,960
Take off when I'm in London next week.

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
I tell you what, you take the car.

80
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,840
- Take the Daimler.
- Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,440
You and that Daimler belong together.

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
You were made for each other.

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,240
That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,040
I'd meant to travel the West, where I
understand we have splendid scenery.

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,600
And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,560
A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,360
...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
What's this, your girlfriend?

89
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Or a former attachment?

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh, no, sir.

91
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,760
No, but a very able housekeeper.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
A most able housekeeper.

93
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I was just kidding, Stevens.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Sorry.

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,160
You know what I like best
about your papers?

96
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
These obituaries.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,960
Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,440
- It's not an art we have in the States.
- Indeed, sir.

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you, Stevens.

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,280
Mr. Lewis.

101
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
<i>Dear Mrs. Benn...</i>

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,320
<i>... I propose to reach Clevedon
on October 3rd around 4 p.m.</i>

103
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
<i>I'd be grateful for a line from you...</i>

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,840
<i>... to reach me at the post office
at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...</i>

105
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,480
<i>... where I'm planning to stop.</i>

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,040
<i>Mrs. Benn, I always said you
possess an amazing memory.</i>

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,160
<i>Our new employer is indeed
Congressman Lewis...</i>

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,800
<i>... though he's now retired
from political life in the U.S.</i>

109
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,440
<i>He's taken up residence at Darlington
Hall, soon to be joined by his family.</i>

110
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,440
<i>But I regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size.</i>

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>Mrs. Benn, will you permit me
once again to sing your praises?</i>

112
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,400
<i>Let me state that when you left
to get married...</i>

113
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,040
<i>... no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department.</i>

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,360
<i>I well remember your arrival
at Darlington Hall.</i>

115
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
<i>You came somewhat unexpectedly,
one might even say impulsively...</i>

116
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,760
<i>... while we were dead in the middle
of the Charlgrove meet.</i>

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
<i>That day is marked in my
memory in another way as well.</i>

118
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
<i>It was the last time His Lordship...</i>

119
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,400
<i>... was happy to welcome
his neighbours, as in the old days.</i>

120
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,360
<i>Of course, it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt.</i>

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
<i>It was never a sport His Lordship
enjoyed or approved of.</i>

122
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,320
- Good morning, Ayres.
- My lord, nice to see you.

123
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,760
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,800
<i>I fear I may have been a little
unwelcoming, even a little short.</i>

125
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,840
<i>You presented the best references
I've ever seen.</i>

126
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,240
<i>Which proved to be well-deserved.</i>

127
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,360
<i>Though, I confess, I did have my
doubts, on account of your youth.</i>

128
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,040
No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

129
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,640
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

130
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,520
Inside the house too.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,640
The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

132
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,480
If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

133
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
What I find a major irritation...

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,720
...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

135
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,600
Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

136
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,640
- No offense intended, of course.
- None taken.

137
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,840
I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,760
Yes, indeed.

139
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,800
- Might I have a word, sir?
- Of course.

140
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,400
My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

141
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,140
...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

142
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,200
Bad business.
How are you managing?

143
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
I've found two
first-rate replacements.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

145
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,640
Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,400
And a man with
considerable experience.

147
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,000
- Older and happy to be under-butler.
- Name?

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Stevens, sir.

149
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,040
- Stevens?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,160
- That's your name.
- He's my father, sir.

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,040
Really?

152
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,760
Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
He's outside the door.

154
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Good. Bring him in.

155
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,160
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Father.

157
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,160
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

158
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,880
- My lord.
- Very good man here, your son.

159
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,920
He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,440
- Proud of him?
- Very, my lord.

161
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
Quite right too.

162
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
Glad to have you with us.

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,880
Thank you, my lord.

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,640
What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

165
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
Twelve, sir.

166
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,340
Right.

167
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Thank you, my lord.

168
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,680
- This pitcher seems out of place here.
- Dining room. Well spotted.

169
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
- Hello, William, how are you?
- Good day, Miss Kenton.

170
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,040
I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

171
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Beg your pardon?

172
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,720
They might cheer things up for you.

173
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,120
That's very kind of you.

174
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,000
If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

175
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,040
Thank you...

176
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,560
...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

177
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,640
...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

178
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,560
Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

179
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,120
I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,720
But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

181
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,400
I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

182
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,160
...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

183
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,640
May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

184
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,200
I should think I was
addressing your father.

185
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,640
There are no other Williams
in this house.

186
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
True.

187
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,560
May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

188
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,840
If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

189
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,520
...Mr. Stevens Sr.
to distinguish him from myself.

190
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,400
So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

191
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,240
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

192
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,040
I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

193
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,000
I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

194
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,840
If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

195
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,920
...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

196
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,840
...someone such as my father.

197
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,600
It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

198
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,760
...by one such as myself.

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,240
My father is a person from whom...

200
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,480
...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

201
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,320
I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

202
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,640
...what things might I learn from him?

203
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,840
I might point out that you're...

204
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,160
...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

205
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
is very good at his job...

206
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,560
...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

207
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,880
- Of course.
- Thank you.

208
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
If you will please excuse me.

209
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Oh, well.

210
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,520
My compliments to cook.

211
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,160
What a lovely piece of crackling.

212
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

213
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,760
I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

214
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,440
Sprouts "are" done, not "is" done.

215
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,720
Isn't that right, George?

216
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,920
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

217
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,760
Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,560
...at your age for the sake
of my education.

219
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,040
I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

220
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

221
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,080
...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

222
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,600
I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

223
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,320
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

224
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,240
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

225
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,920
The definition from our quarterly
"The Gentlemen's Gentleman":

226
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,520
A great butler must be possessed
of dignity...

227
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,280
In keeping with his position.

228
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,440
There was this English butler
in India.

229
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,120
One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

230
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,160
A tiger.

231
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,320
Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

232
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,440
"Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

233
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,240
"I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

234
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,920
Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?"

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,800
They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,640
They don't think nothing of it.
In India, they're used to anything.

237
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

238
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,640
...he says, cool as a cucumber:

239
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,200
"Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

240
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,520
And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

241
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,480
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

242
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,560
I'll repeat it."There will be
no discernible traces left...

243
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,640
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

244
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
- Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

245
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

246
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,640
For you, Mr. Stevens.

247
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,720
Thank you.

248
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,760
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

249
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

250
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Put Mr. Stevens Sr.'s plate
with cook to keep it warm.

251
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
Yes, Miss Kenton.

252
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,000
Thank you.

253
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,480
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

254
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,440
If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

255
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,640
My dustpan?

256
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
You've left it on the landing.

257
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,320
- I haven't used a dustpan.
- Really? It must be somebody else.

258
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,200
- I don't follow you.
- My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

259
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,800
Morning, sir.

260
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'Ivry
as the French delegate.

261
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,360
He'll never come!

262
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,120
I just had word of his acceptance.

263
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,160
Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

264
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,040
...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

265
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
It's not the English way.

266
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
No, it is not.

267
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,600
This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

268
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,720
...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

269
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,720
...in the friendly and relaxed...

270
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
...atmosphere of one's home.

271
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

272
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,240
And that of the Germans.

273
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

274
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,840
With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

275
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,440
...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

276
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,840
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

277
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,200
...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

278
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,760
And what about the Jews?

279
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

280
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
...with the one outside the door?

281
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
- Chinaman?
- Yes.

282
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,840
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

283
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm busy at the moment.

284
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

285
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,920
- I'll look into the matter later.
- You think it's a fantasy?

286
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,800
A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

287
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

288
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I shall wait.

289
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,440
Outside.

290
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,040
Look!

291
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,040
- Is that not the wrong Chinaman?
- I am very busy.

292
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,520
Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

293
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,800
Look at it and tell me the truth.

294
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

295
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,440
...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

296
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,400
And I would ask you...

297
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,680
...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

298
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
It is a small mistake.

299
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,760
Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

300
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,240
Let me pass.

301
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,240
Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

302
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,240
He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

303
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,840
Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

304
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,720
- You can't talk to me like this.
- I'm afraid I must.

305
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm giving you serious advice.

306
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,400
Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

307
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,440
Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

308
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,040
I thank you for your advice.

309
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,200
Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

310
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,320
I never meant to keep you
from your business.

311
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
Thank you.

312
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,640
It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

313
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,440
...your Frenchman. What's his name?
- Giscard Dupont D'Ivry.

314
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,920
We also expect the
American delegate...

315
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,200
...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

316
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,400
Who is he, this American?

317
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,120
He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

318
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,760
Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

319
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,240
Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

320
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,440
- Meatpacking?
- Trolley cars?

321
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
Or dry goods?

322
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
What are dry goods?

323
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,200
Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

324
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,200
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

325
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,780
It's old Mr. Stevens!

326
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,520
Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

327
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,640
The silver!
The silver!

328
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

329
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,440
You'll be all right.

330
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,520
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

331
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,520
- He tripped with the tray.
- I saw it from the window.

332
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,720
This has never happened before.

333
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,160
- May I telephone the doctor?
- Yes, do.

334
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,640
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

335
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,840
Your father feeling better?

336
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
He's made a full recovery.

337
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Good.

338
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,520
We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

339
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,840
- I mean, your father collapsing.
- Indeed not, my lord.

340
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,640
And it could happen anywhere.

341
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,200
At any time.

342
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,320
The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

343
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,520
- We are well prepared, my lord.
- I'm sure you are.

344
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,520
What happens within this house
could have...

345
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,400
...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

346
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
It means a great deal.

347
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,640
And it means a great deal
to me personally.

348
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,040
I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

349
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,920
We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

350
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,840
We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

351
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,840
...like gentlemen.

352
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,200
The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

353
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,960
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

354
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

355
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

356
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,040
Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

357
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,240
My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

358
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,000
Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

359
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,520
Killed himself.

360
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,000
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

361
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,440
Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

362
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,000
...a fair chance.

363
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,200
So this conference is crucial...

364
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,840
...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

365
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,800
There's no question
of your father leaving.

366
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,240
You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

367
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,240
Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

368
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,040
Good.

369
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,120
I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

370
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,840
Thank you, sir.

371
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,320
I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

372
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,400
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
- Smarten up. Look sharp.

373
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,000
Good morning.

374
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,760
Good morning.

375
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,400
I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

376
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,160
I've been up for two hours.

377
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,480
- That's not much sleep.
- It's all the sleep I need.

378
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
I've come to talk to you.

379
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

380
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,160
- I'll come straight to the point.
- Do, and be done with it.

381
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,280
Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

382
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,600
There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

383
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,440
People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

384
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,380
We must all put our best foot forward.

385
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,240
Because of Father's recent accident...

386
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,600
...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

387
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,560
I've waited at table every day...

388
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,840
...for the last 54 years.

389
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,760
It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

390
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,960
Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

391
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,960
Look, I fell...

392
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,920
...because of those paving stones.

393
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,240
They're crooked.

394
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,280
Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

395
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,440
You will read the revised list
of your duties.

396
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,480
Get those stones put right.

397
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,160
You don't want those "gentlemen of stature"
breaking their necks.

398
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,400
No, indeed, I don't.

399
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,320
What is it?

400
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,280
You have what we can call
a roving commission.

401
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,960
In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

402
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,280
...within certain limits, of course.

403
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,000
Now, here are the mops, and...
Here.

404
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,840
- Are these me mops?
- Right. Your brushes.

405
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,600
And me brushes?

406
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,600
- And me mops.
- That's right.

407
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,080
What do you want me to do with them?

408
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,080
I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

409
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
If I find any dust or dirt...

410
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
...I go over them with this mop.

411
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,880
That's right.

412
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,840
Now, I suggest you start off...

413
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
...with the brasses on the doors.

414
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,160
There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

415
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,920
And then there's this door here...

416
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Here's your polish.
And duster.

417
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,480
History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

418
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,560
Each and every one of you...

419
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,840
...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

420
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,880
<i>Imagine yourself
the head of a battalion...</i>

421
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,840
<i>... even if it is only filling
the hot-water bottles.</i>

422
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,680
<i>Each one has his own
particular duty...</i>

423
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,760
<i>... or her particular duty,
as the cap fits.</i>

424
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,680
<i>Polished brass, brilliant silver,
mahogany shining like a mirror.</i>

425
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,960
<i>That is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors...</i>

426
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,280
<i>... to let them know
they are in England...</i>

427
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,600
<i>... where order and tradition
still prevail.</i>

428
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,320
Thank you, Brian.

429
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,240
Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

430
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,680
He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

431
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,760
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

432
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,800
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

433
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,640
Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

434
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,760
Thank you, Stevens.

435
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,880
I feel very responsible for the boy.

436
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,360
He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

437
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,040
And now that he's gone, well...

438
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,040
...I feel in place of a father to him.

439
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,000
I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

440
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,000
He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

441
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,000
I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

442
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,480
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

443
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm sorry to bring this up...

444
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,880
...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

445
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,680
You are familiar with
the facts of life?

446
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,160
- My lord?
- The facts of life.

447
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,520
Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Let me put my cards on the table.

450
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,440
I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

451
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,120
...but someone has to tell him.

452
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,440
In a way, it would be easier for you.

453
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,160
Less awkward.

454
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,080
I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

455
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,760
I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

456
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,920
Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

457
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,280
I shall do my best.

458
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,880
I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

459
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,800
There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

460
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,160
God! Stevens!

461
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,760
Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

462
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,240
...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

463
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,080
If I may, I'll come to the point.

464
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,040
Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

465
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,160
Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

466
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,640
Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

467
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,080
...or the shrubs, the bees...

468
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
I've not seen any bees.

469
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,240
- It's not the best time to see them.
- What, the bees?

470
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,160
What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

471
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,240
...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

472
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,760
...in the surroundings.

473
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,080
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

474
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,280
I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

475
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,640
...because it's worrying...

476
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,760
Dupont D'Ivry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

477
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,080
- M. Dupont D'Ivry has arrived?
- Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

478
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,640
In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

479
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,320
Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

480
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,760
Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

481
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,200
...as you put it most admirably...

482
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,680
...the glories of nature.

483
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,280
But it must wait for another occasion.

484
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,440
I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

485
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,400
- Fish?
- I know all about fish.

486
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
Freshwater and salt.

487
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,440
All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

488
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,640
Excuse me. I had no idea that
"Monsieur" Dupont D'Ivry had arrived.

489
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,400
Thank you.

490
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,000
May I be of assistance, sir?

491
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,960
Oh, the butler.

492
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,960
I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

493
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,760
I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

494
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,520
Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

495
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,000
How do you do? But I speak English.

496
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,480
Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

497
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,840
Could we speak privately soon?

498
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, of course.

499
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,000
But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

500
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,880
I had already seen
the Tower of London.

501
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,080
I've discovered that things
are not moving...

502
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,960
...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

503
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,280
German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

504
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,760
It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

505
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
Not a prostrate nation...

506
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,400
...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

507
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,400
Those who've been in Germany...

508
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,560
...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

509
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,880
...to assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

510
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,480
...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

511
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,200
...and universal military service
for German youth.

512
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,640
If we, in postwar Europe...

513
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,480
I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

514
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,080
Follow me, sir.

515
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,560
Excuse me.

516
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,080
- We have to talk.
- This way, sir.

517
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,880
My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

518
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,000
Vanity.

519
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,960
We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

520
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Please come this way, gentlemen.

521
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,480
Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet... shoe?

522
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,680
- Yes, of course.
- Take it off.

523
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,760
What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service...

524
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,760
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll manage.

525
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
What?

526
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,600
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

527
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,080
- Where?
- Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

528
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,760
Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

529
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,440
Here, let me help you with that.

530
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,120
Thank you.

531
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,200
Thank you, Charles.

532
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,480
Take a basin of hot water and salts...

533
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,080
...to Mr. D'Ivry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

534
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,920
- Yes, Mr. Stevens.
- Good. Do it.

535
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,920
Father?

536
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,480
I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

537
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,520
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

538
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,520
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

539
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,480
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

540
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,240
How old is he? 70, 72?

541
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,600
- 75, sir.
- I see.

542
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,160
- Lf he deteriorates, let me know.
- I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

543
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,120
More haste, less speed.

544
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,240
There's something missing.

545
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,280
What is it?

546
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,160
- The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
- Good.

547
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,960
Well observed.

548
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,840
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

549
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,880
Good.

550
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,680
Glass first, and then...

551
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,840
Is everything in hand downstairs?

552
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,480
We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

553
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,640
You can imagine the kitchen.

554
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,120
- But is everything in hand?
- Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

555
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,240
Are you feeling any better?

556
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,440
There's something I have to tell you.

557
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,360
I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

558
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,040
Jim...

559
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,080
...I fell out of love
with your mother.

560
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,960
I loved her once.

561
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:10,200
The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

562
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,600
A good son.

563
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,880
Proud of you.

564
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,920
I hope I've been a good father.

565
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,760
I tried me best.

566
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,200
You better get down there...

567
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:44,160
...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

568
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,120
Go on.

569
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,880
Go on!

570
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,200
We'll talk in the morning.

571
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,960
On the last day of our conference...

572
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,880
...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

573
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,280
...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

574
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,760
Goodwill for Germany.

575
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And with tears in my eyes...

576
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,080
...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

577
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,560
...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

578
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,440
With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

579
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
...that Germany needs peace...

580
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,040
...and desires only peace.

581
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,760
Peace with England...

582
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,640
...and peace with France.

583
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Thank you very much.

584
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,080
I, too, have been impressed...

585
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,640
...yes, deeply impressed...

586
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,240
...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

587
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,560
Unlike our American colleague...

588
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,080
...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

589
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,200
And whether we are French
or English or Italian or German...

590
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,000
...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

591
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,080
Indeed.

592
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,080
Impressed, or I may say touched...

593
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,080
...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

594
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,520
...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

595
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,960
...to change my country's policy...

596
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,640
...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

597
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,280
...but is now,
I may venture to say...

598
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,920
...our friend.

599
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

600
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,680
...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

601
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,080
On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

602
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,880
...because some prices,
you may find...

603
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,680
...are too outrageously high to pay.

604
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,360
But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

605
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,240
For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

606
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,760
...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

607
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,560
Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

608
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,360
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

609
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,440
So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

610
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,480
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

611
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
But...

612
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
...now, excuse me, I must say this...

613
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,000
...you are, all of you, amateurs.

614
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,520
And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

615
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,440
Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

616
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,160
The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

617
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,680
Europe has become the arena of
"Realpolitik", the politics of reality.

618
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,400
If you like, real politics.

619
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,760
What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

620
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,080
You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

621
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,800
So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

622
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,080
...to the professionals.

623
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,600
Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

624
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,640
...on our last evening together.

625
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,040
But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

626
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,560
...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

627
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,360
Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

628
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,840
I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

629
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,000
...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

630
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,280
I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

631
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,360
...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

632
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,080
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

633
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,600
Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

634
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,960
Oh, I see.

635
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,080
I'm so very sorry.

636
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,880
I wish there was something
I could say.

637
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,960
Will you come up and see him?

638
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,760
Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

639
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,480
In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

640
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,960
I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

641
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,640
My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

642
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,200
No. Of course.

643
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,680
I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

644
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,480
About nature.

645
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,360
You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

646
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,040
Yes, sir. Indeed.

647
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,080
As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

648
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,080
When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

649
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,080
I harboured quite a passion for them.

650
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,480
I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

651
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,560
You all right?

652
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,160
I'm perfectly all right.

653
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,960
Not feeling unwell?

654
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,040
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

655
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,840
Wonderful!

656
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,840
What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

657
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,680
Very nice.

658
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,760
I hope there's no hard feelings.

659
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,640
Oh, my dear good chap.

660
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,880
I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

661
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,480
I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

662
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,040
My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

663
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,760
Anyway, thank you.

664
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,480
Excuse me.

665
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,680
You all right?

666
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,880
Yes, perfect, my lord.

667
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,160
You coming down
with a cold or something?

668
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,600
It's been a long day.

669
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,760
It's been a hard day for both of us.

670
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,920
Well done.

671
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,000
My condolences.

672
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,120
It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

673
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,560
Thank you for telling me.

674
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,040
There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

675
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,440
...in need of attention.

676
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,640
Urgent?

677
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,360
His feet.

678
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,200
Feet?

679
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,040
- I'll take you to him.
- Lf it's urgent.

680
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,480
It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

681
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,240
My condolences.

682
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

683
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,120
Good afternoon.

684
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,000
My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

685
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,680
- I'll just check for you, sir.
- James Stevens.

686
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,800
- I'd like two apples, please.
- There you are, Mr. Stevens.

687
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,520
- You are touring in these parts?
- I'm on my way to Clevedon.

688
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,920
- How much is that?
- That'll be threepence, please.

689
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,200
And you'd be coming from...?

690
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,240
- Oxfordshire.
- Whereabouts?

691
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,120
- Sorry?
- Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

692
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,360
Darlington.

693
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,120
That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

694
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,160
...of Nazi, got us in the war?

695
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,760
I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

696
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,640
...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

697
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,560
I didn't know the former owner.

698
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,360
Your change.

699
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,040
<i>I should be glad to meet you at the
Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.</i>

700
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,400
<i>We'll have such a lot to talk about,
and I'll have many questions.</i>

701
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,560
<i>Ex cept for you, I've lost touch with
all our friends at Darlington Hall.</i>

702
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,840
<i>But that's no wonder.</i>

703
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,840
<i>It was long ago and a lot
has happened in between.</i>

704
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,040
<i>Who could keep track of all the people
His Lordship once employed?</i>

705
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,560
My lord, you rang?

706
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,240
- Have the young German ladies arrived?
- They're outside.

707
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,320
I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

708
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:04,120
- They do speak excellent English.
- Good. Well, ask them to come in.

709
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,000
This is Elsa and this is Irma.

710
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,440
I'm asking about their journey.

711
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,920
It was long, my lord.

712
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,360
I asked if they like the weather.

713
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:37,960
We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

714
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,160
Our parents are very grateful.

715
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,320
Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

716
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,240
- Won't you?
- Indeed, my lord.

717
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,120
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

718
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,760
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

719
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,560
Will there be anything else?

720
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,320
Sir Geoffrey.

721
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,240
Good to see you.

722
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,160
How do you do?

723
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,440
Well, come in.

724
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,440
- Mr. Benn.
- Mr. Stevens.

725
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,840
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

726
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,400
- Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
- I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

727
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,240
- You haven't changed one bit.
- I'll let you get on.

728
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,480
- Perhaps we'll meet later.
- I hope so.

729
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:59,120
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

730
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,920
But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

731
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,520
...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

732
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,760
Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country...

733
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,120
You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

734
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,760
Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

735
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,400
Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

736
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,640
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

737
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,640
Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

738
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,920
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

739
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,720
I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

740
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,840
Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

741
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,640
Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

742
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,920
And everyone's kept in line.

743
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,040
No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

744
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,400
It is internally diseased.

745
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,720
I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

746
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,520
I'm afraid there may be.

747
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,840
You've made a cozy little nest here.

748
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,160
Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

749
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,440
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

750
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,200
...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

751
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,440
...until he has done all he can...

752
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,840
...to be of service to his employer.

753
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,200
This assumes that one's employer...

754
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,440
...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

755
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,200
...but in moral stature.

756
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,000
And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has "moral stature"?

757
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,520
I wish I could be sure.

758
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,840
But I'm not.

759
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,120
I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

760
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,800
I hear nothing.

761
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,440
Listen.

762
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,120
That's so touching, isn't it?

763
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:01,640
To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

764
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,960
It's fresh soda.

765
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,200
Would you be joining us?

766
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,160
Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

767
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,640
Good night.

768
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,360
- Good night, Mr. Stevens.
- Good night, Miss Kenton.

769
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,280
Good-looking woman.

770
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,120
It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

771
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,480
I handed in my own notice
six months later.

772
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,480
I'd be lost without her.

773
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,120
A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

774
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,480
...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

775
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,000
- Good morning.
- My lord.

776
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,960
<i>"We do the Jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of Christ...</i>

777
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,760
<i>... is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them.</i>

778
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,440
<i>Though He apparently sprang
from their midst...</i>

779
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,120
<i>... He embodies the negation of their
whole nature.</i>

780
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,840
<i>The Jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are.</i>

781
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,840
<i>This demonstration of the cleft that
separates us Europeans from the Jew...</i>

782
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,040
<i>... is not given in order
to let religious prejudice...</i>

783
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,800
<i>... with its dangerous bias,
settle the matter...</i>

784
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,600
<i>... but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures...</i>

785
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,360
<i>... reveals a real gulf."</i>

786
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,640
We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

787
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,040
We do.

788
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,120
Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.

789
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,080
You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

790
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,680
Let them go, my lord?

791
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,000
It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

792
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,440
You must see the whole thing
in context.

793
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,240
I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

794
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,640
May I say...

795
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,720
...they work extremely well.

796
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,720
They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

797
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,720
I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

798
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,480
There are larger issues at stake.

799
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,120
I'm sorry, but there it is.

800
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,240
They're Jews.

801
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,520
Yes, my lord.

802
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,440
I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

803
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,360
...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!

804
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,520
Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed
because they're Jewish?

805
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,240
His Lordship has decided. There's
nothing for you and I to discuss.

806
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,600
Without work, they could be
sent back to Germany.

807
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,080
It is out of our hands.

808
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,000
I tell you, if you dismiss my girls
tomorrow, it will be wrong!

809
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,040
A sin, as any sin ever was one!

810
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,320
There are many things you and I
don't understand in this world.

811
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,560
His Lordship understands fully and has
studied the larger issues at stake...

812
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,240
...concerning, say...

813
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,840
...the nature of Jewry.

814
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,360
I warn you...

815
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,160
...if those girls go...

816
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,760
...I shall leave this house.

817
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,760
Please.

818
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,640
These references,
I have to tell you...

819
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,320
...are quite reserved.

820
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,200
Why did you leave
your last employment?

821
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,800
- They didn't want me anymore.
- Why not?

822
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,920
I don't know.

823
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,960
They just didn't want me anymore.

824
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,720
They say she works well.

825
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,000
Would you please wait outside?

826
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,840
- She's unsuitable.
- Not at all. I want her.

827
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,800
- She'll be under my supervision.
- She's not suitable.

828
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,720
She'll do well. I'll see to it.

829
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:19,360
Well, then, it is entirely
your responsibility.

830
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,680
Weren't you leaving
because of the German girls?

831
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,680
I'm not leaving.

832
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,160
I've nowhere to go. I have no family.

833
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,320
I'm a coward.

834
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,040
Yes. I am a coward.

835
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,100
I'm frightened of leaving,
and that's the truth.

836
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:44,520
All I see out in the world
is loneliness, and it frightens me.

837
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:49,240
That's all my high principles
are worth.

838
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,440
I'm ashamed of myself.

839
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,800
You mean a great deal to this house.

840
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,040
You're extremely important
to this house.

841
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,080
Am I?

842
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,760
Now, look here...

843
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,880
...if you're really sure about
this young woman, call her back in.

844
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,720
Miss Hull, we would like you
to start next week.

845
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,640
You're responsible to Miss Kenton.
She'll explain the house rules.

846
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,320
Number one: no gentlemen callers,
or other such.

847
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,240
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

848
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,720
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

849
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,680
Well done.
I'll show you to your room.

850
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,360
I'd forgotten how much petrol
the Daimler uses.

851
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,000
It's an impractical motor to be
going about the country, Mister...

852
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,840
Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege
to have you here in Moscombe.

853
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,640
- It's a privilege to be here.
- Your health, sir.

854
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,960
Dr. Carlisle usually drops in
around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.

855
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,360
He's a gentleman like yourself.

856
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,880
I don't know what you call
a gentleman.

857
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,240
It's a name every man
in this country has a right to.

858
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,040
There's Harry Smith now, giving
you an earful of his philosophy.

859
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,520
We English...

860
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,320
...have the advantage and privilege
of expressing our opinions...

861
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,440
...and voting for Parliament.
That's what we fought Hitler for.

862
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,520
Have you had much to do
with politics yourself?

863
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,120
Not directly as such, no,
particularly in these days.

864
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Perhaps more so in the early 1930s
and just before the war.

865
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,520
My concern was more
international affairs.

866
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,800
Or foreign policy, so to speak.

867
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,800
Not that I ever held high office,
mind you.

868
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,080
No, any influence I exerted
was in an unofficial capacity.

869
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,040
Excuse me, sir.

870
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,160
Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?

871
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,720
He came to the house occasionally.
Again, in the early 1930s.

872
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,840
He was a bloody warmonger!

873
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,040
Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won
the war without him.

874
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,680
Not content to fight Germans,
he sent troops in against the miners.

875
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,440
- What about the war?
- Yes, all right.

876
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,440
He did well in the war,
but he should've stepped down.

877
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,720
- And Mr. Eden?
- He made a right bugger of Suez!

878
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,600
Yes, I met Mr. Eden.
Yes, occasionally.

879
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
How do you do? Richard Carlisle.

880
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,000
Rotten luck about your car,
but nice to have you.

881
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,360
- Everyone has been most kind.
- He says he knows foreign affairs.

882
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,240
Is that so, indeed?

883
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,400
In an unofficial capacity.

884
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,240
- He knows Mr. Churchill.
- And Mr. Eden.

885
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,440
Really?

886
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,960
Yes, well, it was my good fortune
to have consorted...

887
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,640
...with many men of influence
from Europe and from America.

888
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,000
Mr. Taylor...

889
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,360
...I really feel I ought to retire now
because I'm feeling rather tired.

890
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,600
No wonder, sir.
Running out of petrol...

891
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,200
...then having to hear Smith's
political opinions.

892
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,840
Just step this way, sir.

893
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,840
I'm going to Stanbury in the
morning. I'll give you a lift...

894
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,800
...and we could pick up
a can of petrol on the way.

895
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,920
- I'd hate to inconvenience you.
- Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?

896
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,360
You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle.
Watch this step.

897
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
Excuse Harry Smith.

898
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,040
He will go on about his politics.
I don't mean he's not right.

899
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,400
Democracy is why we fought Hitler, and
we lost a few lads in this village...

900
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,600
...including our son here.

901
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,960
Dunkirk.

902
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,840
I'll get you a blanket.

903
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:03,000
I've left a razor and soap
on the basin.

904
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,400
Listen to the opinions
of your man in the street.

905
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,240
They're perfectly entitled
to give an opinion...

906
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,960
...on politics or whatever questions...

907
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,160
They've got no qualifications!

908
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,720
Of course they have!

909
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,640
Mr. Spencer would like
a word with you.

910
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,000
My good man,
I have a question for you.

911
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,520
Do you suppose the debt situation
regarding America...

912
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,040
...factors significantly in the
present low levels of trade?

913
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,960
Or is this a red herring...

914
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:12,080
...and the abandonment of the gold
standard is the cause of the problem?

915
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,760
I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

916
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,200
Oh, dear.
What a pity.

917
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,960
Perhaps you'd help us
on another matter.

918
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,920
Do you think...

919
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,400
...Europe's currency problem would be
alleviated by an arms agreement...

920
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,240
...between the French
and the Bolsheviks?

921
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:38,200
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

922
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,080
Very well, that'll be all.

923
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,960
One moment, Darlington, I have another
question to put to our good man here.

924
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,120
My good fellow...

925
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,320
...do you share our opinion...

926
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,000
...that M. Daladier's recent speech
on North Africa...

927
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,600
...was simply a ruse...

928
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,640
...to scupper the nationalist fringe
of his own domestic party?

929
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,840
I'm sorry, sir. I am unable
to help in any of these matters.

930
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:09,400
You see, our good man here is
"unable to assist us in these matters."

931
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,400
Yet we still go along
with the notion...

932
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,000
...that this nation's decisions
be left to our good man here...

933
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,440
...and a few millions like him.

934
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:24,400
You may as well ask the Mothers'
Union to organize a war campaign.

935
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,840
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

936
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,600
You certainly proved your point.

937
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,120
- Q.E.D., I think.
- No, not at all!

938
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,400
Oh, yes, he has!

939
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,760
What did you make of the citizens
of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.

940
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,840
No, sir.

941
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,640
Mr. And Mrs. Taylor
were extremely kind.

942
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,240
I say, I hope you don't
think me very rude...

943
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,760
...but you aren't a manservant
of some sort, are you?

944
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,400
Yes, sir. I am, indeed.

945
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,000
In fact, I'm the butler
of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.

946
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,720
It wasn't my intention
to deceive anyone.

947
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,120
Don't explain.
I can see how it happened.

948
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,200
Darlington.

949
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,640
Wasn't there a
Lord Darlington involved...

950
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,320
...in that appeasement business
that got us into the war?

951
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,960
Sorry, I never knew
that Lord Darlington.

952
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,080
My employer's an American
gentleman, Mr. Lewis.

953
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,480
Lord Darlington was among those who
tried to make a deal with Hitler.

954
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,440
Then there was a case after the war...

955
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,680
...where he sued a newspaper
for libel.

956
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,880
"The Express", was it?
"News Chronicle"?

957
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,760
- I couldn't say, sir.
- Anyway, he lost.

958
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,200
He was lucky, really, not to have
been tried for treason.

959
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,120
There it is, just ahead.

960
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,880
Sir, I must confess...

961
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:17,080
...that I failed to tell
you the truth.

962
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,680
I did know Lord Darlington, and I can
declare that he was a truly good man.

963
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,040
A gentleman through and through...

964
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,920
...to whom I'm proud to have given
my best years of service.

965
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:35,920
That should get you
to the next petrol station.

966
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,080
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm most grateful.

967
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,800
But did you...

968
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,280
...share his opinions?

969
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,840
Who?

970
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,520
Lord Darlington.

971
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,440
I was his butler.
I was there to serve him...

972
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,080
...not to agree or disagree.

973
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,200
You trusted him.

974
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,760
Yes, I did. Completely.

975
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,160
But at the end of his life, he himself
admitted that he'd been... mistaken.

976
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,400
That he'd been too gullible,
and he'd let himself be taken in.

977
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,440
I see.

978
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,560
Thank you, sir.
You've been most kind.

979
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:27,560
Just keep going straight up here,
and turn left at the first crossroads.

980
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,640
I say, I don't want to be a bore,
but I'm intrigued.

981
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
Where do you stand on all that?

982
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,200
If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't
you rather have made your own?

983
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,480
Forgive me for being so inquisitive.

984
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,080
Not at all, sir.

985
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,240
In a very small way,
I did make my own mistake.

986
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,440
But I might have a chance
to set mine right.

987
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:52,320
In fact, I'm on my way
to try and do so now.

988
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,880
Try the ignition.

989
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,680
Thank you, sir.
I'm most grateful for your help.

990
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,000
Good luck.
It's been interesting talking to you.

991
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,040
Good morning.

992
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,880
Lord Halifax was impressed
with the silver.

993
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,320
I told him it was all your doing.
Sent his compliments. Well done.

994
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,000
I've been meaning to ask you...

995
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,640
That business last year
about the Jewish maids...

996
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,480
...I suppose there's no way
of tracing them?

997
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,680
That would be difficult. I tried
to get them a position in Surrey.

998
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,000
There was room only for one,
and they didn't want to be separated.

999
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:12,760
Well, try anyway. One would like
to do something for them.

1000
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,360
It was wrong, what occurred.

1001
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,040
I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.

1002
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1003
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,160
He asked about the Jewish girls.

1004
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,280
- Elsa and Irma?
- He wondered where they were.

1005
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,600
He said it was wrong
to dismiss them.

1006
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,440
I remember you were
as distressed as I was about it.

1007
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,600
As you were?

1008
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,600
You thought it was right and proper
that they should be sent packing.

1009
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,040
Now, really, that is most unfair.

1010
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,480
Of course I was upset.
Very much so.

1011
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,640
I don't like that happening here.

1012
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:56,880
I wish you'd told me. It would've
helped me to know you felt as I did.

1013
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,640
Why do you always have to hide
what you feel?

1014
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,240
Have you finished the lavender bags?
Good.

1015
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,080
All right.

1016
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,400
I take my hat off to you.

1017
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,920
That girl's come along very well.
You were right and I was wrong.

1018
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,880
- Look at that smile on your face.
- What smile?

1019
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,120
That tells a story in itself.

1020
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,480
Wouldn't you say so?

1021
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,800
What story's that?

1022
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,200
She's a pretty girl, don't you think?

1023
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,880
Is she?

1024
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,400
You don't like pretty girls
on the staff. I've noticed.

1025
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:56,040
Might it be that our Mr. Stevens
fears distraction?

1026
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,400
Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh
and blood and cannot trust himself?

1027
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,760
You know what I'm doing?

1028
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,200
I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere
while you chatter away.

1029
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,640
Why is that guilty smile
still on your face?

1030
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,840
Not guilty, simply amused
by the nonsense you sometimes talk.

1031
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,360
It is a guilty smile.
You can't bear to look at her.

1032
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,080
You didn't want her.
She was too pretty.

1033
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,880
You must be right.

1034
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,080
You always are.

1035
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,840
Charlie!

1036
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,680
Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be
turning down the beds?

1037
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,840
Well, you better get on with it, then.

1038
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,280
Have you told her yet?
You better get on with it, then.

1039
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,880
What can I say to her?
She'd never understand.

1040
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,360
- Why not?
- She's old. She must be at least 30.

1041
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,160
Perhaps she doesn't feel old.

1042
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,960
Who do you think those flowers
are for she's been picking?

1043
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,080
Come here. Give us a kiss.

1044
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,720
Flowers.

1045
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,280
Flowers.

1046
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,880
You're reading.

1047
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,880
It's very dim. Can you see?

1048
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,880
Yes, thank you.

1049
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,680
What are you reading?

1050
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,880
A book.

1051
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,560
Yes, but what sort of book?

1052
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,040
It's a book, Miss Kenton.
A book.

1053
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,600
What's the book?

1054
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,080
Are you shy about your book?

1055
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,040
What is it?

1056
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,880
Is it racy?

1057
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,280
Racy?

1058
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,240
Are you reading a racy book?

1059
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,160
Do you think racy books are to be
found in His Lordship's shelves?

1060
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,760
How would I know?

1061
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,240
What is it?

1062
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,360
Let me see it.
Let me see your book.

1063
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,480
Please leave me alone.

1064
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,880
Why won't you show me your book?

1065
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,560
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

1066
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,360
Is that so?

1067
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,200
I'm invading your private time,
am I?

1068
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,040
What's in that book?

1069
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,400
Come on, let me see.

1070
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,240
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

1071
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,640
Would I be shocked?

1072
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,480
Would it ruin my character?

1073
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,920
Let me see it.

1074
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,480
Oh, dear.

1075
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,360
It's not scandalous at all.

1076
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:31,000
It's just a sentimental
old love story.

1077
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,640
I read these books...

1078
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,680
...any books...

1079
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,760
...to develop my command and knowledge
of the English language.

1080
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I read to further my education,
Miss Kenton.

1081
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,000
I really must ask you, please...

1082
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:05,200
...not to disturb the few moments
I have to myself.

1083
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,200
Come in.

1084
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,800
What is it?

1085
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:44,040
I'm wanting to give you
my notice, please.

1086
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,480
Why?

1087
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,240
Charlie and me, we're getting married.

1088
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,560
Have you thought about this carefully?

1089
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,220
Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.

1090
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:04,000
You've been getting on well here and
could have a fine career before you.

1091
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,040
Charlie and me's getting married.

1092
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,080
Charlie and I.

1093
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,080
I wish I knew what to say to you.

1094
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,680
I've seen this happen so many times.

1095
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,760
A young girl rushing into marriage
only to be disappointed in the end.

1096
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,600
What about money?

1097
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,360
We don't have any.

1098
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,600
But who cares?

1099
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,560
You'll find it's not easy
to live poor.

1100
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,160
We have each other.

1101
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,920
That's all anyone can ever need.

1102
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,160
Very well.

1103
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,280
If you're so sure.

1104
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,320
Thank you.

1105
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,640
Good luck.

1106
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,040
We did all we could for them.

1107
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,080
I told him...

1108
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,680
...I had my eye on him
as a possible under-butler...

1109
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,360
...in a year or so.

1110
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,360
But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.

1111
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,160
She's sure to be let down.

1112
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,680
No use crying over spilt milk.

1113
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,280
Besides, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

1114
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,080
- Next week's meeting. Now...
- Must we discuss it tonight?

1115
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,840
Sorry?

1116
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,400
I'm tired.

1117
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,480
I've had a busy day.
Don't you realize that?

1118
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,440
I'm very tired.

1119
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,760
I'm very, very tired.

1120
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,160
Don't you understand?

1121
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,080
I owe you an apology.
I thought...

1122
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,360
...these quiet evening talks
were useful to our work.

1123
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,160
But now I see that they're
a burden to you.

1124
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,840
I was only saying I was tired tonight.

1125
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,780
No, no. You're right.

1126
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,680
Our meetings are a burden
after a long day.

1127
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,880
Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.

1128
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,400
They're useful.
It was only tonight.

1129
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,200
I thank you for the cocoa.

1130
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,680
In the future, we shall communicate
only during the day.

1131
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,760
If necessary, by written message.

1132
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,320
I wish you a very good night.

1133
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,800
I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.

1134
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,680
I'll be back in the house by 9:30.

1135
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,200
Certainly.

1136
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,880
Certainly.

1137
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,840
Good night.

1138
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,240
I'm glad to be out of it,
I can tell you.

1139
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,160
There was something about Sir Geoffrey
and his Black Shirts...

1140
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,360
...gave me the creeps.

1141
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,880
Mr. Stevens says we should
run the house...

1142
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:44,120
...and leave the rest
where it belongs.

1143
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,760
You don't agree, Mr. Benn.

1144
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,000
Nor do l, really.

1145
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,880
If I don't like something,
I want to say "stuff it"...

1146
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,680
...if you'll pardon the expression,
Miss Kenton.

1147
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:03,680
But then I suppose I'm not
a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.

1148
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,840
It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.

1149
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,680
Well, it's not mine.

1150
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,840
And to tell you the truth...

1151
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,960
...I don't want to go back in service.

1152
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,280
- What would you do instead, Mr. Benn?
- Tom's the name.

1153
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,880
Tom.

1154
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,200
What employment would you take up?

1155
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,880
I'd really like to be on my own.

1156
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:33,480
Start a little shop somewhere,
newspapers and tobacco.

1157
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,760
Or a boarding house in the
west country, where I come from.

1158
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,680
Clevedon's a good place for
a boarding house.

1159
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,840
Would I get you another shandy?

1160
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,200
Well, it's almost 9:30...

1161
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,880
Go on!

1162
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,680
It's your day off, isn't it?

1163
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,560
You're not in the army,
due back in the barracks.

1164
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,920
- All right, then.
- Good.

1165
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,840
Half a shandy, please.

1166
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,680
What about yourself, then, Sarah?

1167
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,840
That's a serious sort of a name.

1168
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,280
They called me Sally
when my mum was alive.

1169
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,680
Sally. That's nice.

1170
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,600
Is it your intention
to remain in service?

1171
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,360
It's a good profession,
when you have a position.

1172
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,240
- Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate...
- We're not talking about him.

1173
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,800
We're talking about you.

1174
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,600
Supposing...

1175
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,640
...someone asked if you'd like to come
in on a boarding house by the sea?

1176
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,760
What would you say?

1177
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,200
Well, I don't know.

1178
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,080
It's a theoretical question,
so I haven't given it any thought...

1179
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,640
...Mr. Benn.
- Tom.

1180
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,880
Supposing it wasn't theoretical...

1181
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,520
...Sally?

1182
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,200
It's been years since I've been
called that. It feels funny.

1183
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,200
Nice, though?

1184
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,160
It's very late.

1185
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,480
Will there be anything else?

1186
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,200
What?

1187
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,960
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, my lord.

1188
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,480
Mr. Cardinal, good evening.

1189
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,280
- How are you?
- Very well.

1190
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:52,480
- Delighted. And your wife?
- Very well too, sir.

1191
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,400
- How are you?
- Very well, sir.

1192
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:58,160
I've gone and got myself in a bit
of a mess with arrangements.

1193
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,160
Would His Lordship put me up?

1194
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,560
I'll tell him you're here.

1195
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,600
I hope there's nothing special tonight.

1196
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,320
His Lordship expects
some gentlemen after dinner.

1197
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:11,480
I'll keep my head down, then.
I've got to write my column anyway.

1198
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,960
- You're in time for dinner, if you like.
- I hoped I would be.

1199
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,080
How is my godfather? Fit?

1200
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,280
Very well. Some refreshment?

1201
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,880
Thank you.
Some whisky would be lovely.

1202
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:25,800
- Who's he expecting tonight?
- I am unable to help you there.

1203
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,000
What, no idea?

1204
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,080
No idea at all, sir.

1205
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:35,840
- I'll keep my head down all the same.
- I think it's a good idea, sir.

1206
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,560
Come in.

1207
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,440
Mr. Cardinal has just arrived,
out of the blue.

1208
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,480
He'll expect his usual room.

1209
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,520
- I'll see to it before I leave.
- You're going out?

1210
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,760
I am indeed.

1211
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,040
It's Thursday.

1212
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,520
Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.

1213
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,760
Is something the matter?

1214
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,080
Some visitors are arriving,
but it doesn't involve you.

1215
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,240
We agreed that Thursday
is my day off...

1216
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,760
...but if you need me urgently...

1217
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,800
No, it's perfectly all right.
Thank you.

1218
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,680
I have something to tell you.

1219
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,000
My friend...

1220
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,840
...the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.

1221
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,560
Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.

1222
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,200
He has asked me to marry him.

1223
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,720
I am thinking about it.

1224
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,720
I see.

1225
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,760
He's moving to the west country
next month.

1226
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,720
I'm still thinking about it.

1227
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,240
I thought you should be informed
of the situation.

1228
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,480
Yes, thank you.

1229
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:08,560
That's most kind of you.

1230
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,400
I trust you'll have
a most pleasant evening.

1231
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,900
Is there something special tonight?

1232
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,040
Are your visitors special?

1233
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,280
Can't tell you, my boy.
Strictly confidential.

1234
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,520
- So I can't sit in on it?
- On what?

1235
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:46,760
- Whatever it is that's taking place.
- Absolutely not.

1236
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,320
Can't have someone like you sticking
your nose in. A journalist.

1237
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,080
What do you call it, a "newshound"?

1238
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,440
No, it wouldn't do at all.

1239
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,120
Once you've had your food,
you'd better make yourself scarce.

1240
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,000
It sounds pretty special to me.

1241
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,440
Good evening, prime minister.

1242
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,760
- Sorry, we've been delayed.
- I understand.

1243
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,960
Lord Halifax.

1244
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:42,440
- Very nice to see you.
- This is Mr. Fraser.

1245
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,720
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1246
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:05,040
Please wait here, Your Excellency.
I'll inform His Lordship.

1247
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,960
We don't intend to involve
the whole British Empire in a war...

1248
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,760
...simply because of a quarrel
in a faraway country...

1249
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,680
...between people of whom
we know nothing.

1250
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,360
To my mind, the whole
of Czechoslovakia...

1251
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,080
...isn't worth a single
one of our own young men.

1252
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,840
We have a small, noisy
and corrupt war group here...

1253
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:18,400
...who don't realize that you Germans
are marching into your own back yard.

1254
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,320
The "Führer" is a man of peace
to the depth of his soul...

1255
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:26,520
...but he won't allow
a small second-rate country...

1256
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,000
...to thumb its nose
at the 1000-year German Reich.

1257
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,640
I'll get it.

1258
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,560
Come on, wake up!

1259
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,240
Stay awake!

1260
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,640
Could you confirm that this lady
is on the staff here?

1261
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,760
Yes, of course.
She's the housekeeper.

1262
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,040
Thank you, sir.

1263
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,160
- May I?
- Of course.

1264
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,760
Sorry to have alarmed you.

1265
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,520
Just security, miss.

1266
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,680
I trust you've had a pleasant evening.

1267
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,960
Well, did you have a pleasant evening?

1268
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,680
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

1269
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:30,680
Would you like to know
what took place?

1270
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,880
I have to return upstairs.

1271
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,720
There are important events
taking place tonight.

1272
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,160
When are there not?

1273
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,480
I accepted his proposal.

1274
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,880
I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal
of marriage.

1275
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,160
My congratulations.

1276
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,360
I am prepared to serve out my notice.

1277
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,960
But if you'd release me earlier,
I'd be grateful.

1278
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,040
Mr. Benn is planning to leave
for the west country in two weeks.

1279
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,320
I'll do my best.

1280
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,640
Now, please excuse me.

1281
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,800
After all the years I have been here,
you have nothing else to say?

1282
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:22,600
You have my warmest congratulations.

1283
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,840
You've been a very important figure...

1284
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,480
...for Mr. Benn and me.

1285
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,720
Oh, in what way?

1286
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,920
I tell him all sorts
of things about you.

1287
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:39,120
I tell him stories about you.
About your habits.

1288
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,040
About your mannerisms.

1289
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,360
He finds it very funny,
especially when I show him how...

1290
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,560
...you pinch your nose
when you put pepper on your food.

1291
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:51,760
That always has us in stitches.

1292
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,720
Does it, indeed?

1293
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,520
Well, please...

1294
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,560
...excuse me, Miss Kenton.

1295
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,240
Good night.

1296
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,040
Thanks.

1297
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:38,960
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

1298
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:42,160
I always look forward to a chat
when I come here.

1299
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,840
Would you care to join me in a drink?

1300
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,160
That's most kind of you,
but no, thank you.

1301
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,640
You all right?

1302
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,160
I'm perfectly all right.

1303
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,440
Not feeling unwell, are you?

1304
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:54,960
A little tired, perhaps.

1305
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,920
I bet you're tired.
What is it, about 1:00?

1306
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,560
Come on.

1307
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,280
I want you to sit down.

1308
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,360
Well, sir, I really...

1309
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,040
I didn't come here by accident.

1310
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,360
You know that.

1311
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,160
I had a tip-off, you see...

1312
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,080
...about what's going on now
in the library.

1313
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,160
I wish you'd sit down.
I'm your friend...

1314
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,040
...and you're holding that tray
as if you're about to wander off!

1315
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,680
Now, come on.
Sit down, damn it!

1316
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,800
That's better.

1317
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:40,520
Now, look, I don't suppose the prime
minister is in the library, is he?

1318
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,040
Prime minister, sir?

1319
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,480
In the library...
You don't have to confirm it...

1320
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:50,680
...are our prime minister, our foreign
secretary and the German ambassador.

1321
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,920
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- I'm afraid not.

1322
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,720
Tell me, Stevens,
don't you care at all?

1323
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,160
Aren't you in the least bit curious?

1324
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,160
It's not my place to be curious
about such matters.

1325
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,280
Not your place.

1326
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,760
And supposing I told you
that His Lordship...

1327
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,160
...is trying to persuade
the prime minister...

1328
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,880
...to enter into a pact with that
bunch of criminals in Berlin?

1329
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,920
I'm certain His Lordship is acting
from the highest and noblest motives.

1330
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:20,480
Don't you see? That's exactly
what makes it so abominable!

1331
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:24,680
Twisting these high and noble
motives to their own foul ends!

1332
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:28,320
You do, please, realize
that His Lordship's been the most...

1333
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,920
...valuable pawn that the Nazis
have in this country...

1334
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:35,240
...precisely because he is good
and honourable?

1335
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:39,120
If I weren't so drunk,
I could make you understand!

1336
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,640
Sir...

1337
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,240
...I do understand.

1338
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,360
His Lordship is working
to ensure peace in our time.

1339
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,520
Peace in our time
on their beastly terms!

1340
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,280
Remember that American here
at the conference?

1341
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:55,440
Called Lord Darlington an amateur,
out of his depth?

1342
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,840
Well, he was right.

1343
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,920
He was dead right.

1344
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,720
I hardly have to tell you
how I feel towards His Lordship.

1345
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,280
I care about him deeply,
and I know you do too.

1346
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:07,600
Yes, I do indeed.

1347
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,440
Then aren't you desperate
to see him make this mistake?

1348
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:18,080
He's being tricked! Don't you see?
Or are you as deluded as he is?

1349
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,720
Oh, dear. Now I've probably
offended you.

1350
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,240
No. Not at all, sir.

1351
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:26,120
Not at all.

1352
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,080
You must excuse me.

1353
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:37,200
There are other gentlemen
calling for me, sir.

1354
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:09,760
You mustn't take anything
I said to heart.

1355
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,160
I was very foolish a little while ago.

1356
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,040
I haven't taken anything
you said to heart.

1357
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,720
In fact, I can hardly recall
anything you did say.

1358
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,280
I was just being very foolish.

1359
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:32,680
I simply haven't time to stand here
with you, engaging in idle talk.

1360
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,760
I suggest you go to bed now.
You must be very tired.

1361
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,800
Good night.

1362
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,720
Oh, damn it!

1363
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,400
Blast!

1364
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,160
I'd been wanting to tell you...

1365
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:38,760
It's the small alcove outside
the breakfast room.

1366
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,760
It's the new girl, of course...

1367
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,880
...but I find it has not
been dusted in some time.

1368
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,520
I'll see to it.

1369
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,320
Thank you.

1370
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:57,720
I knew you would have wanted
to be informed.

1371
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,280
Hello, Sally.

1372
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,360
Hi, Tom.

1373
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,040
You all right, then?

1374
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,480
How are you?

1375
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,320
I'm good.

1376
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:54,160
Could we talk for a moment, please?
Just for a moment.

1377
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,640
We'll have to be quick
because I'm going out.

1378
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,360
It won't take long.

1379
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:03,600
All right, then.
We'll have to go into the lounge.

1380
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,840
Afternoon.

1381
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,440
Nice little place, isn't it?

1382
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:21,840
The sort of quiet little
boarding house I had in mind for us.

1383
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,560
Like other things, it didn't work out.

1384
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,240
What did you want to say?

1385
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:34,920
I saw Catherine yesterday.
She had some interesting news.

1386
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,440
She's expecting.

1387
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:39,080
Oh, my goodness!

1388
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,000
She wants us both over
for tea on Sunday.

1389
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,640
I could come and get you.

1390
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,720
We could go together on the bus.

1391
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:57,320
Yes, well, we'll see about that.

1392
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,440
House is that empty without you.

1393
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:06,160
I can't tell you.

1394
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,160
You cut yourself shaving.

1395
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,120
Oh, yeah. I know.

1396
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,920
Can't seem to do anything right
these days.

1397
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,160
<i>I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

1398
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,760
<i>... when I was housekeeper
at Darlington Hall.</i>

1399
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,120
<i>Those years with you
were the happiest of my life.</i>

1400
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,520
Would you like more tea?

1401
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,680
Yes, please. Thank you.

1402
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,840
Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.

1403
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,760
- Sorry, I was delayed.
- That's all right.

1404
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,360
Please sit down.

1405
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,320
- I've ordered some fresh tea.
- Lovely.

1406
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,440
Would you like some cake?

1407
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:53,280
- Sure?
- All right. It's a special occasion.

1408
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,840
Good.

1409
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:56,960
Waitress?

1410
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:01,360
- Could we have some cake?
- Yes, of course.

1411
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,440
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, indeed.

1412
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,800
You haven't changed at all.

1413
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:09,760
A little, perhaps.

1414
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,560
We've all changed, I think.

1415
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,120
I'd have known you anywhere.

1416
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,960
How long's it been?
Twenty years?

1417
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,120
Yes, just over, I think.

1418
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,640
The tea should be along.

1419
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,840
We read about the suit for libel.

1420
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,080
It's a shame...

1421
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,960
...calling His Lordship a traitor.
Those papers will print anything.

1422
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:58,280
They should have lost the case.

1423
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,560
When His Lordship went to court...

1424
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:05,180
...he sincerely expected
he would get justice.

1425
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,320
Instead, the newspaper increased
its circulation, and His Lordship's...

1426
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,240
...good name was destroyed forever.

1427
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,560
Afterwards, in his last years, well...

1428
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,560
...quite honestly, Mrs. Benn...

1429
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,520
...his heart was broken.

1430
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:25,320
I'd take him tea in the library,
and he'd be sitting there...

1431
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,320
...and he wouldn't even see me,
so deep was he in his own thoughts.

1432
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:35,560
And he'd be talking to himself,
as though he was arguing with someone.

1433
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,280
There was no one, of course.

1434
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:41,160
No one came to see him anymore.

1435
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:45,120
What about his godson,
young Mr. Cardinal?

1436
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,720
Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war.
Waitress.

1437
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,120
May I have my bill, please?

1438
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,800
I'm very sorry.

1439
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,960
I know you remember Darlington Hall
in its best days...

1440
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:10,280
...and that's how His Lordship
deserves to be remembered.

1441
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:13,800
But perhaps the good days are back,
now that Mr. Lewis is here...

1442
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,040
...and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.

1443
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:19,040
Very fortunate to have you
running the house.

1444
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:23,680
We still have problems, Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.

1445
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:29,640
- We still have staff problems.
- You mentioned it in your letter.

1446
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,760
Frankly, I've been thinking
of going back in service.

1447
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,680
Good...

1448
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,760
But now the situation
has changed for me.

1449
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,480
If I take up any work,
it will have to be...

1450
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:44,120
...here in the west country...

1451
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:49,840
...because Catherine, our daughter,
is expecting a baby.

1452
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:52,200
So I would like to be near her.

1453
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,280
Of course.

1454
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,360
And to be near our grandchild
as he grows up.

1455
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:03,480
- Naturally.
- Or her, if it's a little girl.

1456
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:12,280
When I left Darlington Hall,
all those years ago...

1457
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,440
...I never realized I was really,
truly leaving.

1458
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,160
I believe I thought of it
as simply another ruse...

1459
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,240
...to annoy you.

1460
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,240
It was a shock to come out here
and find myself actually married.

1461
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,480
For a long time, I was...

1462
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:32,360
...very unhappy.

1463
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:35,880
But then Catherine was born,
the years went by and one day...

1464
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:39,120
...I realized I loved my husband.

1465
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,320
You see, there is no one...

1466
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:48,000
...no one in the world who needs me
as much as he does.

1467
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:51,360
But still there are times...

1468
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:57,080
...when I think I made a terrible
mistake with my life.

1469
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,080
I'm sure we all have these thoughts...

1470
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:04,160
...from time to time.

1471
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,040
People always cheer when they turn
the lights on in the evening.

1472
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,920
I wonder why.

1473
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,840
They do say...

1474
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:50,120
...that for many people, the evening's
the best part of the day.

1475
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,880
The part they most look forward to.

1476
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:56,180
Is that so?

1477
01:59:56,280 --> 02:00:00,880
What do you most look forward to?

1478
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:06,120
Getting back to Darlington Hall,
principally...

1479
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,880
...and straightening out
our staff problems.

1480
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:12,160
You were always able to do that.

1481
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:17,000
And you had quite a few
to straighten out, as I remember.

1482
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:22,120
Always was work, work
and more work...

1483
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:26,680
...and will continue to be so,
I have no doubt.

1484
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,560
Mr. Stevens, don't you wait!
That bus is always late.

1485
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,040
Come in out of the wet.

1486
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,720
You must take good care of yourself.

1487
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,760
- You too, promise me that.
- Oh, yes, I promise.

1488
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,080
Do all you can to make these years
happy for yourself and your husband.

1489
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:05,320
We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.

1490
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:10,480
That is why I am being personal,
if you will forgive me.

1491
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,560
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

1492
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,880
Oh, here it comes.
It's on time for once.

1493
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,360
Thank you. And thank you
so very much for coming.

1494
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,360
It was so very kind of you.

1495
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,120
It was so nice to see you.

1496
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:46,760
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Goodbye.

1497
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,480
Take care.

1498
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:37,900
You scared me.
Where'd you come from?

1499
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,040
You like the suit?

1500
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,920
Very good, sir.

1501
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,600
Good.

1502
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:56,400
Watch the chandelier there.

1503
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:10,800
You're really getting things
going here. This is wonderful!

1504
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,960
I've had to ask another three girls
from the village to come up.

1505
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,560
And I can promise you that
the house will be ready...

1506
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:21,120
...and in shape by the time
Mrs. Lewis arrives.

1507
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,080
That sounds good.

1508
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,240
I'm expecting a possible
new housekeeper this afternoon.

1509
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,080
A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.

1510
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,160
Excellent references. She was matron
at a boys' school in Sussex.

1511
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,080
A matron?

1512
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,880
Sounds like she'll keep us
from misbehaving.

1513
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:43,040
- I certainly hope so, sir.
- Good.

1514
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,160
Good, Stevens. Very good.

1515
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:48,680
This is where we had that banquet
back in '35. Remember?

1516
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:52,640
We all stood up and delivered
ourselves of our principles.

1517
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,680
God knows what I said.
Sure got worked up about it, though.

1518
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:00,320
What did I say, anyway?

1519
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,040
I'm sorry, sir,
I was too busy serving...

1520
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:06,760
...to listen to the speeches.

1521
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,760
We got a visitor here.

1522
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,360
Be very careful.

1523
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:19,160
Come here.
That's a boy. Come on.

1524
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,440
Okay. Easy does it.

1525
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,320
Come on!

1526
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,960
You don't want to startle it.

1527
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,840
It'll come down.

1528
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:39,120
I think if we
leave the window open...

1529
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:44,880
Good.

1530
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,160
Very still.

1531
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,640
Go on. Out!
Come on. Out!

1532
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,640
Well done.

1533
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:57,720
Well done, sir.
