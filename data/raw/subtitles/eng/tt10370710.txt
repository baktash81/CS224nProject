00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,313
THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD

3
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:40,583
A FILM IN 12 CHAPTERS,
A PROLOGUE AND AN EPILOGUE

4
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:53,033
You've been through the epidermis,
derma and muscles.

5
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:54,608
PROLOGUE

6
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:58,408
<i>Julie disappointed herself.
This used to be easy.</i>

7
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,908
<i>She was still among the top students,</i>

8
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,575
<i>but there were too many</i>

9
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,741
<i>interruptions, updates,</i>

10
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,283
<i>feeds,</i>

11
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,658
<i>unsolvable global problems.</i>

12
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,575
<i>She sensed</i>

13
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:17,533
<i>a gnawing unease
she had tried to suppress by cramming</i>

14
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,033
<i>by drowning it in digital interference.</i>

15
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,450
<i>This was wrong.
This wasn't her.</i>

16
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,283
<i>She'd chosen medicine</i>

17
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:32,366
<i>because it was
so hard to gain admission.</i>

18
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:35,741
<i>Where her excellent grades
actually meant something.</i>

19
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:44,033
<i>But then she had
a revelation.</i>

20
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,908
<i>Her passion had always been the soul.</i>

21
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,991
<i>The mind, not the body.</i>

22
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:52,366
Surgery is like, so concrete.

23
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:55,741
It's almost like being a carpenter.

24
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,533
<i>But now...</i>

25
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:02,533
My passion has always been
what goes on inside — thoughts and feelings.

26
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,866
<i>It was like a window had opened.</i>

27
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,033
Not anatomy.

28
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:10,658
If psychology will make you happy,
then do it.

29
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:14,075
I think you're really brave.

30
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,325
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to.

31
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,033
<i>She left him.</i>

32
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:20,991
<i>Though he was devastated,</i>

33
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,283
<i>he had to respect
the way she took control of her life.</i>

34
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,658
<i>She observed her fellow students.</i>

35
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,991
<i>Norway's future spiritual advisers.</i>

36
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:58,241
<i>Mostly girls with borderline
eating disorders.</i>

37
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,616
Say you're at a party.

38
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:03,033
<i>She still felt trapped in
the role of model student.</i>

39
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,200
<i>All this cramming.</i>

40
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,991
<i>When was life supposed to start?</i>

41
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,408
What's your name?

42
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,408
Julie.

43
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:14,616
The person's name is Julie.

44
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:17,825
Let's say Julie and I
meet at a party,

45
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:22,200
and we feel a mutual attraction.

46
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,575
Hypothetically.

47
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,866
<i>Actually, she was a visual person.</i>

48
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,700
Now I know.

49
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,283
I want to be a photographer.

50
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,991
A photographer?

51
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:47,408
I see.

52
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:51,033
<i>Julie spent her student loan
on cameras and lenses.</i>

53
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,991
As long as you're serious about it.

54
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,991
<i>No safety net. No holding back.</i>

55
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,241
Need help?

56
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:59,158
<i>She took a temp job
in a bookstore.</i>

57
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,533
<i>Started a photography course.</i>

58
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:03,366
Super!

59
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,366
<i>She made new friends.</i>

60
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:07,325
<i>It felt like coming home.</i>

61
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,575
<i>Suddenly Oslo was a different city.</i>

62
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:16,158
<i>New places. New faces.</i>

63
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,241
Hi. Aksel.

64
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,200
Right...

65
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,283
You're the comic book artist?

66
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,741
<i>She'd heard
he was the creator of Bobcat.</i>

67
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,741
<i>Sorry, I'm a wild animal.</i>

68
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,491
Have you read it?

69
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,491
Yeah.

70
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:35,991
So?

71
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,783
<i>She pretended she'd read it.</i>

72
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:43,200
<i>She only remembered one strip
she'd found vaguely sexist.</i>

73
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:00,200
I know what you mean.

74
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,491
Nothing's ever good enough.

75
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:05,575
The only thing worse than
all the idiots is yourself.

76
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:06,575
But...

77
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,741
If we go on, I'll fall in love with you.
Then it'll be too late.

78
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,908
Maybe we should agree to...

79
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,783
stop seeing each other.

80
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,658
The problem is our age difference.

81
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:28,283
I'm just afraid we'll fall into
a vicious circle.

82
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:30,575
You're much younger than I am.

83
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,366
You'll start to question who you are.

84
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,450
I'm past 40.
I've entered a new phase.

85
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,950
Whereas you still need time
to find yourself.

86
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,700
You don't need me waiting.

87
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,741
You need to be completely free.

88
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,741
I'm just afraid we'll hurt each other.

89
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,366
<i>Later she said
that was the precise moment</i>

90
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,700
<i>she fell in love with him.</i>

91
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,825
Shall I put your bag in the bedroom?

92
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:27,158
Yes, please.

93
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,866
I have two copies of a book!

94
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:41,200
Huh?

95
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,325
Yeah.

96
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:44,491
I'll throw one away.

97
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,283
Can I have two shelves?

98
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,158
How many closets do you need?

99
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:54,741
How many can I have?

100
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:57,825
No, that's not how it works.

101
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,200
This is antique glass.
All wavy and stuff.

102
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,825
No, don't do that. Not like that.

103
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,825
No!

104
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:07,658
Lift this catch here.

105
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,991
I'm terrified it'll break.

106
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,783
I gaze out this window.

107
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,908
- No way!
- I'm not kidding.

108
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,990
Hey, that's how relationships work.

109
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:21,450
She's a bit frosty towards me.
That's new.

110
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:25,408
Yeah? Why do you think that is?

111
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,658
It's embarrassing to say.

112
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,950
We've been single together.

113
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,825
Lived that life.

114
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,700
Then suddenly I move in with you.

115
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,616
- And you're happy?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,033
No, no, no...

117
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,491
Did you date this guy?

118
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,283
Yeah, just a fling.

119
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:47,741
Okay.

120
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,533
Stop!

121
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:53,908
You're so predictable!

122
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,158
Let's just fuck.

123
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,658
Hello!

124
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:20,241
CHAPTER 1
THE OTHERS

125
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,116
- Happy to see you!
- Me, too.

126
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:26,741
- Doing good?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:28,825
Hi, Martin.

128
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,116
Welcome.

129
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:31,700
Thanks for coming.

130
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,491
Dad designed it.

131
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,616
We should renovate,
but don't want to change anything.

132
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,700
It's beautiful.

133
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,950
Yeah, but there's stuff like that. Damp.

134
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:58,533
We get this room
because we're childless.

135
00:09:58,742 --> 00:09:59,991
Dibs on the top bunk.

136
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:04,158
I always feel that Tone doesn't like me.

137
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,908
She's just shy.

138
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,658
That's what you say about boring people.

139
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,658
- It's my turn now.
- Okay.

140
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,991
Thank you.

141
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,283
Vin?

142
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:21,200
Vin de blanc?

143
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:22,366
Thanks.

144
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:28,533
Do you have any friends with kids yet?

145
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,158
No. Only one.

146
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,575
Guess this feels unfamiliar.

147
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,950
- They're very sweet.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,325
So what are you doing now, Julie?

149
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,950
Aksel says you've started writing?

150
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,616
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it writing.

151
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:49,991
Being modest?

152
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:51,991
No.

153
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,408
Seems so.

154
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,908
Is there anything you'd like to do,

155
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,283
as a career?

156
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,325
Questions, questions, Karianne.

157
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:05,408
That question was vulgar
when we were students.

158
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,283
Lucky you!

159
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:07,700
Yeah, we were.

160
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,158
True, we had a lot of freedom.

161
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,325
Being young today is different.

162
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,866
The pressure is heart-breaking.

163
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,283
There's no time to think.

164
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:19,241
Always something on the screen.

165
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,158
Take William.

166
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:25,408
If we don't set limits,
he spends his life on screens.

167
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,325
Nice try.

168
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:32,450
Okay.

169
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,450
No, it's not your turn.

170
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:36,741
It's Martin's turn.

171
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,658
Julie's still the closest.

172
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,533
Bedtime.

173
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,200
- She's exhausted.
- No!

174
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,033
No!

175
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,158
- Yes!
- No!

176
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,700
I don't want to go to bed!

177
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,908
I don't want to!

178
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,450
Eva, don't make another scene.
Come here!

179
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,991
No! I don't want to!

180
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:14,200
Let go!

181
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,241
- You silly girl!
- I don't want to!

182
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:19,950
But I want you to!

183
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,575
I don't want to!

184
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,366
Kids can be intense.

185
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,491
Well, it's okay.

186
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:36,366
- Fun with kids.
- Yeah.

187
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,700
Can't we just enjoy it?

188
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,408
Please. No fights.

189
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:46,408
There are kids here, and it's chaos.

190
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:47,700
Just try.

191
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:50,700
Try playing with them
or something, okay?

192
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,783
Please.

193
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:54,450
Spare me the kid talk.

194
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,783
Sorry, but I wasn't the one who started.

195
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:03,575
You're with someone who's
younger than you. There's a gap.

196
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,866
You're almost 30.
Not a bad age to have kids.

197
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:12,533
I'm 44. I want to go to the next level.
With you.

198
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:16,033
It has nothing to do with my friends.

199
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:20,991
You seem to be waiting for something.
I don't know what.

200
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,075
Hello?

201
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,325
Jeez.

202
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,616
I didn't want to get into this.

203
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,700
Really not.

204
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,241
Everything's on your terms.

205
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,700
You have time off,
so we're on holiday.

206
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,075
You agreed.

207
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,283
After you publish, you get bored.

208
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,241
And start talking about kids.

209
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:47,158
The others here have kids,
so it's an issue.

210
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,700
Not true.

211
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,491
It is true.

212
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:52,783
And then...

213
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,783
you get a new idea at some point,

214
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,658
and disappear into your drawing board.

215
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,408
What are you saying?

216
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,908
Don't start. It's not cool.

217
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,575
Shut up. Please.

218
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:06,908
Of course I'd be there if we had kids.

219
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:10,033
You know that.
You know I want children.

220
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:14,033
Sure, and I'll also want kids
at some point.

221
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:15,616
But I don't know...

222
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,325
I have no maternal instinct, right?

223
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,866
No, you'd make a great mom.

224
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,408
I'm sure of it.

225
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,366
I want to have children, too.

226
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,325
At some point.

227
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,158
So what are we waiting for?
What has to happen first?

228
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,491
I don't know what exactly.

229
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,450
I just want to do more first.

230
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,741
Okay, like what?

231
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,533
What's the obstacle?

232
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,158
I don't know! Why do you ask?

233
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,491
Your concept is flawed.

234
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:55,283
Most people have kids without
sorting out their life first.

235
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,866
- They figure it out.
- Flawed?

236
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,450
That's how most people do it.

237
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,158
But I don't want everything
to happen on your terms,

238
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,533
based on what you want.

239
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:09,408
Fine. I got it.
But what do you want?

240
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,741
Oh, please! We have to stop.

241
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,783
I need sleep
to put up with those people.

242
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:54,116
I know a guy
who has a theory about that.

243
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,741
He says we have
a limited number of sperm.

244
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:01,283
Say... three trillion in your lifetime.

245
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:02,533
Jerk off too much...

246
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,283
and you run out.
Could be true.

247
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:07,491
Easy now, Portnoy.

248
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,033
How fascinating.

249
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,325
Personally, I feel like

250
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,991
I know everything
about male problems.

251
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,491
Erectile dysfunction,

252
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,658
morning wood,
infatuation with young women...

253
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:21,825
premature ejaculation...

254
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:22,991
Nice work, Aksel.

255
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,116
It's in all the books and movies.

256
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:30,283
Where's the menstrual period?

257
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:32,866
Female orgasm and desire? Where?

258
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,977
Good question. Tell us.
In juicy detail.

259
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,366
No, the point is

260
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,991
it shouldn't be taboo.

261
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:43,908
If men had periods,
that's all we'd hear about.

262
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,575
Can you womansplain it

263
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,116
a bit better?

264
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,741
What do you mean?

265
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:55,574
Like mansplaining, but womansplaining.

266
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,158
What?

267
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,741
Mansplaining is...

268
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:03,949
When a 45-year-old man explains

269
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,449
how things really are
to a younger woman.

270
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:08,241
Nice demonstration!

271
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,699
My pleasure.

272
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,116
Ding! Great!

273
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,824
Whiskey, anyone?

274
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,950
How's the senior citizen club doing?

275
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:02,700
Come on.

276
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,408
Look who's here!

277
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:03,991
Are you okay?

278
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,408
Not really.

279
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,658
Show me.

280
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:09,908
No!

281
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,950
Let me see...

282
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:20,241
We'll laugh about it later.
It's just a scratch.

283
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,575
Karianne's such a drama queen.

284
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,325
It's my fault.

285
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,700
Not at all, Julie.

286
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,200
It is. I always overdo it.

287
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:35,116
I know being here isn't easy for you.

288
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:39,908
I'm not into this whole
"happy family" thing either.

289
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm glad it turned into a party tonight.

290
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,200
I hope you had fun!

291
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,575
What the hell's wrong with you?

292
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,950
What's wrong with having a little fun?

293
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,075
I didn't have any fun!

294
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,825
Sorry that happened.

295
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:01,991
You don't care!

296
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,366
Shut up! Just shut up!

297
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:08,491
You don't give a shit about me!

298
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,783
Shall we make a baby?

299
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,200
Fuck you.

300
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,116
- Hi.
- Good morning.

301
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,491
There's coffee. And cups.

302
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:08,033
CHAPTER 2
CHEATING

303
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,200
Sorry, I forgot.

304
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,116
What's your line of work?

305
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:15,825
I work in a bookstore.

306
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,658
Which one?

307
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,825
Norli, by the university.

308
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:25,075
Could you excuse me for a moment?

309
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:29,116
Could you sign?

310
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,408
Sure, I'll just finish this.

311
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,825
Any new Bobcat in the pipeline?

312
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,116
I've moved on.

313
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,991
Do you work full-time there,

314
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,991
or are you just temping on weekends?

315
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,158
- Sorry.
- Bye.

316
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:06,116
Hey, I think I'll head home.

317
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,575
Okay.

318
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:09,283
- You good?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:11,241
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

320
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,075
- I can stay if you like.
- It's okay.

321
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:18,116
- But I have to stay a bit longer.
- Of course.

322
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:21,241
Okay. See you at home.

323
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,241
Hi. Can I have a smoke?

324
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:46,700
Of course.

325
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:38,533
I had my second child
ten years later.

326
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:42,658
Now we're supposed
to introduce solids at 4 months.

327
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:47,450
What made the pediatricians
change their minds?

328
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:51,033
- Do you cuddle your kids?
- Sure, a lot.

329
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,866
They'll be drug addicts.

330
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:57,408
They'll be addicts
because I cuddle them?

331
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,533
Yeah, according to new research.

332
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:04,575
New research says
you shouldn't cuddle your kids?

333
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:09,200
I realize it must be counter-intuitive
for a mother.

334
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,908
But motherhood upsets
your limbic system.

335
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:14,533
So my kids are going to be drug addicts?

336
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,200
That's ridiculous.
Do you have children?

337
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:21,741
No, but I'm a doctor.
I have a medical perspective.

338
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:26,075
Babies express themselves by crying.

339
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:30,700
It's normal for a mother or a father
to comfort them.

340
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,366
Hi.

341
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,616
Not asking me the usual questions?

342
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:16,783
- Which ones?
- Who I am, what I do.

343
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:19,783
Who are you? What do you do?

344
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,366
I hate those questions.

345
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,783
They're especially bad
when you're a doctor.

346
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,200
Are you a doctor?

347
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:29,033
No, you are.

348
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,741
Which questions should I ask?

349
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:49,158
Ask me who I know here.

350
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,658
- Who do you know here?
- Nobody.

351
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,158
I crashed the party.

352
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,325
You just waltzed in?

353
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:00,950
Okay.

354
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:26,616
Nothing's gonna happen.

355
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:27,866
Of course not.

356
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,616
I'm with someone I love.

357
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:30,783
Me, too.

358
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,950
And I can't stand cheating.
I've been there. Never again.

359
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,116
- Right, cheating is...
- No good.

360
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,408
But where do you draw the line?

361
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,075
You can feel it.

362
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:54,616
If I do this...

363
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:00,866
Is that cheating?

364
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:02,033
No.

365
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,991
What about this?

366
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:16,533
- No, that's permissible.
- Is it?

367
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:26,283
And hurting someone
who's not your partner?

368
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,866
- You hurt your partner?
- Is that cheating?

369
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,366
Did that hurt?

370
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:37,908
Did it?

371
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,283
- Feel good?
- Yeah, it did.

372
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:52,533
Okay.

373
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:55,950
Let me smell your sweat.

374
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,450
- No.
- Yes.

375
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:01,616
- Seriously?
- Yes, that's allowed.

376
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,408
- It stinks!
- Yes.

377
00:31:11,992 --> 00:31:14,658
The kind of smell you never forget.

378
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:18,575
My turn to smell you.

379
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,658
No, please.
I regret it now.

380
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:23,866
Let me smell.

381
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,325
I think you smell nice.

382
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:53,991
I don't know if...

383
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:02,241
this is permissible.

384
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,450
Go ahead.

385
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:09,325
Okay.

386
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:11,575
You start,
then I'll go next.

387
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:17,033
I actually think sex is best

388
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,616
when the dick isn't too hard.

389
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,283
Because...

390
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,950
in a way, then I'm the one

391
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:30,991
who makes it hard, you know?

392
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,325
My secret will be dumb now.

393
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:39,366
I guess I misunderstood.

394
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,658
I was going to say
I like the Barcode Project.

395
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,450
It looks pretty from the bridge
when I go to work.

396
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,450
I expose my darkest secrets,
and you...

397
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,283
You said "secrets",
not "darkest".

398
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:55,700
So why is that a secret?

399
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,783
Because everyone thinks it's ugly.

400
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,825
Sorry, we're...

401
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:31,991
- Can I whisper it?
- Okay.

402
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:54,241
What?

403
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:02,950
Sorry, I seem to
be sitting on everything.

404
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:04,408
My bad.

405
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:34,033
There's nothing sexual about that.

406
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,741
Not at all.

407
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,783
Although you do like soft dicks.

408
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,200
Yeah.

409
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:45,991
Okay. Your turn.

410
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:02,741
I can't pee.

411
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,866
Just relax.

412
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:16,783
I'm going this way.

413
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:21,658
Okay.

414
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:30,241
What's your name?

415
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:32,450
Julie.

416
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,200
- I'm Eivind. Eivind...
- Don't say it.

417
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,741
Why not?

418
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,950
I'll find you on Facebook, and...

419
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,283
Good thinking.

420
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,450
Okay.

421
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

422
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,658
- We didn't cheat.
- No.

423
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,075
- Not at all.
- No.

424
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:52,200
Bye.

Aksel?

427
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,491
Aksel, I need to tell you something.

428
00:37:57,951 --> 00:37:58,908
Aksel?

429

<i>"instead of having it thrust upon me."</i>

440

This is good.

441
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,783
- Yeah?
- It's over the top.

442
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:36,283
I don't agree with everything,
but it's very well written.

443
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:38,658
Original. Very good.

444
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:40,533
What will you do with it?

445
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:42,575
I don't know.

446
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,283
You really think it's good?

447
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:49,200
Yeah. Absolutely.

448
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:51,075
You sure?

449
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:52,908
Yeah, I'm not lying.

450
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:53,741
No?

451
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:02,075
Are you sure?

452
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:04,575
Don't you dare doubt it.

453
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:08,158
It's pretty cerebral.

454
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,075
But it turns me on too.

455
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,783
- Right?
- Kinda.

456
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:15,825
Is that why you wrote it?

457
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,075
Intellectual Viagra?

458
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,533
- Yeah.
- It works.

464
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:42,944
I understand.

Say hello from me.

472
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,825
How nice to see you.

473
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,866
- It's been too long.
- Way too long.

474
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,908
<i>Anyway, have a nice birthday.</i>

475
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:15,200
Thanks.

476
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:16,408
Okay.

477
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:18,533
I'm too skinny?

478
00:41:18,784 --> 00:41:20,575
- You work too much.
- True.

479
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,741
We'll talk later.

480
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:26,325
Happy birthday!

481
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:32,200
- Why do I always have to go see him?
- He's not coming?

482
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,533
Well, he's got a backache.

483
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,783
There's always something wrong with him.

484
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:40,158
Hello!

485
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:43,033
So, he's not coming.

486
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:44,991
That's not nice.

487
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,575
He wanted to, but he has a backache.

488
00:41:50,076 --> 00:41:52,450
Does he realize how it makes you feel?

489
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:55,241
- He's...
- It's a backache, Mom.

490
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:57,783
Sorry.

491

521

It's getting harder and harder to pee.

- Yeah.

Still...

526
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:00,283
I go to the toilet all the time.

527
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:01,450
And...

528
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,075
there's leakage.

529
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:08,366
Thanks for the cool jacket.
Good timing.

530
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:11,408
I want to get into hiking.

531
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,616
Sorry we're late.

532
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,491
You didn't make them coffee?

533
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:25,158
It's okay.

534
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:28,116
I'll fix something.

535
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:29,700
- How'd it go?
- Great.

536
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,950
- How many saves?
- Lots.

537
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:33,116
Good job.

538
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,950
Happy belated birthday.

539
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:36,908
30 is pretty major.

540

542
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,616
So we couldn't come.

543
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,658
No problem. That's okay.

544
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:49,991
She's the goalkeeper.
You should see her play.

545
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:52,783
No, she doesn't have to.

546
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,825
She's awesome.

547
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:57,783
I'll let you know next time.

548
00:44:58,034 --> 00:44:59,575
Yeah, please do.

549
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:01,950
Cool.

550
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,825
Did you get the article I sent you?

551
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,491
Yeah, I was about to ask you.
I couldn't get the link to work.

552
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:15,116
My PC acts up.

553
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:18,700
Know anything about computers?

554
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:21,241
I can take a look.

555
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:24,950
But can't she just resend the email?

556
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,700
Wasn't there a...

557
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,575
Did she send it
in an email?

558
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:31,116
An attachment to an email.

559
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:35,408
No, I pressed the button on the mouse.

560
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:38,700
Then I put the arrow on the square.

561
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:41,825
I tried twice, then it vanished.

562
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:45,366
It could be my fault.

563
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,408
Maybe I sent the wrong version.

564
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:51,658
We'll fix it.
You have to read that article.

565
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:53,950
It's really good.

566
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:55,450
Very...

567
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:58,491
Very well written, and...

568
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,116
Clever girl.

569
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:07,450
When are you coming to see us,
Per Harald?

570
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:11,116
We'd love it.
Come see where your daughter lives.

571
00:46:11,326 --> 00:46:13,450
Sure, of course.

572
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,700
But it's hard to park in Central Oslo.

573
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,283
They've got that...

574
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:21,950
resident...

575
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,616
resident parking there.

576
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:25,991
Yeah.

577
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,408
It's made it much easier
to find a space.

578
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,325
You just have to pay.

579
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:35,325
And move the car every half hour?

580
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:41,075
Is that the reason
you don't come to see us?

581
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:44,200
Because it's hard to drive in town?

582
00:46:44,492 --> 00:46:45,325
That's not it.

583
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:46,700
Then what is it?

584
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:49,783
Well, you know...

585
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:53,700
with my painkillers,
I'm not allowed to drive.

586
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:55,700
There's that, too.

587
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,450
The good thing is,
he's open about it.

588
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:08,825
His pains. His prostate.

589
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,825
You have to make your own family.

590
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:37,075
CHAPTER 5
BAD TIMING

591
00:48:13,784 --> 00:48:14,783
Excuse me?

592
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:16,033
Hi.

593
00:48:16,242 --> 00:48:17,741
Do you have <i>Green Yoga</i>?

594
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:23,158
Let me check.

595
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,908
- Which book again?
- <i>Green Yoga.</i>

596
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:28,033
Published last year.

597
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,825
No, I'll have to order it.
It's not in stock.

598
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,741
How long will it take?

599
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:38,741
Two weeks.

600
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:41,991
Okay. No thanks.

601
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,866
They don't have it either.

602
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,116
Okay.

603
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,075
We can try at Ark.

604
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:49,825
Thank you.

605
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:17,700
I told her
I forgot my sunglasses.

606
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:19,575
I just had to say

607
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:21,825
that I know what we said.

608
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,241
But I think about you a lot.

609
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:26,366
And...

610
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,325
I don't want to bug you
if you're happy.

611
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,491
Are you?

612
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,325
- I don't know what to say.
- Say nothing.

613
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:40,116
I'd like to see you again.
Just to talk.

614
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,075
I mean, I'm not going to...

615
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:49,825
But I'd like to see you again.
Just to...

616
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:53,950
I'm at Åpent Bakeri in Barcode
nearly every day.

617
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,450
I work there, I mean.
If you want to.

618
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:01,825
So...

619
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:06,241
- Eivind?
- Yes.

620
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:07,825
Your glasses.

621
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:09,116
Oh, right. Fuck.

622
00:50:24,117 --> 00:50:28,116
Language opens the door
to the subconscious.

623
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,908
Freud was a great writer.

624
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:33,116
He could be self-critical.

625
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:36,366
He never hesitated
to revise his theories.

626
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:40,700
He viewed each individual patient
as a research subject.

627
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:44,283
Freud didn't distinguish between
therapy and research.

628
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:47,658
I find that very compelling.

629
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:51,366
Especially these days,

630
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:55,200
when scientific methodology
is applied

631
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,991
even in the humanities.

632
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:00,991
Enough about Freud.
How's the movie coming along?

633
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:03,408
Isn't it almost done?

634
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:05,325
Yeah, I've seen it, but...

635
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:06,866
- You have?
- Yes.

636
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:09,158
It's no longer mine at all.

637
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,658
Is it as bad as you feared?

638
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:15,575
The worst thing is how
they've housetrained Bobcat.

639
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:19,283
It's all very sanitized and safe.

640
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,700
I'll show you something.

641
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:26,325
A mock-up of the movie poster.

642
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,366
I have to admit...

643
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:31,200
I'm embarrassed my name's on it.

644
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:32,158
Shit.

645
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:34,075
No! Seriously?

646
00:51:34,284 --> 00:51:36,408
You must be kidding. No way.

647
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:39,616
That's the poster. For real.

648
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:42,158
Let's see.

649
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,241
Looks like Chip and Dale.

650
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:45,158
Holy shit.

651
00:51:45,784 --> 00:51:47,575
Should I laugh or cry?

652
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:51,991
Everything was butchered.
The story. All the details.

653
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:54,741
They removed the starfish.

654
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:56,741
Sorry, I'm lost.

655
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,158
What starfish?

656
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:00,200
It's, you know...

657
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,991
the butthole. The anus.

658
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:04,283
His butt is smooth in the movie.

659
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:07,450
This thing is gone.

660
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,783
That's bad in my book.

661
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:12,200
In underground comics you shit,

662
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:15,866
you puke, you fuck and all that stuff.

663
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:21,200
Bobcat is a wild cat
in a world of domestic cats.

664
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:23,700
He's a rebel against the bourgeoisie.

665
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:26,616
One of the most iconic buttholes ever.

666
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:06,533
Coffee?

667
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:07,575
Yeah.

668
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:41,908
I don't know what we should do.

669
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,616
I have to go.

670
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:33,616
Aksel,

671
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:35,450
we need to talk.

672
00:58:37,326 --> 00:58:38,866
Yeah, of course.

673
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:40,991
What's wrong?

674
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,325
<i>Julie said she'd been thinking.</i>

675
00:58:44,867 --> 00:58:48,075
<i>It wasn't his fault.
Nothing he could have changed.</i>

676
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:50,533
It's not anything you've done.

677
00:58:51,117 --> 00:58:53,741
It's not your fault. But I feel...

678
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:56,533
<i>It was about
all their old arguments.</i>

679
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,616
<i>Things they both knew.</i>

680
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,075
<i>It was bad timing.</i>

681
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:02,991
<i>They'd met in different phases of life.</i>

682
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,325
<i>They wanted different things.</i>

683
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:07,741
We want different things.

684
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:16,450
Are you leaving me?

685
00:59:17,117 --> 00:59:17,991
Yeah.

686
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:22,950
I want it to be over.

687
00:59:49,534 --> 00:59:53,241
Are you sure you're yourself right now?

688
00:59:54,076 --> 00:59:55,116
What do you mean?

689
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:57,700
Do you realize...

690
00:59:58,367 --> 01:00:01,325
Do you realize what you're doing?

691
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:03,200
What you're destroying?

692
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:05,325
Yes, of course.

693
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:08,158
That's why it's so hard.

694
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:16,908
Where will you live?

695
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:19,866
I don't know.

696
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,366
You don't know?

697
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,116
No. With Mom.

698
01:00:28,242 --> 01:00:29,241
Move home to Mom?

699
01:00:30,242 --> 01:00:32,325
Yeah. Until I find a place.

700
01:00:34,826 --> 01:00:35,700
Okay.

701
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:43,408
No, come on...

702
01:00:46,117 --> 01:00:47,450
It's over.

703
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:51,950
I've had it. What else can I say?

704
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:56,033
Is something else bothering you
and you're venting on me?

705
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:56,991
No.

706
01:00:57,409 --> 01:00:59,241
I've thought about it for a long time.

707
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:01,950
It feels right.

708
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:08,158
Have you met someone?

709
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:09,616
No.

710
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:19,075
I'm so sick of all this, Julie.
Dammit.

711
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:20,658
Sick to death of it.

712
01:01:23,701 --> 01:01:25,658
But okay.

713
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:28,283
Just leave. If that's what you want.

714
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:33,908
I'll take a walk while you pack.

715
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:04,616
<i>Julie said he deserved
a more grounded woman.</i>

716
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:07,075
<i>Ready for children.</i>

717
01:02:07,534 --> 01:02:08,658
<i>Who was dependable,</i>

718
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:11,825
<i>didn't flake out every six months.</i>

719
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,908
But I like you flaky.

720
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:19,116
<i>Aksel said he liked her flaky.</i>

721
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:22,533
<i>That he needed someone like that.</i>

722
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,450
<i>Who could draw him out
of his drawing board.</i>

723
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,950
And as for having kids...

724
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:34,533
<i>He said
he'd rather be childless with her</i>

725
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:36,575
<i>than have kids with anyone else.</i>

726
01:02:37,326 --> 01:02:39,408
You know that's not the only problem.

727
01:02:40,076 --> 01:02:41,741
So what is the problem?

728
01:02:43,617 --> 01:02:47,700
It's a combination of things,
not just that.

729
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:51,866
I can see you're in a crisis right now.

730
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:54,033
I can understand that.

731
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:57,325
But if you love me,

732
01:02:58,451 --> 01:02:59,950
we'll sort it all out.

733
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,658
Yes, I do love you.

734
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,033
And I don't love you.

735
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:07,283
<i>Julie felt that this sentence,</i>

736
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,991
<i>the way she said it,</i>

737
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:10,491
<i>her emphasis on certain words,</i>

738
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:13,783
<i>summed up the impossibility of it all.</i>

739
01:03:13,992 --> 01:03:16,991
I feel like a spectator in my own life.

740
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:21,950
Like I'm playing a supporting role
in my own life.

741
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:30,116
I get that you feel stuck.

742
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:33,033
You need a change.

743
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,366
But is this the solution?

744
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:38,575
This is exactly my point.

745
01:03:39,117 --> 01:03:41,241
I'm trying to tell you how I feel,

746
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:44,700
and you're defining my feelings.

747
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:47,283
I see what you're doing.

748
01:03:47,492 --> 01:03:51,116
What am I doing?
Tell me what I'm doing.

749
01:03:51,242 --> 01:03:53,366
Shut up, and I'll tell you.

750
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:58,158
You're acting out the confrontation
you never dared have with your father.

751
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:02,491
- You're taking it out on me.
- Is that so?

752
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:05,366
What do you know about it?

753
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:08,700
This is the crux of our relationship.

754
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:12,116
Everything we feel,
we have to put into words.

755
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:15,366
Sometimes, I just want to feel things.

756
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:19,033
You insist on being so
damn strong all the time.

757
01:04:19,284 --> 01:04:20,200
For you,

758
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:22,783
being strong

759
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,908
is about formulating things.

760
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:27,200
If you analyze things

761
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,741
at every psychological level,

762
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,450
you think you're strong.

763
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:35,491
Because I'm less analytical,
you think I'm weaker.

764
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:42,825
<i>She said she was terrified
of being alone.</i>

765
01:04:43,034 --> 01:04:44,700
<i>Terrified of living without him.</i>

766
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:46,741
<i>That when she left,</i>

767
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,366
<i>she'd be like Bambi on the ice.</i>

768
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:53,991
<i>And that was precisely
why she had to do it.</i>

769
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:59,700
<i>Aksel mumbled soothing words
she didn't hear.</i>

770
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:01,741
<i>She was thinking about how,</i>

771
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,575
<i>at the age of 30,
she'd just compared herself to Bambi.</i>

772
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:10,033
No.

773
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:13,491
I'm pathetic.

774
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,950
No, you're not.

775
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:30,575
Aksel...

776
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:13,491
Hey...

777
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:17,533
I didn't mean what I said.

778
01:06:17,826 --> 01:06:18,741
It's okay.

779
01:06:18,992 --> 01:06:20,575
I said plenty of things, too.

780
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:26,408
Stay a little longer.

781
01:06:31,076 --> 01:06:32,783
You'll regret it.

782
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:36,866
I'm sure I will.

783
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:39,700
The saddest thing,

784
01:06:39,951 --> 01:06:43,991
is one day, you'll want kids.

785
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:47,241
In any case,
you'll have other relationships.

786
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:52,033
And you'll realize that
what we had was unique.

787
01:06:52,492 --> 01:06:53,366
I know.

788
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,783
You don't. But I do.
I've had many relationships.

789
01:06:56,992 --> 01:06:58,491
I know how hard it is.

790
01:06:59,867 --> 01:07:03,116
Nobody communicates like we do.
Laughs like we do.

791
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:17,366
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get back together someday.

792
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,866
<i>Then and there...</i>

793
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:21,575
<i>she meant it.</i>

794
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:23,741
I mean it.

795
01:07:45,367 --> 01:07:48,491
CHAPTER 6
FINNMARK HIGHLANDS

796
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,450
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

797
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:09,825
- It looked easier on YouTube.
- I told you we should practice.

798
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:13,950
Wait...

799
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,491
This one first.

800
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:17,950
- Are you sure?
- Yes, this goes on top.

801
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,866
Right, but is it first?

802
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:23,158
Isn't the other one first?

803
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:25,491
- No, that's the top.
- Okay.

804
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,075
<i>Eivind turned it into a funny story
he told everyone.</i>

805
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:12,866
<i>But it touched
something deeper in her.</i>

806
01:09:14,742 --> 01:09:17,075
<i>Awoke something in her.</i>

807
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,700
<i>She googled her family name.</i>

808
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,783
<i>Her grandfather came
from the Far North.</i>

809
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:27,491
<i>The DNA sample
she sent to America confirmed it.</i>

810
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:35,741
<i>Eivind didn't see how
her newfound identity</i>

811
01:09:35,951 --> 01:09:37,950
<i>as 3.1% Sami</i>

812
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:42,325
<i>connected to mind-expanding substances
and unrelated exotic rituals,</i>

813
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:45,408
<i>but tried to be supportive.</i>

814
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:49,783
<i>As she became increasingly militant,</i>

815
01:09:50,034 --> 01:09:53,325
<i>she saw how climate change
was hurting indigenous people.</i>

816
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:01,075
<i>Inuit starving as seals vanish.</i>

817
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:04,408
<i>Melting ice ruining reindeer pastures.</i>

818
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,866
<i>Aborigines dying of skin cancer
from the hole in the ozone.</i>

819
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,408
<i>Eivind could forget
about flying to New York.</i>

820
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,283
Breathe in. All the way up.

821
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:17,950
<i>She made them live</i>

822
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:20,241
<i>more sustainably.</i>

823
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:24,075
<i>He could always do better.</i>

824
01:10:24,326 --> 01:10:26,408
<i>Study the ingredients more closely.</i>

825
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:29,825
<i>Consider the environmental impact
of his purchases.</i>

826
01:10:30,034 --> 01:10:31,700
<i>Plastic is killing the oceans.</i>

827
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:35,075
<i>Norwegian cod
was ferried to China and back.</i>

828
01:10:35,326 --> 01:10:37,700
<i>Cobalt mining was destroying the Congo.</i>

829
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:40,116
<i>Batteries had blood on their hands.</i>

830
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:46,366
<i>The sum of Western guilt
sat beside him on the couch.</i>

831
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,450
<i>Went to bed with him at night.</i>

832
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:53,700
<i>Everything was weighed against
the greater cause.</i>

833
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:14,325
<i>He felt he was betraying Sunniva.
Betraying the Sami people.</i>

834
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:23,116
<i>Felt like the world's worst person,
but couldn't resist.</i>

835
01:11:24,992 --> 01:11:27,658
I forgot my sunglasses inside.

836
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,200
Right.

837
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:30,950
Be right back.

838
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:41,908
CHAPTER 7
A NEW CHAPTER

839
01:12:27,826 --> 01:12:29,908
<i>Eivind didn't want kids either.</i>

840
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:34,783
<i>Climate researchers foresaw
hard times for future generations.</i>

841
01:12:34,992 --> 01:12:38,616
<i>Overpopulation was the reason
everything was falling apart.</i>

842
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,158
<i>Julie liked how this pessimism
added depth</i>

843
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:56,116
<i>to his cheerful nature.</i>

844
01:12:57,867 --> 01:13:01,366
<i>But she could tell
he had other reasons too.</i>

845
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:06,658
<i>Eivind's father, like Julie's,</i>

846
01:13:06,867 --> 01:13:09,033
<i>tended to forget birthdays.</i>

847
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:10,616
<i>Eivind would often say,</i>

848
01:13:10,826 --> 01:13:12,575
<i>"According to my father's calendar..."</i>

849
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,408
I'm 12 years old.

850
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,950
They're all hard. No ripe ones.

851
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:19,408
People die of thirst in Chile

852
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:22,991
because avocados need so much water.

853
01:13:43,117 --> 01:13:45,325
Still following Sunniva on Instagram?

854
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:50,866
Yeah, she posts interesting links
about the environment.

855
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:55,950
We don't message or anything.

856
01:13:56,242 --> 01:13:58,908
She's got over 30,000 followers.

857
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,075
For showing off her ass?

858
01:14:02,784 --> 01:14:05,741
She's not showing off her ass,
she's doing yoga.

859
01:14:06,284 --> 01:14:07,366
It's yoga.

860
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:11,825
Okay, she shows it off a bit.

861
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:14,450
I don't mind you following her.

862
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,950
It's not a problem, but...

863
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,033
I don't want to be

864
01:14:21,076 --> 01:14:24,575
the sensible choice
while she's the sexy one.

865
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:35,158
There's nothing sensible about you.

866
01:14:36,784 --> 01:14:38,241
- I mean...
- Yeah.

867
01:14:39,367 --> 01:14:43,075
- The angle of her pelvis...
- It's yoga.

868
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:45,283
That's not yoga.

869
01:14:45,576 --> 01:14:46,325
It is yoga.

870
01:14:47,076 --> 01:14:48,158
You liked it!

871
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:49,950
Oh, my god!

872
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:54,366
- That's not cool!
- I had to like it!

873
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:05,491
That's right.

874
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,116
So, that's why...

875
01:15:09,492 --> 01:15:12,783
CHAPTER 8
JULIE'S NARCISSISTIC CIRCUS

876
01:15:12,992 --> 01:15:14,558
I want people to watch me dance.

877
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:16,783
It's annoying as hell.

878
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:21,658
You can make a fool of yourself
on the dance floor and still be cool.

879
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:26,533
So true! I've noticed that.
When we dance,

880
01:15:26,742 --> 01:15:28,241
you take up all the space.

881
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:40,825
Yeah, but it's also like,

882
01:15:41,034 --> 01:15:42,950
"Everyone look at me!"

883
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:47,200
Yeah, that's my point.
You're always so mysterious.

884
01:15:53,117 --> 01:15:54,700
You still have your stash?

885
01:15:56,576 --> 01:15:57,658
What's that?

886
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:02,950
Where'd you find it?

887
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:05,700
What is it?

888
01:16:06,326 --> 01:16:07,491
Magic mushrooms.

889
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:16,783
Have you tried it?

890
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:19,950
Yeah.

891
01:16:25,784 --> 01:16:26,408
Right.

892
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:29,450
Why'd you do that?

893
01:16:30,992 --> 01:16:31,866
Yuck.

894
01:16:32,076 --> 01:16:33,283
Tastes like dirt.

895
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:35,575
Anyone?

896
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:34,158
I don't feel anything.
They're probably too old.

897
01:17:35,576 --> 01:17:36,658
I gotta go.

898
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,991
Are you sure? Could be risky.

899
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:40,700
Come on, man.

900
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,450
We've done this before.

901
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,741
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Call me.

902
01:17:53,826 --> 01:17:54,908
Adil?

903
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:06,241
Can you speak?

904
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:17,533
It's kicking in for him.

905
01:18:21,784 --> 01:18:22,533
Julie?

906
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:24,366
Is it starting to kick in?

907
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,575
You need water.

908
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,116
It's important.

909
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:30,866
You have to drink lots of water.

910
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:34,200
Here.

911
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:35,658
Drink it all.

912
01:18:35,992 --> 01:18:37,658
You'll be okay.

913
01:18:38,076 --> 01:18:39,783
You know I'm here for you.

914
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:46,033
Julie?

915
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:47,908
Drink the water.

916
01:18:58,659 --> 01:18:59,700
It's okay! I'm here!

917
01:20:11,034 --> 01:20:13,241
Julie, are you okay?

918
01:20:18,284 --> 01:20:20,658
I thought I'd make it.

919
01:20:21,576 --> 01:20:22,325
Are you okay?

920
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:47,075
Thought we could use some coffee.

921
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:52,616
We won't be doing that again.

922
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:00,658
You should take a shower.

923
01:22:00,867 --> 01:22:02,241
Do I smell bad?

924
01:22:04,242 --> 01:22:06,366
- Is that...
- Oh, my god.

925
01:22:07,576 --> 01:22:09,450
Oh, my god.
I need to take a shower.

926
01:22:09,701 --> 01:22:12,075
Don't worry, it's not urgent.

927
01:22:12,284 --> 01:22:14,033
Shall I make breakfast?

928
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:27,783
I feel I can be myself with you.

929
01:22:28,534 --> 01:22:29,825
Completely.

930
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:35,741
You weren't yourself before?

931
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,033
I was, but I felt like...

932
01:22:38,617 --> 01:22:40,158
I had to be...

933
01:22:41,284 --> 01:22:42,741
a bit...

934
01:22:42,784 --> 01:22:45,408
like I was when we first met.

935
01:22:59,034 --> 01:23:00,908
Thanks for putting up with me.

936
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,616
I love you.

937
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:42,783
CHAPTER 9
BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

938
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,925
BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

939
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:20,283
<i>Have you read your
old Bobcat comics since you grew up?</i>

940
01:24:20,492 --> 01:24:23,533
<i>Because in our day and age,</i>

941
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:26,241
they seem so inappropriate and murky

942
01:24:26,451 --> 01:24:28,658
that we feel almost sick

943
01:24:28,909 --> 01:24:29,825
<i>reading them.</i>

944
01:24:30,117 --> 01:24:32,908
<i>It's unpleasant to realize
you created a character</i>

945
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:36,200
<i>who gained popularity
at the expense of women.</i>

946
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:37,450
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

947
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:40,283
You're saying art should be pleasant?

948
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,325
Do you think it's art?

949
01:24:43,617 --> 01:24:47,908
I brought along
some of your early comics.

950
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:51,241
Bobcat is one thing,
but then there's Dick Wolf Dick,

951
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,033
Pedo the Parrot...

952
01:24:53,617 --> 01:24:57,950
Right, I don't really think
this is the right medium to

953
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:00,200
explain comic book humor.

954
01:25:00,492 --> 01:25:04,450
<i>Have you ever considered that
some of your readers</i>

955
01:25:04,659 --> 01:25:07,283
<i>may have been victims
of incest or rape?</i>

956
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:12,616
<i>Do we stop creating
because some people might feel bad?</i>

957
01:25:12,826 --> 01:25:17,908
<i>Artists get killed for drawing things
others find offensive. They're shot.</i>

958
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,950
Are you comparing Mohammed caricatures

959
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,533
with drawings of women with big tits?

960
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:25,241
Or with incest?

961
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:26,616
What's your point?

962
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:28,616
Well, yes and no.

963
01:25:28,867 --> 01:25:30,325
It's a bit of a cop-out

964
01:25:30,617 --> 01:25:33,783
<i>to claim freedom of speech
when people criticize you.</i>

965
01:25:33,992 --> 01:25:36,366
<i>We're discussing your work right now,</i>

966
01:25:36,576 --> 01:25:39,366
<i>so nobody's censoring you.</i>

967
01:25:39,742 --> 01:25:42,075
<i>As a woman, I'm upset.</i>

968
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:45,741
<i>I'm offended,
though we're not supposed to say that.</i>

969
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:49,950
You have a choice.
You don't have to feel offended.

970
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:51,491
It's not a choice.

971
01:25:51,784 --> 01:25:54,616
This is very generational.

972
01:25:54,992 --> 01:25:58,241
<i>One author cannot be held
solely responsible.</i>

973
01:25:58,451 --> 01:26:02,616
<i>I think art has to be messy and free.</i>

974
01:26:02,826 --> 01:26:05,325
<i>It has to be a bit dangerous
to be fun.</i>

975
01:26:05,534 --> 01:26:09,158
I want art to be a form of therapy

976
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:12,200
where I can express and work through

977
01:26:12,492 --> 01:26:14,241
all my unacceptable thoughts,

978
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:17,325
all my darkest impulses.

979
01:26:17,576 --> 01:26:21,325
But you're using your male privilege

980
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,741
to mock people weaker than you.

981
01:26:23,951 --> 01:26:26,325
It's hardly art, or even humor.

982
01:26:26,534 --> 01:26:28,825
Sorry, it's not
smart enough to be satire.

983
01:26:29,076 --> 01:26:30,241
But this isn't about me.

984
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:33,450
Like, when I create something,

985
01:26:33,784 --> 01:26:35,700
it's not just me talking.

986
01:26:35,992 --> 01:26:37,616
- I know that much.
- Do you?

987
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:42,283
<i>Let's say I draw this interview
as a cartoon.</i>

988
01:26:42,492 --> 01:26:46,533
<i>The comic version of me
might call you a whore.</i>

989
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:50,116
<i>It doesn't mean I think that.</i>

990
01:26:50,367 --> 01:26:51,991
<i>It could be</i>

991
01:26:52,242 --> 01:26:54,908
a parody of a certain type
of insecure male...

992
01:26:55,742 --> 01:26:57,283
You used the word "whore"?

993
01:26:58,326 --> 01:26:59,950
Yes, I said "whore".

994
01:27:00,409 --> 01:27:02,366
<i>You're not interested in what I mean.</i>

995
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,200
<i>Can't you see
that's crass sexualization?</i>

996
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:08,283
I think we're on a slippery slope here.

997
01:27:08,534 --> 01:27:12,575
All you post-feminists
are so fucking self-righteous!

998
01:27:14,076 --> 01:27:16,991
<i>Thank you, Marthe Refstad
and Aksel Willmann.</i>

999
01:27:17,326 --> 01:27:19,866
<i>The term is "sex worker" now,
by the way.</i>

1000
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:29,783
CHAPTER 10
FIRST PERSON SINGULAR

1001
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:36,075
<i>I'm happy to help!</i>

1002
01:27:58,867 --> 01:27:59,825
Long time no see!

1003
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:02,366
- Yeah.
- How are you?

1004
01:28:02,576 --> 01:28:04,283
Okay. And you?

1005
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:05,991
I'm good.

1006
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:10,116
Do you ever talk to Aksel?

1007
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:11,533
Is he okay?

1008
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:12,908
Yeah, well...

1009
01:28:13,492 --> 01:28:16,200
I heard the radio interview.

1010
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:17,283
Yeah.

1011
01:28:17,951 --> 01:28:19,408
He went a bit far.

1012
01:28:25,201 --> 01:28:26,908
He's not doing that well.

1013
01:28:28,201 --> 01:28:30,116
Did you know he's sick?

1014
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:32,783
Aksel?

1015
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:34,200
Haven't you heard?

1016
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,700
He has cancer.

1017
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:39,575
Sorry, I thought you knew.

1018
01:28:40,617 --> 01:28:42,200
It spread quickly.

1019
01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:44,866
They discovered it too late.

1020
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:45,783
Cancer?

1021
01:28:46,367 --> 01:28:48,408
Pancreatic.

1022
01:28:54,117 --> 01:28:55,283
But...

1023
01:29:00,076 --> 01:29:01,741
How is he coping?

1024
01:29:02,117 --> 01:29:04,741
Pretty well, under the circumstances.

1025
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:06,325
But it's hard.

1026
01:29:06,784 --> 01:29:08,408
The prognosis

1027
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:11,491
is not good.

1028
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:12,908
It's incurable.

1029
01:29:25,784 --> 01:29:27,616
Thanks for letting me know.

1030
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:29,950
I thought you knew.

1031
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:32,825
No, I hadn't heard anything.

1032
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:35,408
It's just...

1033
01:29:37,284 --> 01:29:39,033
I didn't know.

1034
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,741
When did you write this?

1035
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:26,825
Have you read it?

1036
01:30:27,076 --> 01:30:29,700
I was moving it to paper recycling.

1037
01:30:31,284 --> 01:30:32,366
It's very good.

1038
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:35,158
You think?

1039
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:36,991
Yeah, it sucked me right in.

1040
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:39,616
It's really, really great.

1041
01:30:40,117 --> 01:30:42,200
I mean...

1042
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:44,950
It's like...

1043
01:30:46,992 --> 01:30:47,616
What?

1044
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:49,158
Well...

1045
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:54,616
I have to say,

1046
01:30:54,867 --> 01:30:56,950
it's really nice to read about you.

1047
01:30:58,409 --> 01:31:00,241
But it's not about me.

1048
01:31:01,284 --> 01:31:04,825
But the Christmas scene
is your family, right?

1049
01:31:06,242 --> 01:31:08,866
Yeah, but it's fiction.
You didn't get that?

1050
01:31:09,117 --> 01:31:10,283
I made it up.

1051
01:31:10,492 --> 01:31:12,658
Okay, it's fiction.
In any case...

1052
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:18,366
- It's good.
- Because it's me?

1053
01:31:18,576 --> 01:31:21,366
No, because it's nice.

1054
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,616
"Nice"?

1055
01:31:24,867 --> 01:31:27,325
Yeah, nice. Good.
Well written.

1056
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:31,450
The way you write
is really great.

1057
01:31:33,284 --> 01:31:34,491
Like here:

1058
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:39,408
"Too many memories overlapping,
blending into a blur."

1059
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:43,991
That resonates with me.
It's well written. Truly good.

1060
01:31:44,951 --> 01:31:46,325
It's not well written.

1061
01:31:48,951 --> 01:31:49,825
What's wrong?

1062
01:31:50,034 --> 01:31:53,408
Suddenly you're into literature?

1063
01:31:54,951 --> 01:31:57,241
What was the last book you read?

1064
01:32:00,409 --> 01:32:02,575
- Are you okay? What's up?
- Why?

1065
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:06,116
You criticize
everything I do these days.

1066
01:32:06,409 --> 01:32:10,116
Sorry, but going through my trash
is pretty invasive.

1067
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:13,950
- Can't you see that?
- Relax.

1068
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:15,533
- "Relax"?
- Calm down.

1069
01:32:15,826 --> 01:32:17,741
Relaxing is your specialty!

1070
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:20,825
You don't mind
serving coffee till you're 50.

1071
01:32:21,117 --> 01:32:22,158
But I want more!

1072
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:34,741
That's hurtful.
I don't know what to say.

1073
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:04,825
CHAPTER 11
POSITIVE

1074
01:33:32,034 --> 01:33:33,158
Hello?

1075
01:33:45,201 --> 01:33:46,158
Hey...

1076
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:52,825
Have you eaten?

1077
01:33:53,034 --> 01:33:55,700
Yeah, but I can make pasta if you like.

1078
01:33:55,909 --> 01:33:58,325
No, I don't need any if you've eaten.

1079
01:35:41,826 --> 01:35:42,908
Oops, sorry.

1080
01:35:58,117 --> 01:35:59,950
It started with a backache.

1081
01:36:01,034 --> 01:36:03,700
I've had backaches before.
I didn't worry.

1082
01:36:04,701 --> 01:36:08,158
Then my skin turned almost golden.

1083
01:36:10,576 --> 01:36:11,658
I thought I looked good.

1084
01:36:13,326 --> 01:36:15,116
It turned out to be jaundice.

1085
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:22,200
Mom said I was born jaundiced.
They put me in a light box.

1086
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:24,491
Is it painful?

1087
01:36:25,492 --> 01:36:26,741
No, not really.

1088
01:36:27,034 --> 01:36:28,366
It's okay.

1089
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:33,158
They block selected
neural pathways with Botox.

1090
01:36:34,492 --> 01:36:35,283
That's good.

1091
01:36:35,576 --> 01:36:39,408
Yeah, it keeps me from taking
too many painkillers.

1092
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:46,908
How's your family doing?

1093
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:48,866
Fine, I guess.

1094
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:51,200
Mom still follows your every move.

1095
01:36:53,576 --> 01:36:54,700
And your dad?

1096
01:36:57,576 --> 01:36:59,450
I've basically cut him off.

1097
01:36:59,784 --> 01:37:00,741
Good.

1098
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,116
He can chase me if he likes.

1099
01:37:04,367 --> 01:37:05,366
Does he?

1100
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:07,408
No, not really.

1101
01:37:08,576 --> 01:37:09,491
Two coffees.

1102
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,950
They thought it was hilarious.

1103
01:37:13,201 --> 01:37:15,450
In some circumstances,

1104
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:18,399
morbid humour can be funny.

1105
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:20,935
Even anal sex at a bar mitzvah?

1106
01:37:21,242 --> 01:37:24,325
It makes me laugh.
But I'm an old guy now.

1107
01:37:24,576 --> 01:37:25,575
No.

1108
01:37:25,867 --> 01:37:27,283
Well, you know...

1109
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:29,533
I kind of expected this.

1110
01:37:29,742 --> 01:37:32,908
I'd given up long before I got sick.

1111
01:37:34,492 --> 01:37:38,866
Really. I just watch
my favourite old movies over and over.

1112
01:37:39,117 --> 01:37:43,200
Lynch, <i>The Godfather Part II</i>...

1113
01:37:43,451 --> 01:37:45,075
How many times can you watch

1114
01:37:45,742 --> 01:37:47,158
<i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>?

1115
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:48,491
Many times!

1116
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:52,783
You should.

1117
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:54,533
Absolutely.

1118
01:37:57,742 --> 01:37:59,991
Sometimes I listen to music...

1119
01:38:00,784 --> 01:38:02,200
I haven't heard before.

1120
01:38:02,909 --> 01:38:04,241
But...

1121
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:06,950
It's old as well.

1122
01:38:08,367 --> 01:38:12,325
Music I didn't know about,
but from when I grew up.

1123
01:38:13,326 --> 01:38:16,033
It felt as though I'd already given up.

1124
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:22,616
I grew up in an age
without Internet and mobile phones.

1125
01:38:24,909 --> 01:38:27,241
No, but honestly...

1126
01:38:27,784 --> 01:38:30,950
I sound like an old fart.
But I think about it a lot.

1127
01:38:31,992 --> 01:38:35,158
The world that I knew...

1128
01:38:36,284 --> 01:38:38,033
has disappeared.

1129
01:38:38,242 --> 01:38:41,450
For me it was all about going to stores.

1130
01:38:42,076 --> 01:38:45,325
Record stores.

1131
01:38:47,742 --> 01:38:50,491
I'd take the tram
to Voices record store in Grünerløkka.

1132
01:38:50,826 --> 01:38:53,450
Leaf through
used comics at Pretty Price.

1133
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:57,700
I can close my eyes and see
the aisles at Video Nova in Majorstua.

1134
01:38:59,284 --> 01:39:01,866
I grew up in a time

1135
01:39:02,076 --> 01:39:05,408
when culture was passed along
through objects.

1136
01:39:07,117 --> 01:39:10,075
They were interesting because

1137
01:39:11,826 --> 01:39:14,158
we could live among them.

1138
01:39:14,367 --> 01:39:17,325
We could pick them up.
Hold them in our hands.

1139
01:39:17,867 --> 01:39:19,200
Compare them.

1140
01:39:19,409 --> 01:39:20,950
A bit like books?

1141
01:39:22,242 --> 01:39:23,825
Yeah, a bit like books.

1142
01:39:27,076 --> 01:39:31,408
That's all I have.
I spent my life doing that.

1143
01:39:33,284 --> 01:39:38,200
Collecting all that stuff,
comics, books...

1144
01:39:39,951 --> 01:39:41,158
And...

1145
01:39:43,242 --> 01:39:47,241
I just continued,
even when it stopped giving me

1146
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:50,325
the powerful emotions

1147
01:39:50,534 --> 01:39:53,533
I felt in my early 20s.

1148
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,991
I continued anyway.

1149
01:39:58,534 --> 01:39:59,491
And...

1150
01:40:01,076 --> 01:40:02,366
now it's all I have left.

1151
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:07,158
Knowledge and memories
of stupid, futile things

1152
01:40:07,367 --> 01:40:10,241
nobody cares about.

1153
01:40:10,451 --> 01:40:11,950
Don't say that.

1154
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,325
You've got the comics you created.

1155
01:40:15,159 --> 01:40:18,325
I wish I'd had what you had.

1156
01:40:18,534 --> 01:40:20,491
To be able to draw

1157
01:40:20,701 --> 01:40:24,658
without doubting that you're doing
what you're supposed to do.

1158
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:29,366
I really wish I had that.

1159
01:40:29,909 --> 01:40:30,950
Yeah, but...

1160
01:40:31,284 --> 01:40:33,158
I've got cancer. I'm dying.

1161
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:35,866
Of course I'm being retrospective.

1162
01:40:37,492 --> 01:40:40,116
You said you've done that for ages.

1163
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:42,241
Not for that long.

1164
01:40:43,492 --> 01:40:48,116
In recent years. I reached
a point in life when suddenly...

1165
01:40:48,326 --> 01:40:49,908
It just happened.

1166
01:40:51,534 --> 01:40:53,116
When...

1167
01:40:55,951 --> 01:40:58,325
I began to worship what had been.

1168
01:41:01,076 --> 01:41:05,200
And now I have nothing else.
I have no future.

1169
01:41:07,326 --> 01:41:09,575
I can only look back.

1170
01:41:13,076 --> 01:41:14,408
And...

1171
01:41:14,659 --> 01:41:17,158
It's not even nostalgia.
It's...

1172
01:41:17,909 --> 01:41:19,325
fear of death.

1173
01:41:19,534 --> 01:41:21,616
It's because I'm scared.

1174
01:41:28,742 --> 01:41:31,241
It has nothing to do with art.

1175
01:41:31,992 --> 01:41:33,908
I'm just trying to process...

1176
01:41:45,992 --> 01:41:48,533
I have surgery tomorrow at 9.

1177
01:41:49,951 --> 01:41:53,366
<i>I felt I could tell you anything.</i>

1178
01:41:54,617 --> 01:41:56,075
<i>You wouldn't judge me.</i>

1179
01:41:56,451 --> 01:41:59,450
<i>You're the least
judgemental person I know.</i>

1180
01:42:02,659 --> 01:42:04,575
I don't have anyone I can talk to...

1181
01:42:06,076 --> 01:42:08,450
the way we used to talk.

1182
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:24,450
Can you tell me
what you used to tell me?

1183
01:42:25,284 --> 01:42:28,450
I hated hearing it at the time,
but can you tell me...

1184
01:42:29,242 --> 01:42:31,283
I'll be a good mother?

1185
01:42:34,742 --> 01:42:35,652
Are you pregnant?

1186
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:46,950
Congratulations?

1187
01:42:49,534 --> 01:42:51,241
How do you feel?
Good or bad?

1188
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:52,700
I don't know.

1189
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:55,658
I'm not sure.

1190
01:42:57,992 --> 01:42:59,616
It was an accident.

1191
01:42:59,826 --> 01:43:03,075
I must've been careless.
I mean, clearly I was.

1192
01:43:18,617 --> 01:43:20,741
Were you really sure?

1193
01:43:22,701 --> 01:43:24,450
Sure you wanted kids?

1194
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:34,825
I was scared, too.
I had doubts, of course.

1195
01:43:36,409 --> 01:43:40,283
But I didn't want to show them,
to keep you from...

1196
01:43:41,867 --> 01:43:45,116
I never doubted
you'd make a good mother.

1197
01:43:45,867 --> 01:43:49,325
I saw that you doubted it.

1198
01:43:50,242 --> 01:43:54,033
If I regret one thing,
it's that I never managed

1199
01:43:56,451 --> 01:44:00,866
to make you see how wonderful you are.

1200
01:44:21,617 --> 01:44:22,783
What are you thinking?

1201
01:44:26,409 --> 01:44:28,616
This is hard to hear.

1202
01:44:34,784 --> 01:44:37,616
But... will you keep it?

1203
01:44:39,534 --> 01:44:41,075
I don't know.

1204
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,991
I wasted so much time

1205
01:44:53,909 --> 01:44:55,866
worrying about what could go wrong.

1206
01:44:56,076 --> 01:45:00,033
But what did go wrong,
was never the things I worried about.

1207
01:45:02,534 --> 01:45:06,283
If he's a kind man, then go for it.

1208
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:11,283
With a kind father,
and you as the mother,

1209
01:45:12,242 --> 01:45:13,658
everything will be fine.

1210
01:45:27,367 --> 01:45:29,700
Your voice has stayed in my head.

1211
01:45:29,992 --> 01:45:32,825
We still have great conversations.

1212
01:45:33,117 --> 01:45:33,950
No way?

1213
01:45:36,034 --> 01:45:37,200
About what?

1214
01:45:38,701 --> 01:45:41,200
Mostly about comics.

1215
01:45:43,409 --> 01:45:45,241
Eclectic tastes.

1216
01:45:54,742 --> 01:45:56,116
Same here.

1217
01:45:56,409 --> 01:45:58,783
I have imaginary conversations with you.

1218
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:18,116
I'm sure I remember things about you
that you've forgotten.

1219
01:46:20,201 --> 01:46:21,491
And the other way round.

1220
01:46:22,451 --> 01:46:24,325
Yeah, maybe.

1221
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:30,991
When I'm gone,

1222
01:46:31,826 --> 01:46:34,325
all that stuff about you
will go with me.

1223
01:46:45,826 --> 01:46:47,533
May I ask you a question?

1224
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:53,616
Had you already met him
when you broke up with me?

1225
01:46:59,742 --> 01:47:00,741
Yeah.

1226
01:47:04,201 --> 01:47:05,783
Why didn't you tell me?

1227
01:47:13,826 --> 01:47:15,116
I don't know.

1228
01:47:16,534 --> 01:47:17,825
I didn't dare.

1229
01:47:24,784 --> 01:47:27,075
And now you're breaking up with him?

1230
01:47:27,784 --> 01:47:29,450
No, why do you say that?

1231
01:47:31,117 --> 01:47:34,741
Maybe because you don't seem happy
about the baby.

1232
01:47:38,076 --> 01:47:41,325
And that's what you do
when things get tough.

1233
01:47:49,367 --> 01:47:51,033
I'm glad I'm pregnant.

1234
01:47:59,451 --> 01:48:00,616
I'm sorry.

1235
01:48:06,909 --> 01:48:07,950
It's alright.

1236
01:48:32,951 --> 01:48:35,325
You were the most important
relationship in my life.

1237
01:48:38,659 --> 01:48:40,825
You don't have to say anything.

1238
01:48:41,492 --> 01:48:44,575
I know it's not the same for you.

1239
01:48:45,534 --> 01:48:49,075
That's normal.
You have many years left to live.

1240
01:48:51,826 --> 01:48:53,283
But I know, I feel it.

1241
01:48:56,117 --> 01:48:57,866
And I want you to know.

1242
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:04,700
You were the love of my life.

1243
01:49:20,409 --> 01:49:21,866
You're a damn good person.

1244
01:50:01,159 --> 01:50:02,575
I should've told you before.

1245
01:50:03,326 --> 01:50:04,658
But I couldn't.

1246
01:50:06,992 --> 01:50:08,366
I'm pregnant.

1247
01:50:15,534 --> 01:50:17,241
How long have you known?

1248
01:50:18,992 --> 01:50:20,950
I know we don't want kids.

1249
01:50:21,534 --> 01:50:22,616
No...

1250
01:50:22,826 --> 01:50:25,533
I don't know if I do.

1251
01:50:27,826 --> 01:50:31,325
I feel like I never see anything through.

1252
01:50:31,534 --> 01:50:35,033
I go from one thing to another.

1253
01:50:43,659 --> 01:50:46,033
I need time

1254
01:50:47,242 --> 01:50:48,616
to think about all this.

1255
01:50:49,159 --> 01:50:50,450
About us.

1256
01:51:11,492 --> 01:51:12,866
It's okay.

1257
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:28,491
CHAPTER 12
EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END

1258
01:51:40,034 --> 01:51:41,158
That's where I lived.

1259
01:51:44,659 --> 01:51:46,408
We moved there when I was 8.

1260
01:51:48,576 --> 01:51:49,866
Shall we knock?

1261
01:51:50,451 --> 01:51:51,991
No. I don't think so.

1262
01:52:18,242 --> 01:52:21,158
<i>What do you remember from here?</i>

1263
01:52:30,242 --> 01:52:32,325
<i>I remember these colours.</i>

1264
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:41,033
<i>They were always my reference</i>

1265
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:43,116
when I drew my comics.

1266
01:52:43,867 --> 01:52:45,325
These colours.

1267
01:52:51,909 --> 01:52:53,491
<i>And I remember</i>

1268
01:52:54,451 --> 01:52:57,658
<i>the local drunk,
who was super nice.</i>

1269
01:53:42,826 --> 01:53:45,700
I'm so tired of pretending
everything is okay.

1270
01:53:57,409 --> 01:54:00,533
It sucks being in so much pain.
It sucks.

1271
01:54:01,326 --> 01:54:03,033
Everything sucks.

1272
01:54:05,492 --> 01:54:06,325
And...

1273
01:54:08,617 --> 01:54:11,450
I don't want to be a memory for you.

1274
01:54:12,617 --> 01:54:15,325
I don't want to be a voice in your head.

1275
01:54:16,742 --> 01:54:19,825
I don't want to live on through my art.

1276
01:54:26,451 --> 01:54:28,825
I want to live in my flat.

1277
01:54:30,992 --> 01:54:32,075
I want to live...

1278
01:54:36,451 --> 01:54:38,658
I want to live in my flat with you.

1279
01:54:39,617 --> 01:54:41,200
I want to be happy together.

1280
01:55:27,034 --> 01:55:28,033
Bye.

1281
01:55:28,576 --> 01:55:29,700
Bye.

1282
01:55:29,992 --> 01:55:31,075
<i>Hi, Julie.</i>

1283
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:34,533
<i>Aksel's condition has suddenly worsened.</i>

1284
01:55:35,242 --> 01:55:38,491
<i>He's too ill for his planned treatment.</i>

1285
01:55:38,784 --> 01:55:41,866
<i>He may not make it through the night.</i>

1286
01:55:42,534 --> 01:55:46,241
<i>His family is with him,
but I thought you should know.</i>

1287
01:58:33,617 --> 01:58:37,200
EPILOGUE

1288
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:39,200
There's nothing more to say.

1289
01:59:00,701 --> 01:59:01,450
Cut!

1290
01:59:01,951 --> 01:59:02,741
One more.

1291
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:05,950
One more quick take.
Slight adjustment.

1292
01:59:06,617 --> 01:59:07,783
Be sadder.

1293
01:59:07,992 --> 01:59:08,908
Okay.

1294
01:59:09,117 --> 01:59:10,866
But he gets up so quickly.

1295
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:12,408
Hey!

1296
01:59:13,409 --> 01:59:15,741
Okay, camera ready.

1297
01:59:17,451 --> 01:59:18,450
Action!

1298
01:59:18,701 --> 01:59:20,058
There's nothing more to say.

1299
01:59:38,992 --> 01:59:40,616
Cut! Great.

1300
01:59:41,242 --> 01:59:42,158
Let's move on.

1301
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,450
Right, stills.

1302
01:59:48,909 --> 01:59:50,950
Sorry, I need some shots of you.

1303
01:59:52,992 --> 01:59:54,283
- Sure. Here?
- Yeah.

1304
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:01,783
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1305
02:00:05,159 --> 02:00:07,366
But I think I was pretty terrible.

1306
02:00:09,534 --> 02:00:12,283
Then use that.
Hold on to that feeling.

1307
02:00:12,909 --> 02:00:15,325
Act like you're looking at him.
