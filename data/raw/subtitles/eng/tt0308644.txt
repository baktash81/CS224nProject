1
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,810
- Lights up!
- Beginners, please!

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,051
- Your five-minute call, sir.
- Places.

3
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,519
Places. Everyone to their places.

4
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:27,088
Sh. Quiet, everyone.

5
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,580
Opening nights?
I love opening nights.

6
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:33,618
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good evening, Charles.

7
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,188
- Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.

8
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,361
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do?

9
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:38,157
May I give you a peck?

10
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,101
One of Mr Barrie's finest?

11
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,933
Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

12
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:44,334
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

13
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:47,132
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

14
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:50,772
See you on Broadway!

15
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:07,391
First positions, people.

16
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,327
Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:13,882
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,992
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

19
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:25,412
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

20
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:30,280
- Good audience.
- Sorry?

21
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:32,020
Good audience tonight.

22
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,353
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer?

23
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,718
Um, ten minutes, sir.

24
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:41,360
I love opening nights.

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,930
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

26
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,891
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

27
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:47,452
- How are you, John?
- Very well.

28
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:50,251
It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

29
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,507
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,532
You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

31
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:56,010
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

32
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,034
I'm sure.

33
00:01:57,262 --> 00:02:00,129
- Have you got the tickets?
- They're in my pocket.

34
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:04,046
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

35
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:08,653
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

36
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:12,315
- Have you seen him?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

37
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:34,749
We do miss seeing you on stage.
You were so wonderful.

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,881
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat?

39
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,256
Oh, yes, yes.

40
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:45,351
See you at the party, then.

41
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:46,910
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

42
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:50,156
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

43
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:52,932
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,916
Let's close the doors.

45
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:58,743
Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

46
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,018
I can wait quite well in the shop.

47
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:05,614
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

48
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:06,990
Really, you are uncommonly good.

49
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,583
Sorry, sir.

50
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:12,758
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

51
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:16,181
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

52
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:19,264
- Sir?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

53
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:25,475
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

54
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,046
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

55
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:32,482
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it? Is it crap?

56
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,916
- Crap, sir?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

57
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,588
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

58
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,591
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

59
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,149
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

60
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:45,393
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

61
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,621
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:53,593
Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment?

63
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm an old man...

64
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,207
..and I've seen few of the sights.

65
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,038
Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

66
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,917
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

67
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,852
Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,354
Good to see you. My apologies.

69
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:28,923
We'll get them with the next one,
Charles, I promise.

70
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:32,360
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

71
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:36,386
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

72
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:39,059
- Can you?
- No, I can't. How are you?

73
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,669
- Arthur.
- James.

74
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,534
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

75
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:44,728
Was I?

76
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,824
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

77
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,594
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you?

78
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,722
Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we?

79
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,758
I don't see why not.

80
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:59,299
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

81
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,055
- James.
- Hello, darling.

82
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,852
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you?

83
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,854
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

84
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,075
Mr Snow.

85
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,036
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

86
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,361
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right?

87
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:17,216
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it?

88
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,915
Was it?

89
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,763
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

90
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:29,810
How did you feel it went?

91
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:32,745
- I think I can do better.
- Really?

92
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:52,256
- Mary? Hello?
- Yes, James?

93
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

94
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,696
You'll be working, won't you?

95
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,064
Perhaps, yes.

96
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:06,066
I'll let you to your work then.

97
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:16,911
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

98
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,642
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

99
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:26,583
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

100
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,486
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

101
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:04,485
Who do you belong to?
Come on, boy. Come on.

102
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:12,209
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

103
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,946
Am I? So sorry.

104
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,286
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

105
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:20,594
I have to, I'm afraid.

106
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:25,089
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

107
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,401
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

108
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,599
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there?

109
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,488
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

110
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:39,476
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

111
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:41,365
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

112
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,769
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

113
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,747
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

114
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:52,438
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

115
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:56,355
I'm not horrible really, but
a firm ruler, yes. Kind and tolerant.

116
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,928
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?

117
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,869
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime?

118
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,823
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

119
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:11,189
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

120
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,228
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No. Go on.

121
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:17,475
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

122
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,871
And I'm in prison for it.

123
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:25,309
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?
- We're not bothering him, Mum.

124
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,275
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

125
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,206
I can't. I'm in prison.

126
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,773
Oh, I see.

127
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,968
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

128
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:37,598
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

129
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,433
- Are you a writer?
- I am.

130
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,788
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

131
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:45,108
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,616
- Where's Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

133
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:55,384
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

134
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,901
with my trained bear, Porthos.

135
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,743
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

136
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:03,145
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

137
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:06,463
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

138
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,136
- Very well.
- Very well.

139
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:10,588
Now...

140
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,958
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

141
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:22,597
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

142
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:27,238
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

143
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:33,507
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

144
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,980
- What did you bring me over here for?
- Peter.

145
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:41,919
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

146
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:46,416
Come on, darling.

147
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,628
"Just a dog"? "Just"?

148
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,790
Porthos, don't listen to him.

149
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:54,761
Porthos dreams of being a bear

150
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:59,566
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog"?

151
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,745
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

152
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:06,022
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

153
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:10,721
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

154
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,159
"Just."

155
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:21,303
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

156
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,110
Peter, where are your manners?

157
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:28,048
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

158
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,836
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

159
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:38,002
I can turn around right now and see...

160
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:40,071
the great bear, Porthos.

161
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,659
Dance with me.

162
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:49,229
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

163
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,358
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

164
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,578
Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

165
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,851
Perhaps.

166
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,922
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- Bye.

167
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,257
Bye.

168
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:06,781
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?
- I've seen better.

169
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,863
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

170
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:12,929
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

171
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,955
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

172
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,187
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

173
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,805
- What's her name?
- Sylvia. Um...

174
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:27,684
Mrs... something Davies.

175
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,017
Llewelyn Davies?

176
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,419
- You know her?
- I know who she is, of course.

177
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:38,078
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

178
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,416
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

179
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:49,489
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

180
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:52,575
Oh, yes. He died.

181
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:56,162
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

182
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,823
That's horrible.

183
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:04,296
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

184
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:08,572
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

185
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,078
James.

186
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:20,516
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we?

187
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:25,123
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

188
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:29,457
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

189
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,440
- What are you writing about?
- Oh.

190
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:49,079
Nothing of any great consequence.

191
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,879
I can't write.

192
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,916
Have you ever kept a journal?

193
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,851
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

194
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,956
Well, then how do you know?

195
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:07,234
I know. That's all.

196
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:11,739
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys?

197
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:15,742
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

198
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:22,343
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

199
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:27,167
I should leave you to your writing.

200
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,744
Peter.

201
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,043
I'll see you later then.

202
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:49,163
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?
You knew it wasn't any good.

203
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,703
Why didn't you tell me. James?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

204
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:57,378
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

205
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:01,621
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

206
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,352
- Won't you?
- We'll see.

207
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:09,390
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

208
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:14,292
- Lower.
- Easy does it. Take your time.

209
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,472
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

210
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:27,340
You know what happened, James?
They changed it.

211
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:32,242
- They changed what?
- The critics.

212
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,382
They made it important.

213
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,695
Hm?

214
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,857
What's it called?

215
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:49,987
What's it called?

216
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,706
- "Play."
- "Play."

217
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,816
Bang, bang, bang!

218
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,934
Bang!

219
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,176
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.

220
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,544
Our people teach boy lndian ways,
make him great warrior.

221
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:20,731
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

222
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,978
Bang, bang, bang!

223
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,856
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

224
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:33,368
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

225
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:37,710
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

226
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,420
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

227
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:42,456
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

228
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:45,119
Listen to us, boy.
This lnjun kidnapped you.

229
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:49,630
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

230
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:54,432
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

231
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:57,220
You are not my father.

232
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,184
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

233
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,988
- I've got him!
- Let me go!

234
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,461
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

235
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:07,644
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

236
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,510
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

237
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,361
- Stop it, you two. Get off!
- Don't.

238
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,383
- Jack!
- Stop it!

239
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:17,499
- Get off, George!
- Peter.

240
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:23,912
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

241
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,795
I'm afraid it might have been.

242
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,902
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

243
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:32,495
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

244
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:36,307
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

245
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:40,311
Peter's a different boy
since his father died.

246
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:44,314
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

247
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:48,114
Well, grief affects us all
in different ways, doesn't it?

248
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,649
Yes, it does.

249
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:56,224
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

250
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,408
Your mother as well.

251
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,334
Oh.

252
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,202
How kind. That would be lovely.

253
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:08,985
Well...

254
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,212
Don't you all look
lovely in your little suits?

255
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:18,049
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

256
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,053
How kind of you to say so.

257
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:24,582
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

258
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,393
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

259
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:35,468
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

260
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,822
if I could just find the time.

261
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:42,725
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

262
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:45,829
At the moment I am running
two households.

263
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,162
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

264
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,359
Mother.

265
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,331
My house is quite large enough for us all,

266
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:55,567
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

267
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,942
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

268
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:02,546
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

269
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:08,008
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

270
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:13,089
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

271
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:18,254
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

272
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:23,933
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it?

273
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:26,401
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

274
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:29,096
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

275
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,506
Fingers like sausages.

276
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:34,033
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

277
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:37,912
But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

278
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,520
James.

279
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:48,339
Please.

280
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:51,061
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

281
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,791
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Bye.

282
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:56,625
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,563
Well, that was a disaster.

284
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:09,012
Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

285
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,912
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

286
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,117
Oh, James, please.

287
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:18,452
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

288
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:23,185
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged? How do you mean?

289
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:25,493
A grown man, for heaven's sake,

290
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,428
playing all day long with children?

291
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,209
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

292
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,619
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

293
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:41,123
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

294
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:44,888
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

295
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:45,866
Surely you don't intend...

296
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,360
..to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you?

297
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,036
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:01,063
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

299
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:04,673
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

300
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,087
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

301
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:09,750
- Go on, George.
- You're going to break it, George.

302
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:12,067
- George, stop!
- I just need a bit more speed.

303
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,924
I want to do it.

304
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,856
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

305
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,842
Oh, wait.

306
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:22,498
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

307
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,563
- No, it's not heavy enough.
- I want to do it.

308
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:28,572
- You coming, Peter?
- Porthos!

309
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:30,802
It'll work this time.

310
00:22:30,828 --> 00:22:33,763
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

311
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:34,948
- Michael?
- Yeah?

312
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:38,441
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.

313
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:41,888
- Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

314
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:44,781
- Let him try, Jack.
- Now, George, you hold the kite.

315
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:45,842
George.

316
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:49,745
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

317
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:55,125
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

318
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:58,121
- Run! Run, Michael!
- Run!

319
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:02,785
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

320
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,760
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

321
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:07,262
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

322
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:09,722
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

323
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:15,881
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

324
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:19,157
Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

325
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,202
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

326
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:24,124
- Run!
- That's it!

327
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:28,134
Yes! He did it!

328
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:31,366
Keep running! Keep running!

329
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:03,402
What are you writing about now?

330
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:05,665
Oh, just making notes.

331
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:10,159
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

332
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,040
Something about the kite?

333
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,159
Now, why do you ask that?

334
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:21,822
I don't know.

335
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:26,793
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

336
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:31,655
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

337
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:36,366
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

338
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:40,696
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

339
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,385
Can we have him for supper?

340
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,751
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

341
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:55,320
You are welcome, you know.

342
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,439
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

343
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,953
Where have you been?

344
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,943
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

345
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:06,979
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

346
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:10,236
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

347
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:13,331
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

348
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,875
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

349
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:18,070
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

350
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:20,030
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

351
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:23,194
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

352
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,731
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

353
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:28,903
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

354
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,025
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow?

355
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:36,711
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

356
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,543
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

357
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,167
You can't do everything yourself.

358
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:47,620
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

359
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:50,953
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

360
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:57,134
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

361
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:01,736
And not one of you will escape.

362
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,525
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

363
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:12,710
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

364
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,817
You missed supper.

365
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:27,595
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

366
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:31,732
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

367
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:35,752
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

368
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:40,225
Is that right? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

369
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:41,861
for the occasional evening?

370
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:44,262
They don't actually have a cook.

371
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:48,600
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here?

372
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:55,184
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

373
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,925
That's very charitable of you.

374
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:02,107
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

375
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,517
And what about linen?

376
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:07,453
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

377
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:09,822
Please, Mary, stop.

378
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:15,022
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

379
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,695
My husband, for example.

380
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:21,847
We rarely see him in this house.

381
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,849
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

382
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,768
Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,
King Michael the Benevolent,

383
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,258
protector of the realm.

384
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:21,160
That scepter's made of wood.

385
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:24,322
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we?

386
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:29,930
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

387
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:32,238
The means to an end, Peter.

388
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,182
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

389
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:40,459
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

390
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:45,210
- There you go.
- What's this?

391
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:50,833
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

392
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,589
Open it.

393
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,621
"The Boy Castaways."

394
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:03,160
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

395
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:08,141
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

396
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:11,134
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

397
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:14,197
Stab him, George. You can do it.

398
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:17,276
I still have no idea what to write.

399
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:20,128
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

400
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:23,069
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale?

401
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:29,221
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

402
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:36,375
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

403
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,685
- A play?
- A play indeed, yes.

404
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:42,414
And I would be extremely honored

405
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:46,863
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

406
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,694
I don't know what to say.

407
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,526
Say yes.

408
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:54,437
Good man.

409
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:56,531
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

410
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:59,642
I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

411
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:04,546
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

412
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,793
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

413
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:11,137
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

414
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:14,265
They always wake up a day older.

415
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,500
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

416
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,546
Their father would have been horrified.

417
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,742
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

418
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,297
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

419
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:29,545
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

420
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:22,601
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

421
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:26,894
Especially Peter.

422
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:31,675
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

423
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,252
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

424
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:41,720
when they lose someone.

425
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:49,541
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

426
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,578
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

427
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,082
James, I'm so sorry.

428
00:31:57,094 --> 00:32:00,996
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

429
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:03,123
Aye.

430
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:06,467
She didn't get out of bed for months.

431
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,204
She wouldn't eat.

432
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,587
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

433
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:16,261
she only wanted David.

434
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:17,990
So...

435
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:20,208
one day...

436
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:24,295
I dressed myself in David's clothing

437
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:29,091
and I went to her.

438
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:32,289
You must have frightened her to death.

439
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:38,281
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

440
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:45,950
And that was the end of the boy James.

441
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:51,346
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

442
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:53,366
Where?

443
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,962
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

444
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:10,281
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

445
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:12,818
Ever.

446
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:26,688
What's it like... Neverland?

447
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:32,288
One day I'll take you there.

448
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:35,519
Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy?

449
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,523
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

450
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:42,628
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

451
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,825
He is a boy who stays young forever.

452
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:48,168
James, how does anyone
stay young forever? It doesn't work.

453
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:51,034
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

454
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:56,472
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see?

455
00:33:56,473 --> 00:33:59,042
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

456
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:03,649
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

457
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,301
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

458
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:09,499
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

459
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,477
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

460
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:15,278
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

461
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:18,280
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

462
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:21,852
You know what I think I'll do? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

463
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,853
Long enough and hard enough?

464
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,393
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

465
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,257
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

466
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:32,397
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile?

467
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:34,660
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

468
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,311
Out!

469
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:42,058
How was he?

470
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,050
- Well done.
- Good show!

471
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:48,341
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

472
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:51,311
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

473
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:53,235
It's perfect actually.

474
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:55,466
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you?

475
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,037
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

476
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,368
I'm glad for you.

477
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:04,271
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

478
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:08,893
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

479
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:13,052
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

480
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:16,123
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

481
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:19,345
Very well.

482
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:22,804
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

483
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:25,545
She's a widow. And...

484
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:29,151
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

485
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,173
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

486
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,455
And why.

487
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:42,615
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil?

488
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:47,313
They're children.
They're innocent children.

489
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,768
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

490
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:53,045
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

491
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:59,451
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

492
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:02,111
Then why is no one sitting with them?

493
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,086
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

494
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:12,437
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

495
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:18,784
Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

496
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:19,937
for the summer, James?

497
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,371
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really?

498
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:25,256
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope?

499
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:28,259
- Of course. Are we in?
- Everyone in?

500
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,365
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.

501
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,625
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

502
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:51,161
Get the sheep out the way.

503
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:12,219
- Are we there yet?
- Almost. Almost there.

504
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:15,518
I can see the cottage!

505
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:36,305
- Shall we explore, Michael?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

506
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:39,342
- Come on. Follow me.
- Be careful of stinging nettles.

507
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,343
Hurry up, everyone.

508
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,955
- Would you like to see the rest of it?
- Mm. Yes.

509
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:13,385
'Ello!

510
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:16,952
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh?

511
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:20,519
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son!

512
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:27,128
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

513
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,096
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

514
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,473
- How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

515
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:39,033
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

516
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,011
Now then.

517
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,481
Now is your only chance to speak.

518
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:47,019
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

519
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:49,419
- I am!
- Not finished yet.

520
00:38:49,422 --> 00:38:52,789
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

521
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:56,259
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

522
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,565
What did you say? What are doing, son?

523
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,831
Are you giggling? On my ship?
Giggling? What did you say?

524
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,299
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy?

525
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:08,541
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

526
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,907
Cut him loose, matey.

527
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:15,275
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

528
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:18,380
And who be you, young squire?

529
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:23,955
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

530
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:24,946
Jack!

531
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:29,269
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

532
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,578
Grab a hold of that rigging.

533
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,079
- And you, lad?
- I'm Peter.

534
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:39,905
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

535
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:42,424
No. Just Peter.

536
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,876
I like my name.

537
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,311
Very well.

538
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:54,215
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

539
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:56,421
Cut him loose.

540
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:21,412
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.

541
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:22,913
What have you got...? Excuse me.

542
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,417
Mr Barrie, sir?

543
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,682
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

544
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:35,222
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?
- You're not actually the nanny.

545
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:37,121
You're a dog.

546
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,531
- What?
- A Newfound land.

547
00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:41,932
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

548
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,469
Rrr.

549
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:47,733
Oh, right.

550
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:53,103
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

551
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:57,498
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

552
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,069
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

553
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:05,100
Bit worried about this.

554
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:09,138
Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

555
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:12,072
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

556
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:16,646
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

557
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:19,581
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

558
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,684
Captain Hook, S...

559
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:25,620
Oh, hello, James.

560
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:28,521
You're out of your mind.

561
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:43,343
How were rehearsals?

562
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:48,974
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

563
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:52,385
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

564
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,928
- Hello.
- Hello.

565
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:38,850
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

566
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:43,005
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

567
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:49,039
- Can you come to the playhouse?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

568
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,005
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

569
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,337
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?

570
00:42:58,338 --> 00:43:03,037
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

571
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:07,655
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

572
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:11,917
Please don't tell them that I told you
the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

573
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:13,883
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you?

574
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:17,813
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play?

575
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:32,737
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

576
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:36,020
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

577
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:42,876
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

578
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,483
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

579
00:43:45,685 --> 00:43:48,245
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

580
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:50,432
Well, let's see it then.

581
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:56,237
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

582
00:43:56,646 --> 00:43:58,647
"One morning, just after sunrise,

583
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:02,175
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

584
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:07,669
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

585
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:10,757
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

586
00:44:10,758 --> 00:44:13,523
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

587
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:16,424
came to life and swooped down upon her."

588
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:20,981
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

589
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:23,805
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

590
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:27,970
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

591
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:32,611
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

592
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:36,182
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

593
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:41,016
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

594
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:43,955
Sylvia.

595
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:46,693
- Do you want some water?
- Mother?

596
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:50,287
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

597
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,016
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

598
00:44:58,017 --> 00:45:00,926
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

599
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:04,454
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

600
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:08,389
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

601
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:12,200
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

602
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:45,267
Get your hand flat like that.

603
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,356
Ow.

604
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,655
Then... Like that.

605
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:20,297
Come in.

606
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:32,946
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

607
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:36,746
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

608
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:40,215
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that?

609
00:46:40,226 --> 00:46:44,458
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

610
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:49,293
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

611
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:52,738
I saw what they did for my husband.

612
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:56,038
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

613
00:46:57,243 --> 00:46:59,837
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

614
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:34,069
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

615
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,998
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me!

616
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:40,147
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

617
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,288
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

618
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:47,783
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "ln just a few weeks."

619
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:50,582
And he died the next morning.

620
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:53,038
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

621
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:54,299
That was your mother's hope.

622
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,703
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

623
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:02,916
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

624
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:06,586
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

625
00:48:06,863 --> 00:48:11,391
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

626
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:17,271
I won't! I'm not blind.

627
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,015
I won't be made a fool.

628
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:23,853
What's this? Peter.

629
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:26,306
The play.

630
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:30,098
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

631
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:35,262
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it?

632
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:38,522
All because of a silly chest cold.

633
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:24,705
James.

634
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:29,175
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you?

635
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:30,312
Good evening.

636
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:36,513
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

637
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:39,310
I know how involved you've been as well.

638
00:49:39,322 --> 00:49:44,589
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

639
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:47,421
It's been a long evening, Mary.

640
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:50,265
Yes.

641
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,834
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

642
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:56,066
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time? Not so late?

643
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:58,398
That will be fine.

644
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:02,844
We'll talk then.

645
00:50:02,845 --> 00:50:05,712
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

646
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:07,577
Mr Barrie.

647
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,977
- Good night.
- Night.

648
00:50:27,003 --> 00:50:30,034
Well, aren't you going to speak?

649
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:33,066
What would you like me to say?

650
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:37,277
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

651
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,872
And then, let's see. What comes next?

652
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:45,854
"No later than you were out, James."

653
00:50:45,888 --> 00:50:48,686
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

654
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:52,008
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I?

655
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:53,737
How dare you.

656
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:58,598
This isn't one of your plays.

657
00:50:58,734 --> 00:51:02,500
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

658
00:51:04,957 --> 00:51:08,154
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

659
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:13,421
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.

660
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:40,834
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight?

661
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:45,254
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy?

662
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:48,120
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it
right in just there.

663
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:49,819
That's very tight.

664
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:52,663
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

665
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,700
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood?

666
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:57,134
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

667
00:52:57,236 --> 00:53:01,104
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

668
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:16,270
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

669
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:22,742
James.

670
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:26,645
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

671
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:30,012
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

672
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:36,240
- May I take your hat?
- That's enough, boys.

673
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:42,080
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

674
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:44,423
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

675
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:47,748
- I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

676
00:53:47,749 --> 00:53:49,750
We'll only be a few minutes.

677
00:53:50,206 --> 00:53:52,470
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden? Go on.

678
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:54,054
- Is he in trouble?
- Sh.

679
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,396
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

680
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:02,560
- Should we retire into the study?
- Why don't you join them, dear?

681
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:04,310
Very well.

682
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:09,941
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?

683
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:11,593
Certainly.

684
00:54:11,594 --> 00:54:16,657
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

685
00:54:16,658 --> 00:54:20,865
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

686
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:23,432
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

687
00:54:24,106 --> 00:54:26,191
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

688
00:54:26,192 --> 00:54:29,244
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

689
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:33,875
- You're moving in?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

690
00:54:34,116 --> 00:54:36,778
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

691
00:54:37,002 --> 00:54:39,334
without resorting to your charity.

692
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:44,000
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

693
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:48,629
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter?

694
00:54:48,764 --> 00:54:51,528
Or are you really that selfish?

695
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:54,345
I beg your pardon?

696
00:54:54,603 --> 00:54:58,699
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

697
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,838
does for a widow's future prospects?

698
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:07,422
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

699
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,756
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

700
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:18,624
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

701
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,122
I'll look after them.

702
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:25,331
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

703
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:27,131
What are you suggesting?

704
00:55:27,136 --> 00:55:31,129
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

705
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:35,189
That is precisely what I am doing.

706
00:55:57,333 --> 00:56:01,030
I was so certain what I would find in this.

707
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:06,153
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

708
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,809
I don't write love notes in my journal.

709
00:56:08,844 --> 00:56:11,278
No.

710
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,888
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

711
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:17,664
That's some comfort, actually.

712
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,250
It means I know you just a little after all.

713
00:56:21,273 --> 00:56:24,970
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

714
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,588
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

715
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:36,835
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

716
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:43,368
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

717
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:47,410
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

718
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:52,700
And I hoped, at least once...

719
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:56,991
you would take me there with you.

720
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:00,051
There is no such place.

721
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:03,640
Yes, there is.

722
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:07,277
Neverland.

723
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:12,323
It's the best you've written, James.

724
00:57:12,324 --> 00:57:16,351
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

725
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:19,873
I only wish I were part of it.

726
00:57:20,783 --> 00:57:24,412
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

727
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,540
Mary.

728
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:34,444
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

729
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:38,073
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

730
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:42,418
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James?

731
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:43,851
You were always gone.

732
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,148
I was right here.

733
00:57:45,557 --> 00:57:52,554
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

734
00:57:53,482 --> 00:57:56,144
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

735
00:57:56,235 --> 00:57:58,169
To spend with your muse?

736
00:57:58,237 --> 00:58:03,800
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

737
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:08,444
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

738
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:12,176
Of course not.

739
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:17,962
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

740
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:23,133
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

741
00:58:23,134 --> 00:58:27,305
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

742
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:30,702
then we must end this.

743
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:34,354
And I will.

744
00:58:39,411 --> 00:58:41,936
Pitiful display.

745
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:49,580
Nanny. Nanny.

746
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:52,015
What?

747
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:57,793
First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.

748
00:58:57,794 --> 00:58:59,840
With my paws?

749
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:04,243
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

750
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:08,304
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you?

751
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:11,805
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

752
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:14,337
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

753
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:17,774
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

754
00:59:20,652 --> 00:59:24,748
- Can we get him some teeth?
- He can have mine.

755
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:26,886
We'll get you teeth.

756
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:30,617
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?
- Right.

757
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:34,932
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

758
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,409
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

759
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,911
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

760
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,723
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

761
00:59:44,724 --> 00:59:48,056
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

762
00:59:48,397 --> 00:59:49,864
all dressed to the nines.

763
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:54,550
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

764
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:59,203
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians.

765
00:59:59,408 --> 01:00:02,809
I don't even know what it is.

766
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:07,245
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

767
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:09,266
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

768
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:12,428
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet?

769
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:15,867
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

770
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:17,708
- Set aside? 25?
- 25 seats.

771
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:20,405
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

772
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:22,680
- Are they paying for it?
- They're filled.

773
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:25,115
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

774
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:27,778
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.

775
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:29,484
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?

776
01:00:29,485 --> 01:00:30,917
Certainly.

777
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:34,216
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

778
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:35,785
25 scattered seats?
Who's paying for them?

779
01:00:35,786 --> 01:00:36,718
Throughout the theater.

780
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:40,688
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

781
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:42,700
Whoa. Look.

782
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:45,465
This is great. I'm flying.

783
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:49,905
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?
As long as we've got the balance down.

784
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:52,677
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

785
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:55,296
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

786
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:59,666
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

787
01:00:59,718 --> 01:01:02,881
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

788
01:01:03,088 --> 01:01:06,455
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

789
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,868
But you think it's serious?

790
01:01:10,979 --> 01:01:13,846
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

791
01:01:13,982 --> 01:01:15,813
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

792
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:18,384
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

793
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:20,571
And lately, to be quite honest,

794
01:01:20,572 --> 01:01:25,305
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

795
01:01:25,577 --> 01:01:27,841
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

796
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,277
It's Grandmother, isn't it?
She's run you off, hasn't she?

797
01:01:31,283 --> 01:01:36,482
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great
effort. And perhaps with good reason.

798
01:01:36,483 --> 01:01:39,874
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

799
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:44,244
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

800
01:01:47,766 --> 01:01:50,701
Look at that.

801
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:53,431
How magnificent.

802
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:56,566
The boy's gone.

803
01:01:58,977 --> 01:02:03,495
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

804
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:08,013
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

805
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:14,122
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

806
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:17,128
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

807
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:21,293
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened?

808
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:24,363
I think his costume is too tight.

809
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:30,040
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

810
01:02:33,428 --> 01:02:38,127
Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

811
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:42,001
OK. Flap those wings.

812
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:44,151
- There you go.
- Whoa!

813
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:47,491
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

814
01:02:47,526 --> 01:02:48,993
Give that a tug. Go on.

815
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:51,393
- Just give it a little pull.
- Can I have a go?

816
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,929
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go?

817
01:02:53,031 --> 01:02:55,022
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

818
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,660
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

819
01:02:56,868 --> 01:02:58,369
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

820
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,338
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

821
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:01,950
What are you...?

822
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,302
Ow!

823
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:13,239
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

824
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,929
- I'm so sorry.
- George?

825
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,459
Mr Barrie?

826
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:27,191
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

827
01:03:27,482 --> 01:03:29,814
No, just Mr Barrie.

828
01:03:46,051 --> 01:03:51,353
- Did you encourage this?
- Encourage what?

829
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:55,587
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

830
01:03:56,428 --> 01:04:02,697
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

831
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:07,349
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

832
01:04:07,689 --> 01:04:12,786
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

833
01:04:12,944 --> 01:04:17,745
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

834
01:04:17,746 --> 01:04:19,917
Different?

835
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:22,545
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

836
01:04:22,954 --> 01:04:25,718
That is not your concern.

837
01:04:31,346 --> 01:04:35,612
My understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious.

838
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:40,652
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

839
01:04:41,606 --> 01:04:43,096
So,

840
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:46,110
I'll have the examination,

841
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:49,239
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

842
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,947
But I don't want to know what they're for.

843
01:04:52,117 --> 01:04:56,213
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

844
01:04:57,122 --> 01:04:59,488
Wouldn't dream of it.

845
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:20,319
Mary?

846
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,494
Mary?

847
01:05:45,587 --> 01:05:48,488
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

848
01:05:48,673 --> 01:05:51,972
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?
- Yes, Mother.

849
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:55,772
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked?

850
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:58,209
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please?

851
01:05:58,517 --> 01:05:59,745
Yes, Mother.

852
01:06:00,018 --> 01:06:02,452
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you?

853
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:06,218
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

854
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:08,225
- With the children?
- George!

855
01:06:08,226 --> 01:06:11,456
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please?

856
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:14,687
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

857
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:19,795
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

858
01:06:19,796 --> 01:06:22,070
Wait here, don't move.

859
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:59,592
Take her feet, George.

860
01:07:01,746 --> 01:07:04,112
We'll need some more blankets.

861
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:08,302
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

862
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:15,071
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

863
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:18,345
Sh, Michael.

864
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:21,338
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
- No, sir. Not yet.

865
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:23,817
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats?

866
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:25,341
- Yes, sir.
- Charles.

867
01:07:25,353 --> 01:07:27,412
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James?

868
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:29,319
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening?

869
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,321
The 25 seats, are they filled?

870
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:32,220
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

871
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:35,587
Who did you invite? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

872
01:07:35,614 --> 01:07:38,174
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

873
01:07:38,175 --> 01:07:39,743
- Charles?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

874
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:41,847
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening?

875
01:07:41,848 --> 01:07:42,609
No, sir.

876
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:46,686
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

877
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,551
Yes, you do, dear.

878
01:07:50,462 --> 01:07:53,522
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

879
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:57,458
Peter will be here if you need anything.

880
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:05,136
Peter.

881
01:08:05,477 --> 01:08:07,536
Peter.

882
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,852
Can I do anything, Mother?

883
01:08:18,023 --> 01:08:20,116
No, darling.

884
01:08:21,526 --> 01:08:23,858
You must go to the play.

885
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:29,126
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

886
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:31,559
I need you to.

887
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:36,739
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

888
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,375
Please.

889
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:41,436
It's only a play, Mother.

890
01:08:41,437 --> 01:08:44,280
It doesn't matter.

891
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,034
What do you want?

892
01:08:51,272 --> 01:08:54,070
Take it out.

893
01:08:56,277 --> 01:08:59,041
Open it.

894
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:11,456
I've never been so proud of you.

895
01:09:24,806 --> 01:09:27,707
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

896
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:30,585
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

897
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:34,576
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

898
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:47,861
- Charles.
- What?

899
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:51,821
- They're here.
- Who's here?

900
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:58,464
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

901
01:09:58,465 --> 01:10:00,603
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

902
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,467
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

903
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:04,277
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

904
01:10:04,379 --> 01:10:08,543
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

905
01:10:08,883 --> 01:10:10,942
You can start your play now.

906
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,944
Your play.

907
01:10:17,942 --> 01:10:20,911
Get them in the scattered seats.

908
01:10:36,044 --> 01:10:39,172
Just there, boys.

909
01:11:10,612 --> 01:11:13,706
Excuse me, sir. This way.

910
01:11:13,707 --> 01:11:15,674
Thank you.

911
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:19,211
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

912
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:24,081
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

913
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,355
Thanks.

914
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,956
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

915
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:31,438
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

916
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,994
Two minutes more.

917
01:12:33,995 --> 01:12:36,429
Please. One minute more.

918
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:41,582
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

919
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,185
Who are you?

920
01:12:55,767 --> 01:13:00,466
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

921
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:03,706
My children.

922
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:08,325
- How is she?
- She's resting.

923
01:13:08,529 --> 01:13:10,397
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.

924
01:13:10,398 --> 01:13:13,390
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

925
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:15,846
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

926
01:13:15,847 --> 01:13:16,954
And since, as I've discovered,

927
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:20,948
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

928
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:24,284
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

929
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:25,204
But you can't...

930
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:29,107
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

931
01:13:29,108 --> 01:13:31,278
This isn't your home. It's our home.

932
01:13:31,586 --> 01:13:33,554
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

933
01:13:33,588 --> 01:13:35,852
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

934
01:13:35,853 --> 01:13:38,252
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

935
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,959
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

936
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,023
There's nothing you can do about it.

937
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:50,946
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?

938
01:13:53,358 --> 01:13:55,859
James.

939
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,624
No. Your play.

940
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:04,368
Look at all this.

941
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:06,667
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

942
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,999
- Mother, you need to rest.
- l still have things to do here.

943
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:13,927
See? This needs mending.

944
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:17,455
Four boys, no end of patches.

945
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:20,265
Can't seem to keep up.

946
01:14:21,386 --> 01:14:24,219
I haven't the time for all this.

947
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:30,893
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

948
01:14:32,697 --> 01:14:38,192
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please? Thank you.

949
01:14:57,972 --> 01:15:00,702
They can see it, you know.

950
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:04,376
You can't go on just pretending.

951
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,415
"Just pretending"?

952
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:14,421
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

953
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:19,050
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

954
01:15:19,051 --> 01:15:21,484
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

955
01:15:21,496 --> 01:15:24,727
But the things that matter.

956
01:15:25,783 --> 01:15:32,347
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

957
01:15:37,295 --> 01:15:44,428
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

958
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:50,171
And even if it isn't true,

959
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:53,994
even if that can never be...

960
01:15:56,531 --> 01:15:59,466
I need to go on pretending.

961
01:16:01,536 --> 01:16:03,663
Until the end.

962
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,133
With you.

963
01:16:09,043 --> 01:16:13,377
- Oh, I am sweet.
- How do you do it?

964
01:16:13,714 --> 01:16:18,276
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

965
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:26,701
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

966
01:16:30,598 --> 01:16:34,534
Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.

967
01:16:34,602 --> 01:16:37,901
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

968
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:50,107
Now try. Try it from the beds.

969
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:54,604
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

970
01:16:56,257 --> 01:16:59,420
- I flew!
- How ripping!

971
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:01,986
Now join hands.

972
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:08,884
- Look at me!
- I do like it!

973
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:14,271
- Bravo!
- Let's go out.

974
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:18,545
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

975
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:20,911
Genius.

976
01:17:24,735 --> 01:17:29,604
- Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

977
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:33,369
It's been a bad day, that's all.

978
01:17:34,745 --> 01:17:37,714
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

979
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:40,250
Find Peter.

980
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:44,312
- Of course.
- Thank you.

981
01:17:47,758 --> 01:17:51,888
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

982
01:17:52,763 --> 01:17:54,856
No.

983
01:17:56,767 --> 01:17:58,268
Well,

984
01:17:58,269 --> 01:18:01,500
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

985
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:04,999
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

986
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:08,518
Aye. That I did.

987
01:18:09,664 --> 01:18:13,100
It's a bit late for it
tonight though, I'm afraid.

988
01:18:14,702 --> 01:18:18,160
Perhaps some time soon though?

989
01:18:25,096 --> 01:18:27,597
Most definitely.

990
01:18:27,598 --> 01:18:32,831
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?
- Look how the water is rising.

991
01:18:36,107 --> 01:18:39,609
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

992
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:44,946
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

993
01:18:46,117 --> 01:18:50,679
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?
- Both of us.

994
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:54,955
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

995
01:18:54,956 --> 01:18:57,719
I won't go without you, Peter.

996
01:18:58,129 --> 01:19:00,689
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

997
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:03,623
And you a lady? Never.

998
01:19:06,637 --> 01:19:08,195
Ready, Wendy?

999
01:19:08,196 --> 01:19:10,107
Peter!

1000
01:19:10,141 --> 01:19:12,609
Don't let go, Wendy.

1001
01:19:12,643 --> 01:19:15,111
Peter, I'm frightened.

1002
01:19:15,146 --> 01:19:18,013
Hang on, Wendy!

1003
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,151
Peter!

1004
01:19:21,152 --> 01:19:24,986
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

1005
01:19:41,422 --> 01:19:43,982
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

1006
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:49,055
I've never missed an opening.

1007
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:51,022
So I...

1008
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:54,958
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

1009
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:56,835
Yes.

1010
01:19:57,938 --> 01:20:00,270
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

1011
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:10,678
How are you?

1012
01:20:14,955 --> 01:20:17,822
I'm all right.

1013
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:20,449
How are you?

1014
01:20:21,462 --> 01:20:24,192
I'm sorry.

1015
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:29,663
Don't be.

1016
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:35,135
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

1017
01:20:35,136 --> 01:20:37,569
You need them.

1018
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:47,318
Goodbye.

1019
01:20:58,616 --> 01:21:00,948
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

1020
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:05,487
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

1021
01:21:05,488 --> 01:21:08,717
Very kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening?

1022
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:10,126
Oh.

1023
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:12,994
I'm afraid he's left us.

1024
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:16,122
And he would so have loved this evening.

1025
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:18,624
The pirates and the lndians.

1026
01:21:19,136 --> 01:21:23,004
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

1027
01:21:23,005 --> 01:21:25,370
To the very end.

1028
01:21:25,643 --> 01:21:28,908
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

1029
01:21:29,146 --> 01:21:33,032
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

1030
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:38,300
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

1031
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:43,556
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right?

1032
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:47,570
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

1033
01:21:47,581 --> 01:21:51,039
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

1034
01:21:51,085 --> 01:21:54,612
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

1035
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:59,924
- Was that Mr Barrie?
- That was Mr Barrie.

1036
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:02,858
Well done, Mr Barrie.

1037
01:22:03,097 --> 01:22:05,930
- Good show.
- Well done.

1038
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:12,103
Psst.

1039
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:14,416
What did you think?

1040
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:17,878
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?
- It is.

1041
01:22:17,912 --> 01:22:20,107
- About all of us.
- That's right.

1042
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:24,612
Did you like it?

1043
01:22:24,919 --> 01:22:27,615
It's magical. Thank you.

1044
01:22:27,922 --> 01:22:30,322
Oh, thank you.

1045
01:22:30,424 --> 01:22:32,221
Thank you, Peter.

1046
01:22:32,426 --> 01:22:36,522
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.
- Really?

1047
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:40,389
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

1048
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:43,581
Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

1049
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:47,380
But I'm not Peter Pan.

1050
01:22:47,558 --> 01:22:49,992
He is.

1051
01:23:00,404 --> 01:23:05,068
And there's been no improvement
since my last visit?

1052
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:06,968
No.

1053
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:15,791
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

1054
01:23:18,255 --> 01:23:20,519
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

1055
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:24,872
Excuse me a moment.

1056
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:32,774
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you?

1057
01:23:32,853 --> 01:23:35,083
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

1058
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:37,908
Would have proved me wrong about him.

1059
01:23:37,942 --> 01:23:39,807
Of course, with the success of his play,

1060
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,221
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

1061
01:23:47,868 --> 01:23:50,029
I'm sorry, dear.

1062
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:56,876
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

1063
01:23:56,877 --> 01:23:59,937
- Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

1064
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,608
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment?

1065
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:05,863
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?

1066
01:24:05,936 --> 01:24:10,464
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

1067
01:24:19,316 --> 01:24:23,184
- What have you been up to?
- Just wait and see.

1068
01:24:31,712 --> 01:24:33,630
It's a play.

1069
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:37,499
It's not just a play, Michael.
It's the play.

1070
01:24:38,669 --> 01:24:42,036
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

1071
01:24:42,673 --> 01:24:44,674
Much of it will have to be imagined.

1072
01:24:44,675 --> 01:24:48,042
- As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

1073
01:24:55,986 --> 01:24:59,444
Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

1074
01:25:03,327 --> 01:25:05,761
When you're ready.

1075
01:25:31,805 --> 01:25:34,399
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

1076
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:39,959
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

1077
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:43,693
- You know fairies, Peter?
- Yes.

1078
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:46,942
But they're nearly all dead now.

1079
01:25:46,954 --> 01:25:51,653
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

1080
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:56,089
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

1081
01:25:56,246 --> 01:25:58,247
and that was the beginning of fairies.

1082
01:25:58,248 --> 01:26:03,686
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

1083
01:26:03,754 --> 01:26:07,053
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

1084
01:26:07,257 --> 01:26:10,351
- Ought to be? lsn't there?
- Oh, no.

1085
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:14,989
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

1086
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:18,595
And every time a child says,
"l don't believe in fairies,"

1087
01:26:18,852 --> 01:26:22,083
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

1088
01:26:25,743 --> 01:26:28,837
Who is that?

1089
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,908
The redskins were defeated?

1090
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:37,428
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates?

1091
01:26:37,504 --> 01:26:40,405
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

1092
01:26:42,543 --> 01:26:45,273
Oh, that's just my medicine.

1093
01:26:45,712 --> 01:26:49,739
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

1094
01:26:51,802 --> 01:26:55,499
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

1095
01:26:57,608 --> 01:27:00,577
It was poisoned.

1096
01:27:01,612 --> 01:27:04,945
And you drank it to save my life?

1097
01:27:06,817 --> 01:27:08,978
Tink.

1098
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,153
Are you dying?

1099
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:19,595
Her light is growing faint.

1100
01:27:21,165 --> 01:27:25,158
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

1101
01:27:27,387 --> 01:27:31,084
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

1102
01:27:31,085 --> 01:27:34,850
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1103
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:37,628
if children believed in fairies.

1104
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:47,240
Do you believe in fairies?

1105
01:27:48,742 --> 01:27:52,007
Say quick that you believe.

1106
01:27:54,698 --> 01:27:57,758
If you believe, clap your hands.

1107
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:02,582
Clap louder.

1108
01:28:07,594 --> 01:28:10,688
Thank you. Thank you.

1109
01:28:53,924 --> 01:28:56,586
That is Neverland.

1110
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,858
So many perfect days.

1111
01:30:24,064 --> 01:30:28,728
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

1112
01:30:29,069 --> 01:30:31,320
Oh, stop it.

1113
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:34,484
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

1114
01:30:35,325 --> 01:30:38,694
She had a husband. My father.

1115
01:30:38,695 --> 01:30:42,256
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

1116
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:46,544
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

1117
01:30:46,953 --> 01:30:49,888
I could never do that.

1118
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,239
You'd best let him go.

1119
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:07,051
George, would you take the boys back
to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

1120
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:09,500
Go on, dear.

1121
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,077
I'm terribly sorry.

1122
01:31:19,953 --> 01:31:23,389
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

1123
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,992
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

1124
01:31:25,993 --> 01:31:30,293
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

1125
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:33,898
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

1126
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:37,164
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

1127
01:31:37,504 --> 01:31:43,773
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

1128
01:31:45,262 --> 01:31:49,130
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

1129
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:52,929
but I loved your daughter very much.

1130
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,636
And I love those boys.

1131
01:31:55,772 --> 01:31:57,831
And I think they need me right now.

1132
01:31:57,832 --> 01:31:59,775
Is that so?

1133
01:31:59,776 --> 01:32:02,006
And for how long after?

1134
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,247
Meaning what?

1135
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:10,584
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

1136
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:15,315
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

1137
01:32:17,794 --> 01:32:23,164
- And what do you have to say about that?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

1138
01:32:23,165 --> 01:32:27,867
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

1139
01:32:29,606 --> 01:32:31,574
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

1140
01:32:31,608 --> 01:32:37,012
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

1141
01:32:37,114 --> 01:32:40,242
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

1142
01:32:49,626 --> 01:32:51,821
Sit down, Peter.

1143
01:33:12,149 --> 01:33:15,607
Mother pasted it back together

1144
01:33:15,608 --> 01:33:17,734
after I ruined it.

1145
01:33:18,905 --> 01:33:20,906
And then I saw the play.

1146
01:33:20,907 --> 01:33:25,776
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

1147
01:33:27,414 --> 01:33:30,679
She would be very pleased to know that.

1148
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:38,653
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

1149
01:33:39,926 --> 01:33:42,121
and I'm staying.

1150
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:44,863
For good.

1151
01:33:47,434 --> 01:33:50,028
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

1152
01:33:51,188 --> 01:33:53,247
Don't worry.

1153
01:33:56,693 --> 01:33:59,695
It's just...

1154
01:33:59,696 --> 01:34:02,995
I thought she'd always be here.

1155
01:34:04,868 --> 01:34:06,927
So did I.

1156
01:34:08,872 --> 01:34:11,067
But, in fact...

1157
01:34:13,743 --> 01:34:16,128
she is.

1158
01:34:16,129 --> 01:34:21,294
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

1159
01:34:22,669 --> 01:34:25,866
You'll always have her there. Always.

1160
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:35,274
But why did she have to die?

1161
01:34:42,405 --> 01:34:44,669
I don't know, boy.

1162
01:34:49,162 --> 01:34:51,722
When I think of your mother...

1163
01:34:52,666 --> 01:34:55,692
I will always remember
how happy she looked

1164
01:34:55,693 --> 01:34:57,899
sitting there in the parlor,

1165
01:34:58,038 --> 01:35:00,905
watching a play about her family.

1166
01:35:00,924 --> 01:35:04,860
About her boys that never grew up.

1167
01:35:08,131 --> 01:35:10,599
She went to Neverland.

1168
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:18,039
And you can visit her any time you like

1169
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:21,008
if you just go there yourself.

1170
01:35:23,146 --> 01:35:26,148
How?

1171
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:29,312
By believing, Peter.

1172
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,643
Just believe.

1173
01:35:44,968 --> 01:35:47,402
I can see her.
