1
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,241
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,478
<i>there was a brave little mouse</i>

3
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,250
<i>who loved honor and justice</i>
<i>and always told the truth.</i>

4
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,567
<i>No, that's not him.</i>

5
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,742
<i>That's a rat.</i>

6
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,202
<i>And anyone who knows anything,</i>

7
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,838
<i>knows there's a big difference</i>
<i>between a mouse and a rat.</i>

8
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,938
Ohhh.

9
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,007
<i>First of all,
rats hate the light.</i>

10
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,281
<i>They spend their
lives in the darkness.</i>

11
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,885
<i>They're also terrified of people,</i>

12
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,085
<i>which is why they slink</i>
<i>and cower all the time.</i>

13
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,218
Ooh!

14
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,757
<i>And as far as telling
the truth is concerned,</i>

15
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,628
<i>well, that's impossible</i>
<i>because, as everyone knows,</i>

16
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,797
<i>a rat can't talk.</i>

17
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,460
Tell me that thing again, please.

18
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,133
Come on.

19
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,104
Just once, I promise.

20
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,301
Tell me one more time,

21
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,071
and I won't ask you ever again. I swear.

22
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,248
Fine. We are headed to Dor,

23
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,114
one of the most
magical places in the whole world.

24
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,743
No, that's not what you said before.

25
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,380
You know, every place
has something special.

26
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,924
And, in Dor, it's the soup!

27
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,754
Land ho!

28
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,989
Ohhh.

29
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,566
It's down below, I tell you.

30
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,659
Give it a heave.

31
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,241
I can see it!

32
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,409
Ooh, I can smell it! I can smell it.

33
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,281
Oh, I can't wait
to taste the soup!

34
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,082
Just stay close.

35
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,422
We leave again at 6:00.

36
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,328
You know, we ought to think
about staying here just a little longer.

37
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,422
Don't even think about it.

38
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,758
Remember Shanghai?

39
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,427
Yeah, but this place is different.

40
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,805
I mean, this is special.

41
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,038
<i>On any given day,</i>
<i>just one whiff from one of the soup shops</i>

42
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,545
<i>was almost like
having a full meal.</i>

43
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,150
<i>But on one very
special day every year,</i>

44
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,187
<i>the kingdom of Dor</i>
<i>was magically transformed.</i>

45
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,848
<i>In Dor, Christmas was nothing.</i>

46
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,517
<i>Well, they still celebrated it,</i>

47
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,323
<i>but it was nothing
compared to Soup Day.</i>

48
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,392
Watch it, watch it.

49
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,368
Incoming potatoes!

50
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,200
Hurry! Hurry! Excuse us.

51
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,367
<i>Every Dorian, young and old,</i>
<i>would flock toward the castle</i>

52
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,502
<i>because they knew that,
at that very moment,</i>

53
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,207
<i>deep within the royal kitchens,</i>

54
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,181
<i>a masterpiece was being created.</i>

55
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,014
Potatoes coming up!

56
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,485
Let's go!

57
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,585
Don't forget the parsley!

58
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,363
Make sure it's clean!

59
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,569
<i>Everyone knew</i>
<i>Chef Andre was a genius,</i>

60
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:49,046
<i>but they got reminded of it</i>
<i>on the first Sunday of every spring.</i>

61
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,215
<i>At exactly 12:00 noon,</i>

62
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,722
<i>he would unveil that
year's royal creation.</i>

63
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,862
More onions!

64
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,961
More onions!

65
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,095
More onions!

66
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,264
More onions!

67
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,876
<i>They would jam the town square,</i>

68
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,242
<i>and, as the aroma began to build,</i>

69
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,440
<i>so did their anticipation.</i>

70
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,984
- Ohhh!
- Ow!

71
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,110
Sorry.

72
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,620
Wow.

73
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,458
Thank you.

74
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:47,637
It's my pleasure to announce
this year's royal creations

75
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,205
from the kitchens of Chef Andre.

76
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,972
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

77
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,545
Something is wrong.

78
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,240
I need more time!

79
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,609
But we're late already!

80
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,308
This is not right!

81
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,943
Everyone out!

82
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,412
Out!

83
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,555
<i>Now, it's hard to</i>
<i>be a genius all by yourself.</i>

84
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,897
<i>In fact, sometimes,
it takes a little help.</i>

85
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,690
You changed something.

86
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,119
You're crazy. I did not touch it.

87
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,287
- I can smell it.
- Hmm?

88
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,454
- What's this?
- What?

89
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,157
- This!
- Ow! Garlic.

90
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,759
- Garlic.
- Yeah, a little garlic.

91
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,925
- It was already there.
- No.

92
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,026
- Yes.
- No.

93
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,195
- Yes.
- Not this much!

94
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,329
Ow!

95
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,531
You ruined my soup!

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,039
I save your soup!

97
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:01,136
Those people wait all year,
and you want to give them this dishwater.

98
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,178
Dishwater?

99
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,510
Dishwater.

100
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,675
Dishwater?

101
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,877
Ow! Cut it out!

102
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,820
And this year's soup is

103
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,829
a spring tureen

104
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,625
with a <i>mélange</i>
of roasted vegetables...

105
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,722
Oh.

106
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,561
...fresh herbs...
- Mmm!

107
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,328
...and wild mushrooms.

108
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,528
Oh.

109
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,466
Roscuro?

110
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,076
Roscuro?

111
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,475
Oh. Evening.

112
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,921
I don't have to stand here
and listen to a big talking garbage can!

113
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,718
Ha! And I don't have
to stand here and listen to a coward!

114
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,584
- Coward?
- Yes, a coward!

115
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,525
- You call me coward?
- Yes!

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,067
Oh, no!

117
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,076
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

118
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,745
That did it.

119
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,890
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

120
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,627
Mmm!

121
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,862
<i>- Bellissima!</i>
- It's <i>fantastique!</i>

122
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,904
Roscuro! Roscuro, where are you?

123
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,267
Ohhh.

124
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,890
Whoa!

125
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>Voilà!</i>

126
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,080
This is amazing!

127
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,018
Wait till
Your Highness tastes it.

128
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,318
Hmm?

129
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,538
This is...

130
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,666
Whoa!

131
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,767
...absolutely...

132
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,813
Oh, it moved! My soup moved!

133
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,178
No, it isn't... It did not move.

134
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,047
Oh, Your Highness.

135
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,212
- Ahhh!
- Darling?

136
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,314
Oh! A rat! There's a rat in my soup!

137
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,019
Madam, I know that this is unfortunate.

138
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,288
And I know that
while on first glance, I might...

139
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,489
- A rat! In my soup!
- No. Please. Shh, shh, shh.

140
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,657
- And I ate it!
- Your Highness, hold on...

141
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,665
- Uh-oh.
- She's right! It's a rat!

142
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,963
- Please...
- Ahhh! It's a rat!

143
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,866
Get me that rat!

144
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,905
Now, I really believe
you're jumping to conclusions.

145
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,903
And I'm sure that the
rats you met last time

146
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,209
might have caused you
to create a stereotype,

147
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,874
but... But I... But...

148
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,215
It's just... I'm just...
I'm not really from around here.

149
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,049
I'm... I'm from... Oh...

150
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,214
Oh!

151
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,756
That's very aggressive.

152
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,383
Get him!

153
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,551
Kitchen...

154
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,923
He's going into the kitchen!

155
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,323
Oh!

156
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,295
Over there!

157
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,133
Stop that rat!

158
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,137
Whoa!

159
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,969
I got him!

160
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,137
Uh-oh.

161
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,715
He's going near the soup!

162
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,083
There he is!

163
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,228
lf... If I could just tell...

164
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,597
On the kettle!
That's him, right there!

165
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,027
Look, up there!

166
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,112
Sweetie? Darling?

167
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,075
She's... She's...

168
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,216
She's...

169
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,586
Blimey, she's dead. Get him!

170
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,423
Don't let him escape!

171
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,759
We'll get you, you rowdy rat!

172
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,526
Oh!

173
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,562
No, no, no!

174
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,368
No, not there!

175
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,163
You don't need to be afraid.

176
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,341
I know it's dark,
but you'll get used to it.

177
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,840
Who... Who are you?

178
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,943
Just a rat, like you.

179
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,049
Come with me.

180
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,330
<i>When something hurts
this much, there must be a reason.</i>

181
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,499
<i>There must be someone to blame.</i>

182
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,140
"From this moment on, soup,

183
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:46,742
"the making of soup,
the selling of soup, or the eating of soup,

184
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,182

185
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,564
"Rats are to be

00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,331

190
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,847
<i>So think about this.</i>

191
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,719
<i>What happens when you make something</i>
<i>illegal that is just a natural part of the world?</i>

192
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,583
<i>You may as well
make flies illegal.</i>

193
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,888
<i>Or sweat. Or Monday morning.</i>

194
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,254
<i>But that's what the King did</i>
<i>out of a terrible sadness.</i>

195
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,064
<i>Sunlight left and
the world went gray.</i>

196
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,435
<i>Colors faded into each other and</i>
<i>dark clouds filled the sky.</i>

197
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,643
<i>And for a long time,
it wouldn't rain.</i>

198
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:02,283
<i>The clouds just stayed</i>
<i>and stayed and stayed.</i>

199
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,435
I wish it would rain.

200
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,664
You and the whole world, madam.

201
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,667
Ow!

202
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:19,903
Oh, sorry, milady!

203
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,104
Well, at least I can still feel that.

204
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,178
Louise, do you think
there's a bit of light

205
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,982
somewhere in the world?

206
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,616
Don't know, ma'am.

207
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,319
I think there is.

208
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,923
You just need to know where to find it.

209
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,476
<i>Okay, remember</i>
<i>when we told you how,</i>

210
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,446
<i>once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was this brave little mouse?</i>

211
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,076
<i>Well, if you know
anything about fairytales,</i>

212
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,350
<i>you know that a
hero doesn't appear</i>

213
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,754
<i>until the world really needs one.</i>

214
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,832
Oh, look out!

215
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,137
Alms for the blind! Alms for the blind!

216
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,576
Excuse me. Excuse me.

217
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,515
Excuse me.

218
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,350
Excuse me.

219
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,521
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

220
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,817
- Tilling?
- Oh!

221
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,886
Mr. Mayor, hello!

222
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,152
Where are you going?

223
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,061
Oh, well,
my baby is having a...

224
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,258
No, my wife is having a...

225
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,494
Oh, right. Congratulations.

226
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,101
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

227
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,037
I'm sorry, I... I really... Goodbye.

228
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,711
His eyes are open.

229
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,184
Don't worry about it.

230
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,948
Sometimes they are.

231
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,579
But he isn't cowering.

232
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,521
He's looking right at us.

233
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,026
Don't worry. He'll learn to cower.

234
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,224
They all do in time.

235
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,621
But he isn't!

236
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,772
Wow! He's so puny!
And look at those ears!

237
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,244
<i> And, from the very beginning,</i>

238
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,542
<i>Despereaux Tilling heard more,</i>

239
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,415
<i>saw more and even smelled more</i>
<i>than any of the other mice.</i>

240
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,158
Despereaux, don't do it.

241
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,598
Don't look. Don't look!

242
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,764
I won't, I won't.

243
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,972
Mmm.

244
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,483
<i>Despereaux Tilling</i>
<i>had no idea he was small.</i>

245
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,112
<i>He wasn't just small
in human terms.</i>

246
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,758
<i>He was small even for a mouse.</i>

247
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,587
<i>But, to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>he didn't even notice.</i>

248
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,163
<i>In fact, in his own mind,</i>
<i>Despereaux was a giant.</i>

249
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,807
We're worried about him.

250
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,972
He doesn't scurry. He doesn't cower.

251
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,312
At first, we thought he would
grow out of it, but...

252
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,317
Well, he scurries sometimes.

253
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,716
But not when he's scared!

254
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,844
He just does it for fun.

255
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,479
And he never cowers.

256
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,682
We've showed him how, but he...

257
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,282
Well, some kids are slower than others.

258
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,487
He'll cower in time. We'll work on it.

259
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,122
- Yes, but...
- It'll be fine, I promise.

260
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,732
All right, settle down.

261
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,802
Ready, class?

262
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,835
Good.

263
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,669
Mmm! Ah!

264
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,340
Good. Excellent.

265
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,192
- Despereaux!
- Yes?

266
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,355
You didn't cower.

267
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,022
Looks like a sword.

268
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,590
It's a carving knife.

269
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,897
It's beautiful!

270
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,495
It's dangerous.

271
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,831
Do you have anymore?

272
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,703
Despereaux, what are you doing?

273
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,271
We're not even supposed to be here.

274
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,941
That's the dungeon.

275
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,450
They have rats down there.

276
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,042
And they'll eat you.

277
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,021
And pull your arms off!

278
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,054
How far down is it?

279
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,561
I don't know. No one's ever come back.

280
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,893
How come?

281
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,433
'Cause... 'Cause...

282
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,262
'Cause that's where
you go when you get...

283
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,802
When you get...

284
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,098
Banished.

285
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,437
What do you get banished for?

286
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,038
Oh, you know.

287
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,371
- Rules and...
- Breaking.

288
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,739
- We can't even...
- Talk about it...

289
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,904
- Because...
- That's one of the...

290
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,638
Rules!

291
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,783
Despereaux!

292
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,821
I just want to have a quick look.

293
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,888
We got to get out of here!

294
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,154
Oh, gosh.
- Oh, no.

295
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,388
Oh, jeez.

296
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,623
Uh-oh.

297
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,676
Despereaux! You can't feed them.

298
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,785
Hello?

299
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,590
Here you go, whoever you are.

300
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,264
Nice.

301
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,502
You are crazy!

302
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,041
What I say? I said nothing!

303
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,542
Well, you heard exactly what I said.

304
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,202
- I say you crazy.
- No, no, no, no!

305
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,826
Hurry!

306
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,344
Ha! They look hungry, sir.

307
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,674
Mmm-hmm.

308
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,781
Dinnertime.

309
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,528
You're not eating.

310
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,969
Uh, I was.

311
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,404
No, you weren't.

312
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,911
Well, I'm just watching, sir.

313
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,973
Well, that's not very grateful of you

314
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,210
after I've taken you under my wing.

315
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:51,921
Well, I'm grateful, really.
I am.

316
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,091
You miss something, don't you?

317
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,059
Uh, no, I don't.

318
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,628
There's nothing up there, Roscuro.

319
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,562
Nothing at all.

320
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,100
Oh, no, I know that! Absolutely.

321
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,029
Uh, nothing!

322
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,662
Nothing. Nothing at all.

323
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,364
He's a tough one.

324
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,171
You're not gonna turn him.
Nah, you're not.

325
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,806
Oh, I don't know. A rat is a rat.

326
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,547
It doesn't really matter
where you come from.

327
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,714
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,253
He is so weird.

329
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,523
No kidding.

330
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,234
That is so beautiful.

331
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,666
I wonder what's out there.

332
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,752
Doesn't scurry.

333
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,848
Didn't cower.

334
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,723
"Didn't cower. Didn't cower.

335
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,262
"Wouldn't scurry."

336
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,855
Oh, here's one:
"Drew pictures of cats on his notebook."

337
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,958
- No! Cats?
- Oh! I can't imagine!

338
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,465
I'm afraid so. Named it Fluffy.

339
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,769
- Oh, I had no idea!
- Oh! That's terrible.

340
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,776
- Despereaux.
- Yes, sir?

341
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,378
Come in, please.

342
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,377
Despereaux, why do you think
you're in school?

343
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,915
To learn?

344
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,083
- To learn, yes.
- Yes.

345
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,216
To learn what?

346
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:14,229
To learn
how to be a mouse, sir.

347
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,156
That is correct.

348
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,667
And you can't be a mouse if
you don't learn to be afraid.

349
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,233
Oh, Despereaux, this...

350
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,275
There's so many
wonderful things in life to be afraid of

351
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,242
if you'd just learn how scary they are.

352
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,572
Yes. Yes, sir.

353
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,746
How about his brother?

354
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,149
His brother? What about him?

355
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,188
Yes, is he, you know, timid?

356
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,916
Oh! Oh, yes!

357
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,753
- Yes, very timid.
- Yes. So timid!

358
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,556
As timid as the day is long.

359
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,994
Good. Good.

360
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,859
Sometimes they just need
to see the older ones do it.

361
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,491
No one starts out afraid.

362
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,700
- Understood.
- Of course.

363
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,995
- You coddle that boy, that's the problem.
- No.

364
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,131
- Yes, you do.
- No, no.

365
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,232
- Yes, you do. You've been doing it for years.
- He was always...

366
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,367
He's little. I've had to help him.

367
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,139
He's not going to be afraid unless
you allow him to be afraid.

368
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,544
Well, Furlough will teach him.

369
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,878
Do what he does.

370
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,183
And don't do anything he doesn't.

371
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,656
And if he's afraid of something...

372
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,420
Then you need to be afraid of it, too.

373
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,405
Oh!

374
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,345
Wow.

375
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,096
Come on, Furlough, hurry up!

376
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,200
Whoa...

377
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,420
All right, now, you start
nibbling right along that edge there.

378
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,624
The glue is all right,
but it's the pages that taste the best.

379
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:27,253
Hmm. "Once upon a time."
That's great, isn't it?

380
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,155
"Upon a time."

381
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,268
And they don't even tell you
what time that is yet.

382
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,167
It's like you have to find that out.

383
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,263
You're not supposed to read it, Despereaux.
You're supposed to eat it.

384
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,940
Good. I'll come back in an hour.

385
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,481
And no reading! It's a rule.

386
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,930
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there lived a fair princess,</i>

387
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,335
<i>fairer than any in any other land.</i>

388
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,300
Hmm. Fair.

389
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:15,101
<i>And, as the story goes,</i>
<i>she was locked up in a faraway castle,</i>

390
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,671
<i>where she could see the world</i>
<i>but could never touch it.</i>

391
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,487
<i>She longed for a prince.</i>

392
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,416
<i>A brave knight who would</i>
<i>deliver her from all of this.</i>

393
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,427
<i>Someone with courage</i>
<i>and honor and decency.</i>

394
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,562
<i>But in a cruel and
frightened world,</i>

395
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,730
<i>men like this were scarce indeed.</i>

396
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,845
<i>They lived in a special world</i>

397
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,809
<i>built on courage and
chivalry and honor.</i>

398
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,249
<i>They pledged their
lives to each other.</i>

399
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,989
<i>To fight for truth,
to defend the weak,</i>

400
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,825
<i>to seek justice, and to always...</i>

401
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,867
How was the library?

402
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,028
Fine.

403
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,334
Spoil your appetite?

404
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,938
No. Helped it, actually.

405
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,170
Made me hungrier.

406
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,975
Good lad.

407
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,450
Ha-hah!

408
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,380
Did you see they're putting up
a new front on the crumb shop?

409
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,120
Oh! But I loved the old front.
- Quite modern. Yes.

410
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,163
<i>Did a book ever speak to you?</i>

411
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,972
<i>Almost like it was
written for you?</i>

412
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,642
<i>Despereaux loved it all.</i>

413
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,636
<i>Every bit of it.</i>

414
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,178
<i>The truth, the justice,
the bravery,</i>

415
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,244
<i>the sword-fighting.</i>

416
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,152
<i>He even loved things
you wouldn't suspect.</i>

417
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,521
<i>The story said she was a prisoner,</i>

418
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,752
<i>but that wasn't totally true</i>

419
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,830
<i>because she had hope,</i>
<i>and whenever you have hope,</i>

420
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,059
<i>you're never really
anybody's prisoner.</i>

421
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,828
Someday, my prince will come.

422
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,496
<i>But how did she know that?</i>

423
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,866
Yeah, how did she know that?

424
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,590
Why are you crying?

425
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,790
Why are you crying?

426
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,923
Down here.

427
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,529
Are you a rat?

428
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:56,957
No.

429
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,696
What are you? A mouse?

430
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,139
I am a gentleman.

431
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,634
And how do you do?

432
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,138
You're sad.

433
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,041
Yes.

434
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,443
Because you have longing.

435
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,177
You're a strange little mouse.

436
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,014
Thank you.

437
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,990
Come on.

438
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,470
Where did you hear that?

439
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,965
About the longing.

440
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,372
In a story.

441
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,501
A story? About what?

442
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,708
About a princess, like you,
in a castle, like this.

443
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,750
Oh. You're a smooth little mouse,
aren't you?

444
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,488
Bet you tell that to all the princesses.

445
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,720
I am sworn to tell the truth.

446
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,424
It is a code of honor.

447
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:00,259
Ah. Not just a gentleman,
an honorable gentleman.

448
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,428
Well, then, how does this story end

449
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,696
with this princess
who's locked in a castle?

450
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,204
I don't know...

451
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,030
I haven't finished it yet.

452
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,508
I'd love to know.

453
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,512
Oh, I wish it would rain.

454
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,074
I wish there was soup again.

455
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,376
I even wish there were rats!

456
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,281
Will you promise me that?

457
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,912
Will you promise to finish your story
and tell me how it ends?

458
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,925
Yes. It will be my quest.

459
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,294
Your quest! You are a very brave mouse.

460
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,865
Thank you, my good gentleman.

461
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,204
Whoa!

462
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,942
Whoa.

463
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,484
Whoa!

464
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,674
<i>Now, there are</i>
<i>all kinds of princesses.</i>

465
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,346
<i>Some are born that way,</i>

466
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,143
<i>some marry into it,</i>

467
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,979
<i>and some are destined
to be princesses</i>

468
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,487
<i>only in their own minds.</i>

469
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,852
<i>But at one time or another,</i>

470
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,985
<i>every little girl
longs to be a princess.</i>

471
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,959
I'm gonna live right there.

472
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,001
Right up there, near the tippy-top.

473
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,637
Quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine!

474
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,901
Yes, I know. It's gonna be all mine.

475
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:58,581
No, you deaf little urchin.
I said feed those swine!

476
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,379
<i>Miggery Sow had been</i>
<i>shoveling slop</i>

477
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,547
<i>for as long as she could remember.</i>

478
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,557
<i>Her Uncle Ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one.</i>

479
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,387
<i>But it turned out all right</i>

480
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,488
<i>because she got on</i>
<i>quite nicely with the pigs.</i>

481
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,033
That's right.

482
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:21,237
I'm gonna have a special room
just for my dresses

483
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,100
and another whole closet
just for my knickers!

484
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,111
<i>In fact, Miggery Sow could</i>
<i>see her future so clearly.</i>

485
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:33,878
<i>She could see the tiara, the fancy dresses,</i>
<i>the maids-in-waiting,</i>

486
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,544
<i>and when things got</i>
<i>really bad around the farm,</i>

487
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:42,025
<i>she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this.</i>

488
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,859
Not long now.

489
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,623
I promise you that.

490
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:50,727
20 for the big ones,
15 for the sow, and 12 for the girl.

491
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,762
15 for the girl, same as the sow.

492
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,868
I told you! I told you
I'd make it to the castle!

493
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,466
Whoa!

494
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,310
<i>So sometimes, it doesn't take much</i>
<i>for your dreams to come true.</i>

495
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,151
<i>You just have to be
able to see it that way.</i>

496
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,446
She was beautiful! Like an angel.

497
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,619
You are crazy.

498
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,455
And she smelled so amazing.

499
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,223
Like a garden.

500
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,755
Despereaux!

501
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,823
You can't talk to a human.

502
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,401
That is the worst thing you can do.

503
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,403
No, it's the best thing I ever did.

504
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,936
They will throw you in the dungeon.

505
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,564
You will get eaten by rats!

506
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,903
It would be worth it.

507
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,311
They could tear at my flesh.

508
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,777
Oh, this is bad.

509
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,280
Oh, and when she held me
in her hand, it was...

510
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,182
It was so soft,
like floating in a pillow.

511
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,986
You know what? I'm worried about you.

512
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,983
That's the point, Furlough.

513
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,854
There's nothing to be afraid of.

514
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,949
Quiet! They will hear you.

515
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,790
Come on. Just try it.

516
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,793
Just for a second, just try being brave.

517
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,796
- Oh!
- And stop cowering!

518
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,165
What's going on in here?

519
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:03,900
What's all this talk
about princesses and bravery?

520
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,537
Furlough, I want to see you
in my study, right now.

521
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,312
Are you sure?
- That's what he said.

522
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,818
- A real human?
- A princess.

523
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,580
We need to tell them.

524
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,247
We need to tell the Mouse Council.

525
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,656
- But they'll...
- This is bad. This is very bad.

526
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,719
If they find out...
If they find out that they didn't find out...

527
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,856
Oh, then they'll find
out that it was me who...

528
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,025
Oh, no.

529
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,262
But they will send him to the dungeon!

530
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,230
- Oh, he'll get eaten by rats!
- Oh!

531
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,829
No, not if we beg.

532
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,934
If we really beg
and show them that he's changed.

533
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,676
That he's afraid.

534
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,239
That he's afraid,
and he's turned into a real mouse.

535
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,382
Despereaux!

536
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,522
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>destiny is a funny thing.</i>

537
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,761
<i>We go out to meet it,</i>
<i>and we don't always know that we are.</i>

538
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,869
For glory and honor!

539
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,447
Surround him!

540
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,262
Despereaux Tilling.

541
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,270
How long have you been
working on this book?

542
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,330
Hmm... A week?

543
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,672
A week? You've hardly cracked it.

544
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,001
Well, I was...

545
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,144
I just wanted to see how it ends.

546
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,953
Refused training as a mouse.

547
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,487
Refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice.

548
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,596
Repeatedly engaged in bold
and un-meek behavior.

549
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:17,697
Triggered willfully
not less than 17 mousetraps.

550
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,034
Just shameful!

551
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,339
Had personal contact with...

552
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,071
With...

553
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,210
With a human being.

554
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,348
Isn't there something you can do?

555
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,482
Antoinette, stop right now! Stop that.

556
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,025
You have to trust them.

557
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,651
They are the Council.

558
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,923
They're the Council because...

559
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,722
Because they're the Council.

560
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,835
They're the Council.

561
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,233
Is there anything you wish to say
in your defense?

562
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,006
Well, it was a very good story,

563
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:57,370
and she was a very beautiful princess.

564
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,051
Despereaux Tilling,

565
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,714
our laws are here
to protect us and our way of life.

566
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,884
And when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life,

567
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,525
he becomes a threat to us all.

568
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,030
It's an easy question.

569
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,299
Are you a man or are you a mouse?

570
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,703
And your actions have told us

571
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,799
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse.

572
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,109
It is the judgment of this court

573
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,773
that you should be banished
from these walls forever.

574
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,249
You shall be remanded into the
custody of Hovis, the Threadmaster,

575
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,585
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of Dor,

576
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,252
from which no mouse
and no light has ever escaped.

577
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,500
- Shh!
- My baby!

578
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:01,236
Quiet. Be quiet, my dear.
There's nothing to be done.

579
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,203
Come with me.

580
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,012
Stand there.

581
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,418
Red?

582
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,662
Ah, so they tell me.

583
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,000
So you're the brave one.

584
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,228
I guess.

585
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,861
It's good. It'll carry well down there.

586
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,201
Wear it proudly.

587
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,567
There's no shame.

588
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,711
It's time.

589
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,884
It's all right.
They're too scared to come down here.

590
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,556
In there?

591
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,419
I'm afraid so.

592
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,790
Courage, right?

593
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,232
And truth.

594
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,771
- And honor.
- Good.

595
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,432
But especially courage.

596
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,277
I'm ready.

597
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,412
All right, then you need to...

598
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,818
What? Whoa!

599
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,987
Hello? Hello?

600
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,714
Whoa!

601
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,893
Lads, let's go, on the double!

602
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,758
Who is that?

603
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,666
Who goes there?

604
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,833
Who is that?

605
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,430
Despereaux Tilling.

606
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,736
Are you a man or are you a mouse?

607
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,239
I am a gentleman.

608
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,081
Oh.

609
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,242
- It's a mouse.
- I'm hungry.

610
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,378
Shh! Quiet, lads. Patience.

611
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,248
And what makes you a gentleman?

612
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,022
A code...

613
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,391
A code of honor.

614
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,724
You're a strange little
mouse, aren't you?

615
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,267
And where did you find
this code of honor?

616
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,302
Well, in a legend.

617
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,803
A legend that I read.

618
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,635
Fine. Oh, tell me this legend of yours.

619
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,971
I could do with a good story right now.

620
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,608
Well,

621
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,112
it's about a princess and a knight

622
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,273
and his quest to save her honor.

623
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,084
Ah. It was a princess
that took away my soup.

624
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,079
She didn't take it.

625
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,284
In fact, she misses it, too!

626
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,721
How do you know all this, then?

627
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,888
I've seen her.

628
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,960
- Seen her?
- I've talked to her.

629
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,500
- Talked to her?
- That's why they sent me down here.

630
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,900
Mmm-hmm.
And what did this princess tell you

631
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,632
when you had your little audience?

632
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,138
Eh? Eh?

633
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,005
Oh, you must be a royal mouse.
Is that it?

634
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:04,004
She told me that
she missed the soup and the rain

635
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,648
and, most of all, the sunlight.

636
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,945
And that she just
wanted it all to come back again.

637
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,949
Well, I don't want to
hear your little stories

638
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,959
about princesses and sunshine.

639
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,759
Go tell them to the rats!

640
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,698
All right, boys, come on!

641
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,542
Good crowd, isn't it, sir?

642
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,172
Yes, it is, quite.

643
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,376
Mouse! Mouse!
Mouse! Mouse!

644
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,691
Ah, Roscuro! I'm glad you could make it.

645
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,252
I thought you didn't like the arena.

646
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,492
Huh? Oh! No, no.
It... It's an honor, sir.

647
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,226
Oh!

648
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,530
Good.
- Mmm.

649
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,729
Well, enjoy.

650
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:39,199
Oh, uh... Thank you.

651
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,182
Let the games begin!

652
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,191
Mouse! Mouse! Mouse!

653
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:21,975
Come on!

654
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,519
Hold on!

655
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,201
Eat! Eat! Eat!

656
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,172
Wait!

657
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,316
Can I have him?
Can I have this one? Please?

658
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:34,981
What?

659
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,691
It's just that that one looks tasty.

660
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,490
Well, this is progress.

661
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:45,729
Perhaps we're starting
to leave the past behind us, eh?

662
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,236
Enjoy, my friend.

663
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,568
Don't leave a morsel.

664
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,972
Oh, I won't.

665
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,035
Pull!

666
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,830
Come on, let's go, buster!

667
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,190
That's it. That's it. You keep moving!

668
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,103
It's okay. Keep walking.

669
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,900
Come on, keep moving! Let's go, come on!

670
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,345
It's right up there.

671
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,049
- Huh?
- Keep walking.

672
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,062
- Oh.
- See that?

673
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,964
Light. Real light.

674
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,938
It's mine, but you can share it.

675
00:52:56,606 --> 00:53:00,599
It isn't much, but there isn't much
anywhere since everything turned gray.

676
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,273
You're not gonna eat me?

677
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,943
No. I don't eat mice.

678
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,717
Then what do you eat?

679
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,078
Crumbs.

680
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,484
When I can find them.

681
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,321
So you are a gentleman.

682
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,652
Tell me that story.

683
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,064
About the Princess.

684
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,764
Tell me what she looked like.

685
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,132
Well, she was...

686
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,499
Was she angry?

687
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,799
No.

688
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,567
No, not at all.

689
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,576
Her heart was full of longing.

690
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,771
What's longing?

691
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,584
<i>And that's</i>
<i>how a friendship is born.</i>

692
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,313
<i>Over the next few weeks, he told Roscuro</i>
<i>everything he knew about loyalty</i>

693
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,756
<i>and honor and
chivalry and courage.</i>

694
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,159
<i>He told him about the Princess,</i>
<i>and where her longing came from.</i>

695
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,097
<i>That she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats.</i>

696
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,493
Even the rats?

697
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,401
<i>He told him about their</i>
<i>code of honor, about his noble quest,</i>

698
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,139
<i>about duty and loyalty.</i>

699
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:10,771
<i>And there, in the
darkness of the cellar,</i>

700
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:15,978
<i>two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle.</i>

701
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,812
<i>Trapped in a life full
of pain and longing.</i>

702
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,823
<i>Even if no one could tell.</i>

703
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,793
Your crown, ma'am.

704
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,124
Oh.

705
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,759
I don't want it today.

706
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,633
But it's beautiful, ma'am.

707
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,132
I know, but I don't want it.

708
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,801
You look so pretty in it, ma'am.

709
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,776
Like a princess.

710
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,037
I know. I am the princess.

711
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,840
Oh, I know, ma'am,

712
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,148
but such a fine princess,
with a little, pretty, glittery...

713
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,848
I don't want it!

714
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,355
All right, Mig?

715
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,985
Very well, ma'am.

716
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,322
Please, take it away.

717
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,403
Princess.

718
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,038
Who's the princess?

719
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,311
I'm a princess.

720
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,319
I'm the princess.

721
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,991
My comb, my hat, my gloves

722
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:36,021
and my pretty powder

723
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,659
on my pretty princess face.

724
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,996
And what do you think you're doing?

725
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,095
Ma'am!

726
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,765
Where did you get all this?

727
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,705
I just borrowed it, ma'am.

728
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,902
Borrowed it?

729
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,269
I was gonna put them all back.

730
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,744
See that you do!

731
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,083
And you can spend the whole week

732
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,017
taking slop to the dungeon

733
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,181
for your little escapade.

734
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,422
"Princess"!

735
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,963
God! She's the princess.

736
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:14,863
And now I have to carry the sloppy,
gloppy, stinky stew

737
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,634
down in the damp, dark, dingy...

738
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,208
A person could get
lost forever down here.

739
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,406
Oh!

740
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,107
Din-din.

741
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,643
Slop.

742
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,719
No, don't stop! I said "slop"!

743
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,064
How am I supposed to eat this swill?

744
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,434
Oh, stop that!
I don't have to be putting up with all this!

745
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,634
I serve the Princess.

746
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,472
Right. You serve the Princess.

747
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,480
- That's a bit of a laugh, isn't it?
- I do.

748
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,312
- I bring her tea and...
- Well, I don't want to hear it!

749
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,154
Had me own little princess once.

750
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:06,916
And now I don't.

751
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,951
Oh. What, you had a princess?

752
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:12,919
Yeah.

753
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,294
Every dad's got a princess.

754
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,091
<i>Till he stops being a dad,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

755
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,937
Sorry. So, so, sorry!

756
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,542
Oh, well, I've got a real one.

757
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,704
And she's got a tiara and fancy robes,

758
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,544
and she's got shiny bits
all over every frock in her closet.

759
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,517
And I get to see her every single day.

760
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,178
What kind of a quest?

761
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,313
Uh...

762
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,887
To right a terrible wrong.

763
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,327
But who did you wrong?

764
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:49,222
Okay.

765
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,496
Do you remember when
they banished the rats?

766
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,698
- Sure. Yes.
- Okay.

767
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,507
Well, it wasn't all
the rats they banished.

768
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:03,012
I mean, they did, but it was
all because of one particular rat

769
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,371
in particular.

770
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,539
Oh.

771
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,841
Mmm-hmm.

772
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,647
If I could just tell her I'm sorry,

773
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,054
that I'm, you know, I'm really sorry.

774
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,854
And that I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

775
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,861
If she could just hear me say it,

776
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,397
you know, just... Just hear my voice,

777
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,730
she would
know how much I meant it.

778
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,367
That is a very noble quest.

779
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,187
Your Highness?

780
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,026
Your Highness?

781
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,562
Is that you?

782
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,229
My little mouse?

783
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,800
Oh, I'm not a mouse. I...

784
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,702
I'm a...

785
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,229
Oh.

786
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,866
I forgot.

787
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,405
You're my little gentleman, aren't you?

788
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,471
Have you come to tell me
how the story ends?

789
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,277
Did you finish your quest?

790
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,952
Where are you?

791
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,089
I have come to apologize.

792
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,248
Oh, you are noble, remember?

793
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,254
You have nothing to be sorry about.

794
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,330
Oh, but I am.

795
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,835
I am sorry.

796
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,740
I know you.

797
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,299
- No, no.
- Oh, no!

798
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,174
No! Please, please listen. Please.

799
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,644
- A rat!
- Please. I just want to tell you.

800
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,339
Someone, please!

801
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,643
Listen. It's okay.

802
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,150
Get it off me! There's a rat in my room!

803
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,249
Please get him off!

804
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,018
What?

805
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,925
Rat!

806
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,463
Oh!

807
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,764
It's a rat!

808
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,373
Quick, rush him!

809
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:22,542
Get him!

810
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,017
Filthy rodent!

811
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,618
Uh-oh.

812
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,020
Oh!

813
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,793
Where'd he go?

814
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:25,407
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if your own name was a bad word?</i>

815
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,145
<i>If John or Beth or
Bill was an insult.</i>

816
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,147
<i>Well, that's how Roscuro</i>
<i>came to feel about who he was.</i>

817
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:42,220
<i>When your heart breaks,</i>
<i>it can grow back crooked.</i>

818
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,998
<i>It grows back twisted
and gnarled and hard.</i>

819
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,705
<i>Even as he changed,</i>
<i>Roscuro still had longing.</i>

820
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:58,112
<i>But now he just longed for someone
whose heart was as hardened as his was.</i>

821
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:04,678
Pretty princess.
Pretty, pretty princess pie.

822
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,780
What a pretty princess!

823
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:10,756
My gloves.

824
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:12,855
My comb.

825
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,860
My jewel-y, girly hat,

826
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:21,600
all sitting on my princess head.

827
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:30,310
Who's the pretty princess pumpkin pie?

828
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,306
You are.

829
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,278
Right. I am.

830
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:41,284
You are. And you should be
dressed in those clothes.

831
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,791
Quite right. I should.

832
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,963
Mmm-hmm.
And you should lounge in that bed.

833
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,326
Lounging.

834
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,334
Lounging round, yes, the whole day!

835
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,227
And you should be wearing that crown.

836
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:58,665
I should be wearing a frown?

837
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,472
No. No, no, no. Not a frown. A crown.

838
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:05,775
Wow! Can't hear me own self think.

839
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,679
- Ah!
- Shh!

840
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,811
- Ah!
- Shh!

841
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,513
Shh!

842
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,352
- Ah!
- Shh!

843
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,593
Who are you?

844
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,253
I'm here to help you.

845
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,923
I can't be caught with
a real rat in my bunk.

846
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,093
I don't think so.

847
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,763
And what if they find you
with a painting of the Princess?

848
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,830
You think that's as bad as a rat?

849
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,269
I want the same thing you do.

850
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,213
<i>Allo?</i>

851
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,453
What are you doing?

852
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,720
Uh...

853
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,565
I need it for a baby.

854
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,299
No, not a baby!

855
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:02,828
For milady.

856
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,736
I mean milady.

857
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,501
Yes.

858
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,238
To chop apples.

859
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,369
Mmm.

860
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,912
She'd like some apples.

861
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,710
Now turn and leave.

862
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,718
Now turn and leave.

863
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,351
No, no! Just turn and leave.

864
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,322
Oh, right. Sorry.

865
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:26,919
Sorry. Bye.

866
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,328
Oh, I can't hear you,
see, because deaf, but...

867
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,491
A bit deaf.

868
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,195
<i>You know, hurt is a funny thing.</i>

869
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:41,869
<i>The same thing that makes one person angry</i>
<i>can put another person into grief.</i>

870
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,674
Here, take care of me little princess.

871
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,539
I can't no more.

872
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,342
Oh, I will. Don't worry.

873
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,512
I'm sorry.

874
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,214
Sorry. So, so sorry!

875
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,523
<i>Gregory always said</i>
<i>that she had too much heart.</i>

876
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,364
<i>And that's why they had to put</i>
<i>some of it on the outside.</i>

877
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,868
<i>But let's face it.</i>

878
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,599
<i>It's hard to see
something on your back.</i>

879
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:14,802
<i>In fact, you can have a good heart</i>
<i>and not even know it.</i>

880
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,707
You can do this. You know you can.

881
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,374
I know I can.

882
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:23,077
She belongs in the dungeon,
and you belong in the palace, like a princess.

883
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,918
What are you doing?

884
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,387
I'm cleaning, ma'am.

885
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,227
With rope?

886
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,422
It helps, ma'am.

887
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,399
Well, stop it. You look ridiculous.

888
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,129
Sorry, ma'am?

889
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,798
I said you look ridiculous.

890
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:48,172
<i> Ridiculous,</i>
<i>ridiculous, ridiculous.</i>

891
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,740
- You can't do this, Mig.
- Gor.

892
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,608
Seems I am, ma'am.

893
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:55,150
You'll get in a terrible
amount of trouble.

894
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,242
Don't listen. You're the princess now.

895
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,810
I'm the princess now.

896
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,616
And you belong in the palace.

897
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,317
I belong in the palace.

898
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,483
And she belongs in...

899
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,583
No! You can't do this!

900
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,926
Help! Help! Someone help me!

901
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,966
Help! Help!

902
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,292
Help! Help!

903
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,177
Help! Help!

904
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,616
Help!

905
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,349
I'm in here!

906
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,812
Help!

907
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,022
You filthy, stinking rat!

908
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,627
You tricked me!

909
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:43,657
Here's the spot, rats!

910
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,132
What's Roscuro brought us, then?

911
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,634
Hungry! Yum! Hungry now!

912
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,533
Not yet, lads.
No, no, you've got to wait.

913
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,036
It's nowhere near dinnertime.

914
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,164
Oh, come on, Smudge, I'm starving.

915
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,878
Something special
for dinner tonight.

916
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,739
Smells delicious!

917
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,981
Smells human to me. A young one.
- And not just any human.

918
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,081
Let's have a look.
- It's the Princess!

919
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,022
Oi, you'll wait
for your dinner like everyone else.

920
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,151
Come on, Smudge,
give us a little look.

921
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,320
No, no, no!

922
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,864
Boss doesn't want her getting
nervous. Spoils the meat, doesn't it?

923
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,036
Milady!

924
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,339
Psst! Milady!

925
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,033
Oh, my little mouse! It's you.

926
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,575
I will deliver you from this evil, ma'am.

927
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,738
Oh, no. Just go find my father.

928
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,213
Take this chain from around my neck.

929
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,115
To show him you are honest and truthful.

930
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,586
Oh, I am!
Honest and truthful and loyal and...

931
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:41,781
I know.

932
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,949
But hurry.

933
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,526
Here. Take it.

934
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,352
There isn't much time.

935
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,488
Whoa!

936
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,826
Ha-ha!

937
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,643
Oh, oh!

938
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,330
Hey, did you get some?
- Oh, yeah.

939
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,769
Here you are, sir.

940
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,932
Fresh worms.

941
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,532
Oh, um...

942
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:42,501
Thank you.

943
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,107
Well done, Roscuro!

944
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,983
You hear that?

945
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,318
That's all because of you.

946
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:59,123
Come, my friend. Look at your handiwork.

947
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,518
King! King!
Sire, your daughter is in danger!

948
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,079
Sire, up here!

949
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,825
Your Highness! Please, sir!

950
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,592
Oh, come on.

951
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:37,689
Oh!

952
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:43,695
Hey, Sire!

953
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,365
Your Highness!

954
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,600
Look, Your Highness! Look!

955
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,008
Hello, Mr. King!

956
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,570
Hey, hello!

957
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,704
Whoa!

958
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,078
Down here! Hello! Down here!

959
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,777
Listen, your daughter is in danger!

960
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,217
She's in a dungeon!

961
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:00,721
You're the only one who can help!

962
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,450
She sent me to get you!

963
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:03,752
Sir, please! Sir...

964
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,383
Ooh! Sire!

965
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,860
Your Highness!

966
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,263
Look down here! Whoa!

967
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,935
Dad? Dad, listen. You've got to help me.

968
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,980
But you're dead!

969
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,742
No. No, I'm not. I'm not dead!

970
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:30,910
Now, listen. The Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the dungeon.

971
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:34,444
Oh, my golly, you're dead.

972
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,149
Dad! Dad, I'm not dead!

973
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,422
Dad, I'm not dead!
Oh, Dad, wake up, please!

974
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,733
Furlough, listen. You've gotta help me.

975
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,326
You're...

976
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:49,995
No. No, I'm not dead.

977
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:52,801
Listen, the Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the cellar.

978
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:56,139
Oh, my God, you're dead!

979
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:57,269
No!

980
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:58,804
Whoo!

981
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,279
Guys? Listen.

982
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,106
Okay, look. Now, I'm not dead.

983
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,948
The Princess is in danger,
and she's down in the dungeon

984
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,648
and you've gotta... You've gotta help me!

985
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,121
Somebody?

986
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,694
Whoa!

987
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,500
Whoa!

988
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,642
Whoa!

989
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:47,819
Hmm.

990
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,296
Oh!

991
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,433
Oh!

992
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,271
Oh, ho, ho!

993
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,709
Ah!

994
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:14,820
Whoa!

995
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,054
Oh, I must have been...

996
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:27,726
Enough!

997
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:33,999
Ah-ha!

998
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,505
Ah!

999
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,584
<i>Voilà!</i>

1000
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,465
Look at you! You are still brewing tea.

1001
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,935
If you want to make a statement,
what do I say?

1002
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:41,639
Make it a good one!

1003
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,309
Ah, it's so great to see you!

1004
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,676
Fantastic!

1005
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,013
- Ah.
- Marjoram?

1006
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,347
Mmm-hmm. Love it. Perfect.

1007
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,081
- Ah! <i>Superbe!</i>
<i>- Bellissima!</i>

1008
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,656
Basil, will you look at that?

1009
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:00,986
Oh!

1010
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,824
Look up there!
Marge, come and have a look at this!

1011
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:04,956
Oh, my!

1012
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:11,997
Mmm!

1013
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,504
Cauliflower?

1014
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,274
Perfect. Perfect, yes, it's about time.

1015
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,610
<i>Basilico.</i>

1016
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,377
Eh, some celery?

1017
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,211
Hey, hello!

1018
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,877
Good, celery. Parsley, maybe.

1019
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,186
The Princess is in danger!
- No, no, no.

1020
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,019
- Garlic! Should I use the garlic?
- Look down here!

1021
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,525
- I mean not too much, but just a little bit.
- Oh, no, no, no, of course.

1022
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,027
- It is fantastic!
- Yes.

1023
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,153
<i>Bellissima!</i>

1024
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,061
Brav-ow!

1025
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,457
Oh.

1026
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,727
The Princess is in danger!

1027
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:41,894
Ooh!

1028
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,572
You are a cute little mouse.

1029
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,036
Would you like some soup?

1030
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,202
No, I don't want...

1031
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,507
The Princess is in danger!

1032
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:54,173
And a talking mouse, too.

1033
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,682
Listen, you've gotta help me.

1034
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,343
Perhaps a little cheese?

1035
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,683
No, I don't want any cheese!

1036
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,315
The Princess! She's in danger!

1037
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,052
She's locked in the dungeon!

1038
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,351
In the dungeon!

1039
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:08,760
Oh, don't be silly, my little mouse.

1040
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,422
Everything is fine!

1041
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,660
The Princess is perfectly
safe up in her...

1042
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:29,741
Oh, my.

1043
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,542
Boldo!

1044
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,244
Look! It's...

1045
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,681
Boldo.

1046
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,720
Where are you?

1047
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,124
Charge!

1048
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,189
Tell me again.

1049
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,289
- Chivalry!
- Mmm.

1050
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,457
- Bravery!
- Mmm-hmm.

1051
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:46,591
Honor!

1052
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:50,638
Chivalry! Bravery! Honor!

1053
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,100
I love it!

1054
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,267
Oh, it feels so good to
be out of the kitchen!

1055
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,269
Let's go!

1056
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,713
Into the breach!

1057
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,107
Down there.

1058
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,582
<i>Andiamo!</i>

1059
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,145
Whoa!

1060
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,048
Ha-ha!

1061
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:16,826
Where did she go?

1062
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,100
My friends!

1063
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,267
My friends, there are rats,

1064
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:29,936
and then there are rats!

1065
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,608
And I would like a huge round of applause

1066
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,117
for our good friend here

1067
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:42,020
for delivering us our princess!

1068
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:45,987
Come on, let's go!

1069
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:50,694
Oi! Hang on! Where you going? Help!

1070
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,760
Hurry!

1071
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:57,462
Look at that!

1072
01:17:57,806 --> 01:17:59,296
Let's get him, boys.

1073
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,848
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

1074
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,712
Keep going! Keep going!

1075
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,722
Please! Oh, no, get off of me!

1076
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,553
Nice shot!

1077
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,356
That's my onion!

1078
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,478
Hello?

1079
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,648
Help!

1080
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,683
Help!

1081
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,160
Can anybody hear me?

1082
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,755
Help!

1083
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,734
I'm in here!

1084
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,269
I'm in here!

1085
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,574
I'm in here!

1086
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,175
Oh, gor!

1087
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:18,579
What took you so long?

1088
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:22,248
I've been screaming in here
for over two hours.

1089
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,459
My little princess.

1090
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,524
Rain.

1091
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,624
Yes.

1092
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,771
Papa! Papa, look!

1093
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,102
Up there!

1094
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,206
The sun!

1095
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,228
Go on, Despereaux.

1096
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:18,272
Wait! Wait just a moment! Patience!

1097
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:24,677
Not just yet.

1098
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:36,826
The honor is all yours, my friend.

1099
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,603
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1100
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,306
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1101
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,347
<i>Okay, remember</i>
<i>when we said that grief</i>

1102
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,044
<i>was the strongest thing
a person could feel?</i>

1103
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,643
<i>Well, it isn't.</i>

1104
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,978
<i>It's forgiveness.</i>

1105
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,483
<i>Because a single act of
forgiveness can change everything.</i>

1106
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:08,787
No.

1107
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,289
What?

1108
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,389
No.

1109
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,027
You worthless little...

1110
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,670
Eat! Eat! Eat!

1111
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:39,350
Help!

1112
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,506
Who let him out?

1113
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:03,708
Hey, you!

1114
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:04,943
It's that mouse!

1115
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:11,716
Get him!

1116
01:22:56,237 --> 01:23:00,731
Ah, if it isn't our brave little knight.

1117
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,134
- I wonder.
- No!

1118
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:07,146
Should I finish you off myself

1119
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:10,581
or turn you into cat food?

1120
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,460
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1121
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:30,194
What is that?

1122
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,235
Please. Nice kitty?

1123
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,374
No, no, no, no!

1124
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:20,912
Hmm?

1125
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,915
Thank you, my good gentleman.

1126
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,265
I am sorry.

1127
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,676
I'm the one who should be sorry.

1128
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:25,583
I'm so, so sorry.
You've no idea how sorry I am.

1129
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,986
That's all right.

1130
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,354
I'm so sorry.

1131
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,330
<i>So, you could call all of this</i>

1132
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,874
<i>a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to.</i>

1133
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,275
<i>A king was hurt, so he hurt a rat.</i>

1134
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:54,179
<i>And a rat was hurt,
so he hurt a princess.</i>

1135
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,344
<i>And a princess was hurt,</i>
<i>so she hurt a servant girl,</i>

1136
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,944
<i>without even meaning to do it.</i>

1137
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,957
<i>And that servant had been</i>
<i>hurting for so long,</i>

1138
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:07,119
<i>that almost nothing</i>
<i>could make her feel better.</i>

1139
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:13,028
<i>But was it a mistake</i>
<i>or was it just good luck?</i>

1140
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:16,163
<i>Because the servant girl</i>
<i>went back to her farm.</i>

1141
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,797
<i>And the jailer finally
found his princess.</i>

1142
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:22,001
<i>And the King found something</i>
<i>stronger than grief.</i>

1143
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:24,704
<i>And the mice finally
got rid of their fear.</i>

1144
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:31,148
<i>And the people of Dor</i>
<i>lived side by side with their rats.</i>

1145
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,484
<i>All except one.</i>

1146
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,147
<i>Who went back to sea</i>

1147
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,521
<i>and felt a cool
breeze each morning</i>

1148
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,755
<i>and the sun in his
face every afternoon.</i>

1149
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:45,162
<i>And we'd tell you that they all
lived happily ever after, but...</i>

1150
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,257
Whoa!

1151
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,232
<i>what fun is that?</i>

1152
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,393
Whoa!

1153
01:30:49,394 --> 01:30:50,394
