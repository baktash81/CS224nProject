1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,037
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

2
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:02,438
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

3
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:06,205
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...

4
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,304
until the sun went down

5
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:12,408
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

6
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:15,544
that took hold each and every night.

7
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:20,693
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

8
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:23,796
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,

9
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:27,663
there to await the kiss...
of the handsome Prince Charming.

10
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,801
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

11
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:36,569
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

12
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,940
traveling for many days and nights,

13
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,206
risking life and limb

14
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,816
to reach the Dragon's keep.

15
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,783
For he was the bravest,

16
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:54,485
and most handsome...

17
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,254
in all the land.

18
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,926
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:06,300
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:12,174
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:16,772
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,908
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

23
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,112
What?

24
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:25,816
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,951
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?

26
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:33,297
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

27
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:50,304
# So she said
what's the problem, baby?

28
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,145
# What's the problem?
I don't know

29
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,253
# Well, maybe I'm in love

30
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,821
# Think about it
every time I think 'bout it

31
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,221
# Can't stop thinking 'bout it

32
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:02,385
# How much longer
will it take to cure this?

33
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:05,089
# Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it

34
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:06,495
# If it's love, love

35
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,863
# Makes me wanna turn around
and face me

36
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,528
# But I don't know nothing
'bout love

37
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,435
# Oh, come on, come on

38
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,701
# Turn a little faster

39
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,299
# Come on, come on

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,469
# The world will follow after

41
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,046
# Come on, come on

42
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:25,811
# Everybody's after love

43
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,850
# So I said
I'm a snowball running

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,760
# Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love

45
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:41,265
# Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight

46
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,392
# Shimmering love

47
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,164
# Well, baby, I surrender

48
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,296
# To the strawberry ice cream

49
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,342
# Never ever end of all this love

50
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,343
# Well, I didn't mean to do it

51
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,710
# But there's no escaping your love

52
00:03:56,483 --> 00:04:00,544
# These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone

53
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,780
# Never alone, no, no

54
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,446
# Come on, come on

55
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,491
# Jump a little higher

56
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:07,582
# Come on, come on

57
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,924
# If you feel a little lighter

58
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:11,189
# Come on, come on

59
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:14,562
# We were once upon a time in love

60
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,658
Hyah!

61
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:21,600
# We're accidentally in love

62
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,501
# Accidentally in love

63
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:29,344
# Accidentally in love

64
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,941
# Accidentally in love

65
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:36,351
# Accidentally in love

66
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,991
# Accidentally in love

67
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,526
# Accidentally

68
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,927
# I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love

69
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,862
# I'm in love, I'm in love

70
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:50,493
# Accidentally in love

71
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:54,334
# I'm in love

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,203
# I'm in love?

73
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,402
It's so good to be home!

74
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,108
Just you and me and...

75
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:11,716
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?

76
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,693
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

77
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,093
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

78
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:22,428
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

79
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,696
Donkey, what are you doing here?

80
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:26,795
Taking care of your love nest for you.

81
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:31,206
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

82
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,280
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,440
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

84
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,485
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

85
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,283
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.

86
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,257
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,524
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

88
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,724
Oh, yeah, that.

89
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,428
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

90
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,164
I thought I'd move in with you.

91
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,934
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

92
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,805
But Fiona and I are married now.

93
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,176
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

94
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,376
Just with each other.

95
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:14,915
Alone.

96
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,819
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

97
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:20,620
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

98
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,422
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

99
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:23,893
You're bothering me.

100
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,423
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...

101
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,765
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...

102
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:36,638
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

103
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:42,808
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

104
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,850
Oh.

105
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,885
I think I remember.

106
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,621
Donkey!

107
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,817
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

108
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,919
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

109
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,001
Enough, Reggie.

110
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:14,702
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

111
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:18,978
"You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

112
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:23,714
"for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

113
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,983
"at which time the King

114
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:31,086
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..."

115
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,290
uh... "Prince Charming.

116
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,029
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

117
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,571
"aka Mom and Dad."

118
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:41,970
Mom and Dad?

119
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,442
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

120
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,308
- We're not going.
- What?

121
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,348
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

122
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,452
shocked to see you like this?

123
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,986
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

124
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:59,252
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

125
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,589
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

126
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:02,661
Yeah, right.

127
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:05,458
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome
at the country club.

128
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,362
Stop it.
They're not like that.

129
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,925
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

130
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,473
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

131
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,565
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

132
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,543
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

133
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:23,706
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?

134
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,284
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

135
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,377
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

136
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,456
You did!
When you married me!

137
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,616
Well, there's some fine print for you!

138
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:36,695
So that's it. You won't come?

139
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:42,029
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

140
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,532
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

141
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,041
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

142
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,181
Hey, wait for me. Oof!

143
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:07,152
# Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

144
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,694
# Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

145
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,094
# Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

146
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:16,532
# Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

147
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,627
# Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

148
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,296
# Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

149
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,931
# Rawhide!?
Yee-haw!

150
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,041
- Are we there yet?
- No.

151
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,148
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

152
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,488
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

153
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:45,296
- Are we there yet?
- No!

154
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,389
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,797
- Really?
- No!

156
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,334
- Are we there yet?
- No!

157
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,199
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

158
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,830
- Are we there yet?
- No!

159
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,039
Are we there yet?

160
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:02,171
That's not funny. That's really immature.

161
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,511
This is why nobody likes ogres.

162
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,912
Your loss!

163
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,351
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

164
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:13,016
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

165
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,926
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

166
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,295
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

167
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,992
away!

168
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:26,663
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

169
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:29,332
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

170
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,725
For five minutes...

171
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,802
Could you not be yourself...

172
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,371
...for five minutes!

173
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,074
Are we there yet?

174
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,809
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

175
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,687
Wow!

176
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:30,301
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

177
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,270
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

178
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:44,576
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

179
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,811
Halt!

180
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,329
Hey, everyone, look.

181
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:13,168
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

182
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,811
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

183
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,319
Announcing the long-awaited return

184
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:06,956
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

185
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,432
Well, this is it.

186
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,470
- This is it.
- This is it.

187
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:13,833
This is it.

188
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:40,022
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

189
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,365
So...

190
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:48,463
you still think
this was a good idea?

191
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:52,977
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

192
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,243
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.

193
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,649
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

194
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:04,018
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

195
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:07,320
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

196
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:11,089
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

197
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,563
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

198
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,931
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

199
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,503
That was for my own...

200
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:22,438
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

201
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,769
Harold, we have to be...

202
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,777
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

203
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,847
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

204
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,280
A disaster! There is no way...

205
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,975
- You can do this.
- I really...

206
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,587
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...

207
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,712
Here!

208
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:42,819
Mom... Dad...

209
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,164
I'd like you to meet my husband...

210
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:47,994
Shrek.

211
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,200
Well, um...

212
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:55,637
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

213
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,941
Excuse me.

214
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:39,745
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?

215
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,918
That's good.

216
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:45,690
I guess not.

217
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:50,255
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

218
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:52,990
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

219
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:57,501
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

220
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,367
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

221
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:03,909
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

222
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,034
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

223
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,669
Oh, boy.

224
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,840
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

225
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:15,442
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.

226
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:16,555
Mmm!

227
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:18,623
No, no. Darling.

228
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,552
Oh!

229
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:27,020
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

230
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,656
Well...

231
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,099
Shrek owns his own land.

232
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:34,500
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

233
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,405
It's in an enchanted forest

234
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,243
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

235
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:43,645
What?

236
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,910
I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

237
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:50,112
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

238
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:53,157
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

239
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,398
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

240
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,406
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

241
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,636
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

242
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:15,509
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

243
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,945
I got to go to the bathroom.

244
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:20,518
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

245
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,451
Bon appetit!

246
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,994
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

247
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,690
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

248
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,164
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

249
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,033
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

250
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:41,470
Ogres, yes!

251
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:44,509
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

252
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,339
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

253
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,642
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

254
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:50,510
Dad!

255
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:55,212
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

256
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:59,051
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

257
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,353
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

258
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,623
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

259
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,099
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

260
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,804
- Harold!
- Shrek!

261
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,877
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

262
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,206
- Mom!
- Harold...

263
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,301
Donkey!

264
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:48,890
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

265
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,800
You're all grown up.

266
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,497
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

267
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,598
I'm your fairy godmother.

268
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,304
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

269
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:04,746
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

270
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:07,875
With just a...

271
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:12,181
# Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

272
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:17,193
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

273
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,230
# A high-priced dress
made by mice no less

274
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,424
# Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress

275
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,467
# Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

276
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,298
# Confide in your very own
furniture friends

277
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,498
# We'll help you set a new fashion trend

278
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:32,566
- # I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- # The kind of girl a prince would date!

279
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,976
# They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

280
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,105
# "For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"

281
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:41,175
# A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

282
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,847
# Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

283
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,686
# And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!'

284
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,555
# Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

285
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:55,064
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush

286
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,136
# Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

287
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:01,365
# You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune

288
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,065
# Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

289
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,837
# Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

290
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,470
# Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair?

291
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:11,606
Stop!

292
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,479
Look...

293
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,247
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

294
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:19,255
but I really don't need all this.

295
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,187
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

296
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,322
Fiona? Fiona?

297
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:34,497
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

298
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:36,233
Oh, uh...

299
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:38,332
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

300
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,809
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

301
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,541
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

302
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,276
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

303
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,321
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

304
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:53,186
She's just trying to help.

305
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,489
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

306
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:58,085
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

307
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,730
When did you decide this?

308
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,392
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

309
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,834
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

310
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:09,237
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

311
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,466
happiness...

312
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,271
is just a teardrop away.

313
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:14,902
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

314
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,844
Happy, happy, happy...

315
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,110
So I see.

316
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,082
Let's go, Kyle.

317
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,323
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

318
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,153
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

319
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,888
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

320
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:33,556
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

321
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,428
even if I did want it.

322
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,527
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

323
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:42,004
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

324
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:46,976
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

325
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,048
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

326
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,581
Here's a news flash for you!

327
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:55,619
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

328
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:05,161
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

329
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:15,099
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

330
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:20,968
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

331
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,372
I knew this would happen.

332
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,373
You should.
You started it.

333
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:54,434
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

334
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:57,980
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

335
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:00,346
This is Fiona's choice.

336
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:03,511
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

337
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:07,852
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

338
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,862
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

339
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,558
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

340
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,228
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

341
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:22,134
Don't you remember when
we were young?

342
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:25,208
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

343
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,507
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

344
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:29,978
It's not the same!

345
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:34,075
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

346
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,517
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

347
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:38,486
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

348
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,582
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

349
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,684
I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

350
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,023
Hello, Harold.

351
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,155
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

352
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:50,234
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

353
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:54,031
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

354
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,199
You better get in.
We need to talk.

355
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,402
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

356
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:03,072
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

357
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:07,049
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

358
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,981
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

359
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,283
So, what's new?

360
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:18,090
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

361
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:21,632
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

362
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,860
When did you get back?

363
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:26,938
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

364
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,531
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

365
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,634
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

366
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:36,111
Mommy can handle this.

367
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:40,310
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

368
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:44,354
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

369
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:45,547
And what does he find?

370
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,387
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

371
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:51,359
is already married.

372
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,897
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

373
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,660
Stop the car!

374
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:58,829
Harold.

375
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:04,509
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

376
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,543
Where are we?

377
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,614
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

378
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,808
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.

379
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:16,750
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

380
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:20,323
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

381
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,426
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

382
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:25,223
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

383
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,198
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

384
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,427
There you are, dear.

385
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:37,670
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

386
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,937
Indeed not.

387
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:43,674
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

388
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:47,240
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

389
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,853
Not only for your daughter...

390
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:53,157
but for your Kingdom.

391
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,854
What am I supposed to do about it?

392
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,401
Use your imagination.

393
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:39,100
Oh...

394
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,900
Come on in, Your Majesty.

395
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:53,015
# I like my town

396
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:58,521
# With a little drop of poison

397
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:01,992
# Nobody knows...

398
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,329
Excuse me.

399
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,694
Do I know you?

400
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,563
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

401
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,366
Uh... excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

402
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,833
Ah! There you are. Right.

403
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:24,246
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.

404
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:28,649
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

405
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,618
Um... He's an ogre.

406
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:35,152
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

407
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,560
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

408
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,797
he don't like to be disturbed.

409
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,527
Where could I find him?

410
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,997
Hello?

411
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,040
Who dares enter my room?

412
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:55,772
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to

413
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,541
about an ogre problem?

414
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:59,843
You are told correct.

415
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:03,714
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.

416
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,914
Would... this be enough?

417
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:17,962
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

418
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,368
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.

419
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:46,024
# Everyone says
I'm getting down too low

420
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:52,929
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go

421
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,736
# You just gotta let it go

422
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:08,576
# I need some sleep

423
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,087
# Time to put the old horse down

424
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,949
# I'm in too deep

425
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:19,326
# And the wheels keep spinning round

426
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:24,333
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go?

427
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,731
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go?

428
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:34,310
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

429
00:30:56,634 --> 00:30:57,965
Dear Diary...

430
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,663
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

431
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,572
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

432
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,206
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

433
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,645
Must be like some finishing school.

434
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,548
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

435
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:16,313
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

436
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,945
and bring me back to my family,

437
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,287
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

438
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:26,121
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

439
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,499
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

440
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,000
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

441
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:33,366
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

442
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,914
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

443
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:51,579
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

444
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:56,751
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

445
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,295
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.

446
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:02,764
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

447
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,893
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

448
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:10,134
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

449
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:13,699
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

450
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:18,249
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

451
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,351
A little father-son time?

452
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,680
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

453
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:37,600
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

454
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,132
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

455
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,973
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

456
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,480
"Head to the
darkest part of the woods..."

457
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,575
"Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches."

458
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:58,984
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

459
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,887
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

460
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:06,396
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

461
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,466
and I end up lost
in the woods with you!

462
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,796
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.

463
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:12,870
I know! I know.

464
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:18,572
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

465
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:21,804
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

466
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,744
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

467
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,155
Well, well, well, Donkey.

468
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,751
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

469
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,590
What? I ain't purring.

470
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:41,995
Sure. What's next? A hug?

471
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,196
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...

472
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:48,864
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!

473
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:51,367
Look! A little cat.

474
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:54,604
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

475
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,679
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

476
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:01,775
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

477
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:04,711
Whoa!

478
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:09,088
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

479
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:11,423
Oh, God. Oh...

480
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:13,121
No!

481
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,565
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

482
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,637
Shrek! Hold still!

483
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:24,739
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.

484
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:32,012
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

485
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:36,618
Puss... in Boots!

486
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,211
I'll kill that cat!

487
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:39,516
Ah-ha-ha!

488
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:01,170
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

489
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:04,140
What should we do with him?

490
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:07,546
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

491
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:08,947
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

492
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,816
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.

493
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,584
I was doing it only for my family.

494
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:17,684
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

495
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:21,253
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

496
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:22,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

497
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,630
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

498
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,637
The rich King? Sí.

499
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,568
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

500
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,978
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

501
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,447
Gee, thanks.

502
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,057
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

503
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,556
That's what the King said.

504
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:53,291
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

505
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:57,368
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

506
00:35:57,468 --> 00:36:00,562
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.

507
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:04,699
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.

508
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:08,377
Hold the phone...

509
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,077
"Happiness."

510
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:15,083
"A tear drop away."

511
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:18,986
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

512
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,684
Aw, man, where do I begin?

513
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:26,093
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

514
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:29,928
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

515
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:34,095
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going "Pinata!"

516
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:35,502
What is a pinata, anyway?

517
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:38,006
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

518
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,508
Don't go projecting on me.

519
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,703
I know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

520
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:47,173
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

521
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,417
What? Is it on? Is it on?

522
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,557
This is Fairy Godmother.

523
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,790
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

524
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:06,403
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

525
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,300
Have a "happy ever after."

526
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,707
Oh...

527
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,939
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

528
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:18,538
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

529
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:22,119
# Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!

530
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:26,849
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

531
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:30,792
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

532
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,760
as you have spared me mine.

533
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:36,129
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

534
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,101
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

535
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:51,310
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

536
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:53,280
in his wee little boots.

537
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:56,612
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

538
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,518
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

539
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,485
Ahh!

540
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,356
Listen. He's purring!

541
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:07,522
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

542
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:11,129
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

543
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,933
Shrek!

544
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:21,712
Shrek?

545
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:35,157
They're both festive, aren't they?

546
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,158
What do you think, Harold?

547
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,491
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

548
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:45,195
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

549
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:47,669
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

550
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:50,070
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

551
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:52,074
Mom. Dad.

552
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:55,771
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

553
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:58,507
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

554
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:01,346
I haven't.
You should ask your father.

555
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:06,046
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

556
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,590
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

557
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,221
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

558
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,424
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

559
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:19,264
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

560
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,431
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

561
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:27,375
I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

562
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,708
You know, after your
little spat last night.

563
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:32,078
Oh. You heard that, huh?

564
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:33,844
The whole kingdom heard you.

565
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,783
I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

566
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,355
well, a bit of a brute.

567
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:42,619
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

568
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:46,128
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

569
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:49,867
Shrek loves me for who I am.

570
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,561
I would think you'd be happy for me.

571
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,071
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

572
00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:59,438
Maybe you should do the same.

573
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:14,651
No, really?

574
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:18,592
Shh...

575
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,060
Oh...

576
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,901
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

577
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,907
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

578
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:35,445
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

579
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:39,175
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

580
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:45,980
He makes me laugh.

581
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:53,826
Hi. I'm here to see the...

582
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,923
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

583
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,901
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

584
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:04,468
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

585
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:07,305
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

586
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,572
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

587
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,647
The union?

588
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:15,151
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

589
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:16,913
Oh! Oh, right.

590
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:20,090
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

591
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:23,853
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

592
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:25,622
They don't even have dental.

593
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,028
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

594
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:29,292
Oh. By the way.

595
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,699
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

596
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,829
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

597
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,204
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

598
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,300
A drop of desire.

599
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,206
Naughty!

600
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:16,072
A pinch of passion.

601
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,684
And just a hint of...

602
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,447
lust!

603
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,994
Excuse me.

604
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,756
Sorry to barge in like this...

605
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,991
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

606
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,037
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

607
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,435
Oh-ho-ho!

608
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,100
And there's some question
as to why that is?

609
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,171
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

610
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:53,783
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

611
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:57,044
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...

612
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,281
No ogres!

613
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:00,754
Let's see. Snow White.

614
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:04,589
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

615
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:06,925
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

616
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:10,159
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

617
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:13,202
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

618
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:15,932
No, no, no, no, no!

619
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,409
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

620
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:22,103
All right, look, lady!

621
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:25,876
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

622
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:29,079
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

623
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,687
Oh! Sorry.

624
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:32,812
Ah... that's okay.

625
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:35,221
We were just leaving.

626
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:37,954
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

627
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:39,825
Just... go.

628
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,227
Come on, guys.

629
00:43:57,148 --> 00:43:59,048
TGIF, eh, buddy?

630
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:03,646
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

631
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:16,458
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

632
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,501
Man, that stinks!

633
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:21,799
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

634
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:29,304
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!

635
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,473
Already our minds are becoming one.

636
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:37,485
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

637
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,146
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

638
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,487
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

639
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:45,892
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

640
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:48,021
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,

641
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:50,999
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

642
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:52,363
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

643
00:44:52,469 --> 00:44:53,834
Shrek, are you off your nut?

644
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:55,496
Donkey, keep watch.

645
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:57,574
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.

646
00:44:57,675 --> 00:45:01,634
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

647
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:04,646
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.

648
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:07,478
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

649
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:11,611
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

650
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,655
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

651
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:17,215
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."

652
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:19,628
Sorry. No handsome.

653
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:23,957
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

654
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:26,161
Well, what does it do?

655
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,566
It says "Beauty Divine."

656
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,040
In some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

657
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:34,667
Especially us talking ones.

658
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:36,871
Donkey!

659
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:40,414
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

660
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,220
Can we get on with this?

661
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:54,121
Hurry!

662
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:04,139
Nice catch, Donkey!

663
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,208
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

664
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,681
Come on!

665
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:20,316
# You spurn my natural emotions

666
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:24,190
# You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt

667
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:31,066
# And if I start a commotion

668
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:34,763
# I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse

669
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:42,139
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

670
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:44,737
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

671
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:48,113
# In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

672
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:58,183
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

673
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:00,923
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

674
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,522
# With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

675
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:06,799
# Fallen in love with

676
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:12,634
# Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with?

677
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:18,108
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

678
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:23,084
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

679
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:27,512
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

680
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:31,059
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

681
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,288
Whoa, what happened here?

682
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:36,457
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

683
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,058
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

684
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:41,535
I will smite him where he stands!

685
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:45,631
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

686
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,210
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

687
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,908
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

688
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,018
Pardon. Um...

689
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:59,384
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

690
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,422
What?

691
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:02,457
Oh...

692
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:06,591
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

693
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:12,096
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

694
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:14,796
"For you and your true love.

695
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:17,567
"If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

696
00:48:17,674 --> 00:48:20,472
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."

697
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:24,274
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

698
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,978
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

699
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,054
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

700
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:35,557
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

701
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:40,597
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

702
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:45,064
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

703
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:48,195
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

704
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,205
allow me to take the first sip.

705
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:53,743
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

706
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,971
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

707
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,639
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.

708
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,741
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

709
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,853
How do you feel?

710
00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:13,127
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

711
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,357
You still look like an ass to me.

712
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:18,492
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

713
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:23,338
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

714
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,103
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.

715
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:29,076
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

716
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:30,840
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

717
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,314
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

718
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,390
But I love Fiona more.

719
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,255
Shrek, no! Wait!

720
00:49:55,038 --> 00:49:59,475
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

721
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,339
Maybe it's a dud.

722
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:04,440
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

723
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:11,678
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

724
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:15,121
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!

725
00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:18,524
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

726
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:20,688
I'm melting!

727
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:22,697
It's just the rain, Donkey.

728
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,134
Oh.

729
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:10,579
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

730
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:13,241
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

731
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:17,420
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

732
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:20,613
# The sun'll come out...

733
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,520
# Tomorrow

734
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,286
# Bet your bottom...?

735
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,225
Bet my bottom?

736
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:28,628
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

737
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:30,393
Donkey?

738
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,365
Are you all right?

739
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:36,303
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

740
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,115
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

741
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:50,986
What is it, darling?

742
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,679
Dad...

743
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:55,121
I've been thinking
about what you said.

744
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,991
And I'm going to set things right.

745
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:00,561
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

746
00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:03,360
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

747
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:06,197
I'm going to go out and find him.

748
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:09,363
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

749
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,372
Fiona, please!

750
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:17,447
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

751
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:21,544
Fiona!

752
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:06,328
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

753
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:10,256
Good morning, sleepyhead.

754
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:12,925
Good morning!

755
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:14,560
We love your kitty!

756
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:18,368
- Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

757
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,033
Thanks.

758
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:21,110
Uhh!

759
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:25,171
Aahh!

760
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:26,249
Oh...

761
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:30,712
A cute button nose?

762
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:32,822
Thick, wavy locks?

763
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,758
Taut, round buttocks?

764
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,150
I'm... I'm...

765
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:39,558
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

766
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:41,324
I'm Jill. What's your name?

767
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,561
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

768
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,967
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

769
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,801
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.

770
00:53:50,907 --> 00:53:52,433
Get in line.

771
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,443
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

772
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,309
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

773
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:01,449
I can whinny.

774
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,644
I can count.

775
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,955
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!

776
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:10,718
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

777
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:13,990
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."

778
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,155
Pah!

779
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:19,725
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

780
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,430
"Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders."

781
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,600
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!

782
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:29,913
What?

783
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:33,542
Senor? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

784
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:37,210
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."

785
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:39,652
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

786
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,554
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

787
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:45,150
I'll be true... enough.

788
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:48,695
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

789
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:49,823
Oh...

790
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:51,423
And take it from me, Boss.

791
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:54,629
You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

792
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:57,332
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

793
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,806
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

794
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,878
- Easy.
- ... cantankerous, foul,

795
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,741
angry ogre you always been.

796
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:06,008
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

797
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,676
Yeah.

798
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,309
Well...

799
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,821
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

800
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,890
First things first.

801
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:19,484
We need to get you out of those clothes.

802
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,825
- Ready?
- Ready!

803
00:55:28,738 --> 00:55:30,763
Driver, stop!

804
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:33,967
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

805
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:35,772
I'm blind! Tell the truth.

806
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:37,574
Will I ever play the violin again?

807
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:39,376
You poor creature!

808
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,677
Is there anything
I can do for you?

809
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,979
Well, I guess there is one thing.

810
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,055
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

811
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:53,425
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

812
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:04,637
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

813
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:13,814
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

814
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,408
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

815
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:25,361
# Oh, yeah

816
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:38,432
# Turn and face the strange

817
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,634
# Ch-Ch-Changes

818
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:43,542
# Don't wanna be a richer one

819
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:45,376
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

820
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,042
# Turn and face the strange

821
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:50,084
# Ch-Ch-Changes

822
00:56:50,186 --> 00:56:53,121
# Just gonna have to be
a different man

823
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:55,690
# Time may change me

824
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:58,919
# But I can't trace time

825
00:57:01,197 --> 00:57:02,164
Halt!

826
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:05,723
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

827
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:13,638
# Still don't know what
I was looking for

828
00:57:13,743 --> 00:57:19,238
# And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets

829
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,409
# Every time I thought
I'd got it made

830
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:25,112
# It seemed the taste
was not so sweet

831
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,223
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

832
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,881
# Turn and face the strange

833
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:31,585
- Shrek?
- # Ch-Ch-Changes

834
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,391
# Don't wanna be a richer one

835
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:37,227
# Time may change me

836
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,928
# But I can't trace time

837
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:41,003
Fiona?

838
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,274
Hello, handsome.

839
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:49,442
Shrek!

840
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:52,877
- Princess!
- Donkey?

841
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:55,109
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

842
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,445
What potion?

843
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:59,714
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

844
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:01,984
Now, we're sexy!

845
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:04,351
Shrek?

846
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:11,192
For you, baby... I could be.

847
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:13,598
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

848
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,000
He went inside looking for you.

849
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:18,874
Shrek?

850
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:22,437
Fiona! Fiona!

851
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:26,541
You want to dance, pretty boy?

852
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:33,048
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

853
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:35,389
Fiona?

854
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,087
Shrek?

855
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:41,993
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

856
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:43,759
What happened to your voice?

857
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:47,963
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

858
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:50,665
But not the way I feel about you.

859
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,207
Fiona?

860
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:55,976
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

861
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,810
Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

862
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:03,510
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

863
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:07,054
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

864
00:59:07,223 --> 00:59:09,623
but, well, what do you think?

865
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:16,559
Fiona! Fiona!

866
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:19,895
Fiona!

867
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:23,962
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

868
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:27,566
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

869
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:33,580
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

870
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,509
I just wanted her to be happy.

871
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:38,951
And now she can be.

872
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,989
Oh, sweetheart.

873
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:44,958
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

874
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:49,088
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

875
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,464
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

876
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:56,699
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

877
00:59:56,806 --> 01:00:00,799
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

878
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:10,082
But...

879
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,653
I love her.

880
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:14,586
If you really love her...

881
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,716
you'll let her go.

882
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:22,653
Shrek?

883
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:23,823
Senor.

884
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:26,902
What's going on?
Where are you going?

885
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:37,546
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

886
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:45,310
# People just ain't no good

887
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:52,025
# I think that's well understood

888
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:53,755
There you go, boys.

889
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,797
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

890
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,265
Hey. Why the long face?

891
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:01,794
It was all just a stupid mistake.

892
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:06,572
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

893
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,676
I hate Mondays.

894
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:14,409
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

895
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,075
What choice do I have?

896
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:19,620
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

897
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,781
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

898
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,359
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

899
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:27,657
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

900
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,324
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

901
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:33,766
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

902
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:40,532
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

903
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:42,008
Mom and Dad approve,

904
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:45,444
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

905
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:47,379
Everybody wins.

906
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:49,678
Except for you.

907
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:53,084
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

908
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:54,520
Aye.

909
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:58,083
And that's why
I have to let her go.

910
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,897
Excuse me, is she here?

911
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,125
She's, uh... in the back.

912
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,198
Oh, hello again.

913
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,567
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

914
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:17,976
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

915
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:23,883
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

916
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:27,445
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

917
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:29,420
I mean,
how charming can I be

918
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:31,891
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

919
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:34,020
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

920
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,463
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

921
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:41,867
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

922
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:45,134
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

923
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:49,644
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

924
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:51,680
which will be Charming.

925
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:55,784
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

926
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:58,284
I can't. I won't do it.

927
01:02:58,388 --> 01:02:59,855
Oh, yes, you will.

928
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:03,550
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

929
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,187
And I can take it away
just as easily.

930
01:03:07,297 --> 01:03:10,494
Is that what you want? Is it?

931
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:13,969
- No.
- Good boy.

932
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,765
Now, we have to go.

933
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,102
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

934
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,437
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

935
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:23,341
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

936
01:03:23,446 --> 01:03:25,073
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

937
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:26,978
Mother?

938
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:30,210
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

939
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:31,285
The ogre!

940
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:37,192
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

941
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:41,864
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

942
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:45,297
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

943
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:48,461
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

944
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:50,300
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

945
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:52,340
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

946
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,933
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

947
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:58,036
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

948
01:03:58,147 --> 01:03:59,478
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

949
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,112
What the heck are the crumbs for?

950
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:05,243
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

951
01:04:05,388 --> 01:04:08,016
Oh, aren't they adorable!

952
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:11,218
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

953
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:13,227
Tired old thing.

954
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,863
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

955
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:20,094
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

956
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:22,763
It's the Fairy Godmother!

957
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:26,069
Hello, Far, Far Away!

958
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,403
Can I get a whoop whoop?

959
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,147
May all your endings be happy and...

960
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:37,309
Well, you know the rest!

961
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:40,388
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

962
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:42,388
after these messages.

963
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:44,084
I hate these ball shows.

964
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,320
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

965
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:51,025
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

966
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:53,762
Whizzes on you guys.

967
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,963
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

968
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,267
No, to your left. Your left!

969
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:04,438
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!

970
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,948
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

971
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,109
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

972
01:05:10,253 --> 01:05:12,949
their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly.

973
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,087
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

974
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:21,319
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

975
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:23,456
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

976
01:05:23,566 --> 01:05:26,000
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

977
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:28,070
You capitalist pig dogs!

978
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,236
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

979
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,404
Find Princess Fiona!

980
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:40,175
I'm a donkey!

981
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,910
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

982
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:45,586
Quick! Rewind it!

983
01:05:46,622 --> 01:05:49,056
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

984
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:17,953
Darling?

985
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:20,955
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

986
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:24,618
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

987
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,192
I'm not going.

988
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:30,288
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

989
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:34,335
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

990
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,165
I mean, look at him.

991
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:40,976
Yes, he is a bit different,

992
01:06:41,077 --> 01:06:44,103
but people change
for the ones they love.

993
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:47,410
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

994
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,245
Change?

995
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,512
He's completely lost his mind!

996
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:55,146
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

997
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:58,158
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

998
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:01,424
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

999
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,557
I'd give anything to have him back.

1000
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:10,829
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

1001
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,872
Otherwise I'm up all night.

1002
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,407
Thanks.

1003
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:25,418
I got to get out of here!

1004
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:28,149
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

1005
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:29,690
What about my Miranda rights?

1006
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:32,555
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

1007
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:34,857
Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

1008
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:37,489
You have the right to remain silent.

1009
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,158
What you lack is the capacity.

1010
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:43,761
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

1011
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:46,137
Shrek? Donkey?

1012
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:48,575
Too late.

1013
01:07:48,744 --> 01:07:51,941
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

1014
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:53,241
Oh...

1015
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,384
Fire in ze hole!

1016
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:19,469
Look out below!

1017
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,912
Quick! Tell a lie!

1018
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:26,709
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

1019
01:08:26,882 --> 01:08:29,851
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"

1020
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,011
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1021
01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:38,519
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!

1022
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:41,793
It looks like you
most certainly am are!

1023
01:08:41,897 --> 01:08:43,421
- I am not!
- What kind?

1024
01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:46,092
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

1025
01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:47,565
- Are not.
- Are too!

1026
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,365
- Are not!
- Are too!

1027
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:51,167
Here we go. Hang tight.

1028
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,646
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

1029
01:08:58,347 --> 01:08:59,314
Ow!

1030
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,915
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1031
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:06,146
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

1032
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:08,188
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

1033
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,087
We've got to stop that kiss!

1034
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,023
I thought you was going
to let her go.

1035
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:14,392
I was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1036
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,694
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

1037
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,563
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.

1038
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:22,638
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

1039
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:28,574
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

1040
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:36,648
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1041
01:09:36,786 --> 01:09:40,222
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1042
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,790
Because we're gonna need flour.

1043
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:45,918
Lots and lots of flour.

1044
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,698
Gingy!

1045
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,169
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

1046
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,142
It's alive!

1047
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:13,185
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

1048
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,522
Go, baby, go!

1049
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:27,001
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

1050
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:31,472
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

1051
01:10:39,281 --> 01:10:41,943
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1052
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:45,951
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

1053
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:48,556
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

1054
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,284
Pretty pony.

1055
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:53,894
Ladies and gentlemen.

1056
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:58,729
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1057
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:03,264
Shrek, what are you doing?

1058
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:06,569
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1059
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:08,540
Is that glitter on your lips?

1060
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:11,545
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

1061
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:15,447
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

1062
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:20,684
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

1063
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,224
Ladies and gentlemen.

1064
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,729
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

1065
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:32,267
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

1066
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:35,031
Fiona, my Princess.

1067
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:37,662
Will you honor me with a dance?

1068
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:42,768
# Where have all the good men gone

1069
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:45,711
# And where are all the gods?

1070
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:46,907
Dance!

1071
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:50,713
# Where's the streetwise Hercules

1072
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,447
# To fight the rising odds?

1073
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,125
Since when do you dance?

1074
01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:02,026
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing I know,

1075
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:05,396
it's that love is full of surprises.

1076
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:08,026
# Late at night I toss and I turn

1077
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:12,631
# And I dream of what I need

1078
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,867
Hit it!

1079
01:12:19,648 --> 01:12:21,275
# I need a hero

1080
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:25,410
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

1081
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,618
Man the catapults!

1082
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:31,419
Aim! Fire!

1083
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,689
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

1084
01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:45,268
Not the gumdrop button!

1085
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,477
Incoming!

1086
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,173
Ha-ha! All right!

1087
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:04,820
# Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

1088
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,554
Go, Mongo! Go!

1089
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:12,427
Man the cauldrons!

1090
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:19,264
After you, Mongo.

1091
01:13:22,011 --> 01:13:26,243
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

1092
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,346
Shrek!

1093
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,053
More heat, less foam!

1094
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:38,922
# Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

1095
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:41,963
# Out where the lightning
Splits the sea

1096
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:46,865
# I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

1097
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,630
Heave! Ho!

1098
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,275
No...!

1099
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,234
Come on!

1100
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:31,604
Look out!

1101
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:35,410
Be good.

1102
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:39,253
He needs me!
Let me go!

1103
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:44,317
Donkey!

1104
01:14:53,635 --> 01:14:55,034
Puss!

1105
01:14:58,107 --> 01:15:00,507
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

1106
01:15:03,312 --> 01:15:05,746
Today, I repay my debt.

1107
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,319
On guard!

1108
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,653
# He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

1109
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:26,289
# And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight

1110
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:29,269
- # I need a hero?
- Stop!

1111
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:38,372
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

1112
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:43,809
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

1113
01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:46,182
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

1114
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,458
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1115
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:52,321
I see London! I see France!

1116
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:53,725
Whah!

1117
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,464
I'm a real boy!

1118
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,439
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

1119
01:16:07,242 --> 01:16:08,209
Catch!

1120
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,603
Donkey!

1121
01:16:13,315 --> 01:16:14,282
Oh!

1122
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:16,350
I'm a real boy. Aah!

1123
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:17,918
Oh!

1124
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:21,187
- Ha!
- Ah.

1125
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,018
That's mine!

1126
01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:28,720
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

1127
01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:30,455
And Donkey!

1128
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:33,501
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

1129
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:37,839
No!

1130
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:57,549
Hi-ya!

1131
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,959
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1132
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:06,023
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1133
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:09,969
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea.

1134
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:12,471
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1135
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,838
I told you.

1136
01:17:15,944 --> 01:17:20,108
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

1137
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:30,757
Woo!

1138
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:32,660
Ha!

1139
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,707
Oh, Dad!

1140
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,509
- Is he...?
- Yup.

1141
01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:54,677
He croaked.

1142
01:17:56,952 --> 01:17:58,112
Harold?

1143
01:17:58,253 --> 01:17:59,185
Dad?

1144
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,488
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

1145
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,821
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

1146
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:07,122
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.

1147
01:18:08,096 --> 01:18:09,154
To both of you.

1148
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:12,199
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

1149
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:15,432
But I can see now...

1150
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,164
she already has it.

1151
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,333
Shrek, Fiona...

1152
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:25,311
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

1153
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:28,178
and my blessing?

1154
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,547
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.

1155
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:34,178
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1156
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:38,618
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1157
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:40,661
warts and all.

1158
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,964
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

1159
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:48,161
Midnight!

1160
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:51,872
Fiona. Is this what you want?

1161
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:54,933
To be this way forever?

1162
01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:58,706
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

1163
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:00,406
we can stay like this.

1164
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,441
You'd do that?

1165
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,519
- For me?
- Yes.

1166
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:17,161
I want what any princess wants.

1167
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:19,928
To live happily ever after...

1168
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:26,700
with the ogre I married.

1169
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,780
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

1170
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:34,940
You cannot make me cry!

1171
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:58,470
Whoa!

1172
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:03,408
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.

1173
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,377
Oh, no.

1174
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:29,301
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1175
01:20:32,741 --> 01:20:36,142
Now, where were we?

1176
01:20:36,244 --> 01:20:38,542
Oh. I remember.

1177
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:49,680
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

1178
01:20:49,825 --> 01:20:51,417
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

1179
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,099
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

1180
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,932
# She's into superstitions

1181
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:05,632
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

1182
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:08,369
- Sing it, Puss!
- # I feel a premonition

1183
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:10,911
# That girl's gonna make me fall

1184
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:13,503
Here we go!

1185
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:16,379
# She's into new sensations

1186
01:21:16,518 --> 01:21:18,918
# New kicks in the candlelight

1187
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,614
# She's got a new addiction

1188
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,191
# For every day and night

1189
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:26,487
# She'll make you take your clothes off

1190
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:29,723
# And go dancing in the rain

1191
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,856
# She'll make you live her crazy life

1192
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,435
# But she'll take away your pain

1193
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:37,994
# Like a bullet to your brain

1194
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,540
# Upside inside out

1195
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:42,906

Are you serious?
