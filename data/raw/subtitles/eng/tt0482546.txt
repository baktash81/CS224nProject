1
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,890
There's something delicious about
writing the first words of a story.

2
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,010
You can never quite tell
where they'll take you.

3
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Mine took me here.

4
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,430
Looking back, the city and I
never much liked each other.

5
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,780
An unmarried woman, after all,
was expected to behave in

6
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,610
very particular ways.

7
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,970
Which did not include traipsing
from publisher to publisher

8
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,790
with a gaggle of friends.

9
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,720
Now, listen to me,
you must not be afraid.

10
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,470
And don't talk too much.

11
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,640
Friends who, sadly, others were
not so keen to meet.

12
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,340
I've been selling my drawings
for greeting cards, place cards,

13
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,740
etcetera for seven years.

14
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,160
Bunnies in jackets
with brass buttons.

15
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,900
How ever do you imagine
such things?

16
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't imagine them.

17
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,920
They're quite real.
They're my friends.

18
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,510
Are you based the animal
characters on your friends?

19
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,020
No, the animals are my friends.

20
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,850
Before Peter Rabbit there was
Benjamin Bunny,

21
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,070
and then Sir Isaac the Newt.

22
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,890
I have their drawings as well,
if you'd like to see them.

23
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,190
That won't be necessary.
Unfortunately, Miss Potter.

24
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,600
It is 'Miss' Potter, is it not?
Yes. Of course. Silly of me.

25
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,340
Unfortunately, the market for
children's books...

26
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,450
Yes, of course.
I completely understand.

27
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,860
It was silly of me,
with no experience of these...

28
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,780
F. Warne and Company would like to
publish your little book, Miss Potter.

29
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,990
But best not to get overly hopeful.

30
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,160
I know publishing your book will
not sell a great number of copies,

31
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,950
but I think we can turn
a small profit.

32
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,020
My dear Mr Warne, well,
I'm pleased. Very pleased indeed.

33
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,560
I shall do everything possible to
ensure that you've not made a mistake.

34
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,310
Miss Wiggin, I believe we can go.

35
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,570
Thank you very much indeed.
Messrs Warne, for your time.

36
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,860
Our pleasure. My brother always
knows what he's doing.

37
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,050
Oh, I'm quite particular about
book size and price,

38
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,320
and I'd like to avoid that
dreadful Gothic typeface

39
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,790
your children's books usually have.

40
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,990
I'm sure everything will be
to your satisfaction.

41
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,870
Miss Potter.

42
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,170
Your...

43
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,340
Of course.

44
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,650
My portfolio.

45
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,200
Come along, Peter.

46
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,830
- Sir Isaac, the newt!
- You can't be serious, Fruing.

47
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,000
- That book won't sell ten copies.
- Of course not!

48
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,810
- However, the thought did occur to me...
- Norman!

49
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,110
We promised our little brother
a project.

50
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,510
If he makes a muck of it,
what will it matter?

51
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,250
I think Miss Potter may turn out
to be a Godsend.

52
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,880
Home, Miss Potter?

53
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,690
No, Saunders.
Drive me through the park.

54
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,830
Through all the parks.

55
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,820
- I beg your pardon, Miss Potter?
- Drive!

56
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,730
Walk on.

57
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,710
We did it!

58
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,740
Did you hear my heart?
It was a kettle drum.

59
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,530
You see? We cannot stay
home all our lives.

60
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,120
We must present ourselves
to the world.

61
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,010
And we must look upon it
as an adventure.

62
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,430
Faster, Saunders!

63
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,490
- Faster, Saunders, if you please!
- No, Miss Beatrix. No!

64
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,700
- Fast as you can, old boy.
- Go on!

65
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,990
Oh, I say!

66
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,990
Saunders.

67
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,350
Beatrix, where have you been?
It's after four o'clock.

68
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm not a child. I can do things
without my mother's permission.

69
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,340
I was hoping to use the carriage
myself this afternoon.

70
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,400
Where were you?

71
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,460
I took a drive.
With my friends.

72
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
You don't have any friends.

73
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,380
Yes, I do, Mother.
Every time I draw.

74
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,240
Some of your paintings are
quite pretty, Beatrix,

75
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,230
but I'm not going to deceive you
as your father does

76
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,420
and call them great art.

77
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,170
Well, my friend,
when I am a published author

78
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,990
then we shall see.

79
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,180
Beatrix, Bertram,
time for good nights.

80
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
- I haven't finished yet.
- Come on, hurry up.

81
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,820
- Bertram.
- There! I got him.

82
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,600
- Bertram, you're barbaric.
- Come on, you two.

83
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,520
Hurry up. Down you go.

84
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,390
Slowly!

85
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,120
Hurry, Rupert! It won't do t
be late to the 'Hydes'.

86
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,320
Doesn't Mama look beautiful,
Beatrix?

87
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,820
Being in a temper puts such
a rose into her cheeks.

88
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,030
When you grow up, Beatrix,
and have to run a household,

89
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,810
plan parties, keep a social calendar
and put up with a man

90
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,540
who's never been introduced to a clock,

91
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,850
your cheeks will glow too.

92
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,820
Look at this ribbon.

93
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,900
That's unsightly.
Change her into something decent.

94
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,970
And give this nightdress away.

95
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,980
Oh, this will never do.
I'm just all fingers and thumbs!

96
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,520
You're impossible, Rupert!
We are so late.

97
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,250
What have you drawn today, Beatrix?

98
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,760
Benjamin Bunny having a rest.

99
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,150
His ears are getting
better and better.

100
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,080
This shading here is very good,
Beatrix.

101
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,580
Say your good nights now, children.

102
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,170
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Beatrix.

103
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,290
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Beatrix.

104
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,300
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Bertram.

105
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,330
Good night, Father.

106
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,380
Now, hurry upstairs.

107
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,970
- Come on, mustn't make Mama and Papa.
- later than they are.

108
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,000
- Oh, children.
- What now?

109
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,050
On my way home, I happened to
walke down Piccadilly.

110
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,160
And what do you think
jumped into my pockets?

111
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,390
Something very special for
the young entomologist.

112
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,170
And something very suitable for
the young lady

113
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,960
who's very soon to grow up
to run a fine home,

114
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,110
just like her mother.

115
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,990
- We'll open them upstairs. Come on.
- Thank you, Father.

116
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,970
- Thank you, Father.
- Come on.

117
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,340
- Late, late late!
- We are not late.

118
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,170
We will never be invited
to the Hydes' again.

119
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,570
Heaven's sake, Helen,
it's polite to be a little late.

120
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,630
Now get in the carriage.

121
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,890
This isn't polite late,
this is late, late.

122
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,070
Right, wee ones,
one story and then bed.

123
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,300
I want Beatrix to tell a story.
Hers are funny.

124
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,360
Indeed they are, and I know exactly
what it'll be about.

125
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,810
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.

126
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,030
Precisely. Tom, Hunker,
are you ready to play in a story?

127
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,830
Oh, yes. We're excellent actors.

128
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,090
Well, we shall see about that.
This will be your test.

129
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,430
Over there.

130
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,530
Once upon a time, those two excellent
housekeepers, Lucinda and Jane,

131
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,700
bought some shiny new porcelain
food which they set out

132
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,380
on their perfectly appointed
dining room table.

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,700
Then, they decided to go for a walk.

134
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,680
Suddenly, there came a scuffling
noise from the kitchen.

135
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,950
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker crept out.

136
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,660
The two mice saw that
the dining table was set for dinner.

137
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Tom Thumb leapt up and
took a big bite

138
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,710
from the first plate
and broke his tooth.

139
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,010
Who we expecting someone?

140
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,840
That's my publishers.

141
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,540
It's not a social call.
In fact, I'm rather dreading it.

142
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,220
I wish you wouldn't invite
trades people in to the house.

143
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,670
They carry dust.

144
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,310
Well, next time,
I shall go to their office.

145
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,980
Mr Norman Warne.

146
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,090
Miss Potter.

147
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,310
I hope you will forgive my intrusion
into your daily routine.

148
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,380
I was expecting one of the...

149
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,360
Ah, yes,
I am Harold and Fruing's brother.

150
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,560
I've recently joined the firm
and they have done me

151
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,060
the great honour of assigning
your book to me.

152
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,950
Thank you. It was most gracious
of you to invite me to...

153
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,580
- Tea.
- Yes, I would love some.

154
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,790
Yes, thank you.
Lemon.

155
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,620
Thank you.

156
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,330
Extraordinary!

157
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,740
Funny!

158
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,350
Delightful and magical and
so beautifully drawn.

159
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,040
I am utterly, utterly speechless.

160
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,680
Perhaps we should discuss
our business, Mr Warne.

161
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,380
I put your drawings aside with
the greatest reluctance.

162
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,600
Your brother's letter makes
two proposals

163
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,760
which I find quite unacceptable.

164
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,940
First, they'd like the drawings
to be in colour.

165
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm adamant they be
in black and white.

166
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,440
But Peter Rabbit's blue jacket
and the red radishes,

167
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,510
Surely you would like your enchanting
drawings reproduced as they are?

168
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,420
Well, of course I would prefer colour,
but colour will make the book cost

169
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,870
far more than little rabbits
can afford. I'm adamant.

170
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,560
Which brings us to
your brother's second point.

171
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,110
They wish to reduce the number
of drawings by nearly a third.

172
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,850
Totally unacceptable.

173
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,350
Let me explain.
The idea of reducing the number

174
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,540
of drawings was not my brother's
but my own.

175
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,340
If we can reduce the number
to 31 precisely,

176
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,640
then the illustrations for
the entire book could be printed

177
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,900
on a single sheet of paper using
what we call the three-colour process,

178
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,150
that you desire, and at a relatively
low level of cost. Yes?

179
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,230
I've given your book a great deal
of attention, truly.

180
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,340
I would like it to look
colourful on the shelf

181
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,330
so that it stands out
from ordinary books.

182
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,240
You have given it some thought.

183
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,510
Which other books have you
supervised, Mr Warne?

184
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,090
Personally?

185
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,670
- Yes.
- This will be my first.

186
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,430
Miss Potter, I have recently
informed my brothers and my mother

187
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,690
that I am no longer content to
stay at home and play nursemaid

188
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,040
solely because I am the youngest son.

189
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,240
No. I would like a proper job,
working for my family's firm

190
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,250
and they have assigned me you.

191
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,030
Does that make things clearer?

192
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,450
In other words,
you have no experience whatsoever,

193
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,140
but because you've made
a nuisance of yourself,

194
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,780
demanding a chance,
they've fobbed you off on me.

195
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,330
Miss Potter, I know all too well
what my brothers intended,

196
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,980
giving me your, your 'bunny book',
as they call it,

197
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,730
but I find your book quite
enchanting, delightful,

198
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,400
and if they intended to fob me off,
as you say, then we shall show them.

199
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,090
We shall give them a bunny book
to conjure with,

200
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,970
In colours, mixed to your
satisfaction in front of

201
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,080
your very eyes at the printer.

202
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,420
At the printer?

203
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,870
Oh, I could never.

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,070
I will escort you there myself.

205
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,850
If you will allow me the the honour.

206
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,480
Why would I never?

207
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,590
Of course I'll go.
I'm a grown woman.

208
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,140
Miss Wiggin will be there.

209
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,070
I see absolutely no reason why
an artist shouldn't visit her printer.

210
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,790
Excellent, Miss Potter.

211
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,780
Jolly good. Thank you.

212
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,810
I shall make all the arrangements,
and I am, in every way,

213
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,210
my dear lady, at your service.

214
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,300
You and rabbits, extraordinary.
Excuse me.

215
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,640
Johnson, come and get
the charms, would you?

216
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,710
- Slowly, slowly. Put it there.
- I will be careful, ma'am.

217
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,700
One, two, three... ten.

218
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,930
When I was ten, my mother badgered
my father into spending the summer

219
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,370
in the Lake District,
as did other fashionable families.

220
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,150
Like an animal released from its cage,
I fell under its spell.

221
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,520
Mind your frocks now.
Come here!

222
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,270
The woods are full of fairies
and little folk that look for

223
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,280
children that get their
clothes dirty.

224
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,410
And when they find them,
they send the fairy beasts at night,

225
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,390
with sharp teeth and a ready
appetite for young flesh.

226
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,790
- I'm coming to get you, Bea!
- No

227
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,600
Yes!

228
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,190
Bertram. Bertram!

229
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,220
Don't! They're farmers' children.
Their hands. Germs. Come on.

230
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,760
Bertram! Bertram!

231
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,790
Catch him, Bea!

232
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,400
There he is!

233
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,640
Oh, yes!

234
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,600
Out of the way!

235
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,160
There!

236
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,810
There he is.

237
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,450
I don't think a thrashing
will be necessary.

238
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,340
I'll just leave the window
in the nursery unlatched tonight.

239
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,250
The fairy beasts will
take care of the rest.

240
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,080
No! I'll stay clean!

241
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,280
Bertram.

242
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,420
Really, Beatrix, What young man
is ever going to marry a girl

243
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,760
with a faceful of mud?

244
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,390
Well, I shan't marry,
so it doesn't matter.

245
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,930
Of course you shall marry.

246
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,470
All girls marry. I did.
Your grandmother did.

247
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,070
Even Fiona will one day.

248
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,000
- Well, I shan't. I shall draw.
- Oh, those silly drawings.

249
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,360
Then who will love you?

250
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,000
My art and my animals.
I won't need more love than that.

251
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,030
Perhaps not at 11, but let's see
if you still feel the same way at 18.

252
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,580
I drew Mama when we first met
and she married me.

253
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,860
And, Fiona, doesn't mud wash off?

254
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,390
Bertram, come along.

255
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,730
Die, you little devil!

256
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,790
Right. Prince Charming himself
couldn't resist

257
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,140
such a bonny, wee girl.

258
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,310
Not when he meets my brother,
Vlad the Impaler.

259
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,580
- Got you!
- Bedtime my young reprobates.

260
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,410
Now, shall I leave a window
open, or?

261
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,820
No! I don't like fairy beasts.

262
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,700
Well, it is a well-known fact that
fairy beasts never eat a child

263
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,770
when he's tucked up in his own bed.

264
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,420
The fairies have been
in the north country

265
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,490
for hundreds of years,
and have had many adventures.

266
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,270
I told you about you
a changingly child?

267
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,040
No.

268
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,970
Yes, several times.

269
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,170
I want to hear it.

270
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,340
Oh, go ahead, Fiona.
I'll tell myself a story.

271
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,580
Right.

272
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,380
Once upon a time,
there was a king and a queen.

273
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,750
Once upon a time,
there were four little rabbits.

274
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,590
Their names were...
Flopsy, Mopsy...

275
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,060
Cotton-tail and Peter.

276
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,410
'Now, my dears,
said old Mrs Rabbit one morning,

277
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,190
'you may go into the fields
or down the lane,

278
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,560
'but don't go into
Mr McGregor's garden.'

279
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,900
'Why not, Mother?'

280
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,740
'Because your father had
an accident there.

281
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,580
He was put in a pie
by Mrs McGregor.'

282
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,860
Peter, who was very naughty,
ran straightaway to

283
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,100
Mr McGregor's garden,

284
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,790
and squeezed under the gate.

285
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,100
I like it.

286
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,940
But round the end of
the cucumber frame,

287
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,590
whom should he meet,
but Mr McGregor!

288
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,000
Peter was out of breath and
trembling with fright,

289
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,100
and he had not the least idea
which way to go.

290
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,610
- It's muddy, actually.
- One more, Mr Mortimer.

291
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,560
Lighten it up.

292
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,760
Mr McGregor caught sight of him
at the corner,

293
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,390
but Peter did not care.

294
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,830
He slipped underneath the gate
and was safe at last

295
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,550
in the wood outside.

296
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,840
Not quite. See here?
It's still a bit...

297
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,140
When Peter came home
his mother put him to bed

298
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,930
with a tablespoonful of camomile tea.

299
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,010
But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail
had bread and milk

300
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,220
and blackberries for supper.

301
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,820
This book, it's changed things
for me, Mr Warne.

302
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,080
How so?

303
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,130
For one thing, it's given me
the chance to prove to my mother

304
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,500
that an unmarried woman of 32 can
do more than attend tea parties

305
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,950
- and smile at dull conversations.
- Yes, indeed.

306
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
You know, my family never wanted me
to get into publishing either.

307
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,430
We do make rather a good team,
don't you think?

308
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,090
Provided, of course,
we prove them wrong.

309
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,500
Mother, this is Miss Potter.

310
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,970
At last, we poor forgotten folk
in Bedford Square get to share

311
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,690
some of Norman's excitement.

312
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,390
Mrs Warne, it's so kind of you
to invite me.

313
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,930
Nonsense. It was the desperate
act of a woman who was beginning

314
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,280
to forget what her son looked like.

315
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,590
Mother!
And this is my sister, Amelia.

316
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,640
Hello.

317
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,710
Norman allowed us a peek at
Peter Rabbit, Miss Potter.

318
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,300
We found it utterly charming.
So we wheedled, cajoled,

319
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,380
and absolutely insisted that
Norman bring you round for tea.

320
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,450
I have decided that you and I
are going to be friends.

321
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,270
Have you?

322
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,690
Well, Norman tells me that
you're unmarried, as am I,

323
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,140
and that you're not
unhappy about it.

324
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,060
And I can't tell you how much
that pleases me.

325
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,640
Why can't you talk about
the weather like other girls?

326
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,330
Well, all the other unmarried
daughters in our circle,

327
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,960
and, believe me, there are many
they sit around all day,

328
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,850
gossiping and unaccountably
bursting into tears.

329
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,460
But you have done something.
You've written a book.

330
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,210
I warn you, I am prepared to
like you very much.

331
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,800
Well, in that case, I shall have
to like you too, Miss Warne.

332
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,110
Call me Millie, and that's to be
the last of Miss Potter too,

333
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,590
I'm afraid.

334
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,980
Absolutely. Beatrix, by all means.

335
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,670
Thank goodness, the tea!
I'm beginning to feel quite ill

336
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,010
with all this bonhomie.

337
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,460
Oh, do let's have tea
in the garden, Mother.

338
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,560
It's too beautiful a day
in every way not to share it

339
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,010
with the flowers.

340
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,800
Well, I love to garden.
Mother disapproves,

341
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,210
but I can't help myself.
I love flowers shockingly.

342
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,310
That's why you have
the hands of a greengrocer.

343
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,460
I do not!

344
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,880
Thank heavens Norman sometimes
deigns to read to me.

345
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,720
If I had to rely on you
for companionship,

346
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,540
I should expire of loneliness.

347
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,740
My mother's taste in books,
Miss Potter, and, I'm afraid,

348
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,330
in life, runs to the er...
melodramatic.

349
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,070
Oh, nonsense.

350
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,420
I like good English biographies
and you know it.

351
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,690
I loathe silly romances, such as
the ones your brothers publish.

352
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,320
My brothers and I, Mother.

353
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,340
I am part of the firm now too,
you know.

354
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,710
A sweet-natured boy like you
does not need to work.

355
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,810
Your brothers provide quite well
for all of us,

356
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,210
and I need your smile here.

357
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,060
But then, no-one listens to
a crotchety old lady

358
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,830
in a wheelchair.

359
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,460
Indeed they don't, Mother.

360
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,000
My mother may be crotchety,
Miss Potter,

361
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,020
but she does have an eye
for beautiful things.

362
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,210
She was fascinated by your drawings.

363
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,580
Utterly unique.

364
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,770
Well, when I see something unusual,
I'm not content just to look at it.

365
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,870
I must capture it.

366
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,140
Last summer, in the farmyard,
I was drawing something

367
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,640
that was quite lovely in the sun,

368
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,760
and suddenly, I realised I was
drawing the pigs' swill bucket.

369
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,040
I had to laugh at myself.

370
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,160
I feel a bit of a chill, Norman.
Can you take me inside?

371
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,700
- Of course.
- Please excuse me.

372
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,100
It was delightful meeting you,
Miss Potter.

373
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,960
And you.

374
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,470
Do stay longer, and teach
Millie how to behave.

375
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,640
I think that means she likes you.

376
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,960
Did she say she likes to
draw swill buckets?

377
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,600
Indeed she did, Mother.
Indeed she did.

378
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,550
I think by Wednesday, you could
hang the lace curtains upstairs.

379
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,630
- Then at least it will look like summer,
even if it doesn't feel like it. -Yes, Madam

380
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,710
Oh, Beatrix. What is this stain
on your blouse?

381
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,820
Jane says it won't wash out,
and she's tried everything.

382
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,930
- Oh, it's ink.
- Ink?

383
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,720
I must have brushed against
something at the printers'.

384
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,500
Jane, I'm very sorry for causing
you extra work.

385
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,480
Jane, take the blouse away.
Give it to the poor.

386
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,460
This behaviour shows scant
regard for your father's money.

387
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,480
Well, one day, I shall make enough
money to buy my own clothes.

388
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,370
I'm far too old to be living off
the generosity of my father.

389
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,900
You're too old to be
spending so much time

390
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,370
in the company of a man
who takes you to printers!

391
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,630
Your father does not approve,
and neither do I.

392
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,930
Mr Warne is publishing my book.

393
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,530
Oh, that book! I can hardly wait
till it's finished and forgotten.

394
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,370
I don't understand you, Beatrix.

395
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,340
Your father and I have introduced
you to so many suitable young men

396
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,980
of your class, young men of fortune,
and impeccably good family.

397
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,310
Oh, certainly, like that charming
fellow, Lionel Stokely.

398
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,050
Lionel is a particular favourite
of his uncle, the earl,

399
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,730
whom we visit every summer
at Stokely Court.

400
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,450
Oh, and I do regret terribly that
I didn't accept Harry Haddon-Bell.

401
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,550
Harry's great-grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

402
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,390
Harry's grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

403
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,410
Harry's father
went to Sandhurst.

404
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,290
And so I went to Sandhurst.

405
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,600
Father and I and the gamekeeper often
go out riding in the morning...

406
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,810
Ashton's a crack shot.

407
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,080
But no, you're just
a pig-headed girl.

408
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,570
Mr Warne is asking for you
at the door, Miss.

409
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,830
Mr Warne? He's not expected.

410
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,330
Unannounced. Perfection!

411
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,550
Come on, here.

412
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,650
Two sold while we were
at the booksellers.

413
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,960
That amounts to 40 in a week.

414
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,980
- Which is 160 in a month.
- Good gracious!

415
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,760
I'm trying to remember
my twelve-times table.

416
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,570
1,920 in a year.

417
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,440
- I can't breathe.
- That's just in one shop.

418
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,230
My dear Miss Potter,
you are an author.

419
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,140
We have achieved
what we set out to do.

420
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,250
We have created a book.

421
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,470
Yes.

422
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,580
What's the matter?

423
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,460
A cloud just passed across your face.

424
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,550
You've been very generous
with your time, Mr Warne,

425
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,190
Shown me things that
I never would have seen.

426
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,820
Printing houses!

427
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,680
- I shall miss your company.
- Are you losing my company?

428
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,430
It just occurred to me
that the book is out

429
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,800
and our association is
coming to an end.

430
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,040
Miss Potter.

431
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,610
I had hoped that you might
have other stories.

432
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,850
Really?

433
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,870
Really?

434
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,440
Do you know, I recently remembered
one I thought I had forgotten it.

435
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,690
About a duck...

436
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,140
a very stupid duck.

437
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,870
Based on one of your friends?

438
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,910
It's based on myself, I think

439
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,310
It's a story I told a friend once.

440
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,210
My family summers in the Lake District,
and there was someone there,

441
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,050
the grounds man's son, who was
always interested in my stories.

442
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,920
Miss Beatrix. Are you skulking?

443
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,520
No such thing, Willie Heelis. No.
I was drying off my sketch book.

444
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,300
Not bad, Miss Beatrix.

445
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,470
Do you have any animal
stories for me today?

446
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,160
I don't. Sorry. Nothing new.

447
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,260
That's Jemima.
She doesn't have a story yet.

448
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,790
Not a proper one.

449
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,960
- Jemima Duck?
- Jemima Puddle-Duck.

450
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,940
And a stupider duck
the world has never seen.

451
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,580
She goes looking for a safe
place to lay her eggs

452
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,170
and meets a charming gentleman
with a long bushy tail

453
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,470
and very sharp teeth.

454
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,920
Precisely.

455
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,650
The gentlemen offers her his shed
and Jemima is surprised to find

456
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,470
that there are so many feathers in it.

457
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,020
But then, as I told you,
she is a very stupid duck.

458
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,650
I like it.

459
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,640
I'd love to paint every view
in this valley,

460
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,940
but I'm not very good at landscapes.

461
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,730
Wait too long and it won't be
here to paint, Miss Beatrix.

462
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,000
- Really, that's ridiculous.
- No, I'm serious.

463
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,450
The large farms are being broken up
into small plots and sold off.

464
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,720
Well, you can't stand
in the way of progress.

465
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,060
So they say.

466
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,440
But I say beauty's
worth preserving.

467
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,880
I know you do, Willie.

468
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,660
But nobody could disagree
with you about that.

469
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,220
Well, I'll see you soon, then.

470
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,860
Perhaps not, Miss Beatrix.
I'm leaving for Manchester next week.

471
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,970
To study the law?

472
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,040
Yes, indeed. I have to better
myself somehow.

473
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,220
- Good luck.
- Send me some drawings.

474
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,460
I will.

475
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,120
He encouraged me to take
my writing seriously.

476
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,400
We must get started on
the new story straight away.

477
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,980
Jemima Puddle-Duck.
I think the public should like that,

478
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,500
and Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.
What do you think?

479
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,920
Well, if you, if you think.

480
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,030
Your book has been very
important in my life.

481
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,350
You have been very
important in my life.

482
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,780
And you in mine, Mr Warne.

483
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,850
- And we must do it again and again.
- And again!

484
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,440
I promise you,
I intend to be a nuisance.

485
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,790
When did you decide
you wouldn't marry?

486
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,380
Just before my 20th birthday.

487
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,940
Mother came to my room and
announced that Lionel Stokely

488
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,100
was to marry Gwendolyn Alcott and
they were to live at Stokely Court,

489
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,890
which Lionel had just
inherited from the earl.

490
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,220
And I knew right then that
she would bring me no more suitors

491
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,140
and that I would never marry.

492
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,600
And that shocked me.

493
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,860
But I felt relieved.

494
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,350
And that shocked me.

495
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,250
So I went into the garden and filled
an entire notebook with sketches.

496
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,880
Men are bores.

497
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,800
They're useful for only
two things in life

498
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,390
financial support and procreation.

499
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,240
Millie!
You say outrageous things!

500
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,510
- Ah, but the price.
- What price?

501
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,110
Domestic enslavement.
Childbirth. Terrifying.

502
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,110
No, unmarried women have
a better life.

503
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,930
I swear it's true.

504
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,440
No houses, no babies, no husbands
demanding things all the time.

505
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,030
As long as one's lucky enough
in life to have a good friend.

506
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm so glad Norman found you, Beatrix.

507
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,310
I was missing something
I didn't even know.

508
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,870
Dear Miss Potter,
I enclose with great pleasure

509
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,900
the latest in what I hope
will be a long line of tales.

510
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,010
Yours affably, Norman Warne.

511
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,450
Mr Warne.

512
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,520
Would you and Millie like to
come to a Christmas party?

513
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,150
My parents hold one every year,

514
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,420
and I think it's high time
that I invited someone.

515
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,450
Yes, we'd be delighted to attend.
Thrilled, in fact.

516
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,450
Be still, little imps!

517
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,560
Peter, you naughty boy!

518
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,770
Look what an example you're setting.

519
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,480
That's better. Any more of that
and I'll paint you out.

520
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,230
Your father is home.

521
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,720
How was your day at the club, Father?

522
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,220
Interesting, as always.

523
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,100
Rupert, we seem to have a situation.
We need your resolution.

524
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,130
I want to invite Norman Warne and
his sister to our Christmas party.

525
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,720
With Lady Armitage?
With Sir Nigel and Sybil?

526
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,800
A tradesman, Rupert!
How will anyone have fun?

527
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,780
He's the gentleman
who publishes my books, Father.

528
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,960
- Rupert.
- I have something here, Beatrix.

529
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,620
I went into Hatchards bookshop and
I purchased this with good money.

530
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,890
Hugh Whitteford bearded me in
the club and rattled on for hours.

531
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,000
You know old Hugh, jowls all aflutter.

532
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,440
Wife's bought three of
your girls' books

533
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,780
for her granddaughter's nursery.

534
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,890
Sending more by ship
to chums in Bombay.

535
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,550
Very soon, the whole club was
telling me of some purchase

536
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,530
that they had made of
our daughter's creation.

537
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,350
So I thought it was time
that I bought one.

538
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,720
So I went straight into Hatchards,
put my shilling onto the counter.

539
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,770
I would have given you one.

540
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,310
But I wanted to buy one
like everyone else.

541
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,400
Now, I owe you an apology, Beatrix.

542
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,140
When you showed me your books,
all I saw was my little girl

543
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,300
bringing me clever drawings
for me to comment on.

544
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,910
You're not a little girl anymore.
You're an artist.

545
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,630
The genuine article.

546
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,730
I would have been proud to use
that word about myself,

547
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,320
and now, I'm proud of you, Beatrix.

548
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,770
Thank you, Father.

549
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,790
So I don't see any reason why
we cannot make a little social effort

550
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,310
to welcome the gentleman responsible
for this blessing into our home.

551
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,840
Thank you, Father.

552
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,910
Thank you.

553
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,570
I think it will be good
for all of us.

554
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,810
Merry Christmas, Rupert.

555
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,190
Glenys, don't serve Sir Nigel
the punch with brandy

556
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,810
- unless he demands it.
- Yes, madam.

557
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,120
And after dinner, he'll take port.

558
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,480
Come and give me a little signal
after he's had four glasses.

559
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,080
The house shimmers, my darling.
You've done it again.

560
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,930
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

561
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,950
- Mr Warne, Millie,
- how wonderful!

562
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,200
Thank you, Jane.

563
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,500
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,870
Mother, Father,
I would like you to meet

565
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,410
Miss Amelia and Mr Norman Warne.

566
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,580
How charming of you
to be so punctual!

567
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,950
Go on, one wouldn't hurt.

568
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,950
I think Wiggin is under strict
orders never to leave our side.

569
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,580
How festive!

570
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,310
Such scintillating conversation.

571
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,950
Oh, mine as well! The weather
in Amsterdam in July.

572
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,020
Could I interest you ladies
in an after dinner coffee?

573
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,620
Some of the gentlemen would like
to play a few hands of cards,

574
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,160
but they're short of a fourth.

575
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,980
I don't suppose you play whist,
Mr Warne?

576
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,180
I'm afraid I've never had
much aptitude for cards.

577
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,880
- Oh, that is a pity.
- I play.

578
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,800
This is to play with Sir Nigel,
Miss Warne.

579
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,820
Sir Nigel takes his whist
very seriously.

580
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,830
I play rather well, actually.

581
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,460
Do you, Millie?

582
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,750
Well, I'm sure you two have
plenty to talk about without me,

583
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,860
and if they can't play
without a fourth...

584
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,540
Come along, Miss Warne.

585
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,160
Carols in the music room, my dears.

586
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,250
Perhaps I could show you
your Christmas present.

587
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,300
Yes.

588
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,020
It's upstairs.

589
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,560
I will bring the coffee.

590
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,350
- Mrs Wiggin.
- Miss.

591
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,450
Miss Wiggin. I have taken
the liberty of adding

592
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,760
a splash of brandy to our coffees.

593
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,380
Well, it is Christmas.

594
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,230
Is this where you paint, Miss Potter?

595
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Yes, and it's where we shall
find your Christmas present.

596
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,450
Oh, my!

597
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,330
I think, other than Bertram and Father,
you are the first man ever

598
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,290
to set foot in this room.

599
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,940
- Would you like me to leave?
- No, no, no. Wiggin is here.

600
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,920
And if this is the best I can do
for scandal at my age,

601
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,990
I'm hardly worthy of my reputation
for creativity.

602
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,100
Here.

603
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,940
My, but it's beautiful!

604
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,240
Is it the new story?

605
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,930
Miss Potter, is it the new story?

606
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,140
- Is it?
- I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,350
Come over here.

608
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,130
That's Jemima Puddle-Duck.

609
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,640
It's the first drawing I ever did
of Jemima. I was eight, I think.

610
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,340
Jemima, stop that!

611
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,930
Stop what?

612
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,470
Just some silliness.

613
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,610
- And what's this?
- Oh, it's a music box.

614
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,110
My father gave it to me
for my sixth birthday.

615
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,550
He did the painting himself.

616
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,270
So your father is an artist too?

617
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,160
No. He always wanted to be an artist,
but the family disapproved.

618
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,880
So, he took up law.

619
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,720
The joke is I've never once
heard him discuss a case.

620
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,270
He goes to his club every day,
and never his office.

621
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,100
So, I don't really know
what he does.

622
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,680
- Oh, dear.
- Wiggin is fallible.

623
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,510
I'm afraid, Miss Potter, your
reputation is now officially dented.

624
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,550
'Let me teach you how to dance'.
Do you dance, Miss Potter?

625
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,850
No. Well, not well.

626
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,470
I make a terrible hash of it too
when I try,

627
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,030
but the words are very sweet.

628
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,000
You know the words?
Will you sing the words?

629
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,630
Well, er...

630
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,670
#Let me teach you how to dance

631
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,530
#Let me lead you to the floor

632
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,050
#Simply place your hand in mine

633
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,940
#And then think of nothing more.

634
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,450
#Let the music cast its spell

635
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,260
#Give the atmosphere a chance.

636
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,860
#Simply follow where I lead

637
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,040
#Let me teach you how to dance.

638
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,770
Miss Potter.

639
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,520
I know you have decided not to marry.

640
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,010
All my life, I thought that
I would not marry either

641
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,700
but something has happened that
has caused me to change my mind.

642
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,620
No, please, let me go on,
for if I do not say

643
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,830
what I have to say it now,
I fear I never will.

644
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,110
Miss Potter,
I would like you to consider...

645
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,070
Mr Warne.

646
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,620
doing me the honour, and I do not
expect an immediate answer.

647
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,870
Beatrix?

648
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,290
I was just showing Mr Warne
his Christmas present.

649
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,570
I'm an impeccably genteel,
unmarried lady, Mother.

650
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,880
I haven't begun to invite
men to my room.

651
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,120
Mr Warne?

652
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,690
Wiggin!

653
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,390
What is the picture, Beatrix?

654
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,400
I've written and drawn
little children's books,

655
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,330
which have been published.

656
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:05,030
The man who published them is here.
Mr Norman Warne.

657
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,150
To thank him for his assistance
and generosity...

658
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,840
Well... I'm...

659
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,150
I'm writing him a Christmas story.

660
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,180
- Can we hear it?
- It isn't finished, so...

661
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,620
Oh, go on.

662
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,390
I suppose, before we part
for the evening,

663
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:31,000
I could share a glimpse of
the unfinished tale of

664
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,320
'The Rabbits' Christmas Party'.

665
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,430
One particularly snowy Christmas Eve,
a young rabbit and

666
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,610
his fearsome older brothers
and fiercely brave sister

667
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,160
set out on a journey they make
every year to celebrate

668
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,890
with their friends.

669
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Now, rabbits are highly sociable
creatures, and legend has it that

670
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,610
wherever they find themselves
on Christmas Eve,

671
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,460
they get together and
throw a jolly party!

672
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,070
Now, I know such a legend exists
because I made it up.

673
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,440
The rabbits travel through
the woods to the well-appointed

674
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,910
burrow of their cousins where
a warm fire is waiting for them.

675
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:23,580
They take off their frosty coats
and the party begins!

676
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,530
Now, I know on this night
that they will eat and talk

677
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,410
and dance and laugh and
roast apples on the fire!

678
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,740
But I'm not certain
how the story ends,

679
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,670
because I haven't made
that part up yet.

680
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,770
But, in any case, Mr Warne will
have to read it first,

681
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,650
as he is my strict censor,

682
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,230
and, well, it is his present.

683
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,060
Merry Christmas, Mr Warne.

684
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,030
Thank you, Miss Potter.
It's so beautiful.

685
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,990
There'll be no problem with presents
for the grandchildren next year,

686
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,160
- I dare say.
- You must be very proud, Helen.

687
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,750
It's just a children's story.

688
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,340
Outstanding!

689
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,930
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

690
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,840
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

691
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,430
No. As my confidante.

692
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,100
You have something to confide?
How delicious!

693
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,500
Your brother has asked me
to marry him,

694
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:33,370
and I feel, quite irrationally,
that I may say, 'yes'.

695
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,920
I'd like your approval.

696
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,670
My approval?

697
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,560
Beatrix, don't be a fool.

698
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,860
Marry him.

699
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,570
Tomorrow. Don't waste a moment.
How could you hesitate?

700
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,010
You're not upset?

701
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,730
Well, why would I be upset?

702
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,340
Well, both Norman and I.
You'll be alone.

703
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,770
You have a chance for happiness,
and you're worrying about me?

704
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,450
I wouldn't worry about you if,
if someone came along

705
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,710
who loved me and whom I loved,
I would trample my mother.

706
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,790
- Do you love Norman?
- Yes.

707
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,300
Then marry him. Don't you dare
think about anyone else.

708
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,600
But what about all
the blessings of being alone?

709
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,670
Hogwash.

710
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,060
What else is a woman on her own
supposed to say?

711
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:28,140
You have a chance to be loved.
Take it.

712
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,970
And leave me happy,

713
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,130
knowing that the two people
that I love are happy.

714
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,470
That is the most thought
you should ever have for me.

715
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,730
There you are, Beatrix!
The guests.

716
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,070
Yes, Mother.

717
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,370
Millie...

718
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,850
Go.

719
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,360
What is going on tonight?

720
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,590
Why do I feel like a stranger
in my own home?

721
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,370
You have a clever daughter, Rupert.
You must be very proud.

722
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,440
- Of Beatrix? Yes, we are.
- To write and draw like that!

723
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,150
Beatrix should meet my niece, Anne.
She makes pots.

724
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,600
- Ceramics, Nigel.
- Look like pots to me.

725
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,950
As for you, madam,
I suggest you take up knitting.

726
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,290
Merry Christmas.

727
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,110
What was all that about?

728
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,030
Sir Nigel disapproves of the way
I play whist.

729
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,520
I'm afraid I won two guineas from him.

730
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,770
Mr Warne!

731
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,270
- Your painting.
- Oh, yes. My Christmas present.

732
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,290
Yes.

733
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,180
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.

734
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,300
Sir?

735
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,190
I have an appointment to see
Mr Rupert Potter in the Eagleton Room.

736
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,490
- He's expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

737
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,370
Come along, Norman,
it's only her father.

738
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,460
Come in.

739
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,740
Thank you very much, Mr Potter,
for taking the time

740
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,360
out of your very busy day.

741
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,900
Goodbye, Mr Warne.

742
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,050
If you will not accept our advice
in this decision,

743
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,780
then we will have to impose
that advice.

744
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,040
Respect our knowledge and
the worth of our opinions, Beatrix.

745
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,310
Oi! Get over there!

746
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,720
I said that I'll do it and I will.

747
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,310
Norman Warne is a tradesman, Beatrix.
No Potter can marry into trade,

748
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,230
- and that's final.
- And what are we?

749
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,730
Father's money comes from
Grandfather's printing works

750
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,700
in Lancashire.
A trade, Mother.

751
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,720
And if Grandfather hadn't
run for parliament,

752
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,700
we'd still be living
in the shadow of his factories.

753
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,710
Your legacy came from Grandfather
Leech's cotton trade.

754
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,030
When did we become
so high and mighty?

755
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,570
We're parvenus, Mother.
Social climbers.

756
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,820
Your father and I We will not
allow this marriage for your own good,

757
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,350
and there is no reason to
become insulting!

758
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,940
It's not an insult!
It's the truth!

759
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,200
Our lives are pretension and
social aspiration.

760
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,220
Sir this and Lady that!

761
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,390
Norman Warne is a gentleman
of comfortable means,

762
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,570
and not one bit beneath us,
and I intend to marry him.

763
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,740
Not if you expect to take
one penny of your inheritance!

764
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,840
You haven't disinherited Bertram
for running off

765
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,150
with a wine merchant's daughter.

766
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,320
Happily, I am a published author.
I have means of my own.

767
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,210
This discussion is over.

768
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,230
Come in, Father.

769
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,980
Why is it that after any difficult
situation, she always sends you?

770
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,710
Mama didn't send me.

771
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,760
I don't like tension in my home.
I want to resolve this matter.

772
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,260
Well, you can't.
I've made my decision.

773
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,680
Your mother wants what is
best for you, as do I, Beatrix.

774
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,880
An impulsive and inappropriate
marriage is something that

775
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,710
you would ultimately regret.

776
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,010
You can't allow me to
marry and leave.

777
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,120
With Bertram moved away,
who would take care of you?

778
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,230
You surely do not think
we would deny you happiness

779
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,640
just simply because we needed
a nursemaid?

780
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,600
That is a knife in my heart.

781
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,710
Well, then, what is it, Father,
because I cannot understand.

782
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,730
You cannot make us the villains,
Beatrix.

783
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,470
Your mother trotted out countless
suitors all of them acceptable.

784
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,160
- You rejected every one of them.
- I know that, Father.

785
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,140
I didn't want to be a silly woman
marrying a man simply

786
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,220
because he was acceptable,
or rich enough to take care of me.

787
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,680
But does that mean that
I'm never to be loved?

788
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,470
Father?

789
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,280
Wiggin, wait here, please.

790
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,020
I'd like to enquire about my
royalty earnings, Mr Copperthwaite.

791
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:24,130
And whether I might, at some stage,
afford a house of my own

792
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,720
in the country.

793
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:30,130
You have enough to buy an estate.
Several estates, and a house in town.

794
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,820
You're quite a wealthy woman,
Miss Potter.

795
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,700
Am I truly?

796
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,310
Yes, the income has become
quite regular.

797
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,960
If your fortune continues to grow,
you should have no financial worries

798
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,980
for the rest of your life.

799
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,870
Extraordinary.

800
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,870
Beatrix.

801
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,560
Beatrix, come and sit with us,
please.

802
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:13,210
- I'd rather not, Father.
- We have something to discuss.

803
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,970
A proposition.

804
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,520
And, for heaven's sake, Beatrix.
Let the servants carry your dishes.

805
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,970
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

806
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,550
Nonsense. You always take tea.

807
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,620
Contrary to what you think and
what you have so vehemently

808
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,610
expressed, your mama and I
want you to be happy.

809
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,980
We simply doubt that
this marriage will do the trick.

810
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,960
Helen, please.
Sit down, Beatrix.

811
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,470
What we don't want is for you
to rush into something

812
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,870
which you may later wish
to reconsider.

813
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,210
I won't want to reconsider.

814
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,000
- We are not convinced.
- Helen, please.

815
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,750
We are not convinced.
Yet, neither have we hearts of stone.

816
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,220
Therefore, this is what we propose.

817
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,830
You may accept Mr. Warne,

818
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,150
but it must remain a complete
secret even from his own family.

819
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,740
Now, this summer, yourself,
Mama and I will go,

820
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,850
as always, to the Lake District.

821
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,840
If, at the end of the summer,
you still wish to proceed,

822
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,010
then we will announce
your engagement

823
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,850
and you can marry with
our blessing and our love.

824
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,690
Why must no one know?

825
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,800
So there'll be no public
embarrassment when you change.

826
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,610
- If, If you change your mind.
- If.

827
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,450
Now, Beatrix, if you care for
this man as much as you say you do,

828
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,190
then in a few months the ardour
will still be there.

829
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,040
If your mother, and I, are correct,
and this emotion cools with time,

830
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,040
then we will have protected you
against humiliation and unhappiness.

831
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,210
- It will not cool.
- Beatrix, listen to me.

832
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,220
A woman at your age must
consider very carefully...

833
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,640
Mother, the only thing true
at my age is that at my age,

834
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,840
every day matters.

835
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,520
Very well, Mother, Father,
I accept your terms.

836
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,670
Norman and I may decide to
wait in any case.

837
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,710
But make plans.

838
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,690
There will be a wedding
in this house by October.

839
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,190
They're beautiful.

840
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,940
Which carriage, Rupert?

841
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,860
Saunders?

842
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,330
Four carriages down.
This way.

843
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,820
Well...

844
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,240
- This is the Potters' for Windermere.
- Right you are, sir.

845
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,890
Here and those two.

846
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,070
Beatrix!

847
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,540
Mr. Warne!

848
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,470
Oh, I do apologise.

849
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,940
- Miss Potter!
- Mr. Warne!

850
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,330
I was beginning to fear
you wouldn't come.

851
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,090
You're soaked.

852
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,440
It wasn't raining
when I left the office.

853
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,550
I brought you the proof of
the new book for your trip.

854
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,400
- Oh, you'll catch cold.
- I couldn't miss seeing you off.

855
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,320
You know nothing would stop me.

856
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,390
This is going to be the longest
summer I've ever spent.

857
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,890
- It's only the summer. That's all.
- Yes.

858
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,390
And this time is not for us.
It's for your parents.

859
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,070
How can they know what we're feeling?
They've never felt it.

860
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,280
We can afford them
this three months.

861
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,200
I suppose.

862
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,660
This is not how I wish
to say goodbye to you.

863
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,730
Goodbye, Miss Potter.
I look forward to your speedy return.

864
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,140
As do I, Mr. Warne.

865
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,070
Quickly. Here.

866
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,610
Goodbye, Miss Potter.

867
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,390
Goodbye, Mr. Warne.

868
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,710
Goodbye, Norman.

869
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,490
My dear, dear Norman,

870
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,040
this absurd forced separation
is surely a kind of madness,

871
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:55,480
most notably, that of my mother,
but you are here, my dear, for me.

872
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,980
The beauty of this place seems
magnified somehow,

873
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,900
with you in my mind.

874
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:04,020
In my occasional lonely moments,
I imagine conversations between us,

875
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,430
and yesterday startled a duck with
my declaration of love for you.

876
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,320
All of my thoughts are with you,
my darling.

877
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,590
I know that you find Harold
and Fruing terribly boring,

878
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,600
but, in fact, I'm having
what I could almost describe

879
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,810
as wild enjoyment working
with them.

880
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,830
You may wake up, one day,
to find yourself married

881
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,370
to a businessman.

882
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,260
Praise the day when I can wake up
to find you beside me.

883
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,860
I took one of the boats out
onto the lake at sunset

884
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,460
to watch the water hens feeding.

885
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,970
They made noises like kissing.

886
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,460
I closed my eyes and pictured you.

887
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,860
I find I love my heart more now,

888
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,540
because that is where I know
I can find you.

889
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,130
Amelia sends her fond love and
wishes for us all

890
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,480
to be together again,

891
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,460
as do I, multiplied a hundredfold.

892
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,740
Sir... Hill Top Farm.

893
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,230
May I ask,
is it a working farm?

894
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:08,080
Aye. Another great one falls,
but this one breaks your heart.

895
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,910
Really? Why?

896
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,500
Now, miss, a body would have to

897
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,570
be a poet, which I certainly am not.

898
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,890
Excuse me, but I'd swear you
were someone I once knew.

899
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,810
Good heavens, Willie Heelis!

900
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:22,970
Miss Beatrix! Miss Potter!

901
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,170
- Is that you?
- How good to see you!

902
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,900
Well, hello!

903
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,660
I see you've given up on the law.

904
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,760
Have you decided to make
an honest living?

905
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,930
Ah, yes, the law.
Well, not exactly. No, no.

906
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:39,540
A country solicitor needs to
be proficient in many skills.

907
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,520
And it suits me to be out of
the office now and again.

908
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,830
Now, I could show you Hill Top,
if you have the time.

909
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,830
Yes. Yes.
Time is exactly what I have.

910
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,070
Good.

911
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,380
- Not a bad outlook, Miss Potter.
- It's sublime.

912
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,030
By chance, I met an old friend
today who showed me

913
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,440
a beautiful farm that's for sale.

914
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,600
It would be a perfect country home,
and though I know we'll live

915
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,040
mainly in the city

916
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:20,210
I'm very keen to share
my favourite places with you.

917
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,790
The post has arrived and, once again,
no letter from your Mr. Warne.

918
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,870
Is it time for me to start getting
just a little hopeful?

919
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,030
He did mention he might take
a few days' holiday.

920
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,350
The post is no doubt slow
from wherever he's gone.

921
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,590
Indeed.

922
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,950
But there is something that
appears to be from

923
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,880
that interesting sister of his.

924
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,750
Millie? How delightful!

925
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,590
Excuse me.

926
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,060
Norman is ill.

927
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,740
- I'm Beatrix Potter.
- Please come in, miss.

928
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,830
- Ah, Miss Potter.
- Hello.

929
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,180
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

930
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,470
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Yes. It's very kind of you.

931
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,300
Very, very kind indeed.

932
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,220
How is he?

933
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,710
Beatrix.

934
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,930
Millie?

935
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,300
Millie?

936
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,650
I'm too late.

937
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,130
He was so happy.

938
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,780
He sang songs.

939
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,290
He made me dance with him
in the parlour.

940
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:54,400
He laughed all the time,
everyone noticed the change in him.

941
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,140
Only I knew the reason.

942
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:03,430
But all summer, he had a cough,
and then the cough got worse,

943
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,080
and in one night, he was gone.

944
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:11,200
It was so sudden. I keep thinking
that it hasn't happened.

945
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,280
I keep expecting to see him
in the garden.

946
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,980
When's the funeral?

947
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,180
It was yesterday.

948
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,310
It was only the immediate family,
and I...

949
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,090
Well, I couldn't think of a reason
to ask them to delay it for you.

950
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,590
It was considerate of you to come
and pay your respects, Miss Potter.

951
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,960
Our mother is particularly moved,
and is sorry she isn't well enough

952
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,350
to come down to greet you.

953
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,810
I'll be taking over our late brother's
business affairs, Miss Potter.

954
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,560
Fine.

955
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,450
I want to assure you that F Warne
and company will do everything

956
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:53,470
in its power to ensure that
our tragic loss causes you

957
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,580
the least possible inconvenience.

958
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Please accept the gratitude
of the entire family.

959
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,340
- They want me to go.
- I'm sorry.

960
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,700
Miss Beatrix!
What are you doing in London?

961
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,100
- Is something wrong?
- A friend died.

962
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,540
I'm sorry, miss.

963
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,930
Was she a close friend?

964
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,390
Miss Beatrix?

965
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,900
Miss Beatrix?

966
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,040
I'll leave your dinner outside
the door, then, miss.

967
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,920
Saunders is here, Miss Potter,
to take you to the station.

968
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,090
I shan't be going back to the Lakes.

969
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,910
Can I get you anything, then?

970
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,070
Nothing, Hilda.

971
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,850
Very well, Miss Potter.

972
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,090
Beatrix, it's Millie.

973
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,130
Look, I know I'm unannounced,
but they sent back all my messages.

974
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,780
Please, please, please, let me in.

975
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,430
We've got to get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.

976
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:26,020
Let's get you washed and dressed
and out of this room.

977
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,760
Go and find something to wear.

978
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,690
I can't.

979
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:36,940
Millie!

980
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,150
I can't!

981
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,560
I've been torturing myself.

982
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,440
I should never have encouraged
you with Norman.

983
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,040
I'd have saved you all
this terrible grief.

984
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,620
I loved him.

985
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,150
I loved him too.

986
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,130
But he's gone.

987
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,480
I must leave this house.

988
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,900
I will leave this house.

989
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:46,380
Congratulations, Miss Potter.

990
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,200
You are now the proud owner
of Hill Top Farm.

991
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,610
Thank you, George.

992
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,350
Well, I'm sure you'll be
very happy at Hill Top.

993
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,070
I spent some time there
as a child.

994
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,680
Is that so? I did have other
plans for it, but...

995
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:03,460
I'm sure that I will love it
in any case.

996
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:07,020
Yes. If you need any other
assistance or help...

997
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,090
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

998
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,540
Good day.

999
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,880
Good day, Miss Potter.

1000
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,960
What I don't understand, Beatrix,
is how you're going to pay

1001
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,030
for this farm.

1002
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,710
I'm a writer, Mother.
People buy my work.

1003
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,630
Our daughter is famous, Helen.

1004
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,930
You are the only person
who doesn't know it.

1005
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:45,540
What I don't understand is
why you find it necessary

1006
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,170
to leave your home.

1007
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,380
It is not a choice, Father.

1008
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,830
Beatrix, if I could undo anything...

1009
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,560
There's nothing to undo.

1010
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,450
This has nothing to do
with you or Mother.

1011
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,800
I must make my own way.

1012
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,130
So you must.

1013
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,000
So you must.

1014
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,530
Everybody out.

1015
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,790
You see?

1016
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,150
I told you we could not know
where our journey would lead.

1017
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,770
It has led us here.

1018
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,540
This is your new home.

1019
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,340
No tears!

1020
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,480
Miss.

1021
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:50,840
Millie!

1022
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,190
It's wonderful to see you!

1023
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,490
Oh, this place is perfect.

1024
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,740
Millie!

1025
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,290
What have you brought?

1026
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,800
I thought it best not to
bring this, but then...

1027
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:10,300
it jumped into my hand
as I walked out the door.

1028
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,390
I'm sorry.

1029
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:29,740
Thank you.

1030
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,470
It's getting easier.

1031
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,350
- It's getting etasier for me too.
- Good

1032
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,190
I'm painting again.

1033
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:48,760
My mind's going mad with the story.
I've got pigs running amuck up there.

1034
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,180
Well, it's this place, isn't it?

1035
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,400
Who'd want to be cooped up in London
when they could be up here?

1036
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,290
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.

1037
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,990
I've been so lucky with visitors.
First, my brother Bertram,

1038
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,430
then my mother.

1039
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,310
You think that's lucky?
Your mother is a monster!

1040
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,520
No, its fine. My mother and I have
come to an understanding.

1041
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:15,990
We've agreed to not
understand each other.

1042
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,640
Look, if some city slicker wants to
offer me a half-decent price

1043
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:47,440
for a derelict property and then
pay me and my lads good money

1044
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,550
to knock the damn place down.

1045
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:52,240
Let him build what he likes.

1046
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:55,410
If we allow these city developers
to buy up our land,

1047
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,230
there'll be no more farming.

1048
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:02,100
and all you're left with is
a ruined landscape and no community.

1049
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,570
Miss Potter!

1050
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:10,640
Ah, Mr Heelis.

1051
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,330
I see you've found me.

1052
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,950
I played here so often as a child.
I know your farm very well.

1053
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,310
I swam in the stream,
played hide and seek in the woods

1054
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,040
with Cousin Charles.

1055
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,730
I brought you the executed deed
for the farm.

1056
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,710
At last.
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

1057
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,070
- Busy.
- Yes.

1058
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:38,050
Yes, I've asked Mr Canon to stay on
and run Hill Top as a working farm.

1059
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,980
I'm learning a great deal.

1060
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,760
I wish everyone who bought
land up here could be so...

1061
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,590
enlightened.

1062
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,090
You've bought a farm,
you've kept the workers on,

1063
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,960
you're working the land and
you're preserving this place.

1064
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:53,130
Yes. It makes me happy.

1065
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:58,210
Mr Cannon says the two farms
adjoining mine are for sale.

1066
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,720
I'd hate to see the developers
get hold of them.

1067
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,740
Do you know anything about them?

1068
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,590
- Morning, Mr Canon.
- Miss Potter.

1069
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,110
My, they've grown!

1070
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,370
- Handsome lot, wouldn't you say?
- Yes.

1071
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:17,770
Have you named them?

1072
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,790
We don't often give them names,
Miss Potter.

1073
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,380
Makes it a bit hard,
come slaughtering time.

1074
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,390
Hello, Miss Potter!

1075
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:30,250
Hello yourself, Mr Heelis.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1076
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,650
I've come with a message.
Mr Hubbard is ill

1077
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,150
and will be unable to show you
the neighbouring farms today.

1078
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,050
- Oh, dear. It's not serious, I hope?
- Chronic illness, I'm afraid.

1079
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,880
Recurs several times a month.

1080
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:43,750
Usually after a night
at the Rose And Crown.

1081
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,670
I see.

1082
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,840
Mr Hubbard wondered if I might
show you the properties instead.

1083
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:53,070
I'd be pleased to have
so knowledgeable a guide.

1084
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,570
I'll just get my shawl.

1085
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,480
Well, it's prime land.

1086
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:59,590
There's a lot of profit
in building houses on it.

1087
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,180
But more value as
a working farm, surely?

1088
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,490
Spoken like a true
Lakes woman, Miss Potter.

1089
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,400
Indeed, Mr Heelis.

1090
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,580
You do realise I've never
been to an auction.

1091
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,830
It's simple enough.

1092
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,810
Don't bid too early and
stick to your limit.

1093
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:15,210
I know my limit, Mr Heelis.

1094
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,990
Craven's Mill Farm,

1095
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,630
40 acres of splendour.
£ 1,100 anywhere?

1096
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,560
£ 1,100 I'm bid.

1097
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,000
£ 1,150?
Come along, gentlemen.

1098
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,700
Splendid little farm, this.
Lots of development potential.

1099
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:33,450
£ 1,150.
£ 1,200 anywhere?

1100
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,520
£ 1,200.
£ 1,300 anywhere?

1101
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,110
Bidding, madam?
£ 1,300.

1102
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,470
Seated at £ 1,300.

1103
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,580
£ 1,400.

1104
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,130
£ 1,500.

1105
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,950
£ 1,600.

1106
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,250
Seven hundred.
Eight hundred.

1107
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,170
£ 1,900.

1108
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,880
At £ 1,900.
£ 2,000 at the back. £ 2,000

1109
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:59,430
Any more at £ 2,000.

1110
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,250
£ 2,300.

1111
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,090
- Rich Bastard!
- Thank you, sir. £ 2,300.

1112
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:07,490
At £ 2,300.

1113
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:11,420
Any more, then, at £ 2,300?

1114
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,700
£ 2,500.

1115
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,420
The lady at £ 2,500.

1116
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,690
Against you, sir,
at £ 2,500. £ 2,800.

1117
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:21,470
Miss Potter, you've bid more
than that farm is worth.

1118
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:27,800
£3,000, at £3,000 seated,
with the lady. Against you, sir.

1119
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,250
Are we all done at £3,000?

1120
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,510
Going once,

1121
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,720
Going twice,

1122
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:36,920
Sold to the lady, £3,000.

1123
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,590
Sir, you should control your client.

1124
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,340
She has allowed her emotions
to get the better of her.

1125
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:45,830
Really?

1126
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,090
She has squandered any possibility
of profit from that farm.

1127
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,710
It was prime development land.

1128
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,410
This place, this community
is an inspiration.

1129
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,000
It should be conserved for
future generations,

1130
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,200
and not destroyed.
It deserves protection.

1131
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,030
Madam, your observations are
woefully inadequate...

1132
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:03,870
Please, sir. I am no longer
in the habit of being lectured to,

1133
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,380
and, thankfully, I do not require
your approval or anyone else's.

1134
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,130
So, if you'll excuse us?
Mr Heelis?

1135
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,220
I hope you're not going to make
a habit of this, Miss Potter.

1136
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,590
Do you know, Mr Heelis,
I think I might.

1137
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,040
Now, will you have time tomorrow
to show me those other farms?

1138
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,730
- I certainly will.
- Excellent!

1139
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,210
Come in.

1140
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,360
Oh, my!

1141
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,060
Goodness me!

1142
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,590
I'll be just a moment.

1143
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:22,870
Now then young man, how are you
taking to your new home?

1144
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,950
I know it's not London,

1145
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,440
but Hill Top might suit
a young rabbit better.

1146
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,470
He seems to be taking
to the place.

1147
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,970
As am I, Mr Heelis.

1148
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,660
- Now, the road.
- Oh, yes.

1149
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,380
Yes, of course, Miss Potter.

1150
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,820
How would you feel about
calling me William

1151
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:49,750
instead of this infernal Mr Heelis?
I sound like an undertaker.

1152
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,930
Of course, William.

1153
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:56,160
And I believe Beatrix might be
perfectly appropriate as well.

1154
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:18,330
There's something delicious about
writing the first few words of a story.

1155
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,400
You can never quite tell
where they're take you.

1156
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,890
Mine took me here.
Where I belong.
