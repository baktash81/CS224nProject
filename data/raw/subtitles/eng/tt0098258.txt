00:24:20,908 --> 00:24:23,577
Don't make me sound like a counselor.

337
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,247
I've got statistics and graphs.

338
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:29,667
I got all this stuff
that say the same thing:

339
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:33,129
"You have to decide on a career."

340
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:38,009
My dad's an Army colonel.
He wants me to join.

341
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,428
There's no possible way.

342
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:43,973
Take a look at Seattle Junior College.

343
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:48,353
- You the Keymaster?
- I'm not gonna go there.

344
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:51,857
I'm looking for something bigger...

345
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:55,027
...a dare-to-be-great situation.

346
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:59,906
- Only your record is blank.
- Do people really know what they want?

347
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:04,077
Many think they have to know.
But inside, they don't.

348
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:07,372
I don't know.
But I know that I don't know.

349
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,207
Hang tough, Lloyd.

350
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,045
We were "ultra-competitive"...

351
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:17,299
...but I just want to say
if it wasn't for "Diane Court"...

352
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:22,929
...I wouldn't have gotten in Cornell.
You made me study twice as hard.

353
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,223
So thanks.

354
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:28,352
- You did the same for me.
- I did?

355
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,609
Did you really come here
with Lloyd Dobler?

356
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:41,323
- How did that "happen"?
- He made me laugh.

357
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:47,746
Yes.

358
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,291
He's okay, Dad.

359
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:54,879
You're welcome.
I always call you. You know that.

360
00:25:55,171 --> 00:26:00,593
Stop being so grateful. All right.
I'll be home before dawn, okay?

361
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,012
- Bye.
- Dawn?

362
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:07,183
- Would you guys sign my annual?
- Sure.

363
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:11,145
- Would you sign mine?
- Did you have to call your dad?

364
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:14,607
- God, how nightmarish!
- I promised.

365
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:16,859
- Will he wait up?
- Say nothing.

366
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,862
I come in crying. He leaves me alone.

367
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,408
I loved your speech,
about being scared.

368
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,743
Lloyd Dobler. All right.

369
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:45,638
<i>He...</i>

370
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,019
<i>... likes girls...</i>

371
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:52,896
<i>... with names...</i>

372
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,776
<i>... like Ashley...</i>

373
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,864
<i>... and Tamerlane</i>

374
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,287
I'll be in the kitchen, Joe.

375
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,878
<i>That'll never be me
That'll never be me</i>

376
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,797
<i>That'll never be
Never be me, no!</i>

377
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:22,134
<i>That'll never be me
That'll never be me</i>

378
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,970
Joe. Joe.

379
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:27,514
<i>Sex, love...</i>

380
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:33,062
She's written 65 songs.
Sixty-five. They're all about you.

381
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,940
- They're all about pain.
- So, what's up?

382
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:40,444
So stop playing
with her mind, you know?

383
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:44,323
She's a human being.
She's very talented.

384
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:49,454
Why do you think I keep her tapes?
They're gonna be valuable someday.

385
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:50,705
<i>No</i>

386
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,540
<i>Never</i>

387
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,586
<i>No, never, ever, ever
Don't you ever think it</i>

388
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:03,343
Oh, my God.

389
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:21,319
Joe was my first love, my first sex,
and the whole time he was dating Mimi.

390
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:25,573
He'll never break up with her.
But if I see him, it's:

391
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:28,785
"Hi, Joe. How are you?"
And that is it.

392
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:30,870
I'll be okay.

393
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:34,916
Don't worry.
He's at the other end of the house.

394
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:38,169
It's too bad more guys
can't be like Lloyd.

395
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,549
He checks up on me. Look.

396
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:49,890
I got some more songs.

397
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,726
<i>Joe lies</i>

398
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,313
<i>Joe lies</i>

00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,983
<i>Joe lies</i>

400
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:03,362
<i>When he cries</i>

401
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:07,158
<i>When he cries</i>

402
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:11,746
- So we can finally talk.
- Yeah.

403
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,081
Well... What?

404
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,962
<i>Lakewood, Lakewood, have no fear!</i>

405
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:23,424
<i>How about another year?</i>

406
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,808
- He does this every year?
- The worst job since Keymaster.

407
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:53,455
Hi, Joe. How are you?

408
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,043
I love you.

409
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:00,337
I love you too.

410
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,048
You invade my soul.

411
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:07,219
I wanna get back together.

412
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:13,558
Mimi's gonna go to college,
and I'm gonna be alone.

413
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:18,480
But I'm gonna break up with her
before she leaves.

414
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:29,116
Have sex with me.

415
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,494
Goodbye, Joe.

416
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:46,591
Every year I throw this party.
Every year nobody helps me clean up.

417
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,970
- Why am I yelling?
- I don't know.

418
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:51,014
- We're out of here.
- Thanks.

419
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:56,519
- Maybe we'll help you clean tomorrow.
- Diane, everyone loved that you came.

420
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,730
- You're a great rooster.
- Well...

421
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,606
- Sign this?
- Okay.

422
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:01,941
Hey, Corey.

423
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,404
So I'm single now.
Everything's changed. I hate it.

424
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:12,493
- Give me my Firebird keys!
- You must chill!

425
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,787
You must chill!

426
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:17,957
I have hidden your keys! Chill!

427
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:22,211
- I love you!
- Love you too. Go to sleep.

428
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,256
- We're full-on buds.
- Yeah, all right.

429
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,099
You're a great person.

430
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:38,603
I'm a good person,
but you're a great person.

431
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:42,815
- We're out of there. See you tomorrow.
- See you. Bye.

432
00:31:43,024 --> 00:31:45,068
- Bye, Diane.
- Bye.

Hey, drive safe.

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,783
Thank you.

00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:54,286
I surrender my duties
as Keymaster. A beer.

436
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:56,330
Certainly.

437
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,376
I'm happy to say that this sack
is officially empty.

- Look at this gentleman here.
MIKE: I gotta get home.

440
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,023
I gotta get home.

441
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,610
Excuse me.

442
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,531
How you doing, brother?

443
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,411

[TIRES SQUEALING]

456
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,474
- Look at this one.
- Did you...?

457
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:46,024
So, what did they write
to Diane Court?

458
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,530
Listen to some of the things
they wrote me.

459
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:56,035
"Glad I finally met you.
You always seemed nice."

460
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,496
"Wish I'd known you more."

461
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:03,334
Mine says stuff like,
"Lloyd, see you around, maybe."

462
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:10,007
- Nobody knew me before.
- They knew of you. Now they know you.

463
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:15,930
I feel like I fit in for
the first time, you know?

464
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:21,060
Like I just held them far away
from me, so they did the same to me.

465
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,230
That's cool then.

466
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,398
Yeah.

467
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,402
I'm so glad we did this.

DIANE:
We can walk from here.

469
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,913
- It's just you and your dad?
- Long story.

470
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,791
- You don't wanna hear it.
- Sure, I do.

471
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,006
Well, my parents split up
when I was 13 and...

472
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:55,262
God, I actually had to go to court
and choose between the two of them.

473
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,684
So I chose my dad. Just felt
safer that way, you know?

474
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,769
Watch out for that glass.

475
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,732
Thanks.

476
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,694
- But either way it's still...
- Twisted.

477
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:14,031
You know what? You're a great date.

478
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:18,076
I've never gone out
with someone so basic.

479
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,453
Basic?

480
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,751
- What's your job this summer?
- Being a great date.

481
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,128
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

482
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,423
I wanna see you as much as I can.
I said it!

483
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:35,719
- I only have something like 16 weeks.
- That's a long time.

484
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:41,224
- Then call me tomorrow.
- Today is tomorrow.

485
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,686
- Then call me later.
- Okay.

486
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:53,488
Thanks.

487
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,782
I'll call you later.

488
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,873
Morning, honey.

489
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:08,878
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Good night.

490
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:11,381
Wait. Wait a minute.

491
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,926
How was Lloyd?

492
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,931
Lloyd was a gentleman.
He was funny, nervous and strange.

493
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:25,353
I met people I'd never met before.
Then I blew it. I called him "basic."

494
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,107
- Can you believe I did that?
- Well...

495
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,112
I don't think he's reeling
in embarrassment.

496
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,287
Good night.

497
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:44,330
Good night.

498
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,381
COREY: Lloyd is doomed.
- Meaning?

499
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:57,386
She made this date a family audition,
the kiss of death for Lloyd.

500
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:00,305
- Why?
- Too much pressure. Not his crowd.

501
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:02,474
What's wrong with her?

502
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:07,271
- I told him to be himself.
- He has that nervous talking thing.

503
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:09,440
I told him not to speak.

504
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:14,403
This is a strange thing to say,
but maybe Diane really likes Lloyd.

505

- Yeah.

- Or I could always wear this one.
- That's nice.

I forgot to tell you
who'll be at dinner tonight.

Great meal, you two.

- You look beautiful, Diane.
- Thank you.

Same features. See what

AL: What airline are you flying?
- A charter.

525
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,895
She's not the greatest flyer.

526
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,647
- When she was 8...
- Dad.

- What story?

- If you're gonna tell it, let me.
- Well, let me start.

529
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:24,327
I decide to take her
on her first airplane.

530
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:27,496
I knew how planes flew
but I was nervous.

531
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:29,707
Crash paranoia.

532
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:34,378
I had a list. If babies were on
the plane, it couldn't crash.

533
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:37,715
But their crying meant
they knew something.

534
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:43,095
They closed the doors and she screams,
like nobody I'd ever heard.

00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,931
- You said, "Turn around."
- They did.

- No.

But there's more!

541
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,202
There was somebody on the plane...

542
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,664
...who worked in a recording studio.

543
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:14,002
He's making a sound effects record,
and he wants to record her scream.

- What did we pay for the Wurlitzer?

A matter of $9000?

Old people came, and they love to eat.

00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:17,978
They jammed their mouths, ate with
their mouths open and it was too much.

613
00:45:18,186 --> 00:45:21,148
You think about how short life is...

But I'm not sure I'm right.

Everybody does that.

I just don't want it to get too heavy.
I feel really overloaded.

always happen with bad things.

I know you have to deal with them
at the same time but I just...

653

I don't know why they have
to happen at the same time.

654
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:39,891
I wish I could work out a schedule.
Am I babbling? Know what I mean?

A little more.

That's right. Go around, in first.
Keep it in first.

663

It's kind of all right.

664

- Because... Little more gas.

670
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:54,092
Ease it out. All right.
Don't worry. Minor setback.

671
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:57,888
You feel confident? You feel better.

672
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,974
Now go into second. Little more gas.

673
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:02,267
Yeah.

674
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:05,145
You'll get this. No problem.

675
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:11,610
Now, maybe, you downshift. First.

676
00:50:15,572 --> 00:50:19,951
- Does this sound normal?
- As you get better, you'll hear less.

677
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,085
Brake.

678
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:35,801
Let's switch. Wanna switch?
I'll drive?

679
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:48,314
LLOYD:
I'm sorry.

680
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:52,694
- Let's go. You want to?
- Yeah.

[DIANE MOANS]

683
00:51:35,194 --> 00:51:37,113
LLOYD: Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

684
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,182
Are you shaking?

685
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:05,893
No.

686
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,187
You're shaking.

687
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:13,817
- I don't think so.
- You're cold.

688
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:18,405
- I don't think I am.
- Then why are you shaking?

689
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:20,449
I don't know.

690
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:22,993
I think I'm happy.

691
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:27,998
Here's some blanket.

692
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:35,506
Listen to this song.
It's a really good song.

693
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:01,991
Good morning.

694
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,539
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- You should be.

695
00:53:07,747 --> 00:53:11,584
- I should have called.
- You bet you should have!

696
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:16,131
Don't make me call the police.
Don't make me call hospitals.

697
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:19,801
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I know this is a bad time.

698
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,054
I'm not asking what you did.
I wanna know...

699
00:53:23,304 --> 00:53:25,849
...if you're okay.
- I'm fine.

700
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:29,936
You wanna make things easier?
Tell me where you were.

701
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:32,022
This is bullshit!

702
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:39,529
- You can say anything to me, you know.
- I know that.

703
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,828
I spent the night with him.

704
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:50,791
- Lloyd?
- Dad, yes.

705
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:56,005
And I'm scared to death of what
you must think of me right now.

706
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,432
Sit down.

707
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:23,949
Dad, do you know what he did
the first night I went out with him?

708
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,119
We were walking across by the 7-11...

709
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:34,251
...and he pointed out some glass
for me to walk around.

710
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:41,050
I think of that when people say,
"What are you doing with Lloyd?"

711
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:46,263
And I never get nervous around him.

712
00:54:47,098 --> 00:54:51,478
So we started spending all
this time together, as friends.

713
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:56,900
But I could feel him getting anxious.

714
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:58,819
And then...

715
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:04,199
...I knew that there would be
a confrontation over getting physical.

716
00:55:06,284 --> 00:55:09,996
He started to get that look
at the end of the night.

717
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:12,124
Do you know that look?

718
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:16,878
You know it will be an issue.

719
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:22,134
So I went through all the feelings
and arguments you go through...

720
00:55:22,342 --> 00:55:25,929
- Did he ever get rough with you?
- Dad, no.

721
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:32,769
But I didn't want any problems,
so I decided not to sleep with him.

722
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:36,732
But then I attacked him anyway.

723
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:43,697
It always feels good
to tell you the truth.

724
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,490
Because...

725
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:50,496
...if I can't share it with you,
it's almost like it didn't happen.

726
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,250
Did you sleep with her?

727
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,296
- I admit nothing.
- It's us.

728
00:55:59,547 --> 00:56:04,969
- Look at his face. He did the deed.
- You're an inspiration, Lloyd.

729
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:08,931
All right, calm down.
Nothing's different.

730
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:14,354
Lloyd, listen to me. Everything
has changed. You've had sex.

731
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:18,733
Nothing will ever be the same
between you two.

732
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:23,404
You might be 60, you'll see her,
talk to her, whatever...

733
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:27,283
But what you'll really
be thinking is, "We had sex."

734
00:56:28,576 --> 00:56:31,037
- Your point?
- Do something special.

735
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:33,706
- You gotta make a statement.
- Wait...

736
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:37,502
Show her respect.
Show her you're not like Joe.

737
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,253
- Wait...
- Above all...

738
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,799
...just because this happened
gives you no right...

739
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,427
- You never let me talk.
- What? I'm sorry. Talk.

740
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:50,307
Forgot what I was gonna say.

741
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:52,518
Okay, I remember.

742
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:57,231
- Let him do what he wants.
- All right.

743
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:01,819
Send her flowers
or write her a letter.

744
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:03,862
I already did.

745
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:06,657
- What's it say?
- Just read it.

746
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,492
I can read it?

747
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:13,580
Oh, man.

748
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,876
"Dear Diane:

749
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:23,215
I'll always be there for you.
All the love in my heart...

750
00:57:23,424 --> 00:57:24,758
...LIoyd."

751
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:34,309
I've never gotten a letter
like this. Have you?

752
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:37,438
- I dream about it.
- So, what do you think?

753
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:42,067
- You think I'm...?
- Get ready for greatness, Lloyd.

754
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:52,704
The Cynthia Bramson estate
was worth how much?

755
00:57:52,912 --> 00:57:56,249
- Her family...
- Family? Never heard from them.

756
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:59,377
I sold her house for her.
Made her money.

757
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:02,797
Your income, Mr. Court...

758
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:06,468
...hasn't changed substantially
in 17 years.

759
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:07,844
That's right.

760
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:12,599
Why would you stay so long
with an operation...

761
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:16,019
...that is clearly not
a growth enterprise?

762
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:19,356
Caring for people
isn't a growth enterprise.

763
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:22,942
Write that down.
I'd like your boss to read it.

764
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:30,825
Diane!

765
00:58:31,951 --> 00:58:34,204
Ticket to England came today.

766
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:42,170
Maybe I shouldn't go
with all that's happening.

767
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:43,421
You're going.

768
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:47,968
If a friend were in the same position,
I'd tell her to stay.

769
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:50,763
- You're going.
- It doesn't feel right.

770
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:54,642
<i>- I don't even have the right luggage.
- Bon voyage.</i>

771
00:58:55,142 --> 00:58:59,146
- You're not listening to me.
- Let's stop this right now.

772
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:03,192
Let's not put our energy
into something ridiculous.

773
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:06,362
This isn't smart thinking.

774
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:11,075
Why are you acting this way?
Is it because of the other morning?

775
00:59:11,283 --> 00:59:12,368
MR. COURT:
You love him?

776
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:16,747
- I like him a lot.
- Now, I know you like him.

777
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:19,959
He's not like those
frat kids you dislike.

778
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,670
But when the excitement wears off...

779
00:59:22,878 --> 00:59:25,548
...what are you gonna talk about?

780
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,010
You'll be in an
international think tank...

781
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:33,014
...and he's gonna be
kicking punching bags.

782
00:59:34,682 --> 00:59:37,435
I think you should break up with him.

783
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:40,354
Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.

784
00:59:40,604 --> 00:59:44,191
It'd be best to get on
that plane with no strings...

785
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,403
...because once you leave,
things will change.

786
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:50,824
I've talked about this
with you and with him.

787
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:53,118
It's well-covered territory.

788
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:58,081
I'm not asking you to sever
all relations with the boy.

789
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:00,792
Give him a present. Here.

790
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:04,796
Let him know you still care.
Give him this pen.

791
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,131
A pen?

792
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:10,761
Dad, in a million years,
I would never give him a pen.

793
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:14,681
Why can't I have fun? I like him.

794
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:18,977
"I like him"? I'm talking
about being honest and decent...

795
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:21,188
Dad, I love him.

796
01:00:25,984 --> 01:00:27,235
Great.

797
01:00:28,153 --> 01:00:29,946
No, that's great.

798
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:33,158
It's great to hear
you say that because...

799
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,411
I don't know.
What, am I being selfish?

800
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,791
Why am I so fixated?

801
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:45,337
Maybe because I've got
a lot of troubles with...

802
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:48,299
Is that it? Am I being selfish?

803
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:53,304
I want you to have everything.
Is that wrong?

804
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,643
I owe you an apology.

805
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:02,271
I've just got a few weeks
left with you and we...

806
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,817
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

807
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:11,239
They think I'm guilty.

808
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:18,121
Some computer spits out your name
and another honest man...

809
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:23,334
What's the goddamn point?

810
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:27,922
Live your life.

811
01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:31,718
- I love you.
- Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.

812
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:42,645
All right now, power left!

813
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:44,188
Power right!

814
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:47,734
- Who's world champ?
- Don "The Dragon" Wilson!

815
01:01:47,985 --> 01:01:49,778
MAN:
Lloyd! Telephone!

816
01:01:50,029 --> 01:01:51,572
Keep kicking.

817
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:55,659
Hello?

818
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,120
Hi.

819
01:01:58,328 --> 01:01:59,913
How you doing?

820
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:04,293
Yeah, they actually pay me for this.

821
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,089
I'll pick you up in an hour.

822
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:11,175
See you later.

823
01:02:16,138 --> 01:02:18,057
Check your mail tomorrow.

824
01:02:18,265 --> 01:02:21,518
I sent you a letter. A blue letter.

825
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:23,729
- It came yesterday.
- It did?

826
01:02:23,937 --> 01:02:26,648
- It was wonderful.
- You didn't tell me?

827
01:02:26,857 --> 01:02:30,444
- It was wonderful.
- I never sent a letter like that.

828
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:33,238
I sent it... Well, I don't know...

829
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:36,700
I wanted to say something
but I didn't.

830
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:39,995
But I think I want to now.
But I'm not sure.

831
01:02:40,204 --> 01:02:43,582
Many say it and don't mean it,
but I think I do.

832
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,919
- So I wanted to say...
- We don't have to say it.

833
01:02:47,127 --> 01:02:49,631
- How do you know what it is?
- I don't...

834
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,050
...but thank you.
- I love you.

835
01:02:52,884 --> 01:02:55,804
- I said it.
- I know.

836
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:04,688
- Let's not put things on this level.
- What? This is a good level.

837
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:07,065

1007
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:11,401
I'm supposed to be leaving
on a fellowship...

1008
01:18:11,609 --> 01:18:16,531
...that I worked for my entire life,
and I don't even care.

1009
01:18:19,242 --> 01:18:22,620
I met this boy over the summer...

1010
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:27,292
...and we can't talk because of this.
I can't talk to my dad.

1011
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,794
I wore these clothes. I thought...

1012
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:33,298
...if I looked right,
someone would talk to me.

1013
01:18:33,506 --> 01:18:38,011
But I look and feel awful.
Could you please talk to me?

1014
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:40,388
Be a little decent.

1015

We believe your father
has a large pool of cash...

1016

...from phony billing, phony patients.

Pardon me?

1019
01:19:01,786 --> 01:19:06,540
Check it out for yourself.
See if your father fits the profile.

1020
01:19:06,749 --> 01:19:11,337
- What's the profile?
- Take a look around the house.

1021
01:19:11,545 --> 01:19:15,633
Are there a lot of rugs,
pieces of art, stereo equipment?

1022
01:19:15,841 --> 01:19:19,553
Things bought with cash?
Does he give lots of gifts?

1023
01:19:19,762 --> 01:19:24,892
- Do the major items in your house...?
- You want me to say something.

1024
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,104
Don't let his business
infect your life.

1025
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:31,190
- How can you say that?
- He's guilty.

1026
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,692
No. He's not.

1027
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:39,073
We have the records.
We have the proof.

1028
01:19:40,783 --> 01:19:43,452
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

1029
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:45,788
...but it's going to get worse.

1030
01:19:45,996 --> 01:19:49,418

I would take that fellowship.

What happened to you?

1035
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:23,741
Did you do it?
Did you take that money?

1036
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:26,910
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.

1037
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,165
- Swear to God. I need the truth.
- Honey!

1038
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:34,793
- Swear to God.
- I swear to God.

1039
01:22:36,795 --> 01:22:38,922
I found the money.

1040
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,103
It's not what you think.

1041
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:55,732
- What am I supposed to think?
- About what?

1042
01:22:56,566 --> 01:22:59,361
You stole from them! You lied to me!

1043
01:22:59,611 --> 01:23:03,406
- How do you think I feel?
- You know what this money is?

1044
01:23:03,615 --> 01:23:05,950
No, you don't! It's not for me!

1045
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:09,037
It's for when you
get back from England...

1046
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:11,998
...so you don't have to
depend on anybody.

1047
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:16,086
I take better care of those people
than their families!

1048
01:23:16,294 --> 01:23:20,882
I care for them, give them flowers,
feed them, wipe their mouths!

1049
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:24,844
- But you stole from them!
- I make their lives better!

1050
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:31,184
You let me defend you.

1051
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:36,690
You knew you were guilty, and you
let me become a part of it! How...?

1052
01:23:36,898 --> 01:23:41,736
Go ahead. When I'm old, give me
someone like me, but go ahead.

1053
01:23:41,945 --> 01:23:46,658
I trusted you. I stood up in court
five years ago and picked you!

1054

Why are you being so hateful to me?
Because of Lloyd?

1055
01:23:51,706 --> 01:23:56,043
No. I told you everything,
and you lied to me.

1056
01:23:57,253 --> 01:24:00,965
- I would've done anything for you.
- Work it out.

1057

No! I will.

1058

I won't leave anything out
because I can say anything to you.

1059

- Easy. I'm the only dad you got.

He lied to everybody.

1072
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,139
I just left home.

1073

and Grandpa for 17 years.

I can accept that.

1095
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:22,961
- The state takes the home.
- He can serve immediately.

1096
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:27,966
- I can put that together.
- I'll confirm this with my client.

- She's very successful. Very talented.
- I know.

1113

my daughter over this.
