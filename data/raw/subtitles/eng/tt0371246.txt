00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,995
<i>To Dean of Admission, Princeton University.</i>

2
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,747
<i>The most influential person in my life...</i>

3
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Is Mother Teresa, whose example
helped me overcome the arrogance</i>

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,879
<i>which threatened after my 1,600 SAT score
and National Merit Scholarship.</i>

5
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,466
<i>My most influential person taught me
the most important word I've learned.</i>

6
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,426
Aloha, <i>which I...</i>

7
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,059
<i>To the Dean of Admission,
Princeton University.</i>

8
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,311
<i>From Cristina Moreno.</i>

9
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,942
<i>Most influential person, my mother.
No contest.</i>

10
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,197
<i>I think I have been
pointing toward this essay</i>

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,202
<i>ever since the day, 12 years ago in Mexico,
when my father left.</i>

12
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:26,796
<i>Such was my mother's need to protect me,
that she would not let me see her cry.</i>

13
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,638
<i>The trick was, get over it
as quickly and privately as possible.</i>

14
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:56,033
<i>Such was my need to protect her,
that I never let on that I could hear her.</i>

15
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:10,172
<i>My mother kept us in Mexico
as long as possible</i>

16
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,676
<i>to root me in all things Latin.</i>

17
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,847
<i>Finally, she sensed
our last opportunity for change.</i>

18
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,142
<i>We would leave for America.</i>

19
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,104
<i>"One tear.</i>

20
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,356
<i>"Just one.</i>

21
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,068
<i>"So, make it a good one," she said.</i>

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,875
<i>She would be my Mexico.</i>

23
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,343
<i>Because this admissions essay
is open record,</i>

24
00:02:55,426 --> 00:03:00,097
<i>let me just say that
our transportation into the United States</i>

25
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,433
<i>was economy class.</i>

26
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,439
<i>In order to raise me properly,</i>

27
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:13,611
<i>my mother needed as much of the security
of her own culture as possible.</i>

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>So, we rolled through Texas...</i>

29
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,617
<i>Just 34% Hispanic...</i>

30
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,787
<i>To Los Angeles,</i>

31
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,247
<i>48% Hispanic.</i>

32
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,541
Look at the Detroit Pistons.

33
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,711
And your mother's saying, "Get up.
Get up, honey. Get up." But, no, what of it?

34
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,463
You can't see them. Why?
'Cause they're being killed,

35
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,924
they're being strangled
by the psychotic Raider fans.

36
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,219
What do you have in Oakland?
You got a bunch of psychotic...

37
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,932
<i>A few minutes adrift
in an alien environment,</i>

38
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,104
<i>then we turned a corner,
and we were right back home.</i>

39
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,576
<i>My mother's favorite cousin,
Monica, gave us shelter.</i>

40
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,414
<i>For the next six years,</i>

41
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>neither of us ventured outside
our new community.</i>

42
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,714
<i>Mom worked two jobs,
paying a total of $450 a week.</i>

43
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,388
<i>Each of us doing everything we could
to make things work.</i>

44
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,769
<i>We were safe and happy.</i>

45
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,487
<i>If only I could have stayed six.</i>

46
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,284
<i>But I was blossoming.</i>

47
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,453
<i>And during my very first dance,</i>

48
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:50,040
<i>in the time it took a boy's hand
to go from my back to my bottom,</i>

49
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,086
<i>it was evident
that she would have to leave her night job</i>

50
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,754
<i>to keep a watchful eye on me.</i>

51
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,051
<i>Within days,
she was on her way to a job interview.</i>

52
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,556
<i>She needed $450 from one job.</i>

53
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,894
<i>And that meant,
after all her time in America,</i>

54
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,273
<i>finally entering a foreign land.</i>

55
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,655
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,035
Yeah, hi. We're here for
the interview with Mrs. Clasky?

57
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,330
<i>Great, great. You made it.</i>

58
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,042
<i>Come on in. The front door's open
and we're out back. Okay?</i>

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,086
<i>- And call me Deborah.</i>
- Okay.

60
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,761
<i>Holding out had helped, though.</i>

61
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,934
<i>She was no longer intimidated.</i>

62
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:57,566
<i>Working for Anglos now posed no problems.
It would just be a job.</i>

63
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,070
<i>White America beckoned.</i>

64
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,865
<i>She stepped across the cultural divide.</i>

65
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,336
- Gee whiz in heaven, are you okay?
- No. Don't worry, I'm not mad.

66
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,381
I've been looking for decoration
to put up on the glass,

67
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,007
so people would stop walking into it.

68
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,261
Instead of taking what they had in stock,
which was awful, I special ordered and I...

69
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,012
You know what?
I'm just gonna design something myself,

70
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,556
which is
what I should've done in the first place...

71
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,182
And what does that matter
when your nose is bleeding?

72
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,768
- Oh, gosh, shut up, Deborah.
- Now you got it, Mom.

73
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,814
- There's no ice pack, Bern.
- So, get anything frozen.

74
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,867
Pressure, pressure. Just pressure.

75
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,161
Take this.

76
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,669
Is it strange that I just gave you money?
I just felt really badly.

77
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:00,838
It's okay.

78
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,014
Chum, knock it off!

79
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,266
I'm sorry about the way the place looks.

80
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,935
You know, I'm hosting
a fundraiser for the school tonight.

81
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,521
It's just a mess. A couple hours away.
Just come sit right here.

82
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,566
Here you go. Okay.

83
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,568
Yeah, just... That's great.

84
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,445
Yeah, just toss it.

85
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,952
Well, she's my cousin.

86
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,788
She has been here for a while
and she understands some,

87
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:39,001
but doesn't really speak English,
but, well, anyway...

88
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,086
She lives in the apartment I manage and...

89
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,589
- So, who am I interviewing?
- Her.

90
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,344
You're gorgeous.

91
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,012
You're gorgeous.

92
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,684
She didn't mean it as a compliment.
It's more of an accusation.

93
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,104
- Mother.
- Go ahead.

94
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,193
- I'm sorry. This is my daughter, Bernie...
- Hi.

95
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,404
- And my mother, Evelyn Wright.
- Evelyn.

96
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,327
Do you guys want to come in out of the sun?
You wanna?

97
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,453
No, we're fine.

98
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,705
You need some sunscreen? I got a 70 here.

99
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,209
She loves the sun.

100
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,920
Look, we're wearing the same sweater.
That's good booga-booga.

101
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,464
You want some lemonade, maybe?

102
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,177
Lemonade, please?
Would you like to take some? Both of you?

103
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,099
Okay, let's just talk.

104
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,019
Well, I have two children,
and my husband is a chef,

105
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,813
a top chef, like that makes me something.

106
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,192
- Anyway, he works nights, so...
- Do you work?

107
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,778
Yes. No. Not right now. Why?
How do you know to ask that?

108
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,947
Well, it's okay.
I can talk about it. I just...

109
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,366
I helped run a commercial design company
up until four months ago

110
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,867
when it was downsized to zip.

111
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,828
- And now, I'm a full-time mom. Gulp.
- Double gulp.

112
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,041
Anyway, I have two children.
My son Georgie is nine, Bernie you know,

113
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,711
and I like the house to be like me,
you know...

114
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,297
I'm very loose
and meticulous at the same time.

115
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,717
But it's all about
first names and closeness here.

116
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,428
Let her know, absolutely.
But I do care about the place.

117
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,763
I'm so sorry,
I'm not leaving you time to translate.

118
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,441
What's your name?

119
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,943
<i>Llamo.</i> It's one of my five Spanish words.

120
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,655
- Flor Moreno.
- Floor?

121
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,992
- Flor.
- Floor?

122
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,952
No, Flor.

123
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:42,082
- Floor.
- Flor.

124
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,711
- It means "flower," right?
- Yes, flower, yes.

125
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,173
- Floor. What I walk on, right?
- Flor.

126
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,925
- Flor.
- Flor.

127
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,510
Is there some school of the ear

128
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,845
that I'm flunking out of right now?

129
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,237
What'd she say?

130
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,073
She says if you curl your tongue
and then let it be loose,

131
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,951
that you'll get it
and that it's really hard for Americans

132
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,164
and that it's great that you try so hard,
because most people wouldn't bother.

133
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,960
She gets me.

134
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,007
Flor.

135
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,808
Dense, but stubborn, right?

136
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:45,229
Now, see what you just did for me?
That is just what kids need.

137
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,774
Patience and encouragement.

138
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,692
All right, money.

139
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,321
- Goodbye. Look forward to seeing you.
- Love you.

140
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,283
So, the job is six days a week.
Seven, eight, 12 hours, it depends.

141
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,204
All the housekeeping, driving the kids.
How much a week do you want?

142
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,376
- Whatever you say.
- No.

143
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,628
No. This is a very important question

144
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,714
because if you ask for too little,
it means you don't value yourself.

145
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,634
You ask for too much,
it means you're taking advantage. So?

146
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,308
One thousand dollars.

147
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:29,982
She's kidding.

148
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,949
$650.

149
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,121
Welcome to the family.

150
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,548
Come on. I want to show you around.

151
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,799
Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, come on.

152
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,389
<i>I had never known that my mother
had been chronically worried about money</i>

153
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:07,144
<i>until the first glimpse of her
as financially unburdened.</i>

154
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,355
Can we have a table for two, please?

155
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,776
- We're celebrating.
- Okay, right this way.

156
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,994
Is this good?

157
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,748
You're welcome.

158
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,547
Here you go. Here you go. Enjoy.

159
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,549
You're welcome.

160
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,094
Expensive.

161
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,270
Excuse me?

162
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,857
Those men would like to buy you a drink.

163
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,079
Thank you.

164
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,831
- No, <i>gracias.</i>
- Okay.

165
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,338
Sorry.

166
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,857
This is so embarrassing.

167
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,735
My mother said to tell them,
"Who do you think you are?

168
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,071
"Can't you see I'm with my daughter,
for God's sakes?"

169
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,408
Good.

170
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,455
She said, "Who do you think you are?"

171
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,583
She's with her daughter, for God's sake.
Her young daughter.

172
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,266
Passing on the left.

173
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,561
Left.

174
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,735
Morning, Flor. See you up there. Left.

175
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,404
Left!

176
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,500
Hey!

177
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,798
Hey. Will you try this?

178
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,226
Isn't that good?

179
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,401
Okay, think seriously about getting up.

180
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,362
You don't have to get up yet,
but are you thinking seriously about it?

181
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,031
- Yes.
- Okay.

182
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,662
My God! This is amazing.

183
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,664
A simple "it's good" will do.

184
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,250
I mean, that...

185
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,877
I'm glad you like it.

186
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,797
By the way, you could do without this.

187
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,013
No! No!

188
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,851
Flor, never do fetch to Chum. Never!

189
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,524
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.
I'm thinking of you.

190
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,275
This is me being nice.

191
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,862
Okay. It's just...

192
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,783
No taking the ball from the dog. Just don't.
No fetch.

193
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,704
No. Never do fetch with this dog.
Okay? Never.

194
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,251
Here, can you make us
some coffee, maybe? Yeah?

195
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,753
Okay. Right. Thank you.

196
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,558
- Now?
- Yes, actual up.

197
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,062
Hey, Dad!

198
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,941
Are you as mad at me as Mom
'cause of what happened?

199
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,409
No, Georgie, I'm not.

200
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,287
Are you mad at me?

201
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,415
- No.
- Good.

202
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,250
Let's hope.

203
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,923
When it comes to the kids, John,
we got to stay on the same page, you know?

204
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,844
United. Doing consistent,
consistent parenting.

205
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,848
Do you know
how many books on parenting I've read?

206
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,186
Deb, since high school, we've been able
to read each other. Take advantage of it.

207
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,939
Word for word,
what did you say to Georgie exactly?

208
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,276
"No, I'm not mad."

209
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,869
Good guy. Bad guy.

210
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,704
Come on.

211
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,625
What the hell are you doing?
Everything's okay.

212
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,470
- John.
- Yes?

213
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,266
Do you really think that cupping my breast

214
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,478
- is going to solve the issue here?
- It's worked before.

215
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,815
Well, now, it's infuriating me.

216
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,901
- Wrong breast.
- Oh, my God.

217
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,071
No, no, no, no, no.
I know what you mean, okay?

218
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,324
Oh, my God. Don't do the calm thing.
Just don't go there. Don't do that thing.

219
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,992
Oh, my God. Here we go.

220
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,828
This is very important to you. Us, us.

221
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:04,084
I just like to level with Georgie.
That's why I answered him this way.

222
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,421
- This is not an argument, honey.
- Yes, yes, it is!

223
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,926
We're having a fight, John.
A big fight, at last!

224
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,012
So, could you stop
being so stark raving calm?

225
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,190
Great God in heaven, save me.

226
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,777
Hi.

227
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,076
I didn't know Deb found somebody.
You work here?

228
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,412
You're gonna help out
with the house and the kids?

229
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,417
You work here
and you don't speak any English at all?

230
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,588
All she has to do is dial 911
and press two for Spanish.

231
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,756
This is...

232
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:57,429
Flor, this is Georgie and this is John.
John, this is Flor.

233
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,389
Flor.

234
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,394
Great. I'll take Georgie to school.

235
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,231
No, no. I'm doing it.
I'm gonna show Flor the ropes.

236
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,402
Flor, will you come with me, please?

237
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,279
Yeah. Okay.

238
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,949
Flor, just... Yeah.

239
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,245
Come, come. Thank you.

240
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,333
- She's mad.
- You're fine. Deb?

241
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,460
- What?
- You love me!

242
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,396
Okay.

243
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,151
- Not the best place to stand, fella.
- No, it's me. I'm bugged.

244
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,486
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,571
Not a problem.
You're the new helper, Alex, right?

246
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,948
Okay, welcome. First day.

247
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,577
John, John, John,
I have something very important to tell you.

248
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,920
- Damn.
- What? What? What? What?

249
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:17,300
Victor recognized a food critic
over the phone.

250
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,386
- From?
<i>- The Times.</i>

251
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,470
Yes?

252
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,140
I'll bet they sent her across the country
just for us.

253
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,269
- Hey, listen, if you're nervous, take a walk.
- I don't need a walk.

254
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,188
I'll walk with you. I know a breathing thing.

255
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,733
What do you think I'm worried about?
How I'm gonna cook?

256
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,860
That's not the thing. That's not the problem.

257
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:42,242
I worked at a restaurant in New York
that had four stars.

258
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:46,162
It was like a line formed
to become an asshole.

259
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,998
People's accents changed.

260
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,669
The heart went out of the place.
You understand?

261
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,923
- No.
- I agree with everything you just said.

262
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,761
I admire you for your feelings.
I hope to adopt them as my own.

263
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,855
Here we are, ladies.

264
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,441
<i>I don't know what to root for.</i>

265
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,779
The thought of one star gets me nauseous,
but with four, there's no place to go,

266
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,283
but, "Oh, my God,
they took away one of my stars."

267
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,660
<i>- The Times</i> liked the first course.
- You know what you want?

268
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,917
Three and a quarter stars.
Yes, that would be perfect.

269
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,336
It'd mean you're good,
but not good enough to feel disappointed

270
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,797
you just missed out on excellence.

271
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,258
You still get enough respect.
Good people wanna work with you.

272
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,177
Business is good, not crazy.

273
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,930
You're right there below the radar,
where you get to mind your own business.

274
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,225
That's a good, solid life.

275
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,812
Big wipe.

276
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,201
Well, I'm in the vitamin section,

277
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:10,121
and this little hip-hop girl,
what's her name?

278
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,041
Nice surprise, thank you. You want some?

279
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,088
This little hip-hop girl,
what's her name? Grammys.

280
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,552
She's famous. You kids know her. Darn.

281
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,849
God bless the language barrier.
It keeps you from being bored with me.

282
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,436
Anyway, well, she said,

283
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,733
- "Aren't you Evelyn Wright?"
- Oh, my God!

284
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,945
First of all,
that she remembered me from the old covers.

285
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,321
Yeah.

286
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,949
And then she...

287
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,410
- Please! Her name!
- Stop it.

288
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,623
- It makes the story so much better.
- It's still a good story.

289
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,085
She said,

290
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,215
"Whenever I think everything's..."

291
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,636
Pardon my French, pardon her French.
"A mother...

292
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,098
"I put on one of your records."

293
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,145
- Oh, my God.
- That is so sweet.

294
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:20,567
Well, you think your life is embarrassing,

295
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:25,280
and then somebody
finds encouragement in it.

296
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,116
- You understand?
- I think I do.

297
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,123
Mom, it's not even noon.

298
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,047
- This is going to work.
- I don't know anything.

299
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,882
Free your mind.

300
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,760
"The president whose policies

301
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,680
"many consider responsible
for the Great Depression."

302
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,390
I don't know.

303
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,809
- Name a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

304
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,188
- Okay, I got it.
- Hoover!

305
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,025
- I said I had it. You don't trust me?
- Okay.

306
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,110
I no longer know nothing.

307
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,071
And Hoover was followed in office by...

308
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,452
I'm just drawing blanks. I'm embarrassed.
It's my own fault.

309
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,788
I spent all my time on math,
which I'm lucky if I don't flunk, anyway.

310
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,873
Stop it.

311
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,585
The man you're looking for is not a ruse.

312
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,296
- What does "ruse" mean?
- Phony.

313
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,508
- Roo...
- Roosevelt!

314
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,430
If I'd ever heard of that word before,
that would lock it in.

315
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,393
- Hey, surprise! New clothes!
- What?

316
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,149
- What did I do right?
- It was a warehouse sale.

317
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,739
I went nuts. I got so much stuff.

318
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,033
Great. She needed a boost!

319
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,419
Yeah. No, that came together.
I wouldn't wear it together, it's a little much.

320
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,348
Eight?

321
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,434
What?

322
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,066
- Eight.
- What? What? What?

323
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,111
Eight. Eight.

324
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,780
- Bernie, come on. Listen.
- What's going on?

325
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,950
Bernie, you're gonna do it,
and you're gonna look beautiful.

326
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:39,288
Honey, I just...
You are going to lose that weight, and...

327
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,858
You know,
I'm glad you didn't get here earlier,

328
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,695
because then I wouldn't be able to tell you

329
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:16,325
that your gift to me is a ruse.

330
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,956
- Honey, I...
- Please, just excuse me.

331
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,585
- Hey, Bernie...
- I just wanna...

332
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:29,464
I just need to be alone right now, okay?
I'm sorry. It's okay.

333
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,263
We have to be able to endure this, John,
if we're gonna help her.

334
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,932
I'll just gonna hang out here
and wait for you, okay?

335
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,895
Her pediatrician intervened on
his own daughter's weight, and she is an 8.

336
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,855
Dad, don't.
Didn't you ever just need a minute?

337
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,649
Yes.

338
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,902
This is the same page
that I'm talking about, John.

339
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,279
We gotta be on the same page.
That's the most important thing.

340
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,864
You and I need to be on the same page.

341
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,700
- I don't know why it has to be so hard.
- I need a minute.

342
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:09,712
John, she's right between the two sizes.
I thought about it.

343
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,214
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,885
Encourage her denial,
or motivate her to get herself in shape?

345
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,220
Flor?

346
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,516
- Me go.
- Yeah, okay.

347
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,726
I'll take you to the bus stop.

348
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:37,198
Sorry, I didn't even help you with the door.
No, I meant I was...

349
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,201
<i>My mother did not understand her male boss.</i>

350
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,330
<i>He seemed as upset as she was
over what had been done to Bernice...</i>

351
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,457
Shit!

352
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,001
<i>...and yet had done nothing.</i>

353
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,302
I am running out of excuses
for the lady of the house!

354
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,724
But, man, Bernice's final is tomorrow.
She didn't need this one.

355
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,270
And just the look on her face
when she got the gifts.

356
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,146
Like for one second she thought

357
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,025
all her problems with her mother
had been solved.

358
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,695
<i>He appeared to be a good man,</i>

359
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,365
<i>but to someone with first-hand knowledge
of Latin macho,</i>

360
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:23,953
<i>he seemed to have
the emotions of a Mexican woman.</i>

361
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:34,505
<i>She had no idea how to react, except to flee.</i>

362
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,097
What're you doing? We're still moving.

363
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,392
I'll take you all the way to the bus stop.

364
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,897
You got to let me take you all the way.

365
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,609
I'll take you.

366
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,327
All the way.

367
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,497
How weird was this ride?

368
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,210
Sorry. I'm sorry.

369
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,840
Yes, yes, you are released. Yes.

370
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,677
Bye-bye.

371
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
All right.

372
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:51,832
<i>A simple request from my mother startled me.
Her rules were bending.</i>

373
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:56,504
<i>She was losing her battle
to remain uninvolved with the Claskys.</i>

374
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,471
Try it on.

375
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,313
Try...

376
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,580
Just. Just try it on.

377
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,420
Just try on.

378
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,839
Just.

379
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,968
- Just.
- Just.

380
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,859
<i>There is one particular cultural difference,</i>

381
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,570
<i>which I wish to explore academically
at Princeton.</i>

382
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,490
<i>American women, I believe,</i>

383
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:10,119
<i>actually feel the same as Hispanic women
about weight.</i>

384
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:14,040
<i>A desire for the comfort of fullness.</i>

385
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,960
<i>And when that desire is suppressed for style</i>

386
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:22,381
<i>and deprivation allowed to rule,
dieting, exercising American women...</i>

387
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:23,466
Left!

00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,887
<i>...become afraid of everything
associated with being curvaceous.</i>

389
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,848
<i>Such as wantonness, lustfulness...</i>

390
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,224
Left!

391
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,310

- Passing on the left.

<i>All that is best in life.</i>

395
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,369
Hey.

396
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,214
Hey!

397
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,180
Yeah, well, taste, she has.

398
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,017
Just try it on.

399
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,605
When did you learn to speak English?

400
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,651
Just try it on.

401
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,571
It's too tight. It doesn't fit.

402
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:34,203
Bernice, just try it on. Hey.

403
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,956
It's too small. I'm too big.

404
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,292
- Just try it on! Just...
- Okay. Okay.

405
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,044
I'll show you.

406
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,675
Thanks!

407
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,639
Lovely way to start the day.

408
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:58,144
The world's most trim Mexican
learns her first sentence

409
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,897
and uses it to watch me grunt my way

410
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,066
into a...

411
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,249
- It fits.
- Okay.

412
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,143
No. No. No.

413
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,235
Hey.

414
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,780
Okay.

415
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,870
Well, thanks.

416
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,373
Okay.

417
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,835
- Again.
- Again.

418
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,756
<i>- I was wrong
- I was wrong</i>

419
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:15,512
<i>- Now life is lonely again
- Life is lonely again</i>

420
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,766

- And only last year</i>

421
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,020
<i>- Everything seemed so sure

422
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:28,275
<i>- Now life is awful again
- Now life is awful again</i>

423
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,238
<i>- A truffle of hearts

424
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,989
<i>- Could only be
- Could only be</i>

425
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,493
Whatever happened to <i>Frère Jacques</i>
or <i>Itsy Bitsy Spider?</i>

426
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,245
- Make room.
- I know.

427
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:43,040
But every time he has a nightmare,
I teach him one of my old songs.

428
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,710
And that way,
his nightmares have a purpose.

429
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,296
But I don't have to sing it for anyone.

430
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,881
Right, you're clear on that.

431
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,969
How many did you sell
of this song, Grandma?

432
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,012
He likes to know that stuff.

433
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,181
She was huge.

434
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,017
Here goes.

435
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,232
76,000, which is great for a jazz album.

436
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:51,900
Jesus.

437
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,414
Fuck you.

438
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:11,837
Dad! Dad! Dad!

439
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,006
For God's sake, why are you screaming?

440
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,258
Why, crazy father, why aren't you screaming?

441
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,264
I'm working on it.
Just the stunned thing has to get dealt with.

442
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:26,769
"John Clasky..."

443
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,356
- No, no, no...
- Yes, yes, yes.

No, no, no. No, not yet!

Hi.

- Okay.

"I read your good review."

I read your good review.

- Not so far.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

501
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,986
- Congratulations. Good job.
- Chef. Chef.

502
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,698
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, man. Okay.

503
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,619
- You deserved it.
- You were terrific. Terrific.

504
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:39,581
And congratulations. You guys worked hard.
Way to go.

505
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,045
Pietro, what's wrong? What's doing?

506
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,297
I've gotten a fantastic
offer for my own place.

507
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:51,259
Everyone wants to back me
since the paper came out.

508
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,266
I can't lose you
and keep the hours I'm keeping.

509
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,604
I can't do my life unless I hold onto you.

510
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:10,070
I think I just gave you
an incredible bargaining position.

511
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:14,449
So, you gave away 20% of the restaurant

512
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,618
without even talking to me about it?

513
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,121
I had to, right then,
or I would have lost him.

514
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,708
Then I wouldn't have
enough time with the family.

515
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,428
- I don't exist.
- Sure you do.

516
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:41,893
I was all worried, just trying to
figure out the timing to talk to you

517
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,271
about renting a place for the summer.

518
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,273
I think you have your timing.

519
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,903
- Mom, the realtor's here. You coming?
- Go on.

520
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,698
All right, I'll be back later.

521
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,999
- Hi.
- Hi there.

522
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,171
- I'm Mike.
- Deborah. Hi.

523
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,423
There's a great rental
that just came on the market,

524
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,091
so we're starting at the top.

525
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,342
- Okay.
- Good.

526
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,526
I'm never gonna be one of those girls
whose hair

527
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:36,031
flows perfectly in a convertible.

528
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,158
Move your seat forward.

529
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,036
- I just...
- Yeah.

530
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,747
A little more. Good.

531
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,428
You must be trouble.

532
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,104
Look at this.

533
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,859
Isn't it gorgeous?

534
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:20,700
It's beautiful. It's fabulous. Perfect.

535
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,870
What word is the same in Spanish?

536
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,790
Thank you.

537
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,044
So, this will be your room, okay?

538
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,089
And don't worry.
I'm gonna put lots of nice stuff in here, too.

539
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,508
No, I...

540
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,845
Did you ask her if she could live in?

541
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:43,139
Come on. There's no buses from her to here.

542
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:47,435
There's no question. Double come on.
The barrio, Carbon Beach.

543
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:51,773
The barrio, Carbon Beach.
What to do? What to do?

544
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,193
Come on, it's going to be so great. Come on.
Come on.

545
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:58,154
I'm gonna get someone
to explain everything to you. Come on.

546
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,786
You must learn English.
Why won't she learn English?

547
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,455
Be careful.

548
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:11,376
I'm gonna have to learn
"You must learn English" in Spanish.

549
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,795
Excuse me?

550
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:20,051
- Excuse me, do you speak English?
- Yes, I do.

551
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:23,555
All right. Then would you please help me?
Will you translate for me with her?

552
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,225
- Sure.
- Okay.

553
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,686
- Sure. Forever.
- He's gonna...

554
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,397
Give me a minute.

555
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,817
Okay. Hi.

556
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,820
Now, I've rented a house for the summer,

557
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:42,365
and so, she needs to sleep at the house
because of the bus schedule.

558
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,793
- No, sorry.
- What? Why? Why? Why?

559
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,132
She can't because her daughter...

560
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,469
You have a daughter?

561
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,014
A whole daughter you've never mentioned?

562
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,683
This is a little crazy that
I don't know this.

563
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,104
No, don't translate asides.

564
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,614
She said she can't live here.

565
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,741
- Because her daughter...
- I got that.

566
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,751
Her daughter can also live here
for the summer. Go, tell her that.

567
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:40,507
Deborah, if she didn't tell us about her child,
she has to have a deep sense of privacy.

568
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,345
We can figure out
how she can still live at home.

569
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,514
Hell, I don't mind driving her at night.

570
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,975
Let's spare the world
you on the roads, okay?

571
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,186
What am I gonna do?

572
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:02,696
I'm sorry, my friend,
but this is what I need.

573
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,241
It's just for the summer.

574
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,328
I don't want to lose you, but...

575
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,535
She said she live here with you.

576
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,998
Hey, Cristina!

577
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,625
Malibu! Malibu!

578
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,545
Malibu! Malibu!

579
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,922
<i>Malibu! Malibu!</i>

580
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:07,761
<i>The first time one sees natural beauty
which is privately owned,</i>

581
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:11,806
<i>oceans as people's backyards,
confounds the senses.</i>

582
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,183
Oh, my gosh.

583
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,352
<i>I didn't know God had
a toy store for the rich.</i>

584
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:19,689
The beaches are so clean. It's beautiful.

585
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,407
Three months? Three months!

586
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:32,869
We're gonna be staying here
for three months!

587
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,204
Three months!

588
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:38,792
We're gonna be staying at this beach
for three months! This is amazing!

589
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,630
You want to go swimming?

590
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,388
Flor...

591
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,183
Look at this child.

592
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,812
Oh, God, you could make a fortune
at surrogate pregnancy.

593
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,566
How you doing? I'm John.

594
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,151
- Hello.
- Great.

595
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,154
Come on out and meet everybody. Bernie.

596
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,616
I'm Deborah,
and this is my daughter, Bernice.

597
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,618
- Hi.
- Hi.

598
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,036
And here's Georgie.

599
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,707
- And my mother, Evelyn Wright.
- So glad to meet you.

600
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,253
No comparisons, please. No comparisons.

601
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,713
I'm not even gonna respond to that.
Come here.

602
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:31,094
Okay. My mom says it's best if we just go...

603
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,388
Get out of your way
and put our things away.

604
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,723
Yes, go get settled.

605
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,190
Thank you so much. I'm thrilled to be here.

606
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,489
Okay, here's the idea.

607
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:55,869
I need to make a serving platter
for serving fish out of sea glass like this.

608
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:56,995
All right?

609
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,498
Just bits of broken glass
that the ocean sand

610
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:02,500
just blasts over the years.

611
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:06,421
So, here's the deal.
You guys go hunting for it.

612
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,591
I'll give you 50 cents
for any piece you find.

613
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:15,513
A dollar for any piece
that's bigger than that sucker right there.

614
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:20,101
All right, $5 for any piece
that isn't brown, clear, or green.

615
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,687
- Do we really have to do this?
- What?

616
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,108
- Come on.
- Let's go! Let's do this! Have fun!

617
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,277
- Come on, Chum. Let's go.
- Go get them, kid.

618
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,072
- Me, too?
- Yes, of course.

619
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:34,824
Thank you!

620
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,501
Oh, my God, Georgie!

621
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,701
Hey!

622
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,829
Hey!

623
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,375
Cristina, hey! Up here! Over here!

624
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,261
Cristina...

625
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,698
What's wrong?

626
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,160
She's wild-eyed over this.

627
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,080
Flor? Flor?

628
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:15,174
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

629
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,554
Listen, she'll be back shortly.

630
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:26,352
No, no, no, you don't have to work.
Give me that.

631
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,479
Okay. There.

632
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,737
Here.

633
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,115
Thanks.

634
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,037
Deb made a mistake.

635
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,915
I understand how you feel.

636
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,377
Do you understand
what I'm saying right now, at all?

637
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,758
- No.
- Good. Is <i>simpático</i> the word?

638
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,140
All right.

639
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,396
That's Italian.

640
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,318
I really am sorry that this is happening.

641
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,362
I just wanted you to know that.

642
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:21,282
I really... So sorry. Truly.

643
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,995
I didn't mean like...

644
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,583
I meant just a normal sorry.

645
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,755
So, I'm going to go to work.

646
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,809
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

647
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:51,646
- Thank you so much for taking me there.
- Gee, stop thanking me.

648
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,815
I really... I enjoyed having the company.

649
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,734
The flea market was just...

650
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,445
I don't know what to say. It was just...

651
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,696
So many things.

652
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:04,867
And you.
You knew so much about all of them.

653
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,162
The way you made those people
lower the prices, though.

654
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,332
I just think that you're...

655
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,462
- Never mind.
- No, go ahead. I can take it.

656
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,382
I just think that you're...

657
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,678
The most amazing white woman
that I've ever met.

658
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:33,354
That is so nice to hear.

659
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:39,068
Absurd, but deeply appreciated, Cristina.

660
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,412
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.
That was so fun.

661
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:54,500
- This was the best day ever.
- What?

662
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:57,044
Did something bad happen?

663
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,091
Cristina, tell your mother
those wash right out. It's no big deal.

664
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,551
Not right now.

665
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,682
What in the... I mean...

666
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:13,853
You can't just take someone else's kid
and then take them off and...

667
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,606
Don't go there. Or I'll go there,
and you know where "there" is.

668
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,574
Can you believe what a big deal
Flor is making this into?

669
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:31,078
It's just... Please, shoot me
if I ever become that hard to deal with.

670
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,349
- What's this?
- For you.

671
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,142
From?

672
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,854
Okay. Look, you are not yourself.

673
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:00,358
This was written in anger. Will you hold on?

674
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,818
Just look, sleep on it.
You still want me to have it, that's fine.

675
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,362
- Take the letter.
- I don't think that you will.

676
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:07,365
Once calm and rational thought returns.
Just sleep on it.

677
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,743
- Take the letter, Deborah.
- Just sleep on it.

678
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,873
She didn't even want us to know
she had a daughter.

679
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:20,127
And on the first day,
you take her kid away without even asking?

680
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,713
- I think that's a little...
- What?

681
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,424
Insensitive? Elitist?

682
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:29,262
Narcissistic? Irresponsible? Perverse?
Dizzy? What?

683
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,388
Stupid.

684
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,018
When is anyone in this damn house,

685
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:39,021
in this damn life,
gonna consider my feelings?

686
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:43,985
I just tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome.
There is no reason to rake this over.

687
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:48,948
I let it go and gave Flor the room to let it go,
which I'm sure she has.

688
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,159
It's over, so, just get on board, pal!

689
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,581
I slept.

690
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,600
Well, I'm broke.

691
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:21,230
No, please. Don't worry about it.
You really don't have to pay me.

692
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:24,859
- Please, don't worry about it.
- I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

693
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,777
Hey, so,

694
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,740
- when you count it up, give me a holler.
- I did count.

695
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:34,327
Many, many times. I didn't sleep. I counted.

696
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,496
All right, what do I owe you? Give it to me.

697
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,374
$640.

698
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,295
- Really?
- Yes.

699
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,631
- I'm really sorry.
- No.

700
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,552
All right. I don't know.

701
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:54,722
How about
we figure this out tomorrow, okay?

702
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:58,309
You even told me, you said that $5...

703
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,603
I know, I know, I know, I promised.

704
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:06,692
It's all coming back to me now.
Let me just go deal with this.

705
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:03,791
Cristina?

706
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:36,365
Oh, baby.

707
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:43,497
My mother wishes for me to represent
exactly what she says.

708
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,708
- Nothing else.
- What?

709
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,587
- May I talk to you?
- You mean your mother?

710
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:57,052
Yeah. Sure.

711
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,016
You can talk to me.

712
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:05,978
I don't have to sleep first?

713
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,361
What's wrong? Come on, come on, sit down.

714
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:21,202
I'm sorry.
Did you give this money to my daughter?

715
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,956
I made a deal with the kids. All the kids.

716
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:28,125
Oh, no. Please!

717
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:34,381
You don't tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune

718
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,219
for looking on the beach for stones?

719
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,223
- What is the word for this?
- Sea glass.

720
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,604
No, not a name for the stones.

721
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,484
A name for the action, what you did.

722
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:00,407
Oh, boy, <i>engreído</i> is gonna be rough.

723
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,119
Smug.

724
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,458
I had no idea
it was going to amount to that much money.

725
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:11,919
I thought, sort of tops, $50.

726
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,805
But $50 is a lot of money.

727
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,685
I know. I know. I know.

728
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,437
Oh, shit!

729
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,066
I'm sorry. Come on.

730
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,362
I get what you're upset about.

731
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,448
Excuse me.

732
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,453
It might not look it,
but I am good at getting things.

733
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:55,588
I know what it's like
when you feel your kid's being messed with.

734
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,095
It won't happen again.

735
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,269
It won't.

736
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:17,443
- All right.
- Okay!

737
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,778
It's late. You guys get some sleep.

738
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:23,157
Sleep?

739
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:25,576
No!

740
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,918
If this was small enough to be helped
by some little apology,

741
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,878
I would be a fool to bring it up.

742
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,673
But I need to say, no matter what the result,

743
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:42,635
I need to be impolite!

744
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,222
You leave someone else's child alone.

745
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:49,183
It is simple, no?

746
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:53,687
It is too easy for children
to feel contradiction.

747
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:56,190
And it encourages questioning their parents.

748
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:59,860
And that makes them feel less safe!

749
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:02,655
Look.

750
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,951
Your wife takes her for little tours.

751
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,871
And she changes her hair.

752
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,124
And you give her money.

753
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,378
Here, take back the money?

754
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:48,033
I didn't really mean to be angry to you.
Only emotional, for me.

755
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,333
What about hypocritical?

756
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:03,007
Yes, you heard me.
It's not like you didn't do the same thing.

757
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,425
- No.
- Yes, you did.

758
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:09,930
So, why don't you go lecture yourself?
You won't need a translator for that one.

759
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:12,266
What am I lately, a recycling bin?

760
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,686
Anybody dump in your garbage,
hope I make something useful out of it?

761
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,606
Yes, yes, you did the same thing.

762
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:24,278
You think I don't know
about you altering those outfits for Bernie?

763
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,573
She tells me her stuff.
So, am I missing something?

764
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:32,119
Is there really a difference between that
and what you're complaining about?

765
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,370
Excuse me.

766
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,801
There's no difference. I interfered.

767
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:52,973
You're kidding me?

768
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,145
It's just pretty wild
to say something to somebody

769
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,774
and have the other person
just concede the point.

770
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,237
I'm dazed here.

771
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,336
I feel really embarrassed.

772
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:27,508
And you were very right. Hypocrisy, yes.

773
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:31,845
Okay, that doesn't happen very often.

774
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,687
She said that we'll leave
whenever it is good for you.

775
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:43,857
No, no, no! Come on, man.

776
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,112
But how can I keep working for you
after we talked like this?

777
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:50,781
You can't quit the job.

778
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,868
Even if you wanted to. And you know why.

779
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:03,210
- No.
- Yes, you do.

780
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:06,255
You know.

781
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:10,384
Why?

782
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,302
Because if you do,

783
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:15,764
Cristina will blame herself
for costing you the job.

784
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,020
And that guilt,

785
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:26,567
I don't know if you know about guilt.

786
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:33,490
Guilt, <i>sí,</i> we know. We're Catholics.

787
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,828
- We know.
- We know.

788
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,746
You can't do that to her.

789
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,462
Welcome back.

790
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:55,220
Goodnight.

791
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,599
Goodnight.

792
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:04,938
You can't be translating for me all the time.
I need to learn English now.

793
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,737
I really wasn't supposed to translate that.

794
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,032
Listen to your mother. She knows it all.

795
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,712
<i>Learning English would cost $599 down</i>

796
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,466
<i>and 12 monthly payments of $86,</i>

797
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,636
<i>which represents 22% interest.</i>

798
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,389
<i>Assimilation gets expensive.</i>

799
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,474
Got it?

800
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,185
<i>But not a penny was wasted.</i>

801
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:45,646
<i>Food.</i>

802
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,314
Food.

803
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:51,818
<i>- I am just learning English.</i>
- I am just learning English.

804
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,695
<i>- Please repeat.</i>
- Please repeat.

805
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,573
<i>- Neck.</i>
- Neck.

806
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:58,325
<i>- Nose.</i>
- Nose.

807
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:10,045
Go! No!

808
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:11,713
Okay!

809
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:17,427
It is summer...

810
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,554
<i>- Winter...</i>
- Winter...

811
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,515
<i>- Spring.</i>
- Spring.

812
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,101
Sun.

813
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:25,686
<i>- Sunny.</i>
- Sunny.

814
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:26,853
- No.
<i>- Several.</i>

815
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,607
<i>- Several.</i>
- Several.

816
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,526
<i>- Again.</i>
- Several.

817
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,777
<i>Good. Several.</i>

818
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:36,655
<i>- Too many.</i>
- Too many.

819
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:37,781
<i>Right. Too many.</i>

820
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,075
How about a movie tonight?

821
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:43,620
Have you any particular one in mind?

822
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,165
I really enjoyed the <i>Stars Wars</i> trilogy

823
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,376
by Mr. George Lucas.

824
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,129
Congratulations, John.

825
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,464
Chef, it just keeps building.

826
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:57,926
Sorry.

827
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,636
So, should we just stop
answering the phone?

828
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,140
- We're booked for four months solid.
- No.

829
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:07,102
I want to keep some walk-in business.
I want this to stay neighborhood.

830
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:11,189
- The trick is stay the same.
- Impossible, John. There'd be riots.

831
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:13,525
You should hear
the desperation in their voices.

832
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,778
This is the best time of your life.

833
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:19,823
Yes, that includes our 5:30 seating as well.

834
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,950
I know. Could you hold for one minute?

835
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,537
We'll serve the full menu at the bar.

836
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,333
Where will I put people waiting for a table?
It won't work, John.

837
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:31,084
- Just do this for me.
- There's no way.

838
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:36,006
Do this for me, or I'll set my hair on fire
and start punching myself in the face!

839
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,344
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

840
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,096
That was an unusual way
for me to make myself understood.

841
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,046
Phone.

842
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,798
- It's Mike.
- Great.

843
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,720
Yeah, I'm just walking right out the door.
Okey-dokey. Okay, thanks.

844
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,932
Great. Thank you.

845
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:35,816
Thank you for the ride home,
but it was not necessary.

846
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,249
All right, yes.

847
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:56,878
Four stars
and I've never been more unhappy.

848
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,339
Up. Up. Yes.

849
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,801
Yes. Yes.

850
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:06,096
He's got this. Incredible obstacle.

851
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,577
<i>I don't know what to wear to the party.</i>

852
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:33,665
<i>- I don't know what to wear to the party.
- I'm wearing jeans.</i>

853
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:37,836
<i>I'm wearing jeans.</i>

854
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,089
<i>Do you want to wear jeans?</i>

855
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,400
No.

856
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,238
<i>What are you wearing to the party?</i>

857
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:24,174
Who's always there for you
at 2:30 in the morning? Chum!

858
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:42,108
You'd better do something about Chum.
You're gonna throw your arm out.

859
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,903
Don't you sleep anymore?

860
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:50,909
The more you do it, the more you learn.

861
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:54,287
Flor, you're doing fantastic.

862
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:55,830
- No.
- Yes.

863
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:58,041
Now I am like a 2-year-old.

864
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,294
No, no, no.

865
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:02,379
I finish.

866
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:06,967
No, no, no, keep going, keep going.
No, not until you finish it.

867
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,471
Your wife go out.

868
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,978
- Did she say where?
- No.

869
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:22,941
Sorry.

870
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,988
Hey, listen, she's...

871
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,993
I forgot she was going out.
Don't be a smart-ass.

872
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,038
I'm sorry.

873
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:45,922
You and I,
we communicate in apologies anyway.

874
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:50,176
So, I'm sorry. I should be whipped.

875
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:53,305
I should be stoned. It's been a while.

876
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:58,602
I meant to say don't be smart...

877
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,228
Not a smart-ass.

878
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:06,776
Don't be kind.

879
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:11,072
Don't be sensitive.

880
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:13,867
Don't be wonderful.

881
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:15,619
Don't...

882
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,998
I'm way too close. I'm sorry again.

883
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,043
I meant to say, "Hi, Flor."

884
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,173
Goodnight, Flor.
That show you're watching is gonna be a hit.

885
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,812
Hey, pal, you want to...

886
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:50,153
Go, Chum. No, no. Chum, no.

887
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,323
Go to him. Go. Go to him.

888
01:14:57,452 --> 01:15:01,414
Oh, man, you do love me. I was wondering.

889
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,338
What about the point I'm making?
It's good, right?

890
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,257
I mean,
Cristina has already read, on her own,

891
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,010
every book on Bernice's summer reading list.

892
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:15,845
And she's two grades behind her.

893
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:20,183
Can you imagine
if she went to Bernice's school?

894
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:24,521
I think I could probably get her
a scholarship. God knows they owe me.

895
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:29,401
- Talk to Flor.
- Yeah. She's so open to new things.

896
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:39,202
- Where're you going?
- I'm going out. I am...

897
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:43,164
It's this whole... Anyway, you know what?
I'm probably actually gonna be in...

898
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:47,127
The cell is gonna be bad,
so I'll just check in with you later.

899
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:55,969
I just can't find my keys.

900
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,931
Good morning, Ms. Folsom.

901
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,768
- Deborah.
- Arlene, what a surprise.

902
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,106
This is Cristina,
the girl I am always raving to you about.

903
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,900
Cristina, this is Arlene Folsom,
she's the School Director.

904
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,111
- Hi.
- Hello, a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom.

905
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,697
- Would you like a little tour?
- Really?

906
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:16,990
Great.

907
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,704
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

908
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,581
Hispanic.

909
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,963
We ran into the head of the school
and Cristina knocked her out.

910
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,631
I had nothing to do with it.

911
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:37,218
Incidentally,
the scholarship is worth $20,000

912
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:39,345
and early registration is tomorrow.

913
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,015
It's too far from my home.

914
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,934
You could move in to town with us.

915
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,312
Never, thank you.

916
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:49,022
Fine, then don't.

917
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,776
By the way, the phrase is "No, thank you."

918
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,864
<i>Mom was caught in a vise of manipulation.</i>

919
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:02,952
Please, dear God,
this is the most important prayer of my life.

920
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:06,289
It's about my education.
The health of my brain.

921
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,417
Please, dear God, enter my mother's heart.

922
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:12,170
Make her understand what this school means.

923
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,548
- Hi, Flor.
- Hi.

924
01:17:56,798 --> 01:18:00,426
- Want some port?
- No, thank you, Evelyn.

925
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:02,971
- How you doing?
- Hi.

926
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,765
I was just leaving.

927
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,103
Okay, bye...

928
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,189
What? Okay.

929
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:16,109
- Poor guy.
- What?

930
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,656
Nobody noticed.

931
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:24,993
Flor?

932
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,955
Thanks for never judging me.

933
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:35,962
I love you. I love everybody.
That's what's killing me.

934
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:52,228
May I talk with you?

935
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,147
Me?

936
01:18:55,982 --> 01:19:00,111
I just spoke to Deborah. She'll be back soon
if you need to go over something.

937
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,615
I need to really talk. Is okay?

938
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,661
- No.
- No, no, no. Sure, sure, sure.

939
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,706
Sure. I'm sorry.

940
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,880
- Outside?
- Okay.

941
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,942
You have me a little nervous here.

942
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:44,530
Are we ever gonna stop? Just asking.

943
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,708
You know about Cristina
and your private school?

944
01:19:57,919 --> 01:19:59,379
That.

945
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:04,717
- They did it.
- I don't know what to do.

946
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:07,804
Don't ask me.
I'm worried about my own kid going there.

947
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:13,142
Because they keep sending her home
anxiety-ridden, mostly over geometry.

948
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,811
I mean, you get Bernice.

949
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:19,482
In a decent world, her school
should let her know how great she is, right?

950
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,652
You don't have to worry about Bernice.

951
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,321
Nothing is going to change that heart.

952
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,745
Yeah, thanks.

953
01:20:39,377 --> 01:20:40,837
It's just...

954
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:46,300
...great to hear someone else
say that out loud.

955
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,514
Hard to explain.

956
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:53,016
I know.

957
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,981
I'm sorry. I take you here and...

958
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:04,235
- I make too much of this, right?
- No.

959
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:05,820
You have a right to worry about this.

960
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,447
This is the job. These are the decisions.

961
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:11,117
Worrying about your children is sanity.

962
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,913
And being that sane, the way you are,
can drive you nuts.

963
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:20,585
Someone like you, I'm sorry.

964
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:22,920
If you think you're at some crossroads,
you are.

965
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:27,383
You are.

966
01:21:31,763 --> 01:21:34,682
Hey, I wish I could help you more.

967
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:48,613
I never know a man who can put himself
in my place like you do.

968
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:53,409
How did you become that man?

969
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,040
I don't know.

970
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,139
Would you get out of the damn wind?
Sit down.

971
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:23,231
I didn't mean to... I want to be helpful.

972
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,737
It must be hard being a widow,
doing it on your own.

973
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,993
Why do you think I am a widow?

974
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:42,542
I guess I thought...

975
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,881
That would be the only way
a guy would leave you.

976
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:57,306
So, okay... Are you gonna send her?

977
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,727
I don't know.

978
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:06,524
I think if I do, one of two things happens.

979
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:13,573
- Either she will be odd?
- Odd, yes.

980
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:17,243
Or she will make herself the same as them.

981
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:24,625
I felt the same way about my kid going there.

982
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:29,380
So, between odd and the same,
you gotta be rooting for odd, don't you?

983
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:30,756
Yes, you gotta.

984
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:46,063
- Thank you. Goodnight. I go to sleep.
- Hey!

985
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,652
You speaking English, it's...

986
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:56,365
- What?
- Nothing.

987
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,998
It's nice meeting you.

988
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:25,811
Here they are.

989
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,734
Hey, you guys just made it.
I was getting worried.

990
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,444
Hi, hi, hi.

991
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:37,240
I picked up your books yesterday.

992
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,869
I just put them in one of Bernie's old,
ancient backpacks.

993
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:47,541
Thank you. This is gonna be a great school.
I can tell by the weight.

994
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,255
I got her just a little
first-day-at-a-new-school present.

995
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:54,298
It's just a little something
from me and Bernie.

996
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,343
It's okay, right? Come on, it's a big day.

997
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:58,886
What did we get her?

998
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,519
Wait, wait, wait.

999
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:13,859
- Here it comes.
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1000
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:22,368
It's from all of us. Your mom, too.

1001
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,037
It's not from me.

1002
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:31,544
Okay. Let's get going! Don't be late!
Come on!

1003
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:40,511
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

1004
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,390
And everything.

1005
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,603
Have a great year, girls.

1006
01:25:50,855 --> 01:25:52,440
This is so great.

1007
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:15,921
Left!

1008
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,132
Left!

1009
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:20,009
Left!

1010
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,011
- No left!
- Left!

1011
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,764
Left!

1012
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,308
Left!

1013
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:34,940
Left!

1014
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,826
Hey! You're fast! Better pace yourself.

1015
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:58,506
You know, I ran college track. Watch out.

1016
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,648
Look, they're delivering my table.

1017
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,403
See you.

1018
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,492
I love you for trying!

1019
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:35,042
<i>When people exist under one roof,
a tiny society forms,</i>

1020
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:37,503
<i>the stuff of novellas,</i>

1021
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:42,550
<i>masters and servants
unconsciously dancing in lock step.</i>

1022
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,010
<i>So that when things go wrong,</i>

1023
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,013

01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:54,270
<i>At Mrs. Clasky's urging, I had invited
two of my friends to her house,</i>

1025
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:57,022
<i>though I was expected at home.</i>

1026
01:27:58,566 --> 01:28:02,653
<i>Monica had finally managed
to get her mother here from Mexico</i>

1027
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,780
<i>and my mother was making a party.</i>

1028
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:18,335
Flor? Deb. Hey, sorry to call you so late.

1029
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:21,797
But the girls are still studying
and I gotta go out.

1030
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,507
<i>I know that
I promised to get her back to you,</i>

1031
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,342
<i>so, if you want me to cut off the schoolwork,</i>

1032
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,386
that's fine, whatever you want.

1033
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:31,557
Let me think.

1034
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,477
Okay, you think about it.

1035
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:38,189
And, hey, listen, Flor, if you're tired,

1036
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,066
<i>or you want to play, then just...</i>

1037
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:44,111
Let her sleep here tonight, no?
I'll get her back to you in the morning.

1038
01:28:44,195 --> 01:28:45,196
Yes! You can stay!

1039
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,365
You think about it. Call me back. Bye.

1040
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:30,783
Wait! I need to talk to you privately, honey.

1041
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,202
"Honey?" No, Mother. I can't right now.

1042
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,412
I'm really late.
I've been looking all over for you.

1043
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:37,665
Will you keep an eye on the kids?
You've got my secret cell number.

1044
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:41,043
- Just give me a moment to talk here.
- What is it, are you buzzed?

1045
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:44,380
No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.

1046
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,508
Yes. Nobody noticed.

1047
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:51,262
Which shows I probably conducted myself
pretty well as a drunk.

1048
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:54,265
But duty called, and I'm sober.

1049
01:29:54,348 --> 01:29:57,309
So, may I say just one thing?

1050
01:29:57,393 --> 01:30:00,396
- Yes, Mother, one thing. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1051
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,314
Deborah,

1052
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,694
you are going to lose your husband

1053
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,488
if you don't stop what you are doing.

1054
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:13,492
And you will never find someone as good.

1055
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:19,290
There'll only be men
who you know are cheap and shallow

1056
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:22,418
and have no real warmth in their souls.

1057
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:25,838
You may have gotten by
on those surfaces once, but now,

1058
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,173
you have been spoiled by a good man.

1059
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:31,260
If you do not act quickly,

1060
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,096
you will soon cement
an awful fate for yourself.

1061
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,348
A life with no hope of repair.

1062
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:41,604
Which has already
begun to turn desperate and dumb.

1063
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:45,691
That's it. Drive carefully.

1064
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,945
Out of coffee. It's over for me.

1065
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:53,949
You've done it again, Mother.
Made me hate myself.

1066
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,201
One of the things I can count on.

1067
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:00,289
Honey,

1068
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:05,419
lately, your low self-esteem
is just good common sense.

1069
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:54,802
- John.
- Hey, Evelyn.

1070
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:56,136
Better wait a minute.

1071
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,099
- What the hell is wrong?
- Nothing.

1072
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:04,687
Can I urge you, in all hopelessness,
not to go in there?

1073
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:06,605
Deb?

1074
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,900
Deb? Deb?

1075
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,360
Deb?

1076
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,321
- Where are you?
- Over here.

1077
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,869
Baby, what?

1078
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:24,081
- Just stay there, John.
- What? What? What?

1079
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,631
I suddenly get what I gotta do,
but I just gotta get up the guts.

1080
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:37,302
Is it absolutely necessary
to make it this scary?

1081
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:40,973
Can you just say it?

1082
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,268
It's not so easy.

1083
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:47,479
Yeah. Come on, it's me. We can talk.

1084
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:52,735
- Do I ever hope so.
- All right. Don't cry.

1085
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:54,903
Or cry, cry, cry. I'm sorry.

1086
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,450
Come on. What is it?

1087
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:07,416
I've been seeing another man
for the last 11 weeks.

1088
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,918
And it was nothing and I ended it tonight.

1089
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:14,339
At first, it was just keeping an eye
on the real estate market, and then it was

1090
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,720
me being insecure and
searching for some ridiculous validation.

1091
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:20,846
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1092
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,518
I'm missing what you're saying.

1093
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:28,687
I... Hey, are you...

1094
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:33,484
Okay, you can't keep talking

1095
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:38,655
and expect me to follow it
when you start the way you did.

1096
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:40,282
Just what did you hear?

1097
01:33:43,202 --> 01:33:45,204
There was a crack in the planet.

1098
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:49,666
That was noisy.

1099
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,503
Oh, man.

1100
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:56,965
There's an actual noise in my head.
No kidding.

1101
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,052
I met him about a...

1102
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:03,764
If you talk that fast,
I'm not gonna hear you.

1103
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,891
There's a lot going through my mind
right now.

1104
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:15,067
Have you said yet,
whether you slept with him?

1105
01:34:17,945 --> 01:34:21,323
No, so far, I've just been talking
about a flirtation. It's really...

1106
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:25,285
Have you said whether you had sex
with another person?

1107
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:29,414
Because I really am missing your words,
so help me out here.

1108
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:33,210
I've been trying to explain
that for the first 10 weeks...

1109
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:34,753
You still haven't said yet, right?

1110
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,174
- Is this your way...
- Yes, yes! This is my way!

1111
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:42,302
This is my way of asking you
whether or not you...

1112
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:50,435
Oh, man. Once I ask it...

1113
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:53,605
Just give me a second.

1114
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:58,485
I'm trying to figure out
if there's a way to avoid knowing.

1115
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:06,618
No. Damn it.

1116
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:09,580
There's not.

1117
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:14,251
Okay, you're on.

1118
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:19,590
- Real short answer. Have you had...
- Yes.

1119
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,430
Really?

1120
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:35,814
I made up my mind that I was gonna answer
every question you had.

1121
01:35:36,023 --> 01:35:39,818
I'll answer everything, and anything,
and more.

1122
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,321
What other questions could there be?

1123
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:47,034
Are you really that much nicer than me?

1124
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,745
Well,

1125
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:52,748
you don't set the bar real high.

1126
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:57,085
John, just wait, please. Please, just wait,

1127
01:35:57,169 --> 01:36:00,714
John, just listen. I think that if you listen
to exactly what happened

1128
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:02,674
and then you could do whatever you need to.

1129
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:05,177
Just please let me tell you everything.

1130
01:36:13,936 --> 01:36:15,062
It's just Flor.

1131
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:20,609
Flor, what are you doing here?

1132
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,403
I want my daughter.

1133
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,032
I want to talk to Mrs. Clasky.

1134
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:30,494
I want to quit.

1135
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,040
I don't think you can do
any of that right now.

1136
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,292
I gotta.

1137
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:43,131
The reason I took this chance in telling
is that I want us to be good.

1138
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:44,925
I want us to be close.

1139
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:49,179
I want to feel like you're not nuts
to be in love with me.

1140
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:54,059
So, what I think we should do
is I think we should just talk.

1141
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,852
Talk until we pass out.

1142
01:36:55,936 --> 01:36:58,313
Talk until we are so sick of each other,

1143
01:36:58,397 --> 01:37:02,734
that there's nothing left to do
but take that first step out of hell.

1144
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:06,279
Okay. So, let's not leave this room

1145
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:10,242
until you've heard
and said everything, okay?

1146
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:12,035
Please, say okay.

1147
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:18,208
I'm sorry. What?

1148
01:37:20,127 --> 01:37:22,921
John? You didn't hear me?

1149
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:24,923
I gotta get out of here. You keep talking.

1150
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:27,467
- Wait.
- Stay put.

1151
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:35,684
I don't think you want to wake her up

1152
01:37:36,143 --> 01:37:40,313
when you're feeling this upset
and the others are right there, too.

1153
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:56,663
What're you doing? Where're you going?

1154
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:02,335
- I am leaving. I have finally...
- Me, too. I'll drive you.

1155
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:07,215
- No.
- Yeah, it's okay. I don't mind.

1156
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:10,343
- If you truly don't know why I say no...
- It's past midnight here. I can just...

1157
01:38:10,427 --> 01:38:13,930
- ...let me at last say the reason.
- I'll just take you. Don't worry about it.

1158
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:23,148
Have you no idea that I...

1159
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:30,864
I've really gotta get out of here. Right now.

1160
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:32,074
Go.

1161
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,212
Goodbye, Chum.

1162
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:59,267
- Goodbye.
- Wait. I'm taking you.

1163
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,977
No. Why?

1164
01:39:01,061 --> 01:39:03,271
Because, if I don't,
I'll worry about you all night long.

1165
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:04,898
I can't handle that right now.

1166
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:08,193
Come on, come on, in, come on.
Get in the car.

1167
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,041
John!

1168
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:35,053
- I quit this job.
- I quit this job!

1169
01:39:37,806 --> 01:39:40,225
I think I meant that for someone else.
I'm sorry.

1170
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:46,106
- Sorry. Very sorry.
- That is the bus stop.

1171
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:53,071
- Bye.
- Wait, don't go!

1172
01:39:56,283 --> 01:39:58,869
Would you be willing to hang out with me
for a while?

1173
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:04,541
- You want to hang out with me?
- Yes.

1174
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:12,883
- Then I have to ask you...
- What?

1175
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,595
What does "hang out" mean?

1176
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:19,431
It means...

1177
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:22,517
Visit.

1178
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:27,272
Okay.

1179
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,246
I've never seen your place.

1180
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:29,751
Very perfect.

1181
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:39,010
I'm gonna cook for you.

1182
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:43,265
Please, please, please.

1183
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:51,523
I am glad to visit with you.

1184
01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:59,572
If I just left the job

1185
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:02,909
and never spoke with you,

1186
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,205
it would have been...

1187
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,710
...sin.

1188
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:14,963
You understand?

1189
01:42:25,265 --> 01:42:26,391
Yeah.

1190
01:42:46,453 --> 01:42:50,915
My hand is the only sane part of my body.
Every other part wants to jump off a cliff.

1191
01:42:54,044 --> 01:42:57,756
That's it for now.
I already broke my record for smooth.

1192
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:01,468
- I don't understand.
- It's me. I'm not making any sense.

1193
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:02,886
But I can get you fed.

1194
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:18,276
- You want a drink?
- No.

1195
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,116
Wait. I don't think you should, either.

1196
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:30,246
Then, excuse me, because if I had
the equipment, I think I'd inject the vodka.

1197
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:34,417
I just think it is so important
that we are each clear-headed.

1198
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:50,141
It's very good.

1199
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:53,269
You didn't ask why.

1200
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:55,647
Keep things real, right?

1201
01:43:57,816 --> 01:43:59,484
I wouldn't have put it so well.

1202
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:04,489
Okay.

1203
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,826
Let's get this going here.

1204
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:37,188
Beautiful.

1205
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,945
So, tell me again
why I can't call him on his cell again?

1206
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:45,780
Besides that he turned it off?

1207
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:51,453
- Yeah.
- 40 messages start to look needy.

1208
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:13,558
- Mother, you're enjoying this.
- No.

1209
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:18,396
Well, not in the way you think.

1210
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,484
You are enjoying it? Jesus, Mother.

1211
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:26,362
I am enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter.

1212
01:45:26,446 --> 01:45:30,700
I'm enjoying the fact
that I really know how to advise you...

1213
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:35,121
And the miracle
that you are so deeply disoriented,

1214
01:45:35,205 --> 01:45:37,832
that you are gobbling up everything I say.

1215
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:46,925
What?

1216
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:52,430
There's something I want to say to you
about you and me.

1217
01:45:53,306 --> 01:45:55,892
- You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

1218
01:45:57,143 --> 01:45:58,770
- Okay?
- Thank you.

1219
01:46:00,897 --> 01:46:04,317
You were an alcoholic
and wildly promiscuous woman

1220
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:08,029
during my formative years,
so that I'm in this fix because of you.

1221
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:10,073
It is your fault.

1222
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:14,118
I just needed that moment for us to build on.

1223
01:46:19,958 --> 01:46:22,043
You have a solid point, dear.

1224
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:26,172
But right now, the lessons of my life
are coming in handy for you.

1225
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,605
Yes.

1226
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:46,359
That's it. That's it for you.

1227
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:54,659
I keep thinking I should tell you
what happened to me tonight.

1228
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:02,917
But I don't want to spoil this.
I don't want to spoil this.

1229
01:47:08,214 --> 01:47:11,551
I will remember every taste forever.

1230
01:47:13,303 --> 01:47:14,804
I'm very glad you liked it.

1231
01:47:16,556 --> 01:47:18,308
It's something, watching you.

1232
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,897
If it's anything at your end,
imagine over here.

1233
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:28,109
Scratch that. The last thing you want to hear
is somebody going off on your looks.

1234
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:31,529
Don't be crazy. Tell me every detail.

1235
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:35,950
Okay. Okay, I will.

1236
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:43,875
They should name a gender after you.
Looking at you doesn't do it.

1237
01:47:44,334 --> 01:47:47,253
Staring is the only way that makes any sense.

1238
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:51,090
And trying not to blink,
so you don't miss anything.

1239
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:58,389
And all of that, and you're you.

1240
01:47:59,599 --> 01:48:00,725
I mean...

1241
01:48:02,352 --> 01:48:04,520
Look, forgive me.

1242
01:48:05,647 --> 01:48:08,941
It's just you are drop-dead, crazy gorgeous.

1243
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:12,654
So much so, that I'm actually considering

1244
01:48:12,737 --> 01:48:15,239
looking at you again
before we finish up here.

1245
01:48:19,077 --> 01:48:21,454
Soon, please.

1246
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:59,492
- I can't. We can't.
- I know. I know.

1247
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:04,539
We can't do anything that brings us
any kind of satisfaction or release.

1248
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:07,083
But I'm still having a great time!

1249
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:14,549
<i>My mother has often referred
to that evening at the restaurant</i>

1250
01:49:14,632 --> 01:49:16,843
<i>as the conversation of her life.</i>

1251
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:20,596
Ever since that night at the beach,

1252
01:49:21,848 --> 01:49:25,101
I knew you were in a room,
I just wouldn't go in there.

1253
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:30,398
When I hear you coming, I leave.

1254
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,446
That's why we haven't
seen each other a lot lately.

1255
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:40,783
Why is everything so damn confusing?

1256
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:50,293
Is your mind racing, too?

1257
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:55,882
I'd say my mind has evaporated.
Feels pretty good.

1258
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,426
Like happy?

1259
01:50:00,762 --> 01:50:02,221
Like happy.

1260
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:07,059
You think that will last?

1261
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:15,234
- I was just kidding around.
- I understand what you mean.

1262
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,695
No, I don't understand what I mean.

1263
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:22,784
That it's getting late.

1264
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,166
The responsibilities

1265
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,753
have entered your brain.

1266
01:50:36,214 --> 01:50:37,715
Don't hide that from me.

1267
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,553
Don't hide that from me.

1268
01:50:44,055 --> 01:50:46,808
- Please.
- Yeah.

1269
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:49,060
- Thank you. You're right.
- Yeah.

1270
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,105
I won't. You're great.

1271
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,651
You're great, too.

1272
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:02,490
No.

1273
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:04,992
No.

1274
01:51:09,372 --> 01:51:13,584
There are some mistakes you cannot risk
when you have children.

1275
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,549
Please.

1276
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:23,678
- Are you ready to go?
- No. I'm not. I'm not.

1277
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,390
Stay put for a sec. Stay there.

1278
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:34,689
Once our feet touch that floor,
I'm gonna get too many brain cells back.

1279
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:36,774
Don't be in such a hurry.

1280
01:51:39,944 --> 01:51:43,781
That floor, it's going to eat us alive.

1281
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,908
- I love you.
- What?

1282
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:28,659
'Cause I've been...

1283
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:50,348
Oh, God, it's him.
He's gotta tell me everything.

1284
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:51,766
No, no, no.

1285
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,935
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

1286
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:55,269
No, wait!

1287
01:52:57,647 --> 01:52:59,899
Do you know that right now,

1288
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:03,319
you are your own worst enemy?

1289
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:07,490
That you can't trust
one thought in your brain?

1290
01:53:20,211 --> 01:53:22,046
Then trust me

1291
01:53:22,755 --> 01:53:26,384
and only allow yourself
to say one thing to him.

1292
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:28,469
One thing.

1293
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:31,722
"I am so glad you're back."

1294
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:34,809
- What?
- Yes.

1295
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:38,396
But I have to know whether he touched her.

1296
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,982
And where he touched her,
and how he touched her,

1297
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:43,484
and how he felt afterwards,

1298
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:46,445
whether they held hands when they left.

1299
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:54,412
Just those words, if you want to have
a prayer of coming out of this.

1300
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:57,832
Okay. Okay.

1301
01:53:57,915 --> 01:54:00,167
- So, now I...
- Go to him.

1302
01:54:00,251 --> 01:54:01,252
Okay.

1303
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,672
- Jesus, do I need a little makeup?
- You need a hose.

1304
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:09,677
But you don't have the time.
It's fine that you look like that.

1305
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,847
It's genuine. You can use genuine.

1306
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:16,767
- Thank you, Mom.
- Honey.

1307
01:54:20,021 --> 01:54:23,941
It's not the worst thing in the world
to find out that you love your husband.

1308
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,372
It's late, Deborah.

1309
01:54:41,876 --> 01:54:44,128
I just wanted to say...

1310
01:54:51,135 --> 01:54:54,722
I can't sleep upstairs with you.
I just can't for now.

1311
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,604
I'm just so glad you're back.

1312
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:06,067
- I am.
- Yeah, okay.

1313
01:55:11,489 --> 01:55:12,531
Mom?

1314
01:55:40,017 --> 01:55:41,894
I'm done tonight, Deb.

1315
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:46,649
I don't think we can jam anything else in.

1316
01:55:47,608 --> 01:55:49,068
It's me, Dad.

1317
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,031
What's wrong, honey?

1318
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:59,411
I just wanted to check
that you were back and okay and all.

1319
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,873
I'm okay.

1320
01:56:03,624 --> 01:56:04,625
Okay.

1321
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:08,712
Because?

1322
01:56:14,635 --> 01:56:19,682
Mom was crying for six hours straight,
and Grandma was in with her

1323
01:56:19,765 --> 01:56:22,768
all that time, mostly saying,
"He'll be back. He'll be back."

1324
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:25,396
I just hate that you had that kind of night.

1325
01:56:25,855 --> 01:56:27,982
Oh, no, I...

1326
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:36,073
It's good for me to worry about
something that really matters

1327
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,703
instead of the stupid stuff
that's usually on my mind.

1328
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:42,621
Like?

1329
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:46,667
Surviving?

1330
01:56:50,546 --> 01:56:51,755
What?

1331
01:56:53,507 --> 01:56:58,846
How did you come up with this?
You are fantastic, Bernie. I love you.

1332
01:56:59,972 --> 01:57:02,766
- I love you.
- I know.

1333
01:57:03,809 --> 01:57:06,645
I mean, not about me being fantastic,
but just...

1334
01:57:09,148 --> 01:57:12,776
- Sleep well.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

1335
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,530
Hey...

1336
01:57:20,201 --> 01:57:22,453
- I...
- Sweetheart.

1337
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:26,999
Me, too.

1338
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:41,305
Come on. Sing it for Grandma.

1339
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:03,911
Cristina.

1340
01:58:06,038 --> 01:58:09,416
Hey, Mom. Is it okay
if we don't leave right away, please?

1341
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,542
No.

1342
01:58:12,378 --> 01:58:16,006
- Listen, just let me explain, please.
- No. We must say goodbye.

1343
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:18,008
Bernice is going to let me use her computer.

1344
01:58:18,092 --> 01:58:19,510
- This is for school, please.
- Listen to me.

1345
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:22,846
- It's for school. Just listen to me...
- I don't work here anymore!

1346
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:30,020
No, that's not fair.

1347
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:33,983
- That's not fair. You can't do this to me!
- Cristina.

1348
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:38,570
You can't do this to me.
You can't do this to me.

1349
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:48,831
- Do I have to get out?
- No, Georgie. Stay.

1350
01:58:56,839 --> 01:59:01,677
I think you are a wonderful boy.
Be good, like you are.

1351
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:04,013
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1352
01:59:05,723 --> 01:59:08,517
- I can't believe you didn't get out.
- Flor said.

1353
01:59:10,477 --> 01:59:12,062
I don't want to get you wet.

1354
01:59:13,522 --> 01:59:15,983
- Get me wet.
- Thanks.

1355
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:21,572
- You are a trip. You are.
- Thank you.

1356
01:59:23,949 --> 01:59:25,576
You are a beauty.

1357
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:27,202
Flor...

1358
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:31,665
Come on.

1359
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:35,419
Last chance to have some of you
rub off on me.

1360
01:59:37,504 --> 01:59:40,174
Listen, I'm sorry that you're sad,
but this could have been so much worse.

1361
01:59:41,175 --> 01:59:42,176
Flor?

1362
01:59:43,052 --> 01:59:45,679
Why don't you run upstairs
and say goodbye to Deborah?

1363
01:59:45,763 --> 01:59:46,889
I'm coming.

1364
01:59:46,972 --> 01:59:48,098
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1365
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:59,777
I live my life for myself.

1366
02:00:01,195 --> 02:00:03,447
You live your life for your daughter.

1367
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:06,325
None of it works.

1368
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:11,955
Thank you, Evelyn.

1369
02:00:18,087 --> 02:00:20,381
- We're leaving for good.
- No, it's okay.

1370
02:00:20,464 --> 02:00:23,384
- We're not coming back.
- It's okay. No, no, no, it's okay.

1371
02:00:23,467 --> 02:00:27,137
We're still gonna see each other at school.
Come on.

1372
02:00:27,221 --> 02:00:29,556
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

1373
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,725
Come on. No, no, no. Come on.

1374
02:00:31,809 --> 02:00:33,936
It's okay. I got some great things for you.
Want a computer?

1375
02:01:00,254 --> 02:01:03,590
Hey. I was waiting out here.

1376
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,138
Can't give you guys a lift?

1377
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,861
God bless the guy who gets you.

1378
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:39,376
- Let her keep them. Party favors.
- No.

1379
02:01:47,551 --> 02:01:48,552
Cristina...

1380
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:54,766
Goodbye, Mr. Clasky.

1381
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:58,896
I'm very sorry we won't be
seeing each other as frequently.

1382
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,069
Yes.

1383
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:10,240
Yes.

1384
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:13,827
Flor...

1385
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:42,940
Can I sleep at the Claskys'
when I stay late at school?

1386
02:02:43,315 --> 02:02:45,192
<i>Shortly after we left,</i>

1387
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:48,695
<i>my mother told me of another decision
she had reached.</i>

1388
02:02:49,655 --> 02:02:51,949
<i>I would no longer go to the private school.</i>

1389
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:54,201
No!

1390
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:57,746
No! No, you can't do that to me!

1391
02:02:57,829 --> 02:03:02,209
You can't do that to me!
No, you can't do that to me!

1392
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,589
You ruined everything!
You ruined everything!

1393
02:03:08,966 --> 02:03:12,511
This ruins my life! You've ruined everything!

1394
02:03:12,803 --> 02:03:14,972
I will never forgive you!

1395
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:19,560
No, it'll never be all right! You're wrong!

1396
02:03:20,227 --> 02:03:23,355
This is exactly what I was worried about!

1397
02:03:24,565 --> 02:03:27,109
I will never be able to forgive you!

1398
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:35,951
I have a scholarship!
And nobody gives this up!

1399
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:41,832
<i>The 1.3 miles from the Clasky house
to our bus stop</i>

1400
02:03:42,416 --> 02:03:44,293
<i>was the longest walk I'll ever know.</i>

1401
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,298
<i>I had publicly scorned my mother.</i>

1402
02:03:51,842 --> 02:03:54,052
<i>And yet she had not reacted.</i>

1403
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:04,563
<i>What did spark our climactic moment
was my use of a common American phrase.</i>

1404
02:04:06,315 --> 02:04:08,108
Not right now. I need some space.

1405
02:04:11,278 --> 02:04:12,988
Not a space between us.

1406
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:22,372
<i>In the midst of confrontation,
she found clarity.</i>

1407
02:04:38,972 --> 02:04:41,600
<i>She expressed regret that she had to ask me</i>

1408
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:45,395
<i>to deal with the basic question of my life
at such a young age.</i>

1409
02:04:49,733 --> 02:04:51,777
<i>And then she asked it.</i>

1410
02:04:57,324 --> 02:04:59,576
<i>"Is what you want for yourself</i>

1411
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:08,168
<i>"to become someone very different</i>

1412
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:12,589
<i>"than me?"</i>

1413
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:37,197
<i>I have been overwhelmed</i>

1414
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,409
<i>by your encouragement
to apply to your university</i>

1415
02:05:40,492 --> 02:05:43,453
<i>and your list of scholarships
available to me.</i>

1416
02:05:44,246 --> 02:05:47,082
<i>Though, as I hope this essay shows,</i>

1417
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:51,128
<i>your acceptance, while it would thrill me,</i>

1418
02:05:51,962 --> 02:05:53,839
<i>will not define me.</i>

1419
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:58,969
<i>My identity rests firmly</i>

1420
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:02,180
<i>and happily on one fact,</i>

1421
02:06:03,598 --> 02:06:05,809
<i>I am my mother's daughter.</i>

1422
02:06:20,449 --> 02:06:23,827
<i>Thank you. Cristina Moreno.</i>
