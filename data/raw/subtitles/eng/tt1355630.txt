BOY: What's goin' on, bro?

1043
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,640
Tight set tonight. GIRL:
Could I get your autograph?

1044
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,807
ADAM: Yeah, sure.

1045
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,765
Oh, wow. Okay.

1046
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,601
It says Willamette Stone.

1047
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,927
ADAM: Yeah. I can see that.

1048
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,684
There you go.
This is cool.

1049
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,811
If you're so bored
you have to read,

1050
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,810
maybe you should've just stayed home.
(SIGHS)

1051
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,049
I'm just trying to get
some homework done.

1052
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,610
And researching
what phrase

1053
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,126
I'm gonna have tattooed
over my left boob.

1054
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,921
What's all this?

1055
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,087
We got booked
last-minute to do

1056
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,280
a string of shows
in Seattle.

1057
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,523
We gotta leave
tonight, so...

1058
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,201
For how long?

1059
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,407
I don't know.
Like a week?

1060
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,606
Ten days?

1061
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,006
It's hard to say.

1062
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,522
Yeah, but we had plans.

1063
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,284
Remember?
For my birthday dinner?

1064
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,203
Oh, right. Shit. Sorry.

1065
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,326
Well, it's fine. I just
wish you would've told me.

1066
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,040
What, like you told
me about Juilliard?

1067
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,250
And for the record, I didn't
even hear about the tour

1068
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,163
until tonight right
before the show, so...

1069
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,409
So that's what "Glad you could
make it" was all about?

1070
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,885
That's why you're
so pissed at me?

1071
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,086
Why would I be pissed about
you going to a school

1072
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,207
3,000 miles away?

1073
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,842
I'm not going there, Adam.
It's just an audition.

1074
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,367
Which you didn't even
tell me about, Mia!

1075
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,204
And besides, this isn't
about Juilliard.

1076
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,044
This is about you
ditching on our plans.

1077
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,246
You're a liar.
Whoa!

1078
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,363
Screw you, Adam! I haven't
ditched out on anything.

1079
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,124
Am I crazy,
or did you say that

1080
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,521
us getting a place together
would be perfect? Huh?

1081
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,089
It's...
No, you know what?

1082
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,480
It's fine.

1083
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,721
Whatever.

1084
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,966
What? You get to
follow your dreams,

1085
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,202
but I can't follow mine unless
I have your permission?

1086
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,965
And I just have to sit
here and wait around,

1087
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,407
hoping that you'll come
home every few weeks?

1088
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,561
How is that fair?

1089
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,881
You lied to me, Mia.
We had plans.

1090
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,724
One minute, it's one thing. The
next minute, it's the other.

1091
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,080
I grew up with
that shit, okay?

1092
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,849
I don't need it.

1093
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,530
Even if I do go
to Juilliard,

1094
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,887
we can figure it out.

1095
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,082
Baby, we can text
and we can Skype...

1096
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,526
Skype? Skype?

1097
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,886
Jesus, Mia!
Have you ever even

1098
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,525
had a long-distance
relationship?

1099
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,090
It's bullshit.

1100
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,004
Okay? It's like
dating a ghost.

1101
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,003
But Skype, it solves
everything right?

1102
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,206
You know,
you're so naive, man.

1103
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,680
You don't know
shit about the world.

1104
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,404
I can't believe you
just said that to me.

1105
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,925
What, you want me
to write it down for you?

1106
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,810
(VAN HONKING) LIZ: Adam!
Sorry, dude, but we gotta jet

1107
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,962
if we wanna make it
to the motel before sunup.

1108
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,689
No! No. You cannot
leave me like that!

1109
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,330
Why didn't you tell me?

1110
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,250
Maybe because I am
terrified of losing you!

1111
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,166
You know what? You do your thing.
I'm gonna do mine.

1112
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,610
Fine, but for the record, you're
the one who's getting in the van.

1113
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,250
Yeah, whatever.

So, Mia's still unconscious.

1119

The respiratory therapists
are going to run some tests

1120
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,289
to see when they can wean
her off the ventilator.

1121
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,124
So, that's good news.

1122
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,282
If she can breathe
on her own.

00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,728
With comatose patients, the
first 24 hours are critical.

thought I'd drive
down for the day.

Of Jolari Hall
in San Francisco.

Where you'll be
auditioning for Juilliard.

That's the ceiling.

1151
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,002
I put it up there.

1152

MIA: It's intense.

1153
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,728
Yeah. I figured,

1154
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,961
you know, if you
look at it every night

1155
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,441
it wouldn't seem so scary
when you get there.

1156

I know, I suck.
No, no.

1159
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,607
You can't just disappear
from my life like that

1160
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,600
and pop back into it
whenever you feel like it.

1161
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,489
I know. It's just,

1162
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,883
the people in my life have a
habit of disappearing on me

1163
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,485
and when you
started making plans...

1164
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,642
You're not gonna lose me.

1165
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,723

Shut up. And just open it.
Come on.

(SIGHS) God, I hate you.

1176
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,400

know you were good?

What was, like, the moment?

1181
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,763
Actually,
there was one night.

1182
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,968
When we first
started playing out.

1183
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,251
Right before the show, Liz talked
me into going to the liquor store

1184
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,328
and getting her a Red Bull.

1185
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,330
So l go in

1186
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,364
and there's this drunk dude
buying a bottle of Jack.

1187
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,963
And I realize it's him.

1188
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,249
It's my old man.

1189
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,531
And I just

1190
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,325
stop cold.

1191
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,888
And he just looks
right at me

1192
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,005
and walks out.

1193
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,804
No idea who I was.

1194
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,005
Shit, Adam.

1195
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,727
Then that night,
I played like I was on fire.

1196
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,644
I don't know if I
thought I was good.

1197
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,326
I just knew that
nothing else mattered.

1198
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,449
Till now.

1199
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,931

1202
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,690
I kind of picture

1203
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,888
myself inside the cello.

1518
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,049
I remember the day
that he quit the band.

1519
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,411
He just up and said,

1520
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,291
"That's it.
The time has come."

1521
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,042
I was surprised.

1522
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,929
I never really liked
the way the band sounded,

1523
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,048
but I knew how
important it was to him.

1524
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,642
And so I asked him, I said,
"Why are you quitting?"

1525
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,847
And he said,

1526
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,527
"You make sacrifices
for your kids.

1527
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,364
"For your kids."

1528
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,529
He said that
without even blinking.

1529
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,568
That's why
he quit the band.

1530
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,171
For Teddy.

1531
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,560
For you.

1532
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,843
It was when he heard
you play so well.

1533
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,401
I think that's when
it clicked for him.

1534
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,246
Your incredible talent, it...

1535
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,407
He just couldn't believe it.

1536
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,605
And all he wanted to do
was to give you more.

1537
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,808
So, he quit the band,

1538
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,684
he sold his drum kit

1539
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,450
and he bought you that cello.

1540

you and some aren't,

01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,206
<i>From all the nights with you</i>

1733
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,647
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1734
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,889
<i>I don't want you anymore</i>

1735
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:41,447
<i>I don't want you
to feel the same as me</i>

1736
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,927
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1737
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,481
<i>But now I'm letting you know</i>

1738
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,967
<i>I just wanted to feel</i>

1739
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,728
<i>The life in me</i>

1740
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,204
<i>I went from solid steel</i>

1741
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,963
<i>To broken glass</i>

1742
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,331
<i>The darkest side in me</i>

1743
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,571
<i>You brought out fast</i>

1744
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,490
<i>The things I said were true</i>

1745
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,291
<i>I'm taking them back from you</i>

1746
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,927
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1747
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,242
<i>I don't want you anymore</i>

1748
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:37,767
<i>I don't want you
to feel the same as me</i>

1749
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,201
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1750
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,841
<i>But now I'm letting you know</i>

1751
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,241
<i>I just wanted to feel</i>

1752
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,161
<i>The life in me</i>

1753
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,127
<i>I miss you</i>

1754
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,602
<i>I wish you</i>

1755
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,643
<i>Will let me be</i>

1756
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,287
<i>Just leave it</i>

1757
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,522
<i>We stopped breathing</i>

1758
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,570
<i>I</i> need to <i>be</i> free

1759
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,881
<i>I never wanted to go</i>

1760
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,168
<i>But now I'm letting you know</i>

1761
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,369
<i>I just wanted to feel</i>

1762
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,163
<i>The life in me</i>
