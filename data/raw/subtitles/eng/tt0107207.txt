1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,546
<i>Come to me</i>

2
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,777
<i>Come lie beside me</i>

3
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:18,816
<i>And don't deny me your love</i>

4
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:26,016
<i>Make sense of me</i>

5
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:29,503
<i>Walk through my doorway</i>

6
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:33,546
<i>Don't hide in the hallway
oh, love</i>

7
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:40,384
<i>Step over</i>

8
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:50,177
<i>I'll follow you down</i>

9
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,504
<i>In the name of whisky</i>

10
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:19,024
<i>In the name of song</i>

11
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,544
<i>You didn't look back</i>

12
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,383
<i>You didn't belong</i>

13
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,058
<i>In the name of reason</i>

14
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,698
<i>In the name of hope</i>

15
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,378
<i>In the name of religion</i>

16
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,818
<i>In the name of dope</i>

17
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,179
<i>In the name of freedom</i>

18
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,417
<i>You drifted away</i>

19
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,260
<i>To see the sun shining</i>

20
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,577
<i>On someone else's day</i>

21
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,418
<i>In the name of United</i>

22
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,978
<i>And the BBC</i>

23
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:03,578
<i>In the name of Georgie Best</i>

24
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:06,224
<i>And LSD</i>

25
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,375
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

26
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,503
<i>And His wife, the Spirit</i>

27
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:14,023
<i>You said you did not</i>

28
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,663
<i>They said you did</i>

29
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,178
<i>In the name ofjustice</i>

30
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,738
<i>In the name of fun</i>

31
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,458
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

32
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,018
<i>In the name of the Son</i>

33
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:41,736
<i>Call to me</i>

34
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,177
<i>No one is listening</i>

35
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:50,136
<i>I'm waiting to hear from you, love</i>

36
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,422
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

37
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:07,659
<i>Good. I never said "thank you"
for taking up our case.</i>

38
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,942
<i>Never thought I'd trust
an English person again...</i>

39
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:12,063
<i>especially a lawyer.</i>

40
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:16,504
<i>Anyhow, I'll be as accurate as I can
with names, dates and places...</i>

41
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:19,306
<i>anything that might help
in our defence.</i>

42
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:22,060
<i>To explain how I happened
to be in England in 1974...</i>

43
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:23,660
<i>at the time of the bombing...</i>

44
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,978
<i>I'd better take you back
to Northern Ireland, where I come from.</i>

45
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:30,821
<i>Belfast in the early '70s was chaos.</i>

46
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,738
<i>It was strange to see
soldiers on the street--</i>

47
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:35,819
<i>all of them terrified
of the civilian population...</i>

48
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:37,977
<i>any one of whom could be
an IRA gunman.</i>

49
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,338
<i>I was just a petty thief...</i>

50
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,463
<i>stealing scrap metal.</i>

51
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:46,015
<i>In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.</i>

52
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:50,103
Get down, Gerry,
for fuck's sake.

53
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:51,336
Tommo!

54
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,022
<i>The IRA had already
given me three warnings...</i>

55
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:58,577
<i>and when a British patrol mistook me for
a gunman, that got me into real trouble.</i>

56
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,544
Is he trying to fucking shoot us?

57
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,621
There's a sniper! He's up there!

58
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,620
I can't get a bead on him.

59
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,982
Shoot him
before he fucking kills us!

60
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,585
Fucking bastards!

61
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,580
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr Kelly, love.

62
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:51,341
Two suspects proceeding
back west--

63
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:53,381
Mr Kelly!

64
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:55,900
Bastards!

65
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:58,865
We have to move the guns.
You go and move the gear.

66
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,017
Right. Everyone out now!
Come on!

67
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,780
Get out of the fucking way.
The Brits is after us!

68
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,304
The Brits is after us!
The Brits are after us!

69
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:13,345
- In here, in here!
- Gerry!

70
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,497
Come on, come on.
This way, lads.

71
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,185
Go! Go! Go, go!

72
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,141
Go on, Gerry!

73
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,263
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

74
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:48,937
They're right in front of us, boys.

75
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,665
- Who is it?
- It's Conlon.

76
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:55,816
Grab him!

77
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,906
It's your brother!
Your brother Gerry!

78
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,095
Oh, my God!

79
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,259
Fucking English bastards!

80
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:45,015
They've started a riot
to cover the sniper.

81
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:46,904
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him.

82
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,261
Let's go, lads.

83
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,617
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

84
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,540
Get that child out of here now!

85
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:03,698
Move that child!

86
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,621
Shoot that fucking gas now!

87
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,575
Come and fucking get us now,
you bastards!

88
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:34,856
Let him go, you bastards!

89
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,824
Fucking bitch!

90
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,899
You okay?

91
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,978
- I got a friend wants to talk to you.
- Oh, fuck's sake.

92
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,865
Hey, come on. We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, all right?

93
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,938
Let's be smart.
Come on.

94
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,586
They're taking
your brother away!

95
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,585
Where are you going now?

96
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,464
- We weren't robbing no houses.
- Don't fuck with me.

97
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,185
Suddenly you're a good boy?

98
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,701
- Have you been robbing houses again?
- We weren't robbing houses.

99
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:16,096
Search him.
Did you get away all right?

100
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,018
- Aye.
- Who was it?

101
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,745
- It was those two.
- Those two?

102
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:23,103
- That isn't mine. It isn't.
- Peter?

103
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,860
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

104
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,096
Fuck you!

105
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,546
Daddy, Daddy,
the IRA has our Gerry.

106
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,378
Go on, show me.

107
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,856
Yo, give him that.

108
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:41,097
Right, Tommo, lad.

109
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:54,144
Tommo, get their trousers down.
I fucking warned you, Danny.

110
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,343
- Peter, we didn't do nothing, honestly.
- Give you a break?

111
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,736
What's she saying?
What are we supposed to have done?

112
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,977
This is what I'm gonna give you.
Now get your trousers down.

113
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,456
You just ran into the house
where we had all that gear.

114
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:06,107
What was I supposed to know?
I was trying to get away from the Brits.

115
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,939
'Cause you were
stealing lead again, weren't you?

116
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,460
You were stealing lead.

117
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:11,742
- Shut up, Danny!
- They were shooting at us.

118
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,579
- Get the strides down now.
- Why?

119
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,465
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound
and lose your leg, that's why.

120
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,663
Come on, Peter. Give us a few slaps.
You don't have to shoot us.

121
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:21,578
- Fuck's sake.
- Fucking Tarzan.

122
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,385
Look at the balls on him!

123
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:28,496
Jesus! Christ!
Peter! Peter!

124
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,101
They're only young.
Give 'em a chance.

125
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,701
We were just trying
to scare some sense into them.

126
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:35,584
He was stealing lead again.

127
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,783
He ran through one of our houses
and started all this shit.

128
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,505
Did you start all this?

129
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:44,385
He'll never survive
in this town. Never.

130
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,344
This is the last time.
You two blow!

131
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:48,019
And, Danny, it's the last time.

132
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,825
- The same for you, Conlon.
- Pull up your trousers.

133
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,545
Come back here!

134
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:56,303
- We've never had a thief in our family.
- We've never had nothing in our family.

135
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,777
- Will you get a job?
- You know we can't get jobs.

136
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,024
I have a job.

137
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,223
Do you want me to work
as a bookie's clerk?

138
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:09,585
- I want you to have some respect.
- Aye, respect for who?

139
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,220
For yourself.

140
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,736
We're getting you out of here.

141
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,738
He'll do no growing up
in England, Giuseppe.

142
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,182
No family life there.

143
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,542
Oh, give over, Ma.

144
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,346
I'm gonna miss the boat.
What's that?

145
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,987
- Sausages for your Aunt Annie.
-Jesus Christ, Ma!

146
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,864
- Here you are, son.
- Here, let me do that.

147
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,657
All right, I'm ready.
Where are you going?

148
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,896
I'll walk with you.

149
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,625
Do you not trust me
to get on the boat?

150
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:54,501
I'm sure I'll be back
when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

151
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,498
Good luck. God bless.

152
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,339
I love you, son.

153
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,702
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Behave yourself, Ann.

154
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,186
Cheerio, Gerry.

155
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,541
Bye, Bridie.

156
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:19,578
He's gone now forever.

157
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,227
I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

158
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,617
Did I ever tell you
the time I jumped ship?

159
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:29,102
Jumped overboard
about 200 yards out to sea...

160
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,337
swam back to this
godforsaken place.

161
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,462
Why did you swim back?

162
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,458
There was a woman involved.

163
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,500
Oh, aye?

164
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,984
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

165
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,418
What was her name?

166
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:02,975
Aye, you know her name.
You know your own mother's name.

167
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,821
Sarah.
Sarah Maguire she was.

168
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,705
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

169
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,416
<i>Boarding all passengers.</i>

170
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:25,305
<i>All second-class passengers
boarding now.</i>

171
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:40,342
Go and live.
Go and live, son.

172
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,304
That's the best advice
I can give you.

173
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:52,223
Remember,
honest money goes further.

174
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,985
<i>Honest money goes further.</i>

175
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,739
<i>A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.</i>

176
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:59,136
<i>Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.</i>

177
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:01,741
<i>He'd a cliche
for every occasion.</i>

178
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:05,985
I'll give you a call.

179
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,659
Right, son.

180
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,704
<i>I ran up the gangplank
to get away from him...</i>

181
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:15,017
<i>and then I suddenly
felt bad about it.</i>

182
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:16,938
<i>I decided to turn back...</i>

183
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:20,576
<i>to call him Giuseppe
for the first time in my life.</i>

184
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:24,016
<i>When I turned around,
he had already walked away.</i>

185
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,056
<i>- I just called after him.
- Good-bye, Da!</i>

186
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:36,985
<i>Then I met my old schoolmate,
Paul Hill.</i>

187
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,821
<i>Little did I know that after meeting him
my life would change forever.</i>

188
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,419
You're under arrest.

189
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:53,303
Fuck's sake, Gerry!

190
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:56,697
- Still a head case.
-James Bond, license to kill.

191
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,378
Look at you-- you're a fucking nervous
wreck. What's the matter with you?

192
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,105
I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

193
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:09,584
Where're you going?

194
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,465
- I'm going to London. What about you?
- The same.

195
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,583
I need a drink.

196
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:18,103
Aye, I'm skint.
I'll let you buy me one.

197
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:32,740
<i>Once upon a time
you dressed so fine</i>

198
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,466
<i>You threw the bums a dime
in your prime</i>

199
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,139
<i>Didn't you</i>

200
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,985
<i>I arrived in London
on the 26th ofJune.</i>

201
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,661
<i>My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie...</i>

202
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:48,819
<i>but I had an invitation to a hippie
commune from my old friend...</i>

203
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,057
<i>Paddy Armstrong.</i>

204
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:53,456
Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.

205
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,902
- It's only that big on the map.
- But it's a map, Gerry.

206
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:57,943
London's a big place, you know.

207
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:05,823
<i>What I was really looking for
was free love and dope.</i>

208
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,817
I think it's this way.

209
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:27,057
Paddy?

210
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,301
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

211
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,776
- Paddy who?
- Paddy from Belfast. Paddy Armstrong.

212
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:39,665
- There's some people here to see you!
- Who is it?

213
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,066
Some Irish boys.

214
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,217
Jesus! Gerry Conlon.

215
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,865
What about you, Paddy?

216
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:46,824
Thought you was the drug squad.
Come on in.

217
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,941
There you go.

218
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,744
Welcome to Xanadu.

219
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,701
Hi.

220
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,978
Jesus fucking wept.

221
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,217
Neat, ain't it?

222
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:10,979
Deptford Jim.

223
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,422
- Paul Hill. Gerry Conlon from home.
- Right.

224
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,418
Before you can enter the circle...

225
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:22,216
you have to have
the rite of passage.

226
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:24,104
Open your mouth.

227
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,743
I enjoyed that.

228
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,025
They can't stay.

229
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,018
- There's not enough room.
-Jim!

230
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:47,942
Our rule:
No property. No law.

231
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:49,983
-Just love.
- All right, let's vote on it.

232
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,341
If you want Gerry and--

233
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,304
- What's your name?
- Paul.

234
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,502
We're gonna call you
"Saddest Moon".

235
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,817
- Fuck off.
- Right?

236
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:05,546
If you want Gerry and Saddest Moon
to stay, raise your hands.

237
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,663
Four, five, six--

238
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:11,102
- Put your hand up, Paddy.
- Right.

239
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,621
- Eight.
- Looks like we're staying then.

240
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,180
What shall we call you then?

241
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,301
You can call me "Wild One."

242
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:28,901
Here, hold on. Come here.

243
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,659
Get off, all right?

244
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,738
What's the fucking problem?

245
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,303
They have dead pig in here.

246
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:38,666
Just some sausages.

247
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,897
We're all vegetarians here.

248
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:43,137
I am a vegetarian.
We're both vegetarians.

249
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,661
I was just taking them sausages
to me Auntie Annie's.

250
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:49,296
I have to be around there now. I'll be
back in a few minutes, all right?

251
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:51,945
Be back in a few minutes.

252
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,015
Piggy.

253
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,699
And Porky.

254
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,821
Is she related to the
Royal Family or something?

255
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:06,818
Aye, she's fifth in line
to the throne.

256
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,983
Ferguson's sausages-- only good thing
that came out of that godforsaken place.

257
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,659
- Would you like some more?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

258
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,864
- We better make tracks.
- Won't you stay? I've the bed made up.

259
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,381
You're very kind, but we need
a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

260
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,378
We're forming a band
and that there.

261
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,662
Aye. A rock band.

262
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,495
Where are you staying?

263
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,146
- The address, you mean?
- Uh-huh.

264
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,376
- Fillmore.
- Fillimore.

265
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:39,857
Fillimore Road.
It's number 60...

266
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:43,257
something--
the number dropped off the door.

267
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:47,824
What do you mean,
the number dropped off the door?

268
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:52,101
Well, would you let me have it
when you find out what it is?

269
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:55,020
- Aye.
- And would you phone your mother?

270
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,746
Aye.
There's only one problem.

271
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,019
It doesn't have a phone.

272
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,384
Hello, Marian. Any problems?

273
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,264
- Is it all there?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,337
Okay.
We're in business.

275
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:18,100
Watch the cracks.
Watch the cracks.

276
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:20,940
It's not fair.
Their skirts are covering the cracks.

277
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,699
He's cheating!

278
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,015
- I'm a referee!
- He's cheating.

279
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,023
- That wasn't too far away, was it?
- Is that a bomb, Paddy?

280
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:16,098
It's getting more like home.

281
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:19,980
Hello? Hold on, hold on.

282
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,422
Giuseppe. Giuseppe.
Long-distance call.

283
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:24,418
- What?
- Long-distance call.

284
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,746
- Go ahead.
- Hello?

285
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,704
- Ask him for the money.
- Hey, Da.

286
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,425
<i>- It's Gerry speaking.
- Son.</i>

287
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,498
<i>- Hi. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?</i>

288
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,703
It's been six weeks
since you've been in touch.

289
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,823
<i>I know. Sorry about that.
I've been a bit busy.</i>

290
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:42,263
It's just your ma's a bit worried,
you know. You still going to Mass?

291
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:45,339
<i>- Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork.
- Good.</i>

292
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:49,102
<i>- Are you working?
- I have a couple of things going here.</i>

293
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,779
Ah, good.
And are you safe?

294
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,700
<i>- How do you mean?
- From all the bombs.</i>

295
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,540
Aye, you could just hear them
in the distance like, but--

296
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:59,380
Sorry about that.

297
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,742
<i>- Are you stuck?
- How do you mean, Da?</i>

298
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,306
Are you short of cash?

299
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,947
Uh, no. No, I'm flush
at the moment.

300
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,541
No problem.
No, I have plenty of money.

301
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:10,902
All right.
And, Gerry, keep in touch.

302
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:14,297
<i>- Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.
- All right, son. I'll tell your ma--</i>

303
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,659
Bye.

304
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,339
Sorry about that.

305
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:23,895
We've enough for chips.

306
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,063
Sorry, we'd only
enough money for two chips.

307
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,660
Are you all right?

308
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,465
What?

309
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:34,378
There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

310
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,504
There they are.
It's the Irish.

311
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,418
Bringing all their troubles
over here again.

312
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:44,137
Aye, it's all right when it happens
over in Belfast. You fucking prick!

313
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:47,902
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

314
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:51,582
- You stupid fucking prick!
- Go home! Fuck you!

315
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,817
I don't fucking believe this.
I'm getting out of here.

316
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:56,216
- Are you coming, Paddy?
- Where are you gonna sleep?

317
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:59,060
Ah, no problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

318
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:03,745
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Take care.

319
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:06,546
- Mind your fucking manners!
- Prick.

320
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,983
<i>Troops have entered
the Ardoyne area of West Belfast...</i>

321
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,582
<i>since the collapse of the provisional
IRA cease-fire over the weekend.</i>

322
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,817
Yeah, I'm watching it.

323
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:20,583
<i>Civilians have been evacuated, and there
are reports of casualties in many areas.</i>

324
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,465
<i>- Both sides are blaming each other--
- Okay, I'll take care of it.</i>

325
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:28,498
That's it. 8:00 tonight.

326
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:30,620
No warning.

327
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:42,501
That's my place.
Youse are sitting there too long.

328
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:47,263
CB-- Charlie Burke.
That's me.

329
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:50,100
I carved my initials
with this penknife.

330
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:53,702
No problem, Charlie.
No problem. Whatever you say.

331
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:56,984
Closing the park.
Park closing now.

332
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,581
- Easy with the feet there, Charlie.
- It's a big bench, you know?

333
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,783
There's room for three of us here.

334
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,938
You're Irish too, aren't you?

335
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:10,139
I come over here
when I was about your age.

336
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,661
Did you ever think
of going home, Charlie?

337
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,817
Ah, shit.

338
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:17,660
There's nothing for me
over there now.

339
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:24,984
- Closing the park!
- Could you lend us a few shillings?

340
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,864
I was gonna ask you the same.

341
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,342
- Gerry, we've no money left.
- It's all I have.

342
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:40,260
Well, now, like I wouldn't like
to take all your money.

343
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,338
No problem.
Catch you again, Charlie.

344
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:45,703
- Come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.
- All right, all right.

345
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,819
<i>We must'vejust said good night
to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.</i>

346
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:04,536
<i>All we were concerned about was
where we were gonna sleep that night.</i>

347
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,618
<i>We'd no money
in our pockets.</i>

348
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:09,779
<i>We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford
even if we'd known where it was.</i>

349
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:14,865
No fucking way I'm going
back to Belfast.

350
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:16,539
I tell you that.

351
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:22,700
- Hey, blondie.
- Hey, sexy.

352
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,857
- You dropped something.
- Back off, paddy.

353
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,824
She's outta your league.

354
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,181
Here.

355
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,535
It's her fucking keys.
I'm going in.

356
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:41,300
We should give 'em back, Gerry.
Put 'em through the letter box.

357
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,582
Put the keys back
in the letter box, Gerry.

358
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,298
Jesus Christ,
how much money is there?

359
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:47,138
<i>I got £700 from
the hooker's apartment.</i>

360
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:49,866
<i>I did feel a little bit
guilty about that.</i>

361
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:53,946
<i>We spent that night
in a hotel.</i>

362
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:58,179
<i>The next day we went and bought
the same clothes-- the same trousers...</i>

363
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,906
<i>samejackets,
even the same shoes.</i>

364
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,427
Hey, mister,
has your coat got fleas?

365
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:42,816
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

366
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:49,142
- Did you miss me, Bridie?
- Look at Gerry. He's a hippie!

367
00:26:49,227 --> 00:26:50,296
Daddy, look at the money!

368
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:52,343
- Do you want it?
- Oh, my God!

369
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,463
Do you wanna be in my gang?

370
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,823
Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang.
I wanna be in your gang.

371
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,977
- Over here.
- Take it easy.

372
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:03,582
Steady. Calm it down.
Just calm it down.

373
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,386
It's my money!
It's mine!

374
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,219
Calm it down. Stop it.

375
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,979
- It's my money! He gave it to me!
- Stop that!

376
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:11,386
Stop that!

377
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:19,501
And they were always talking about
the troubles, were they?

378
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:23,620
Yeah.
Especially Paul Hill.

379
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:27,666
He was always talking about Belfast,
the IRA, all that stuff.

380
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,467
Look, all I'm saying is this:

381
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:36,256
They had a lot of money,
and Conlon went back to Belfast.

382
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:38,941
- Come along, into the car.
- What the fuck is going on?

383
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,058
That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.

384
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,422
- Aye.
- Did it hurt you, Danny?

385
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:48,817
It wasn't too bad. The bullet bounced
off the kneecap and out the other side.

386
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,340
<i>Five people are dead...</i>

387
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:53,737
<i>and 75 seriously injured
as a result of the IRA 's....</i>

388
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:57,342
<i>no-warning bomb attack
on a Guildford pub.</i>

389
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,817
<i>Parliament has passed
the Prevention of Terrorism Act...</i>

390
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:04,502
<i>which allows terrorist suspects to be
held by police for up to seven days.</i>

391
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:07,260
Seven days. Geez.

392
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:10,225
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

393
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:14,425
<i>...around London
and arrested 19 suspects.</i>

394
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:16,623
Gerry, there's your shoes.

395
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:19,267
<i>Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert
Dixon of the antiterrorist squad...</i>

396
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:21,065
<i>about those arrests.</i>

397
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:23,422
<i>We can't pretend
people won't be inconvenienced.</i>

398
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:25,384
<i>Some of them may not deserve it.</i>

399
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:29,016
<i>That's why we shall use these powers
as selectively as possible.</i>

400
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,227
Get up out of bed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!

401
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,581
Hands above your head!

402
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:44,503
I don't know what the fuck youse are
looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

403
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:48,102
Gerry, your coat.
He's done nothing.

404
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,586
- Inside, sir.
- He's not political.

405
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,464
I have a right to speak to my son.

406
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,941
Keep calm, Gerry.

407
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:59,615
Get back in.
Get back inside.

408
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:05,025
It's all right.
It's all right.

409
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,135
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out soon enough.

410
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:28,022
- Where'd he get this money?
- I don't know.

411
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,740
They have no right
to take him to England.

412
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,979
Slow down a bit.

413
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,580
Look, I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about.

414
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,423
I've done nothing wrong.

415
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,263
When can I go back to Belfast?

416
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:01,145
Next time you see Belfast, they'll be
flying day trips to the moon.

417
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:04,062
I always wanted
to be an astronaut.

418
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,178
What are you charging me with?

419
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,940
You're being held
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

420
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,096
What?

421
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:24,782
We can hold you for seven days
and seven nights without charging you.

422
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:28,257
- When was I a fucking terrorist?
- Were you part of that, Gerry?

423
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,459
And that.
You proud of that?

424
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,779
- And that.
- Why are you showing me these people?

425
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:42,306
No marks!
Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

426
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:43,979
Are you fucking proud of that?

427
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:48,179
Look at that young,
pretty girl there!

428
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:51,577
- Now look at her!
- You're out of your fucking minds!

429
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,464
- Do you?
- You're out of your fucking minds!

430
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,217
The children know there's
something terrible going on.

431
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:02,186
- And you're not making it easier.
- I haven't the strength for this.

432
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,258
If he killed innocent people,
I haven't the strength for it.

433
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:07,622
Listen, I know that child.
I carried that child.

434
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,698
If you're not gonna
believe in him, I will.

435
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:11,539
You think he's innocent?

436
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:13,982
When your son walked through that door
looking like a bloody circus clown...

437
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,023
do you think he had murder
in his eyes?

438
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,023
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

439
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,224
- It's a surprise.
- Shut up. Shut up!

440
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:38,937
When will Daddy be back?

441
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:40,983
He'll be back
in a couple of days.

442
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:44,698
Why did they put
Gerry in jail?

443
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:46,379
It's a mistake.

444
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:50,546
I'm on my way over
to bring him back home.

445
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,822
Why are you getting
narky again?

446
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,338
Are we touching a sore spot?

447
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:58,543
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England.

448
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:01,425
I told you about 100 times.

449
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:02,781
Then tell us again!

450
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:09,386
I stayed at the squat
most of the time.

451
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,264
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's...

452
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:13,861
and one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

453
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,067
Male. Late forties.

454
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,536
Who taught you
how to make the bomb, Gerry?

455
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,902
I never made any bombs.

456
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:39,545
Did Annie make the bomb,
Gerry?

457
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,626
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

458
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:46,981
Is Annie Marian?

459
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,061
- Annie who?
- Annie Maguire!

460
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:54,105
My Aunt Annie?

461
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:57,145
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

462
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,422
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

463
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:01,577
Are you Marian?

464
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:07,302
What?

465
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,615
Are you Marian?

466
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:12,302
She had nothing
to do with it.

467
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:19,020
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

468
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,018
He says I done Guildford.

469
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:25,861
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

470
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:29,496
Show me what you want me to sign.
I have an alibi for that night.

471
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:37,347
What are you showing me
these for?

472
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,939
Gerry told us you did it.

473
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,938
Then he's a fucking liar.

474
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:48,305
Armstrong drove the car.
Who was the woman in the back?

475
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:53,104
I don't know.

476
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:56,338
But you were
in the Ford Cortina.

477
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,305
But you were
in the red Ford Cortina.

478
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,503
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

479
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:07,097
I told you I was in the Cortina.
I told you it was a taxi.

480
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:09,462
No. The taxi was
a Toyota Corolla.

481
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:11,822
When can I ring home?

482
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:16,344
- Let's start again. Who's Marian?
- Was it someone Irish?

483
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:20,022
Why are you getting narky again?
Touching a sore spot? What was her name?

484
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:23,656
- Nothing to do with what, Gerry?
- Talk to me.

485
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,305
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

486
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:29,903
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?"

487
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:31,978
Who taught you how
to make the bomb, Gerry?

488
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,541
Talk to me.

489
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,058
He'll do what he's told.

490
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:49,178
Look at him.
He's a lying bastard.

491
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:51,986
He's a right fucking comedian.
Aren't you, Gerry?

492
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,456
- Who's Marian?
- I don't know what--

493
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:57,664
I'm getting fucking bored with this.
Who is Marian?

494
00:35:57,747 --> 00:36:01,820
I'm gonna keep on asking until
you give me a fucking answer!

495
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:03,386
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know!

496
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:06,106
Yes, you fucking do!
Bollocks! Who is Marian?

497
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:12,899
We know who Marian is.

498
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:26,101
- Are you the man in charge?
- Yes, I am.

499
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,940
For fuck's sake,
tell 'em to stop hurting me.

500
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,338
I swear to God...

501
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,305
I know where I was
at the time of the bombings.

502
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:46,459
I was with a madman
called Charlie Burke.

503
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:49,219
Have you any other alibis?

504
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,538
I have told youse before...

505
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,141
I was with Paul Hill
most of the day.

506
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,417
Tell Gerry Conlon
like you said you would.

507
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,941
- Who's this?
- Gerry Conlon.

508
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,539
Have you anything
to say to him?

509
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,065
I've cleared my conscience.

510
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:29,297
I advise you to do the same.

511
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,379
There's your statement.

512
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:49,818
I didn't do this.

513
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,501
I didn't fucking do this!

514
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:01,026
Please believe me.

515
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:04,224
What are you doing to me?

516
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:11,737
They wouldn't hold him
if he hadn't done something.

517
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:16,058
- Gerry is no angel.
- I know that.

518
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:18,058
He needs a strong hand.

519
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:25,499
You're all under arrest.

520
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,021
- No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child!
- Put your hands up!

521
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:31,224
You're all being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

522
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:42,539
- Is Hill leading us up the garden path?
- I don't know.

523
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,817
I can make him confess.

524
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:52,659
Why don't you have
a word in his ear?

525
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,580
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

526
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,578
Will you have the bomber?

527
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,817
Our job is
to stop the bombing.

528
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:04,343
I'm gonna shoot your da.

529
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:08,902
What did you say to me?

530
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:14,266
Little Bridie'll
have no daddy.

531
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:16,497
I'm gonna shoot Giuseppe.

532
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,498
He's threatening to shoot my da!

533
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:31,499
He's threatening to kill my da!

534
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:33,305
Look at him!
Look at him!

535
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,345
He's a madman!

536
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:40,215
I think you're hallucinating.
Nobody's gonna harm your father.

537
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:44,501
Get him back.
Get him back.

538
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:48,465
He threatened to kill my da.

539
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,503
Nobody's gonna kill your father.

540
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:53,545
- You mad bastard!
- Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

541
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,138
He's not gonna harm your father.

542
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,181
Come on, let it all out.

543
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:03,178
Let it all out--
all that hatred.

544
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:09,857
You hate us, don't you?

545
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:12,541
You hate us enough
to bomb and maim.

546
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,744
That is the trouble.
You let it all out. Come on.

547
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:18,739
- I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.

548
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:22,217
I can see it in your face.
I can see all that hatred.

549
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:24,775
So why don't you just
let it off your chest...

550
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:27,301
before it starts to mess up
with your mind?

551
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:35,344
Give me the fucking statement.

552
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:39,545
For fuck's sake,
give me the statement.

553
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:43,500
Give me a fucking pen.

554
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:55,138
Right, that's my fucking name there.
You can write what you like.

555
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:59,620
All right, nice and easy.
Come on.

556
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:03,256
- Paul! What's going on?
- Gerry!

557
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:05,861
They stuck a fucking gun
in my mouth!

558
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,665
So I told 'em
a lot of bullshit!

559
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:10,819
- Why did you give 'em my fucking name?
- I'm sorry!

560
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:15,344
It's fucking mad!
It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

561
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:17,782
It'll be laughed
out of fucking court!

562
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,586
<i>The four of us were split up.</i>

563
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,420
<i>I was taken to
South London Remand Centre.</i>

564
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,021
<i>You can check the dates, Gareth.</i>

565
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,264
Kill that fucker!

566
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:41,706
You fucking son
of an Irish cow!

567
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:48,705
Kick that Irish fucking ass!

568
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:50,738
- What is that?
- Delousing.

569
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:52,584
I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.

570
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,578
You have no choice, mate.

571
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,056
You'll never clean the scum
off that--

572
00:42:57,147 --> 00:43:00,298
Okay, Conlon.
Go see the room, shall we?

573
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:07,543
Come on, Mr Conlon.

574
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,738
We got your son.

575
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,066
Let's go.

576
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:22,747
Da!

577
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:24,499
Is that you, son?

578
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:29,263
- Da, here!
- Where are you?

579
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:35,301
Don't harm my father.
Don't harm my father!

580
00:43:35,387 --> 00:43:36,820
- Are you all right, son?
- Don't kill him!

581
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:45,747
Come on, move along.
Move along. Come on, you.

582
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:48,420
- Fuck you!
- Shut up, you!

583
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:51,783
- Shut up!
- On the floor!

584
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:55,742
You look fucking brave now.

585
00:44:02,747 --> 00:44:05,747
What the fuck
are you doing here, Da?

586
00:44:05,747 --> 00:44:09,057
I come over to your Aunt Annie's
to get you a lawyer.

587
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,747
They arrested everybody
in the house.

588
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,747
What?

589
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:15,747
- What for, fuck's sake?
- Conspiracy to murder.

590
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:18,136
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck's sake, no. Geez.

591
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:27,496
Did you do it?
Did you do it, son?

592
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:29,100
No, I did not!

593
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:36,545
Of course I fucking
didn't do it, fuck's sake!

594
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:49,736
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What?

595
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:56,382
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

596
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:58,423
Why do you always follow me?

597
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:04,419
Why do you always follow me
when I do something wrong?

598
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:07,260
Why can't you follow me
when I do something right?

599
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:09,736
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

600
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:12,295
- I'm talking about the medal.
- What medal?

601
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:15,106
What fucking medal?
What fucking medal?

602
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:19,465
The only fucking medal that was ever
in our house. That fucking medal.

603
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:22,266
The medal I won at football.

604
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,702
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions...

605
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:26,180
like you could only see
what I was doing--

606
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:28,747
you couldn't even
fucking play football--

607
00:45:28,747 --> 00:45:31,466
and you could only see
what I was doing wrong.

608
00:45:31,547 --> 00:45:33,617
I could never do anything
good enough for you.

609
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,505
And after the game,
you came up to me and said...

610
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:39,624
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

611
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:43,143
And I walked away from you, remember?
I walked away into the dressing room.

612
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:46,503
You followed me in there and said again,
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

613
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:48,817
All the other fathers were in there
laughing at you...

614
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,747
calling you "Poor Giuseppe."

615
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:54,456
And I ran out, and I hid,
and I wrote your name on the ground--

616
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:56,139
your stupid Giuseppe fucking name--

617
00:45:56,227 --> 00:45:58,661
I wrote it in the dirt,
and I fucking pissed on it!

618
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,747
I pissed on it...

619
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:05,466
because I did foul the ball.

620
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:09,460
What did it matter? We won.
For once in our lives, we won.

621
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,425
You ruined that medal for me! I took it
to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

622
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:15,067
- They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.
- This is shock.

623
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:19,425
And that's when I started to rob,
to prove that I was no good.

624
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:21,747
- Delayed shock.
- Never mind delayed shock.

625
00:46:21,747 --> 00:46:24,739
I've been like this
since I was seven.

626
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:27,540
I remember Mammy said to me,
"Don't upset Giuseppe. He's not well."

627
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:30,747
Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

628
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:35,138
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.
"Not well, you know. He's not well."

629
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,747
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

630
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:40,625
Is it my fault you weren't well?

631
00:46:40,707 --> 00:46:43,346
Why did you have to be sick
all your life, Giuseppe?

632
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,543
What'd you have to be sick
all your life for?

633
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:49,176
When that mad bastard out there
threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

634
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,337
I swear to God.
Honest to God, I was happy.

635
00:46:51,427 --> 00:46:54,100
I was delighted! You know why?
Because finally it was all over.

636
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:57,304
It was over!
You see?

637
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,662
And then I knew I was bad.

638
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:02,625
I knew I was bad then, you see,
so I started to cry.

639
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,747
I started to tell lies--
the same fucking lies...

640
00:47:04,747 --> 00:47:07,739
I've been telling
all my gobshite fucking life.

641
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,747
- That means words don't mean nothing.
- Stop this.

642
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:19,420
Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

643
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:22,465
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
no good anyhow. It doesn't matter.

644
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:25,220
Keep away from me. You've been
following me all your life.

645
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:29,505
- Are you here deliberately?
- No. Stop it.

646
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:32,499
You call that a fucking dig, huh?

647
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:36,705
Do you call that a fucking dig?
Hit me harder. Hit me fucking harder!

648
00:47:36,747 --> 00:47:38,738
- Stop it. Calm down.
- For once in your fucking life!

649
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:41,057
- Hit me like a real father!
-Just calm down. Stop it.

650
00:47:49,627 --> 00:47:51,583
Just relax.

651
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,745
Try to relax.

652
00:48:03,187 --> 00:48:04,415
It's okay.

653
00:48:08,587 --> 00:48:11,465
It's not your fault,
son, all right?

654
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:14,584
Everything's gonna be
all right.

655
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:17,465
Okay.
All right, son.

656
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,303
Visitor for Conlon!

657
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,703
Two on for visit!

658
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,498
No touching.

659
00:48:36,587 --> 00:48:41,103
- Everybody else was allowed to touch.
- IRA, closed visits. No contact.

660
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:54,263
Why are you doing this to us?

661
00:48:56,507 --> 00:48:59,305
You have your father
locked up in prison for murder.

662
00:48:59,387 --> 00:49:00,786
Speak up, please.

663
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:05,106
- It's not my fault, Ma.
- Take it easy, Sarah.

664
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:12,379
I swear to God,
I've done nothing wrong.

665
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:14,742
Why did you sign
a confession, son?

666
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,625
He did it
to protect me, love.

667
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:20,585
You have a good son there.
That's all you need to know.

668
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,579
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Giuseppe?

669
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,625
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

670
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:30,416
Look, they've no statement
nor evidence against me.

671
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:34,739
I'll be out and home soon.
Sure I'm only visiting here myself.

672
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:38,337
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

673
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,064
Danny's dead, Gerry.

674
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:45,456
What?

675
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:50,739
They found his body
on waste ground.

676
00:49:50,827 --> 00:49:53,819
The IRA said he was
an incurable thief.

677
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,183
I sent a Mass card
from the family.

678
00:50:03,507 --> 00:50:06,624
This one'll not go to school
since you've been away.

679
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:08,504
Hey, you go to school
for your mammy.

680
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:10,259
Yes, Daddy.

681
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:13,736
Daddy, when will you be home?

682
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:19,057
I've pressed your Sunday suits
for the trial.

683
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:21,342
You make sure
and look your best now, son.

684
00:50:23,827 --> 00:50:27,376
But is there nitro
or was there not nitro?

685
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:30,539
Yes, there are
traces of nitro.

686
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,743
But are they all positive?

687
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:36,223
Well, yes, on six of them.

688
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:40,346
- Who'd we miss?
- The aunt, Aggie-- Annie.

689
00:50:40,427 --> 00:50:43,066
But her rubber glove
showed a faint trace.

690
00:50:44,187 --> 00:50:45,745
And the children?

691
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:48,180
Positive.

692
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:53,060
The results may not
be good enough for court.

693
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:56,423
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

694
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,106
Yes, sir.

695
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:06,656
Kill the bastards!
Kill 'em!

696
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,339
Shoot the bastards!

697
00:51:28,387 --> 00:51:30,742
Call number one.

698
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:36,377
- Let's go.
-Jesus, it's a nightmare, Giuseppe.

699
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:40,301
Just stay calm, be on your best
behaviour, and this'll be behind us soon.

700
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:42,625
That's it, come on.

701
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:49,339
It'll be all right.

702
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:01,701
<i>All rise.</i>

703
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:24,744
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the Crown.

704
00:52:29,387 --> 00:52:33,141
There are two series of charges here,
ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:52:33,227 --> 00:52:36,537
The four defendants in front...

706
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:41,621
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub...

707
00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:43,777
and the murders of five people.

708
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:47,059
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

709
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,297
The seven defendants behind...

710
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:53,778
are charged with the possession
of explosives, not charged with murder.

711
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:56,376
The Crown's case
against them is...

712
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:59,664
that they are a support network
for the bombers, and as such...

713
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:03,740
- should be considered independent.
- Control yourself. Pay attention.

714
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:08,224
My first witness is
Inspector Robert Dixon.

715
00:53:08,307 --> 00:53:11,747
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give shall be the truth...

716
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:13,738
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

717
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:21,226
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

718
00:53:22,747 --> 00:53:27,616
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson...

719
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,584
confessed to the bombing.

720
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,339
They are the IRA's ASU.

721
00:53:31,427 --> 00:53:34,100
Can you explain ASUs for us?

722
00:53:34,187 --> 00:53:37,099
Active Service Unit.
They are the elite of the IRA...

723
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:39,098
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings.

724
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:43,100
Often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers...

725
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,337
and planting explosives.

726
00:53:45,427 --> 00:53:48,419
And the others--
Annie Maguire and her family?

727
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:50,657
They are the IRA's support network.

728
00:53:50,747 --> 00:53:55,616
Their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives...

729
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:59,382
and they provide
what we call "safe houses."

730
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:01,742
Thank you, Inspector.

731
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:05,737
These people were arrested
two days...

732
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:08,745
after the Prevention
of Terrorism Act was introduced.

733
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:10,738
That's correct.

734
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:13,779
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

735
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:16,747
It permits us to hold
suspected terrorists...

736
00:54:16,747 --> 00:54:19,500
for a period of up to seven days.

737
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,657
Quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy.

738
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:24,705
Quite difficult, I would think for
the police to resist the temptation...

739
00:54:24,747 --> 00:54:27,102
- to deal forcibly with people.
- Objection.

740
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:30,747
People they suspect of the biggest
bombing campaign on British mainland...

741
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:33,739
- since the Second World War.
- Objection. My lord, I really must--

742
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:37,462
- Get to the point!
- Now, this bombing campaign...

743
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:41,381
struck deep into the British people's
sense of security.

744
00:54:41,467 --> 00:54:44,664
The people looked to you,
Inspector, to find those responsible.

745
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:45,736
Yes.

746
00:54:46,747 --> 00:54:48,703
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

747
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,738
That's my job.

748
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,745
Now, all of the defendants claim--

749
00:54:53,827 --> 00:54:57,581
including young Patrick Maguire,
aged just 14--

750
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:59,658
Patrick,
would you stand up, please?

751
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:04,215
Thank you.
All of the defendants claim...

752
00:55:04,307 --> 00:55:08,346
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody.

753
00:55:10,347 --> 00:55:12,656
They were never harmed
in any way.

754
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:15,386
He's fucking lying!
They beat the shite out of us!

755
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,736
Silence!

756
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:23,582
Please believe us!
They beat us!

757
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:25,706
Just be quiet.

758
00:55:25,747 --> 00:55:27,747
Sit them down!

759
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:29,703
Silence in the court!

760
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,817
Mr Conlon says...

761
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:38,543
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

762
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,266
I never even spoke to Mr Conlon.

763
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,338
I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

764
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:45,145
Silence!

765
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:49,379
Mr Hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth.

766
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,056
There was no pressure of any kind.

767
00:55:53,147 --> 00:55:55,820
You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!

768
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:57,335
Order! Order in court!

769
00:55:57,427 --> 00:56:00,783
Inspector, in the case
of the four main defendants...

770
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,183
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind.

771
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:06,623
I have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists. What more do you want?

772
00:56:06,707 --> 00:56:10,302
Well, nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance.

773
00:56:10,387 --> 00:56:12,423
It's when the substance
to be tested--

774
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:15,067
<i>After a few weeks,
we were bored out of our minds--</i>

775
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:17,058
<i>just messed around
and that there.</i>

776
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:21,226
<i>They must've been
desperate for evidence.</i>

777
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:25,619
<i>They produced Annie's washing-up gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.</i>

778
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:28,585
<i>Then it was my turn
to take the stand.</i>

779
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,704
Mr Conlon,
did you bomb Guildford?

780
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:34,703
No, I didn't.

781
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:37,580
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night of the bombing.

782
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,464
Can you tell us where you were?

783
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:42,539
I was in a park in London
at that time.

784
00:56:42,627 --> 00:56:45,425
- Who with?
- With Paul Hill sitting there.

785
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:49,056
You met somebody else that night,
about 8:00 p.m.

786
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:53,747
- Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.
- And who is he?

787
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:58,104
He was just a fellow,
a homeless guy that we met in the park.

788
00:56:58,187 --> 00:57:00,417
Why do you remember
this man so clearly?

789
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:05,455
I was thinking that if I didn't get out
of London fast, I would end up like him.

790
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,747
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

791
00:57:08,747 --> 00:57:11,784
- What did they say?
- They said he didn't exist.

792
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:16,504
Mr Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

793
00:57:17,787 --> 00:57:20,747
They beat me...

794
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:22,658
and then they threatened
to kill my father.

795
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:27,423
- Will you repeat that please?
- They terrorized me for seven days.

796
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:29,782
After that,
they threatened to kill my father.

797
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:32,627
I'd have fucking signed anything
after that.

798
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:36,181
- Excuse my language.
- Thank you.

799
00:57:38,427 --> 00:57:42,136
You expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers...

800
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:45,458
would risk their career
and their reputation...

801
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:47,747
by threatening your father?

802
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:50,307
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them...

803
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,423
but it happens to be truth.

804
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,737
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr Conlon?

805
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:57,339
I like to think so.

806
00:57:57,427 --> 00:58:01,659
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

807
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:04,379
Aye.

808
00:58:04,467 --> 00:58:08,221
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

809
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:12,186
Let me refresh your memory.
You told Inspector Dixon...

810
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:14,781
that you had committed
a robbery on that night.

811
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:17,137
Now do you remember?

812
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:21,626
Aye.

813
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:26,417
- Who did you rob?
- Robbed a hooker.

814
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:29,738
- You robbed a prostitute?
- Aye.

815
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:33,780
And we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute...

816
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:37,747
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath...

817
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,544
and called you a liar?

818
00:58:39,627 --> 00:58:43,336
That was the truth.

819
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:46,747
I'm bound to say I don't find
you very convincing.

820
00:58:46,747 --> 00:58:48,738
Thank you, Mr Conlon.

821
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:56,503
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd stole from that woman?

822
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:00,743
You should've called me.
I would've sent the money.

823
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:11,224
Are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life?

824
00:59:13,747 --> 00:59:17,740
Standing up in that witness box,
making faces to your mates.

825
00:59:30,107 --> 00:59:33,463
At least you told the truth
in there. That'll stand you.

826
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,743
Are you not going
to eat that sausage?

827
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:49,101
They put a gun in my mouth...

828
00:59:49,187 --> 00:59:53,578
and made me confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

829
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,306
So I said I did the big bombing...

830
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:59,747
and named anybody I knew
who was not in the IRA.

831
00:59:59,747 --> 01:00:01,747
Not in the IRA?

832
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:04,739
- Definitely not in the IRA.
- Why?

833
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,740
You know why.

834
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:15,500
I just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was.

835
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:19,466
Inspector, the defendant Conlon
presented an alibi--

836
01:00:19,547 --> 01:00:21,747
One Charlie Burke.

837
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:25,217
That name did appear in Mr Conlon's
statement. We investigated it.

838
01:00:25,307 --> 01:00:28,105
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

839
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:30,621
And there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

840
01:00:30,707 --> 01:00:33,744
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

841
01:00:33,827 --> 01:00:37,217
At the start of this trial,
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

842
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:41,747
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked
when a fellow attorney came to me...

843
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:44,307
and asked me if I was now
going to wash my hand.

844
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:48,625
In my long legal career,
I cannot remember a case...

845
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:50,743
where emotions have
been so charged.

846
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:53,747
It falls to me now
to appeal to you...

847
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:56,747
the members of the jury,
not to get caught up in this...

848
01:00:56,747 --> 01:00:59,466
tide of mass hysteria.

849
01:00:59,547 --> 01:01:04,747
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

850
01:01:04,747 --> 01:01:08,103
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess...

851
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:11,418
through brutality
and intimidation.

852
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:14,747
Now, they may be foolish...

853
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:18,820
petty thieves,
even drug abusers...

854
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:24,420
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

855
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:29,586
You should find these young people
not guilty.

856
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:32,784
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

857
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:35,581
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Move it!

858
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:37,544
- Move it!
- Hands off!

859
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:45,305
Ladies and gentlemen...

860
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:50,544
like my learned colleague
in the defence...

861
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,415
I would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions.

862
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:58,546
The four people
you see in the front...

863
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:02,540
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies...

864
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:05,747
ever to set foot on English soil.

865
01:02:05,747 --> 01:02:09,376
Now, here are the facts
of this case:

866
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:11,423
Inspector Dixon...

867
01:02:11,507 --> 01:02:13,702
a decorated officer
of great expertise...

868
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:16,747
acting on reliable information
and good detective work...

869
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:19,747
arrested Paul Hill...

870
01:02:19,747 --> 01:02:24,377
who, guilt-ridden by the shame
of his crime, confessed.

871
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:28,301
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon...

872
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:30,747
and his terrorist family--

873
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:35,616
his aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker...

874
01:02:35,707 --> 01:02:38,380
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives...

875
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:41,379
in the kitchen
of her home in Harlesden.

876
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,265
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives--

877
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:47,419
Vincent, aged 16,
Patrick, 14--

878
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:52,342
who did not-- could not--
know any better.

879
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:54,463
Giuseppe Conlon,
her brother-in-law...

880
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:57,425
the courier who arrived
with more explosives.

881
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:01,705
Armstrong and his dupe
Richardson, who carried the bomb.

882
01:03:01,747 --> 01:03:04,181
Now, these are the people who,
in a panic...

883
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:08,499
had to dispose
of the nitroglycerine...

884
01:03:08,587 --> 01:03:11,420
and that is what sealed
their fate.

885
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:15,739
How do we know this?
Because the truth was on their hands.

886
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:24,062
It is a story written
in the blood of their victims.

887
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:27,105
You have seen some of those
who survived...

888
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:30,259
their callous disregard
for human life.

889
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:34,659
It is now your duty
to protect society from them.

890
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:38,740
I am confident that
that is what you will do.

891
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:16,658
Have you reached a verdict?

892
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,620
Yes, we have, my lord.

893
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:25,216
- How do you find the defendants?
- Guilty as charged.

894
01:04:28,707 --> 01:04:30,538
Hang the Irie bastards!

895
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,541
Order! Silence!

896
01:04:37,427 --> 01:04:39,179
String 'em up!

897
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,747
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

898
01:04:50,107 --> 01:04:51,779
Stand up.

899
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:58,380
I feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud...

900
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:03,257
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

901
01:05:03,347 --> 01:05:07,465
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging--

902
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:11,096
a sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing...

903
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:13,781
in this case.

904
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:17,143
I sentence you
to life imprisonment...

905
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,658
and I instruct
that you shall serve...

906
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:23,739
a minimum of 30 years.

907
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:26,740
Take him down.

908
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:40,140
Help me.

909
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,737
Paul Michael Hill.

910
01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:58,705
In my view, your crime
is such that...

911
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,102
life shall mean life.

912
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:05,578
<i>Annie Maguire,
I recommend you serve 14 years!</i>

913
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,737
- What have I done, for Christ's sake?
- Take her down!

914
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:12,456
<i>- Giuseppe Conlon, 12 years.
- No, my husband's innocent!</i>

915
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:13,747
Lord have mercy on you!

916
01:06:13,747 --> 01:06:16,739
<i>Patrick Joseph Armstrong,
30 years.</i>

917
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:26,262
Carole Richardson,
30 years.

918
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:26,221
<i>Our case was so insane that if you
made it up, nobody would believe it.</i>

919
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:29,424
<i>Look, Gareth, I know people say
that I'm a compulsive storyteller...</i>

920
01:07:29,507 --> 01:07:31,747
<i>and nobody believed
a word I said in court...</i>

921
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:35,422
<i>but Charlie Burke did exist-- he's not
just a figment of my imagination.</i>

922
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:42,295
Sorry.

923
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:56,747
<i>We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison...</i>

924
01:07:56,747 --> 01:08:01,263
<i>an old Victorian fortress where the
most dangerous criminals were held...</i>

925
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:03,747
<i>in the maximum-security wing.</i>

926
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,738
- Place of birth.
- Belfast.

927
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:07,505
Then you're British.

928
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:08,747
This is your home
for the rest of your life.

929
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:11,386
So accept it and get on with it.
Right, come this way.

930
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:12,741
<i>The chief warder, Barker...</i>

931
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:16,183
<i>gave us blue denim uniforms
with yellow stripes.</i>

932
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:17,825
<i>We were Category A--</i>

933
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:21,304
<i>the highest-security class along
with the rapists and murderers.</i>

934
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:23,742
<i>My father said
we'd fight for an appeal...</i>

935
01:08:23,787 --> 01:08:25,823
<i>but I didn't want to know
about the legal system.</i>

936
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:29,543
- I'm going back to the cell.
- Come on. Follow me.

937
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:41,816
Come on, Gerry.

938
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:47,217
Hey, Ronnie.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.

939
01:08:49,147 --> 01:08:50,421
Irish scum.

940
01:08:50,507 --> 01:08:53,305
My name's Giuseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man.

941
01:08:53,387 --> 01:08:55,662
So is my son.

942
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:57,385
We shouldn't even be in here.

943
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,537
Get that fucking scum
off my floor.

944
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:05,058
I said, knock it off!

945
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:27,057
- They must know they've made a mistake.
- No, they don't.

946
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:30,822
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

947
01:09:31,107 --> 01:09:32,825
We have to fight 'em
to get an appeal.

948
01:09:34,747 --> 01:09:38,535
- I'll speak to Father Wilson.
- Speak to everybody.

949
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:41,300
We'll write letters from in here.
Start a campaign.

950
01:09:41,387 --> 01:09:43,742
Have they been
treating you all right?

951
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:45,618
Aye, fine. Fine.

952
01:09:46,387 --> 01:09:47,740
Have they, son?

953
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,583
Aye. No problem.

954
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:06,181
<i>Landing officers, exercise.</i>

955
01:10:08,827 --> 01:10:10,783
Forgot the dessert spoons.

956
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,419
There we go.

957
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:26,818
These chips are not bad.

958
01:10:33,547 --> 01:10:36,778
- Now don't you despair, son.
- Never mind about "don't despair."

959
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,466
What?

960
01:10:38,547 --> 01:10:41,300
I mean, we're innocent,
we can't even go out of the cell.

961
01:10:42,747 --> 01:10:47,696
You're better off being guilty.
At least you get some respect.

962
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:51,341
<i>Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.</i>

963
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:53,622
You can have my chips.

964
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:38,747
Gerry, man.

965
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:40,783
Problem? You all right?

966
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:45,747
How you like your new home?

967
01:11:45,747 --> 01:11:48,739
Bombing of pillar-box,
Kensington High Street.

968
01:11:48,827 --> 01:11:50,747
Bombing of pillar-box,
Talbot Lodge.

969
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:52,658
Bombing of naval club.

970
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:55,747
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.
Attempted murder of Edward Heath.

971
01:11:55,747 --> 01:11:58,261
Murder of Ross McWhirter.

972
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:02,386
Possession of firearms,
Balcombe Street, December 6, 1975.

973
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:04,537
And the Guildford pub bombings.

974
01:12:06,387 --> 01:12:09,584
You have innocent people
in jail for that.

975
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,740
Take him out.

976
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:39,219
He did it.

977
01:12:39,307 --> 01:12:42,299
Where's all the missing pieces?

978
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:49,185
We eat it up, man.

979
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:52,697
Before my woman
send it in here, right...

980
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:55,500
she have it dipped
in liquid acid--

981
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:58,306
LSD, man.

982
01:12:58,387 --> 01:13:01,743
We've been dropping the British Empire
for the last six months.

983
01:13:01,827 --> 01:13:04,387
You want to fly?
Pick a country.

984
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:07,664
Fuck's sake, don't give me Northern
Ireland. I don't want a bad trip.

985
01:13:07,747 --> 01:13:10,784
Try Nepal, man.
Take you to the Himalayas.

986
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:30,380
See the dragon.

987
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:59,264
<i>Lights out in 15 minutes.
15 minutes.</i>

988
01:14:10,147 --> 01:14:12,615
Are you praying
for the Seventh Cavalry?

989
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,747
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

990
01:14:16,747 --> 01:14:20,456
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb,Jesus.

991
01:14:20,547 --> 01:14:22,344
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

992
01:14:22,427 --> 01:14:24,702
now and at the moment of our death.
Amen.

993
01:14:24,747 --> 01:14:26,658
That's not funny, Gerry.

994
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:33,177
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

995
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:36,738
Blessed art thou among women...

996
01:14:36,827 --> 01:14:39,546
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb,Jesus.

997
01:14:42,747 --> 01:14:44,578
Holy Mary, mother of God...

998
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:48,057
pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

999
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:58,738
Are you on drugs?

1000
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:15,298
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
now when I get out of this place.

1001
01:15:16,787 --> 01:15:18,618
If I get out.

1002
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:26,100
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not talking to you.

1003
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:28,303
Now who's being childish?

1004
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:33,220
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1005
01:15:35,307 --> 01:15:36,740
That stuff'll kill you.

1006
01:15:38,307 --> 01:15:40,104
Sure I'm dead anyway.

1007
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:49,104
Look, I'm sorry. I'll not
take it again so long as you live.

1008
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:52,383
Are you happy now?

1009
01:15:54,187 --> 01:15:56,098
No.

1010
01:15:56,187 --> 01:15:58,143
Why not?

1011
01:16:01,107 --> 01:16:03,575
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1012
01:16:07,747 --> 01:16:09,385
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:16:14,467 --> 01:16:17,618
All right. I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1014
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:21,618
Now are you happy?

1015
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:24,737
Is that a promise?

1016
01:16:27,747 --> 01:16:28,736
Aye.

1017
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:31,735
Maybe.

1018
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:42,504
Gerry, man,
check out your friend.

1019
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:46,663
He look like the real thing.

1020
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:51,226
Come on.

1021
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:05,746
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1022
01:17:10,147 --> 01:17:12,103
Let's have a talk.

1023
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:17,543
We have to eat in the cells.

1024
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:20,379
See ya later.

1025
01:17:22,787 --> 01:17:24,743
Gerry, come on.

1026
01:17:50,107 --> 01:17:52,337
Morning, paddy.

1027
01:17:57,307 --> 01:17:58,581
Yes!

1028
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:07,541
Come on!

1029
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:09,741
Yes, man, Gerry!

1030
01:18:20,747 --> 01:18:24,501
This one, this one, this one,
14 days solitary! Lock up!

1031
01:18:25,627 --> 01:18:27,140
Lock up!

1032
01:18:27,227 --> 01:18:30,663
He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1033
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:42,298
I'm worried about Bridie.

1034
01:18:45,067 --> 01:18:46,295
Why?

1035
01:18:47,787 --> 01:18:50,506
She's dyed her hair blonde.

1036
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,739
Well, she's only young.

1037
01:18:57,547 --> 01:19:00,141
She's wearing a dog collar.

1038
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:10,543
There's a fella chained to it.
He's got one on too.

1039
01:19:14,187 --> 01:19:16,098
Well...

1040
01:19:16,187 --> 01:19:18,655
as long as she's happy.

1041
01:19:29,587 --> 01:19:31,225
Lunch break.

1042
01:19:34,067 --> 01:19:36,058
Yes, Gerry, man!
That's right!

1043
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,342
Gerry's a bad boy!

1044
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:40,816
Put the Englishman
under heavy, heavy manners.

1045
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:45,498
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1046
01:19:45,587 --> 01:19:48,818
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1047
01:19:49,107 --> 01:19:50,540
Hello, Mr Conlon.

1048
01:19:53,107 --> 01:19:55,098
I'm watching you.

1049
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,657
What is it?

1050
01:20:08,747 --> 01:20:11,500
I'm the one who planted
the Guildford bomb, Mr Conlon.

1051
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,457
Did you tell the police that?

1052
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:20,584
Yes, I did.

1053
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:24,740
- But we haven't heard a thing.
- See what he has to say, Da.

1054
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:27,221
Go on.

1055
01:20:27,307 --> 01:20:31,459
I told them.
They know the truth.

1056
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:34,300
They can't afford to face it.

1057
01:20:34,387 --> 01:20:37,584
It's a war.
You're one if its innocent victims.

1058
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,747
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1059
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:41,817
Don't be sorry for us.

1060
01:20:42,107 --> 01:20:44,382
You should be sorry
for the people you killed.

1061
01:20:46,147 --> 01:20:49,184
It was a military target,
a soldier's pub.

1062
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:53,747
They were innocent people,
God's children.

1063
01:20:53,747 --> 01:20:58,377
Look, I'll do all I can
to help you while you're in here.

1064
01:20:58,467 --> 01:20:59,741
We don't need your help.

1065
01:21:01,627 --> 01:21:04,095
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us alone.

1066
01:21:05,467 --> 01:21:06,820
Whatever you say.

1067
01:21:09,747 --> 01:21:11,738
I'm sorry about that.

1068
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:17,743
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1069
01:21:17,787 --> 01:21:22,463
What? Manners to him? I don't want
any part of him, or his ways.

1070
01:21:22,547 --> 01:21:25,747
At least he fights back, which is
more than you ever did in your life.

1071
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,341
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember Lydon Hill?

1072
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:31,225
You used to ride me up
on your bike up Lydon Hill.

1073
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:33,298
And then one day
you couldn't make it to the top...

1074
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:37,747
and I hopped off and looked back,
and your face was all red.

1075
01:21:37,747 --> 01:21:39,783
- Remember that?
- Aye.

1076
01:21:42,747 --> 01:21:45,056
It was working in the paint shed
done that to you.

1077
01:21:45,147 --> 01:21:46,421
What?

1078
01:21:46,507 --> 01:21:50,102
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you.

1079
01:21:50,187 --> 01:21:52,655
Never mind jumping off the ferry,
swimming back to Mammy.

1080
01:21:52,747 --> 01:21:56,262
It was the one job a Catholic can get,
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1081
01:21:56,347 --> 01:22:01,467
Go on outside.
Play with your newfound friend.

1082
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:05,699
All I'm saying is that you've been
a victim. It's time you fought back.

1083
01:22:05,747 --> 01:22:07,499
- Get out of my sight.
- I'm going.

1084
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:13,737
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternative.

1085
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:33,784
- Well, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1086
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:38,145
- They didn't do it.
- They all did it.

1087
01:22:41,747 --> 01:22:43,738
I'm going back to Belfast.

1088
01:22:50,307 --> 01:22:54,141
<i>After the fight, nobody stopped us
going out in the yard to exercise.</i>

1089
01:22:54,227 --> 01:22:57,583
<i>I felt brilliant.
Joe explained things to me.</i>

1090
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:00,659
<i>He explained how the Brits
never left anywhere without a fight...</i>

1091
01:23:00,747 --> 01:23:04,137
<i>how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied...</i>

1092
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:07,583
<i>how this prison was just
an extension of their system.</i>

1093
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:10,101
<i>Calling for work
on the threes.</i>

1094
01:23:10,187 --> 01:23:13,224
<i>We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.</i>

1095
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,747
Mr Smalls.

1096
01:23:14,747 --> 01:23:17,747
<i>But to do that,
we had to take care of Ronnie Smalls.</i>

1097
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:20,739
Can I have a word
about 54 Halsley Road?

1098
01:23:24,507 --> 01:23:26,384
Take a walk.

1099
01:23:33,747 --> 01:23:37,456
If anything happens to me
or Gerry...

1100
01:23:38,227 --> 01:23:40,747
or any other Irish prisoner...

1101
01:23:40,747 --> 01:23:45,104
we'll have 54 Halsley Road
blown to smithereens...

1102
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:48,065
with your family in it.

1103
01:23:49,387 --> 01:23:52,299
Threaten my family
and I'll cut your fucking head off.

1104
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:57,658
I don't make threats.

1105
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:01,740
I just carry out orders.
I don't want to hurt your family.

1106
01:24:06,747 --> 01:24:09,739
Your trouble is,Joe,
you want to rule the fucking world.

1107
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:13,660
Paddy's all right.

1108
01:24:25,187 --> 01:24:26,745
<i>Soon, we were all
one happy family.</i>

1109
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:28,579
Again!

1110
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:31,625
<i>Even Kojak was ready to forgive.</i>

1111
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:34,747
<i>- Live and let live.
- Barker began to panic.</i>

1112
01:24:34,747 --> 01:24:37,659
<i>He told us to take our socks
out of the window.</i>

1113
01:24:37,747 --> 01:24:40,341
<i>He thought we were signalling
to other prisoners.</i>

1114
01:24:40,427 --> 01:24:43,658
We're not signalling.
We're drying our socks out.

1115
01:24:43,747 --> 01:24:45,146
- Take the socks out of the window.
- Who says?

1116
01:24:45,227 --> 01:24:46,342
Mr Barker.

1117
01:24:46,427 --> 01:24:50,386
<i>- That was all the excuseJoe needed.
- Give us two minutes.</i>

1118
01:24:50,467 --> 01:24:52,776
<i>- Up and away we went.
- Are you with me?</i>

1119
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:54,500
What's he up to now?

1120
01:24:57,707 --> 01:25:01,097
All prison officers
to vacate the wing.

1121
01:25:01,187 --> 01:25:03,382
<i>All officers
vacate the wing!</i>

1122
01:25:09,267 --> 01:25:11,098
This'll damage the whole campaign.

1123
01:25:11,187 --> 01:25:13,621
Look, you do it your way,
and we'll do it ours, all right?

1124
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:17,461
<i>- You can read our demands.
- Go back to your cells.</i>

1125
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,185
Blankets!

1126
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:23,537
- For God's sake, put a stop to this.
- You're weakening my position.

1127
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:25,424
- It will end in violence.
- Good.

1128
01:25:25,507 --> 01:25:27,816
- What's good about it?
- It's all they understand.

1129
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:32,819
<i>Barker refused to negotiate.</i>

1130
01:25:33,107 --> 01:25:35,143
<i>But with the screws gone,
we'd a brief taste of freedom.</i>

1131
01:25:35,227 --> 01:25:36,546
Check out Ronnie!

1132
01:25:38,587 --> 01:25:40,737
Him swallow half Africa.

1133
01:25:41,587 --> 01:25:43,384
I give him about an hour.

1134
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:52,580
<i>We found out later
our protest got on TV.</i>

1135
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,181
<i>And that's when
the riot squad was ordered in.</i>

1136
01:26:10,187 --> 01:26:12,747
<i>We were singled out
as the ringleaders.</i>

1137
01:26:12,827 --> 01:26:14,055
Now!

1138
01:26:39,747 --> 01:26:42,136
You just signed
your own death warrant, Barker.

1139
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:47,776
Are you happy now?

1140
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:54,655
<i>And then you arrived, Gareth.</i>

1141
01:26:54,747 --> 01:26:58,747
<i>That's the first time I saw you,
under a raining shower of sparks.</i>

1142
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:02,747
<i>It was the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.</i>

1143
01:27:02,747 --> 01:27:06,103
<i>But to me, you were a lawyer first.
And I hated lawyers.</i>

1144
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:11,659
- Do you have a new isolation--
- Prisoners: Barth, Andrew.

1145
01:27:11,747 --> 01:27:14,747
Bailey, Benjamin.
McAndrew,Joseph.

1146
01:27:14,747 --> 01:27:17,659
- Sorry. Can you-- I can't hear.
- Conlon, Gerard.

1147
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:20,705
O'Brien,John.

1148
01:27:20,747 --> 01:27:24,262
Lynch, Bernard.
Crisp, Quincy.

1149
01:27:24,347 --> 01:27:26,736
Lyon, Richard.
Burns, Delrow.

1150
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:30,740
What about Conlon?
Sorry. Giuseppe Conlon.

1151
01:27:30,827 --> 01:27:33,182
He's on the third floor.

1152
01:27:33,267 --> 01:27:37,624
He has difficulty
getting down the stairs.

1153
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:40,747
Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.

1154
01:27:40,747 --> 01:27:43,625
- The delegation has seen enough.
- Right-o. Sorry.

1155
01:27:43,707 --> 01:27:46,744
Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just--
Is that all right? Sorry.

1156
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:50,342
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Sorry.

1157
01:27:56,467 --> 01:27:57,946
Sorry, I can't--

1158
01:27:58,027 --> 01:28:00,063
Pulmonary thrombosis.

1159
01:28:00,147 --> 01:28:03,105
- And he's getting proper medication?
- Aye.

1160
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:09,061
Son?

1161
01:28:11,827 --> 01:28:13,818
That's-- Is it Gerry?

1162
01:28:13,907 --> 01:28:15,306
That's Gerry.

1163
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:18,106
He's had a spot of bother
with lawyers in the past.

1164
01:28:21,947 --> 01:28:24,859
He's all yours.
Fifteen minutes.

1165
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:26,744
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

1166
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:35,738
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1167
01:28:56,467 --> 01:28:59,140
Why are you giving
my father false hope?

1168
01:28:59,227 --> 01:29:00,899
Sorry?

1169
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:03,945
He's been up and down
these stairs to see you.

1170
01:29:04,027 --> 01:29:06,143
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1171
01:29:06,227 --> 01:29:09,060
I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1172
01:29:09,147 --> 01:29:11,377
Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1173
01:29:11,467 --> 01:29:13,378
You don't know the half of it.

1174
01:29:15,907 --> 01:29:17,818
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1175
01:29:17,907 --> 01:29:20,747
It's not the stairs that
are killing your father.

1176
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:24,183
- What is it, then?
- It's your lack of faith.

1177
01:29:24,267 --> 01:29:26,986
Lack of faith?
Faith in what?

1178
01:29:27,067 --> 01:29:28,785
In yourself.

1179
01:29:28,867 --> 01:29:31,461
No, I have faith in myself.

1180
01:29:32,907 --> 01:29:36,536
Gerry Conlon, lifer,
30-year sentence.

1181
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,817
And I know how to survive it.

1182
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:41,740
At what price?

1183
01:29:41,827 --> 01:29:44,182
I'll pay the fucking price.
Don't you worry about it.

1184
01:29:44,267 --> 01:29:46,986
The price for what?

1185
01:29:48,747 --> 01:29:52,262
You're very good at the English,
aren't you?

1186
01:29:52,347 --> 01:29:55,066
You see, I don't understand
your language.

1187
01:29:57,067 --> 01:30:00,747
"Justice." "Mercy." "Clemency."

1188
01:30:00,747 --> 01:30:04,376
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1189
01:30:04,467 --> 01:30:07,504
I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1190
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:11,786
That way I could put my fist in my mouth
and never speak another word of English.

1191
01:30:11,867 --> 01:30:14,427
Do you see what I'm saying?
Mrs Peirce, is it?

1192
01:30:14,507 --> 01:30:17,146
Are you trying to impress me?

1193
01:30:18,987 --> 01:30:20,386
Visit's up.

1194
01:30:20,467 --> 01:30:23,425
Don't give my father
false hope, all right?

1195
01:30:26,867 --> 01:30:28,937
You've got to help him!

1196
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:34,344
<i>In prison, you pray for anything
to break the monotony.</i>

1197
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:37,305
<i>A snowstorm is like
a present from God.</i>

1198
01:30:47,747 --> 01:30:49,544
Prison officers are not to be hit!

1199
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:52,139
You've asked for it.

1200
01:30:52,227 --> 01:30:54,024
Come along!

1201
01:30:54,107 --> 01:30:57,736
<i>After the riot, my father's
health deteriorated badly.</i>

1202
01:30:57,787 --> 01:31:01,223
<i>He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.</i>

1203
01:31:01,307 --> 01:31:04,936
<i>I waved up to him, but he
was looking at something else.</i>

1204
01:31:14,467 --> 01:31:17,425
<i>My da always saw the good
in people.</i>

1205
01:31:17,507 --> 01:31:21,056
<i>He recognized it in you
the minute he saw you, Gareth.</i>

1206
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:25,459
Guv, guv, where you going?
Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1207
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:30,499
Thank you.

1208
01:31:35,027 --> 01:31:37,746
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Giuseppe.

1209
01:31:37,827 --> 01:31:39,260
What's that?

1210
01:31:45,507 --> 01:31:47,418
How'd you come by that name?

1211
01:31:49,347 --> 01:31:51,144
An Italian ice cream maker.

1212
01:31:51,227 --> 01:31:54,344
Had a shop on the corner
of the street where I was born.

1213
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:56,543
Giuseppe Fusco.

1214
01:31:56,747 --> 01:31:59,181
My mother fell in love
with the name.

1215
01:31:59,267 --> 01:32:00,746
Were they--

1216
01:32:02,307 --> 01:32:03,820
- You know.
- What?

1217
01:32:05,067 --> 01:32:06,944
- Lovers.
- Who?

1218
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:08,824
My mother and the ice cream maker?

1219
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:11,459
Oh, no, God.

1220
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:13,742
Jesus, no.
No, they were not.

1221
01:32:15,787 --> 01:32:17,823
No, she just liked the name.

1222
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:21,104
But it made my life hell.

1223
01:32:21,187 --> 01:32:25,226
All the other children laughing at you.
You have any kids yourself?

1224
01:32:29,787 --> 01:32:31,061
He's talking to Barker.

1225
01:32:31,147 --> 01:32:34,537
Forget it. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1226
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:38,786
Two.

1227
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:42,382
Flown the nest now.

1228
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:01,063
<i>Whether Barker was
responsible or not...</i>

1229
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:04,264
<i>for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.</i>

1230
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:07,903
<i>Joe was still at war...</i>

1231
01:33:07,987 --> 01:33:10,421
<i>and to him,
Barker was the enemy.</i>

1232
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:13,866
Number?

1233
01:33:13,947 --> 01:33:15,744
The name is McAndrew.

1234
01:33:17,747 --> 01:33:19,863
Get out.
Get out of the light!

1235
01:33:21,747 --> 01:33:23,305
- Get out of the light.
- Number?

1236
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:25,105
Name's Gerry Conlon.

1237
01:33:26,827 --> 01:33:29,387
Piss off out of the light.
Get out of the light!

1238
01:33:29,467 --> 01:33:31,298
You're 136.

1239
01:33:36,907 --> 01:33:38,499
There's someone sitting there.

1240
01:33:41,427 --> 01:33:43,179
Move when you're told.

1241
01:33:49,827 --> 01:33:51,340
Put it out.

1242
01:34:21,267 --> 01:34:23,861
<i>- How's your boy?
- He's good.</i>

1243
01:34:23,947 --> 01:34:26,825
<i>You know, he looks
more like you every day.</i>

1244
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:29,546
<i>He's smarter than I am.</i>

1245
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:31,747
<i>Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.</i>

1246
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:33,747
There's a hair
in the fucking projector!

1247
01:34:33,747 --> 01:34:37,057
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out the projector, will you?

1248
01:34:38,227 --> 01:34:41,139
- Come on. Get it out!
- Get it out!

1249
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:45,184
We're going fucking blind up here.

1250
01:34:45,267 --> 01:34:46,746
Lively.

1251
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:54,859
<i>- We'll get there, Pop.
- Quiet.</i>

1252
01:34:54,947 --> 01:34:56,824
- I didn't say a fucking thing.
- You're blocking.

1253
01:34:56,907 --> 01:34:59,137
Shut it.

1254
01:35:00,907 --> 01:35:03,296
<i>Now, listen.
Whoever comes to you...</i>

1255
01:35:03,387 --> 01:35:04,979
<i>with this Barzini meeting--</i>

1256
01:35:10,507 --> 01:35:15,103
<i>I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this.</i>

1257
01:35:15,187 --> 01:35:16,984
<i>And Fredo, well--</i>

1258
01:35:18,747 --> 01:35:20,465
<i>Fredo was wrong.</i>

1259
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:25,819
<i>And I never wanted this for you.</i>

1260
01:35:29,227 --> 01:35:29,898
For you!

1261
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,863
To the floor, mate! Get down!

1262
01:35:53,027 --> 01:35:56,861
Come on, mate, get a blanket!
For God's sake, he's burning!

1263
01:35:57,747 --> 01:36:00,261
Barker! Move back, Barker!

1264
01:36:00,347 --> 01:36:01,905
Get in there!

1265
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:05,338
Get it out!

1266
01:36:26,867 --> 01:36:29,540
- Stretcher!
- Let's check it out.

1267
01:36:29,747 --> 01:36:31,544
All right, mate.
You're with us.

1268
01:36:31,747 --> 01:36:33,226
All right. Stretcher!

1269
01:36:34,827 --> 01:36:36,146
Gently.

1270
01:36:36,227 --> 01:36:37,740
All right, up!

1271
01:36:38,907 --> 01:36:41,819
That was a good day's work,
McAndrew.

1272
01:36:41,907 --> 01:36:43,386
That was a good day's work.

1273
01:36:43,467 --> 01:36:45,901
Get away from me.

1274
01:36:45,987 --> 01:36:48,342
Will you not look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you?

1275
01:36:50,987 --> 01:36:54,741
I know how to look at people
without blinking as well.

1276
01:36:58,267 --> 01:37:00,781
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known...

1277
01:37:00,867 --> 01:37:04,098
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1278
01:37:06,507 --> 01:37:09,499
You're a brave man,Joe,
a brave man.

1279
01:37:12,347 --> 01:37:14,747
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1280
01:37:14,747 --> 01:37:18,296
- Stand your ground.
- Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1281
01:37:18,387 --> 01:37:21,185
Benjamin Bailey, back to him cell!

1282
01:37:21,267 --> 01:37:23,337
Burns, returning to his cell.

1283
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:26,339
7445, Casey, back to his cell.

1284
01:37:26,427 --> 01:37:28,987
6309, Johnston, level three.

1285
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:31,865
Regis, 113,
going up to number two.

1286
01:37:49,387 --> 01:37:51,981
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1287
01:37:52,987 --> 01:37:54,898
<i>Barker was maimed for life...</i>

1288
01:37:54,987 --> 01:37:57,455
<i>and Joe was sent
to another prison.</i>

1289
01:37:57,547 --> 01:37:59,458
<i>He's in solitary confinement
somewhere.</i>

1290
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:02,061
<i>We've had no news of him
since then.</i>

1291
01:38:02,147 --> 01:38:04,377
<i>The new chief screw
had the yard painted...</i>

1292
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:06,378
<i>and I was back
walking in circles again.</i>

1293
01:38:06,467 --> 01:38:08,139
Back to the cells.

1294
01:38:10,827 --> 01:38:13,136
Come on. Move.

1295
01:38:40,747 --> 01:38:43,739
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da...

1296
01:38:44,947 --> 01:38:47,859
if that's all right with you.

1297
01:38:47,947 --> 01:38:49,539
Do you mean it?

1298
01:38:49,747 --> 01:38:51,180
Aye.

1299
01:38:52,107 --> 01:38:53,938
That's great.

1300
01:38:54,027 --> 01:38:57,497
What I need from you is
the whole story, your whole story...

1301
01:38:57,747 --> 01:39:00,215
in as much detail
as you can remember.

1302
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:03,902
<i>And I need you to write it down.
It's really important.</i>

1303
01:39:10,267 --> 01:39:12,064
I can't do this.

1304
01:39:13,947 --> 01:39:15,983
I can't write this, Da.

1305
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:18,456
Could your son
not give you a hand?

1306
01:39:18,547 --> 01:39:21,266
He's up in his cell writing away.

1307
01:39:33,227 --> 01:39:35,138
Tape recorder.

1308
01:39:35,227 --> 01:39:37,104
You're a good talker.

1309
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:38,745
Talk.

1310
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:42,303
<i>The strange thing is--</i>

1311
01:39:43,387 --> 01:39:45,747
<i>the strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a littlejealous...</i>

1312
01:39:45,747 --> 01:39:48,341
<i>of me taking over the campaign
and that there.</i>

1313
01:39:48,427 --> 01:39:51,544
<i>Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.</i>

1314
01:39:51,747 --> 01:39:53,817
That's something
I never thought about Giuseppe:

1315
01:39:53,907 --> 01:39:55,738
<i>that he could bejealous.</i>

1316
01:39:58,747 --> 01:40:02,747
<i>Anyhow, the main thing is
to get the case reopened...</i>

1317
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,422
<i>because I don't know how long
he can survive in here.</i>

1318
01:40:23,227 --> 01:40:27,186
- I'm tired of this.
- Come on. We have to do this.

1319
01:40:27,267 --> 01:40:28,780
You behave yourself.

1320
01:40:32,427 --> 01:40:34,224
Get your head down.

1321
01:40:41,507 --> 01:40:44,738
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1322
01:40:44,827 --> 01:40:48,263
One day when you and Ma were out,
I got a big bowl of boiling water...

1323
01:40:48,347 --> 01:40:51,747
whacked a big drop of Vick
and put the towel over my head.

1324
01:40:51,747 --> 01:40:55,422
I sat there trying to figure out what it
was about 'cause nothing was happening.

1325
01:40:55,507 --> 01:40:57,418
I figured you
must've been drinking it.

1326
01:40:57,507 --> 01:40:59,418
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1327
01:41:03,147 --> 01:41:05,103
How could I forget?

1328
01:41:05,947 --> 01:41:08,825
And your tongue
swelled up like a football.

1329
01:41:09,907 --> 01:41:12,023
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1330
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:14,257
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1331
01:41:17,867 --> 01:41:19,300
Give us that.

1332
01:41:20,427 --> 01:41:22,895
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1333
01:41:30,107 --> 01:41:32,063
Was I always bad, was I?

1334
01:41:33,347 --> 01:41:34,780
Not always.

1335
01:41:34,867 --> 01:41:37,745
I don't deserve to spend
the rest of my life in here, do I?

1336
01:41:38,747 --> 01:41:41,215
All they've done
is block out the light.

1337
01:41:41,307 --> 01:41:43,218
They can't block out
the light in here.

1338
01:41:43,307 --> 01:41:45,104
Listen.

1339
01:41:45,187 --> 01:41:46,825
Every night...

1340
01:41:46,907 --> 01:41:49,341
I take your mother's
hand in mine.

1341
01:41:49,427 --> 01:41:53,500
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street...

1342
01:41:53,747 --> 01:41:56,898
down to Falls Road,
up the Antrim Road...

1343
01:41:58,387 --> 01:42:00,378
to Cave Hill.

1344
01:42:00,467 --> 01:42:02,105
We look back down...

1345
01:42:04,507 --> 01:42:06,543
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1346
01:42:09,947 --> 01:42:12,747
I've been doing that every night...

1347
01:42:12,747 --> 01:42:14,544
for five years now.

1348
01:42:16,747 --> 01:42:18,817
As if I never left your mother.

1349
01:42:28,747 --> 01:42:31,307
What I remember most
about my childhood is...

1350
01:42:31,387 --> 01:42:33,378
holding your hand.

1351
01:42:33,467 --> 01:42:36,027
My wee hand in your big hand.

1352
01:42:36,107 --> 01:42:38,747
And the smell of tobacco.
I remember that...

1353
01:42:38,747 --> 01:42:41,944
I could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand.

1354
01:42:45,347 --> 01:42:49,181
When I want to feel happy, I try
to remember the smell of tobacco.

1355
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:54,499
Hold my hand.

1356
01:42:54,747 --> 01:42:56,544
Get the fuck--

1357
01:42:57,747 --> 01:42:59,817
Don't go sentimental on me now.

1358
01:43:01,227 --> 01:43:04,981
Don't be upset, Da. Look,
I'll hold your hand if you like.

1359
01:43:07,547 --> 01:43:09,299
I'm going to die.

1360
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:12,458
Don't be saying that.

1361
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:14,820
I'm scared.

1362
01:43:16,987 --> 01:43:18,978
You've no reason to be scared.

1363
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:23,743
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1364
01:43:23,827 --> 01:43:27,502
I'm scared I'm gonna die here
among strangers.

1365
01:43:27,747 --> 01:43:29,066
You're not fucking dying.

1366
01:43:29,147 --> 01:43:32,822
Can I not say a thing
without you fucking contradicting me?

1367
01:43:34,227 --> 01:43:39,381
I'm scared to leave
your mother behind.

1368
01:43:41,387 --> 01:43:44,743
Look, you are not going to die,
all right, Da?

1369
01:43:46,947 --> 01:43:50,542
Even if you do, sure I can
look after Ma all right.

1370
01:43:50,747 --> 01:43:53,819
You think I'd leave
Sarah in your care?

1371
01:43:55,347 --> 01:43:57,019
What do you mean?

1372
01:43:57,107 --> 01:44:01,066
You haven't the maturity to take care
of yourself, let alone your mother.

1373
01:44:08,107 --> 01:44:10,747
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs Peirce.

1374
01:44:10,747 --> 01:44:12,942
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1375
01:44:13,027 --> 01:44:16,747
I'm the solicitor for the Conlons,
Chief Inspector.

1376
01:44:16,747 --> 01:44:20,501
Giuseppe Conlon is critically ill,
as you may know.

1377
01:44:20,747 --> 01:44:22,977
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1378
01:44:23,067 --> 01:44:24,739
They want your clearance.

1379
01:44:25,827 --> 01:44:27,747
That'll be difficult, Mrs Peirce.

1380
01:44:27,747 --> 01:44:31,137
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1381
01:44:31,227 --> 01:44:33,536
Society demands
that they serve their time.

1382
01:44:34,747 --> 01:44:37,056
But they didn't do it,
Chief Inspector.

1383
01:44:37,147 --> 01:44:38,747
Says who?

1384
01:44:38,747 --> 01:44:41,056
Say the real bombers.

1385
01:44:41,147 --> 01:44:43,786
They told you they did it,
Mr Dixon.

1386
01:44:43,867 --> 01:44:46,427
Gerry Conlon told me he did it,
Mrs Peirce.

1387
01:44:46,507 --> 01:44:49,101
These people are liars.

1388
01:44:49,187 --> 01:44:51,747
They're liars for a cause.
That's the worst kind.

1389
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:54,017
But he's dying.
Giuseppe's dying.

1390
01:44:54,107 --> 01:44:57,144
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1391
01:45:01,747 --> 01:45:03,747
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1392
01:45:03,747 --> 01:45:05,783
Is this your family, Mr Dixon?

1393
01:45:06,987 --> 01:45:08,943
That's my wife and my son.

1394
01:45:09,027 --> 01:45:11,461
You have another appointment.

1395
01:45:11,547 --> 01:45:12,866
Yes.

1396
01:45:14,227 --> 01:45:17,299
I'll see you again, Mr Dixon.

1397
01:45:53,307 --> 01:45:55,184
Are you all right, Da?

1398
01:46:08,787 --> 01:46:10,982
Are you all right?

1399
01:46:13,787 --> 01:46:15,220
Wake up, Da.

1400
01:46:16,267 --> 01:46:19,543
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Giuseppe?

1401
01:46:20,747 --> 01:46:22,544
Come on, dear God in heaven,
don't do this to me.

1402
01:46:22,747 --> 01:46:24,021
Come on. Wake up.

1403
01:46:24,107 --> 01:46:26,337
Wake up! Fuck's sake, come on!

1404
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:29,976
There you go. Thank you.
You're all right, Da.

1405
01:46:30,067 --> 01:46:32,023
I'm going to get some help.

1406
01:46:32,107 --> 01:46:34,747
Number 73! Number 73!

1407
01:46:34,747 --> 01:46:37,307
Please come quickly!
My father's sick!

1408
01:46:37,387 --> 01:46:38,979
Benbay, Giuseppe's taken bad!

1409
01:46:39,067 --> 01:46:40,747
Put your arms around me.

1410
01:46:40,747 --> 01:46:43,864
I'm getting you out of bed.
Put your arms around me.

1411
01:46:46,747 --> 01:46:49,386
- Open the fucking door!
- He's number 73!

1412
01:46:49,467 --> 01:46:51,219
- Open the fucking door!
- Giuseppe!

1413
01:46:52,427 --> 01:46:55,100
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1414
01:46:55,947 --> 01:46:59,417
He can't breathe!
Look, my father's fucking dying!

1415
01:46:59,507 --> 01:47:02,499
- He needs oxygen!
- Give him a fucking break!

1416
01:47:02,747 --> 01:47:05,466
Open the fucking gate!
I'm right here, Da.

1417
01:47:05,547 --> 01:47:07,458
Get him in here!

1418
01:47:07,547 --> 01:47:09,936
What the fuck is going on?

1419
01:47:14,347 --> 01:47:15,939
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1420
01:47:16,027 --> 01:47:17,779
I want to go with him.

1421
01:47:19,027 --> 01:47:22,144
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1422
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:24,422
You're gonna be all right, Da!

1423
01:47:24,507 --> 01:47:27,738
- I'll be with you as soon as I can.
- Take him back to his cell.

1424
01:47:33,307 --> 01:47:37,747
Leave him alone, you bastards!
Just let him be!

1425
01:47:37,747 --> 01:47:40,747
Stay strong, Gerry!
Stay strong, mate!

1426
01:47:40,747 --> 01:47:42,747
Keep your chin up, mate!

1427
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:44,465
We're with you, Gerry!

1428
01:47:44,547 --> 01:47:46,742
We're with you all the way, mate!

1429
01:47:59,827 --> 01:48:01,419
He's still awake.

1430
01:48:16,347 --> 01:48:18,736
Your father passed away
an hour ago.

1431
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,419
Thank you very much.

1432
01:48:23,947 --> 01:48:25,744
I'm sorry.

1433
01:48:57,187 --> 01:48:59,178
Giuseppe is dead, man!

1434
01:49:00,147 --> 01:49:02,217
They kill Giuseppe!

1435
01:49:07,987 --> 01:49:09,420
Gerry, man!

1436
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:16,264
They killed Giuseppe!

1437
01:50:04,867 --> 01:50:07,745
Well, I think they ought to take
the word "compassion"...

1438
01:50:07,787 --> 01:50:09,743
out of the English dictionary.

1439
01:50:12,827 --> 01:50:14,897
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1440
01:50:17,867 --> 01:50:21,542
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1441
01:50:22,747 --> 01:50:25,739
Believe me, if there's one thing
I know about, it's guilt.

1442
01:50:27,107 --> 01:50:30,782
Keep looking 'em in the eye,
and it's gonna reveal itself.

1443
01:50:30,867 --> 01:50:32,937
You have to keep up the pressure.

1444
01:50:35,987 --> 01:50:37,943
Do what you have to do.

1445
01:50:40,027 --> 01:50:42,746
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1446
01:51:01,867 --> 01:51:04,540
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1447
01:51:07,747 --> 01:51:11,183
"The Parade of Innocence."
What do you think?

1448
01:51:11,267 --> 01:51:13,747
<i>Thousands of people
lined the streets of Dublin...</i>

1449
01:51:13,747 --> 01:51:15,339
<i>London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations...</i>

1450
01:51:15,427 --> 01:51:17,463
<i>demanding the release
of the Guildford Four.</i>

1451
01:51:17,547 --> 01:51:20,747
<i>- Questions have been raised--
- Say good night to Daddy.</i>

1452
01:51:20,747 --> 01:51:23,181
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, son.

1453
01:51:23,267 --> 01:51:25,098
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1454
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:40,103
This was a mistake.

1455
01:51:41,067 --> 01:51:43,342
Why don't we let her
see the files?

1456
01:51:43,427 --> 01:51:45,736
What harm could it do?

1457
01:51:45,787 --> 01:51:48,381
- Mr Dixon!
- Yes?

1458
01:51:48,467 --> 01:51:50,378
Don't you get tired of this?

1459
01:51:50,467 --> 01:51:53,220
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Giuseppe Conlon case files.

1460
01:51:57,067 --> 01:51:59,820
- Good morning.
- There are a few rules to be observed.

1461
01:52:01,547 --> 01:52:03,856
Here's a complete list of
the Conlon, Giuseppe case files...

1462
01:52:03,947 --> 01:52:05,858
the only files you'll need to see.

1463
01:52:05,947 --> 01:52:08,177
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1464
01:52:08,267 --> 01:52:10,986
You take a page at a time,
read it and then return it.

1465
01:52:11,067 --> 01:52:13,865
Sorry. Is there a problem,
Mr Dixon?

1466
01:52:13,947 --> 01:52:15,824
Problem?
Not at all, Mrs Peirce.

1467
01:52:15,907 --> 01:52:19,377
Our chief archivist, Mr Jenkins,
is here to assist you.

1468
01:52:20,387 --> 01:52:22,821
If you want to make a photocopy,
I alone will do it.

1469
01:52:22,907 --> 01:52:25,740
Use this pen at all times
for any notes.

1470
01:52:25,827 --> 01:52:29,376
If you deface any document, we can
trace it through the ink in this pen.

1471
01:52:29,467 --> 01:52:34,063
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs Peirce.

1472
01:52:34,147 --> 01:52:36,103
We wouldn't want
police intelligence files...

1473
01:52:36,187 --> 01:52:39,418
leaked to the IRA now, would we?

1474
01:52:42,067 --> 01:52:43,864
Conlon, Giuseppe file.

1475
01:52:43,947 --> 01:52:45,858
Yes, sir.

1476
01:52:58,747 --> 01:53:01,215
Leave my kit on the bus,
'cause I'm not staying in your jail.

1477
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:04,982
So, our new VIP prisoner.

1478
01:53:05,067 --> 01:53:06,466
Welcome to Scotland.

1479
01:53:06,547 --> 01:53:08,742
I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1480
01:53:08,787 --> 01:53:12,939
He died in one of your jails.
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1481
01:53:13,027 --> 01:53:14,938
They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break my confidence.

1482
01:53:15,027 --> 01:53:18,417
- Put him in solitary.
- This is a peaceful protest.

1483
01:53:18,507 --> 01:53:20,065
We'll teach you manners.

1484
01:53:20,147 --> 01:53:21,899
Better men than you
have tried that already.

1485
01:53:21,987 --> 01:53:24,501
I have not seen my client
for two months.

1486
01:53:24,747 --> 01:53:28,217
He's been moved to Scotland, which has
impeded my investigation into his case.

1487
01:53:28,307 --> 01:53:31,982
So I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access--

1488
01:53:32,067 --> 01:53:33,739
Free the Four!

1489
01:53:49,547 --> 01:53:51,265
Here, thanks a lot.
Good day.

1490
01:53:51,347 --> 01:53:52,985
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1491
01:54:10,747 --> 01:54:13,978
Sorry. Could you copy that
for me, please?

1492
01:54:14,947 --> 01:54:17,097
Thank you.

1493
01:54:26,547 --> 01:54:29,505
<i>I just want my mother to be happy.</i>

1494
01:54:30,907 --> 01:54:34,058
<i>I'd like her to know...</i>

1495
01:54:34,147 --> 01:54:37,822
<i>that Giuseppe talked about her
every day of his life.</i>

1496
01:54:40,307 --> 01:54:42,263
<i>He missed her terribly.</i>

1497
01:54:47,187 --> 01:54:50,099
<i>It's strange to be in a cell
without him.</i>

1498
01:54:52,747 --> 01:54:55,341
<i>I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.</i>

1499
01:54:55,427 --> 01:54:57,338
<i>Everywhere I look, I see him.</i>

1500
01:55:04,747 --> 01:55:08,865
<i>Strange what time does
when you're in prison.</i>

1501
01:55:11,107 --> 01:55:14,941
<i>Like, you can be staring
at the wall.</i>

1502
01:55:15,027 --> 01:55:17,461
<i>Drip, drip, drip.</i>

1503
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:21,186
<i>It takes an eternity.</i>

1504
01:55:21,267 --> 01:55:24,543
<i>And then you blink,
and three years have gone by.</i>

1505
01:55:29,547 --> 01:55:31,747
<i>I mean, what I'm trying to--</i>

1506
01:55:31,747 --> 01:55:34,784
<i>I don't know what the fuck
I'm trying to say.</i>

1507
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:40,145
<i>But I can't forget
what they did to my family.</i>

1508
01:55:41,907 --> 01:55:43,420
<i>I just can't forget.</i>

1509
01:56:32,467 --> 01:56:33,820
Morning.

1510
01:56:35,107 --> 01:56:37,746
- Where's Jenkins?
- He telephoned in sick.

1511
01:56:37,787 --> 01:56:40,096
I'm afraid you're going
to have to come back tomorrow.

1512
01:56:40,187 --> 01:56:42,940
I can't. I'm in court tomorrow.
There's too much to get through.

1513
01:56:43,027 --> 01:56:44,506
I can't help you.

1514
01:56:44,747 --> 01:56:46,499
Please. I've got the court order.

1515
01:56:46,747 --> 01:56:48,977
You saw what Mr Jenkins did.
He just brings me the files.

1516
01:56:49,067 --> 01:56:51,535
I take the notes and give them
back to you. Please.

1517
01:56:51,747 --> 01:56:54,341
- What name is it?
- Conlon.

1518
01:56:54,427 --> 01:56:57,464
- All right.
- Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1519
01:57:03,387 --> 01:57:05,105
What name was that again?

1520
01:57:06,787 --> 01:57:08,937
We've got two Conlon boxes.

1521
01:57:09,027 --> 01:57:12,781
Is it Giuseppe Conlon
or Gerard Conlon?

1522
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:16,260
Gerard.

1523
01:57:23,747 --> 01:57:25,738
Well, that's for starters.

1524
01:57:47,747 --> 01:57:49,021
<i>Fuck 'em!</i>

1525
01:57:51,787 --> 01:57:53,220
It's good news.

1526
01:57:54,387 --> 01:57:57,743
We're talking about
a piece of evidence...

1527
01:57:57,827 --> 01:58:01,217
that says they knew all along,
that they let my father die in prison?

1528
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:04,265
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that?

1529
01:58:04,347 --> 01:58:06,258
We'll get them in court.

1530
01:58:06,347 --> 01:58:09,180
"We'll get them in court"?
Will you catch yourself on?

1531
01:58:09,267 --> 01:58:12,339
They've kept us in prison for 15 years.
They can keep us in for another 15.

1532
01:58:12,427 --> 01:58:14,338
This is the fucking
government, Gareth!

1533
01:58:14,427 --> 01:58:17,464
It's the fucking government!
What are they gonna say?

1534
01:58:17,547 --> 01:58:19,742
"We're sorry about that"?

1535
01:58:20,907 --> 01:58:23,865
"Made a wee bit of a mistake,
but you can be on your way now"?

1536
01:58:23,947 --> 01:58:26,097
What are they gonna say?
"Sorry we killed your da"?

1537
01:58:26,187 --> 01:58:29,099
"Sorry we fucked
your fucking life to hell"?

1538
01:58:46,547 --> 01:58:49,505
I am not putting my mother
through hell again.

1539
01:58:50,547 --> 01:58:52,299
Are you afraid of court?

1540
01:58:52,387 --> 01:58:54,742
I just don't wanna be
humiliated again.

1541
01:59:15,867 --> 01:59:17,425
I swear by Almighty God...

1542
01:59:17,507 --> 01:59:20,897
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

1543
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:22,943
and nothing but the truth.

1544
01:59:29,987 --> 01:59:34,344
Mr Dixon, do you know
these young people...

1545
01:59:34,427 --> 01:59:36,782
known as the Guildford Four?

1546
01:59:39,427 --> 01:59:40,826
Yes, I do.

1547
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:44,024
Do you know how long
they have spent in jail?

1548
01:59:45,067 --> 01:59:46,466
Fifteen years.

1549
01:59:49,227 --> 01:59:50,979
Do you know Annie Maguire...

1550
01:59:51,947 --> 01:59:55,144
who served her 14 years
without remission?

1551
01:59:56,187 --> 01:59:59,020
Do you know her son Vincent
who served five years?

1552
01:59:59,107 --> 02:00:01,860
Her son Patrick who served four?
Do you know her husband...

1553
02:00:01,947 --> 02:00:04,905
Paddy Maguire, who served 12 years?

1554
02:00:05,987 --> 02:00:09,900
Carole Richardson was 17
when she went to jail, Mr Dixon.

1555
02:00:09,987 --> 02:00:11,818
Now she is 32.

1556
02:00:13,747 --> 02:00:15,747
Do you know Carole Richardson?

1557
02:00:15,747 --> 02:00:20,025
- What is the point of this?
- Yes, come to the point.

1558
02:00:26,307 --> 02:00:29,743
Do you know who this is, Mr Dixon?

1559
02:00:33,547 --> 02:00:35,344
No, I don't.

1560
02:00:35,427 --> 02:00:37,224
Well, then would you be so kind...

1561
02:00:37,307 --> 02:00:40,747
as to read this statement
that you took from him...

1562
02:00:40,747 --> 02:00:43,739
on the third of November, 1974?

1563
02:00:43,827 --> 02:00:47,536
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all of these people...

1564
02:00:47,747 --> 02:00:50,545
-all these innocent people.
-I need to see a copy of this statement.

1565
02:00:50,747 --> 02:00:54,183
Either that man or his superior
or his superior's superior...

1566
02:00:54,267 --> 02:00:57,339
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats...

1567
02:00:57,427 --> 02:01:00,544
by a nation
that was baying for blood...

1568
02:01:00,747 --> 02:01:03,500
in return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1569
02:01:03,747 --> 02:01:06,747
- You got your blood, Mr Dixon!
- She is making a political speech.

1570
02:01:06,747 --> 02:01:10,296
You got the blood of Giuseppe Conlon
and the lifeblood of Carole Richardson!

1571
02:01:10,387 --> 02:01:13,504
You got 15 years of blood and sweat
and pain from my client...

1572
02:01:13,747 --> 02:01:16,420
whose only crime
was that he was Irish...

1573
02:01:16,507 --> 02:01:19,146
and foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

1574
02:01:19,227 --> 02:01:22,264
Mrs Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

1575
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:30,941
And one of your colleagues,
My Lord...

1576
02:01:31,027 --> 02:01:34,099
who sat where you sit now said,
"It is a pity...

1577
02:01:34,187 --> 02:01:36,747
you were not charged
with treason to the Crown--

1578
02:01:36,747 --> 02:01:40,456
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging--

1579
02:01:40,547 --> 02:01:43,778
a sentence I would have no difficulty
in passing in this case."

1580
02:01:43,867 --> 02:01:46,779
Mrs Peirce, I am trying
to read this document.

1581
02:01:46,867 --> 02:01:50,098
I will not tell you again
to be silent...

1582
02:01:50,187 --> 02:01:53,736
or you will be removed
from the court.

1583
02:02:35,747 --> 02:02:37,977
My Lord, this document...

1584
02:02:38,067 --> 02:02:41,218
brings the entire British
legal system into disrepute.

1585
02:02:41,307 --> 02:02:43,867
My Lord, this is new evidence.

1586
02:02:43,947 --> 02:02:45,983
It is shocking new evidence.

1587
02:02:46,067 --> 02:02:47,747
My Lord, this evidence...

1588
02:02:47,747 --> 02:02:50,944
was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal.

1589
02:02:51,027 --> 02:02:54,736
That, I believe, is the point
Mrs Peirce is trying to make.

1590
02:02:54,787 --> 02:02:57,460
- Proceed, Mrs Peirce.
- My Lord, I demand a recess.

1591
02:02:57,547 --> 02:03:01,540
There will be no demands made
in my court.

1592
02:03:01,747 --> 02:03:03,066
Stand back.

1593
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:10,307
This alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1594
02:03:10,387 --> 02:03:12,139
was taken by Mr Dixon...

1595
02:03:12,227 --> 02:03:15,458
one month after
Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1596
02:03:15,547 --> 02:03:19,747
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

1597
02:03:19,747 --> 02:03:23,103
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defence."

1598
02:03:29,067 --> 02:03:32,139
I have one question
to ask you, Mr Dixon:

1599
02:03:32,227 --> 02:03:34,377
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1600
02:03:34,467 --> 02:03:38,745
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people...

1601
02:03:38,827 --> 02:03:40,863
kept from the defence?

1602
02:03:48,747 --> 02:03:50,738
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

1603
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:53,418
Silence!

1604
02:03:53,507 --> 02:03:56,544
- It's about time!
- Order in the court!

1605
02:03:57,947 --> 02:04:00,745
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

1606
02:04:00,787 --> 02:04:02,379
This is most irregular.

1607
02:04:02,467 --> 02:04:05,140
Yes. I am aware of that, My Lord.

1608
02:04:06,027 --> 02:04:07,904
Very well.

1609
02:04:23,347 --> 02:04:25,907
Mr Dixon, you may stand down.

1610
02:04:27,467 --> 02:04:30,777
This is the man
who should be under arrest!

1611
02:04:30,867 --> 02:04:33,062
Be silent, Mrs Peirce!

1612
02:04:33,147 --> 02:04:35,456
- This court is now in recess.
- Guards, get ready.

1613
02:04:35,547 --> 02:04:37,936
Don't try and make me
the fall guy...

1614
02:04:38,027 --> 02:04:40,985
for the whole
British legal establishment.

1615
02:04:45,067 --> 02:04:47,137
If I accept this mercy deal--

1616
02:04:47,227 --> 02:04:49,138
They have a flipping cheek,
offering me mercy.

1617
02:04:49,227 --> 02:04:51,138
They should be begging
for mercy themselves.

1618
02:04:51,227 --> 02:04:52,899
- You ready, Mr Conlon?
- Aye.

1619
02:04:52,987 --> 02:04:55,057
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

1620
02:04:55,147 --> 02:04:57,747
The truth has to come out.
They may not want to hear it...

1621
02:04:57,747 --> 02:04:59,747
but there's people outside
who'll listen.

1622
02:04:59,747 --> 02:05:02,307
-Just think about it, will you?
- All right.

1623
02:05:02,387 --> 02:05:04,537
Aye. Give us three of them.

1624
02:05:20,267 --> 02:05:21,859
Silence!

1625
02:05:24,507 --> 02:05:27,146
<i>In the matter of Her Majesty...</i>

1626
02:05:27,227 --> 02:05:30,025
<i>versus Gerard Patrick Conlon...</i>

1627
02:05:30,107 --> 02:05:33,019
the case is hereby dismissed.

1628
02:05:37,747 --> 02:05:39,942
My husband died in your prison
an innocent man!

1629
02:05:40,027 --> 02:05:43,337
I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.

1630
02:05:43,427 --> 02:05:45,463
- This way.
- I'm going out the front door.

1631
02:05:45,547 --> 02:05:46,821
What about Giuseppe Conlon?

1632
02:05:46,907 --> 02:05:49,740
Your Honour,
he was an innocent man!

1633
02:05:52,427 --> 02:05:54,179
Mr Conlon, that's not a good idea.

1634
02:05:54,267 --> 02:05:56,019
Use the back,
for security reasons.

1635
02:05:56,107 --> 02:05:58,177
I'm a free man,
and I'm going out the front door.

1636
02:05:59,307 --> 02:06:02,822
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Paul Hill...</i>

1637
02:06:02,907 --> 02:06:06,536
the case is hereby dismissed.

1638
02:06:13,347 --> 02:06:17,545
Leave me alone!
I'm going out the front door with Gerry!

1639
02:06:19,867 --> 02:06:24,861
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Patrick Armstrong...</i>

1640
02:06:24,947 --> 02:06:26,938
the case is hereby dismissed.

1641
02:06:29,107 --> 02:06:33,737
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Carole Richardson...</i>

1642
02:06:33,787 --> 02:06:37,257
the case is hereby dismissed.

1643
02:06:37,347 --> 02:06:38,860
I'm an innocent man!

1644
02:06:38,947 --> 02:06:42,781
I spent 15 years in prison
for something I didn't do!

1645
02:06:42,867 --> 02:06:44,778
I watched my father die...

1646
02:06:44,867 --> 02:06:47,745
in a British prison
for something he didn't do!

1647
02:06:47,787 --> 02:06:50,745
And this government
still says he's guilty!

1648
02:06:50,827 --> 02:06:52,499
I want to tell them...

1649
02:06:52,747 --> 02:06:55,739
that until my father
is proved innocent...

1650
02:06:55,787 --> 02:06:59,860
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent...

1651
02:06:59,947 --> 02:07:02,461
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice...

1652
02:07:02,547 --> 02:07:04,747
I will fight on...

1653
02:07:04,747 --> 02:07:08,376
in the name of my father
and of the truth!
