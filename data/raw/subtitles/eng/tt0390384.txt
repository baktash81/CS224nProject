00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,411
<i>Here's what's going to happen.</i>
<i>I'm going to read this...</i>

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,790
<i>and you're going to listen,</i>
<i>and you're going to stay on the line.</i>

3
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,502
<i>You're not going to interrupt.</i>
<i>You're not going to speak for any reason.</i>

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>Now, some of this you know.</i>
<i>I'm going to start at the top of the page.</i>

5
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.</i>

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>They were these things.</i>

7
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>Nothing extreme. Like anyone, they varied.</i>

8
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>There were days of mistakes</i>
<i>and laziness and infighting.</i>

9
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>And there were days, good days,</i>
<i>when by anyone's judgment...</i>

10
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,362
<i>they would have to be considered clever.</i>

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>No one would say</i>
<i>that what they were doing was complicated.</i>

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>It wouldn't even be considered new.</i>
<i>Except maybe in the geological sense.</i>

13
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,498
<i>They took from their surroundings</i>
<i>what was needed...</i>

14
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,292
<i>and made of it something more.</i>

15
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,004
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

16
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,299
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know.... Yeah, I'm putting 28th.

17
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:34,636
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

18
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,765
- Not really.
- Because I was--

19
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,560
I mean I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

20
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,606
Phillip and I were talking,
and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.

21
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,194
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

22
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,364
The time for jacking around with tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,075
Maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time.

24
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,245
My free time? The free time
after the 50 hours a week at work...

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,333
or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,752
And it's not a tesla coil.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,421
I could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet.

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,216
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

29
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,219
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

30
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,471
Doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

31
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,682
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,144
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it. Are you?

33
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,897
Abe just means that right now
the JTAG cards are it.

34
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:31,318
When you look at the addresses, we have
a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,446
But these are not the bulk orders
to the OEMs or retail giants.

36
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,740
- These are the quiet basement--
- Hackers.

37
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,285
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

38
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:45,457
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,962
With everything last year, and the doubletalk
we were getting from Platts...

40
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,715
- and all the stuff we won't get into now--
- We should get into it.

41
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,093
I'm sorry. What?

42
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,638
Go ahead. Tell him.

43
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,559
We should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

44
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,228
He knows of two other cases like that
at his firm.

45
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,565
- Let Platts know that we're talking about it.
- Look, forget Platts.

46
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,151
This has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market...

47
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,487
and what is going to get us VC attention.

48
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,949
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

49
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,869
And I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing...

50
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,246
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

51
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,624
But if it's my turn...

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,587
if we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

53
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,134
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.

54
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,386
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.

55
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,764
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

56
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,558
- Good night, all.
- See you.

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,898
- We just got done giving this huge speech--
- We gave the speech?

58
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,025
We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,905
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

60
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,366
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

61
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,828
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

62
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,415
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

63
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,543
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs,
and that's fine.

64
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,962
But you know I have no interest in that.

65
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,381
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

66
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,344
that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.

67
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,763
For what I want to do? We don't need them.

68
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,641
Not even Phillip,
because it doesn't need software.

69
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,228
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

70
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,023
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

71
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,735
You know, even if Robert's okay with it,
and he won't be.

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,240
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

73
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,034
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,245
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,830
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.

76
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,624
What about crushed?

77
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,544
These guys are funded.

78
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,005
- These guys are.... What?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

79
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,715
That's what this is.

80
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,176
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,388
We don't have to play the game
where we're going back and forth...

82
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,433
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process.

83
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,687
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

84
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,523
By coming at it from the back end,
rather than changing...

85
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,776
the surrounding temperature,
we'll change the level it'll conduct...

86
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,737
the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges--

87
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,032
They're dropping the ceramic,
the temperature lower and lower.

88
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,911
It makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field.

89
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,747
What I'm saying is
we drop the box down on it.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,668
Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse...

91
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,628
what's going on inside the ceramic.

92
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,757
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

93
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,303
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

94
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,265
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?

95
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,101
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

96
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,895
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

97
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,730
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,523
Yeah, they're Type One.

99
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,233
Is that going to be a problem?

100
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,236
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar coded.

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,907
- lf I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

102
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,366
What?

103
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,995
- I can get them.
- You can.... Are you sure?

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,914
I thought you didn't like this idea.

105
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,958
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.

106
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,460
What about the source here?

107
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,087
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions...

108
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,966
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?

109
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,512
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

110
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,722
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

111
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,726
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

112
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,479
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

113
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,523
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.

114
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,608
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

115
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,944
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

116
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,529
I want to get a replacement router.

117
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,740
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

118
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,617
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

119
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,371
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

120
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,374
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,709
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

122
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,878
- Abe? It's not a--
- Yeah, I don't care.

123
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,464
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

124
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,633
- Did you jiggle the--
- The collet nut?

125
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,469
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

126
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,390
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

127
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,852
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

128
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,146
Why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

129
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,315
One catalytic converter. It's fine.

130
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,068
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300%.

131
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,070
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

132
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,032
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, coppertubing.

133
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,835
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

134
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,006
- We can use the Freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

135
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,174
I know, just in case.

136
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:49,303
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money.

137
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,270
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

138
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,085
Should we be wearing goggles?

139
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,673
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

140
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,051
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?

141
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,769
Wait. Phillip, you don't want
to come out here.

142
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,063
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

143
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,398
It is, though, right? It's not just me?

144
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,111
No, it's definitely smaller, but it just seems
that way. Take what they have.

145
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,281
Minus the coolant which we don't need.

146
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,867
The rest of it is the mercury bath...

147
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:39,246
which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

148
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:44,126
I mean, you have it, you got to use it, right?

149
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,462
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

150
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,840
That sound is just weirding me out.

151
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,556
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

152
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,808
I don't know if I'm making it up.

153
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,311
Here.

154
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,453
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,797
Isn't there some sort of glass
or a transparent....

156
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,467
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

157
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,177
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

158
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,347
I don't know of anything
that won't leave a gap in the field.

159
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,474
But we got to see what's going on in there.

160
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,227
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,855
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

162
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,526
inside the box that's so dangerous
we can't look into it.

163
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,823
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

164
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,703
So we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box.

165
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,872
So we're ready for the argon.

166
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,168
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

167
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,047
I weighed it at 77 grams.

168
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,383
I set the scale to decagrams, though.

169
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,387
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

170
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,265
Ready for...

171
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:26,186
0.05 liters of argon.

172
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,281
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

173
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,284
Right, first just the plate, and then we'II....

174
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,583
Let's just give it a second.

175
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,061
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,898
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

177
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,693
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

178
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,905
Just wait.

179
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,501
Okay.

180
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,386
Anything?

181
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,806
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

182
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,143
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

183
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,983
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

184
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,072
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

185
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,408
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,786
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

187
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,205
One, two, three.

188
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,013
<i>Hey. Tell me you're hungry.</i>
<i>Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.</i>

189
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,516
Yeah, I'm hungry. What....

190
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,812
<i>Abe, it's 7:00. Abe, it's 7:00 at night.</i>

191
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,314
- Okay, yeah, I have food--
<i>- Okay.</i>

192
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,776
<i>- Wait, are those kids there?</i>
- Just a sec.

193
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,237
Yeah, they're here.

194
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:44,116
<i>Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.</i>
<i>I just pulled in, so come on down.</i>

195
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,286
Come up first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.

196
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,538
<i>All right, but meet me at the door.</i>

197
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,791
- Okay, all right.
<i>- Seriously, meet me at the door.</i>

198
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,835
Okay. All right. See you.

199
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,310
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

200
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,644
Good.

201
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,699
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

202
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,827
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.

203
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,581
I know. I just thought it would be good
to do something charitable.

204
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,459
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

205
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,507
You feel like a steak? To eat.

206
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,886
I don't want a steak. Let's just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop.

207
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,930
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

208
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,017
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

209
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,395
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

210
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,735
It's stable?

211
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,405
Aaron, it's stable?

212
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,041
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

213
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,003
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

214
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,549
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

215
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,760
- I figured it's the easiest way--
- It's just controlling the box.

216
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:30,681
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.

217
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,396
Okay. You hear that? How it's....

218
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,816
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

219
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,485
It's like a feedback loop,
and it just regulates itself.

220
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,364
And what you do is when it gets there,
you bring it back...

221
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,785
and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

222
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,039
So it works?

223
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,251
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10%?

224
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,713
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

225
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,841
You may want to come over here
and take a look at this.

226
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,634
Okay, what am I looking at?

227
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,013
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

228
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,515
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

229
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,309
So your meter's jacked up.

230
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,563
That's what I figured. So I tried three others.
I got the exact same thing.

231
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,523
- I spent all last night--
- What was it?

232
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:25,360
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

233
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,448
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

234
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,783
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

235
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,786
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

236
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,832
It's probably the batteries.
They're cheap batteries, not regulated right.

237
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,667
That is weird, though.

238
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,048
You want to see something weirder?

239
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,260
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

240
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,223
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.

241
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,393
Twelve volts.

242
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,907
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

243
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,709
So, what the hell is this thing?

244
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,879
It doesn't stay like that.

245
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,550
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?

246
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:38,559
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

247
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,019
It should just be a day or two, anyways.

248
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,440
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

249
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,694
If Phillip finds out about that
he's going to have to take it apart.

250
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:53,198
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

251
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,244
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.

252
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,832
<i>There was value in the thing.</i>
<i>Clearly. Of that they were certain of.</i>

253
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,293
<i>But what is the application?</i>
<i>In a matter of hours...</i>

254
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,880
<i>they had pinned it to everything</i>
<i>from mass transit to satellite launching.</i>

255
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,174
<i>Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.</i>

256
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,343
<i>Everything would be cheaper.</i>
<i>It was practical and they knew it.</i>

257
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,512
<i>But above all that, beyond the positives...</i>

258
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,806
<i>they knew that the easiest way</i>
<i>to be exploited...</i>

259
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,142
<i>is to sell something</i>
<i>they did not yet understand.</i>

260
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,729
<i>So they kept quiet.</i>
<i>The parties would continue.</i>

261
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,398
<i>Any birthday, anniversary, holiday...</i>

262
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,444
<i>maybe some obscure project launch.</i>
<i>It didn't matter. Any reason would do.</i>

263
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:35,032
<i>What was important is that Thomas Granger,</i>
<i>their last best hope of funding, show up.</i>

264
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,495
<i>If he left a little earlier than</i>
<i>they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.</i>

265
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,623
<i>He was only there</i>
<i>to please his daughter Rachel.</i>

266
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,292
<i>And she was only there to please Abe.</i>

267
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,796
What did you say
to Mr. Granger a while ago?

268
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,674
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

269
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,927
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

270
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,930
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

271
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,725
- He thinks we're kids.
- lf you call him Mr. Granger...

272
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,563
he looks at you like you're a 6-year-old kid.
He does it with me. It won't work anymore.

273
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,484
<i>Abe had taken on the task</i>
<i>of quantifying and explaining the device.</i>

274
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,320
<i>But as weeks became months...</i>

275
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,699
<i>their enthusiasm became a slow realization</i>
<i>that they were out of their depth.</i>

276
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,870
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

277
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,998
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

278
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm not there.

279
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,586
Really?

280
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,549
- March Madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

281
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,759
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

282
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,430
Do you have anything important
at work today?

283
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,475
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

284
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,272
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

285
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,317
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

286
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,068
But how about this instead?

287
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,364
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

288
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,201
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

289
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,953
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

290
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:49,458
Well, it looks like mustard to me.

291
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,919
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein...

292
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,922
secreted by a fungus
called <i>Aspergillus Ticor.</i>

293
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,048
He told you that?

294
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,134
No, he knew it was a protein
but didn't know where it came from.

295
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,387
All he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment.

296
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,805
Guess where we're going.

297
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,308
- Do you know where Will is?
- No, why?

298
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,727
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

299
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,605
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

300
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,941
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

301
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,443
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

302
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,446
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.

303
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,782
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

304
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,993
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

305
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:29,289
Okay, if you can, just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

306
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,918
And if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me....

307
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,130
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein buildup.

308
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,843
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein buildup.

309
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,137
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

310
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,182
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

311
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,186
- I don't know. You were to take it to the lab.
- Yeah, that's next.

312
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,064
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,024
How did you get over here?

314
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:59,319
Do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

315
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,238
They take them out and shoot them.

316
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,324
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.

317
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:08,078
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

318
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,997
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

319
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,542
this guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

320
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,961
<i>Really? Why would he think that?</i>

321
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,100
Please.

322
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>Aspergillus Ticor.</i>

323
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,690
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

324
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,612
It's in our bed, our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

325
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:47,034
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

326
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,953
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?

327
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,212
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

328
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,549
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

329
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:08,430
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

330
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,350
Right, but how did you know?

331
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,772
Will you show him? Please?

332
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,326
This is how I get protein A
out of <i>Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.</i>

333
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,287
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.

334
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,624
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

335
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,252
To get the same amount I brought in.

336
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,754
So if it's an incubator for fungus,
is that valuable?

337
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,631
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

338
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:46,134
There's another way to secrete
that much protein. Do it naturally.

339
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,470
But that takes a lot longer.

340
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:53,517
If it has a little moisture and it's left alone,
it'll start secreting and it'll build up...

341
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,019
- and build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

342
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,981
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

343
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,358
To get the same amount of protein
that we have...

344
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,777
the amount that I was wiping off
every five days...

345
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,071
and five days later it would accumulate...

346
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,824
he says it would take about five to six years.

347
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,245
I don't want to belittle this guy.

348
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,039
So, I said screw it
and I put my watch in there.

349
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,709
- And?
- I want you to do it.

350
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:22,254
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

351
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,843
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

352
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,597
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

353
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,518
We thought
that we were degrading gravity, right?

354
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,645
That we were blocking that information.

355
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:42,357
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

356
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,612
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

357
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,157
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.

358
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,659
I don't know, Abe.

359
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,370
I'm going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds...

360
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,748
with nothing in it. It's empty this time.

361
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:58,832
That's 22--

362
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,710
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

363
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:05,339
In all Feynman diagrams what's the
one variable that you can turn negative...

364
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,925
and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.

365
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,802
Twenty-two hours, 27 minutes in the box.

366
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:14,223
- It's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

367
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,436
- 1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

368
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,607
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an "A" end and a "B" end.

369
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,693
Let's say the A end is 12:00,and the B end is 12:01.

370
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,696
All right? We start the machine
with the Weeble at the A end.

371
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,241
- It travels forward--
- You got to write this down.

372
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,785
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

373
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,912
It travels forward normally
towards the B end.

374
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,456
When it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically...

375
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,709
until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the A end.

376
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,963
When it gets back to the A end....
Curve that around. The Weeble...

377
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,424
has experienced a total of two minutes,
and again it curves--

378
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,635
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

379
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,388
It comes back around
and it does this about 1,300 times.

380
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,223
When it finally exits on the B end...

381
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,142
it's traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

382
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,688
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

383
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,857
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

384
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,777
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

385
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,405
Every time it hits the B end
there's a chance...

386
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,408
a small chance it won't
curve back around towards the A end.

387
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:18,203
And for some reason, it takes
about 1,300 trips before it finally does.

388
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,623
It does have to exit, or else
we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

389
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:23,709
Okay, let's take a look at this.

390
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,670
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

391
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,886
- 1,334 minutes.
- Even.

392
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,973
Enter at the B end.

393
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,685
Exit at the B end.

394
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:48,108
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

395
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,694
Everything we're putting in that box
comes ungrounded.

396
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,530
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.

397
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,825
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

398
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,037
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

399
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:04,124
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

400
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,335
This is not mechanics and heat.

401
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,218
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

402
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,803
No, I mean we can really publish.

403
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,015
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid. It can't move.

404
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,684
Even if we were
to put the Weeble in at point B...

405
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,523
it's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the B end.

406
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,694
But if it were smart...

407
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,700
it could enter at the B end
and exit at the A end before it flips back.

408
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:46,875
You're talking about making a bigger one.

409
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:51,505
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.

410
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:54,550
So, you believe me?

411
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,886
No, I don't.

412
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,389
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.

413
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,896
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

414
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,777
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on--

415
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,072
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

416
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:20,617
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it makes the plate smaller.

417
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,828
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

418
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:27,249
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

419
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,751
How small?

420
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:34,089
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

421
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,758
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.

422
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:40,304
What I was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it...

423
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,264
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

424
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,433
We could just lock it in a closet.

425
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,604
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

426
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,355
And climate-controlled.

427
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:53,400
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.

428
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,695
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?

429
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,532
That's a lot of work. We'd have to....
I mean, how many days is that?

430
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,162
Abe, you know what we could use?

431
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,625
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, okay?

432
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,670
I know you're still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense.

433
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:17,341
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

434
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,219
I wouldn't do that to you
and I'm not doing that to you.

435
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,723
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere.

436
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:29,311
I know you probably feel like you're
being tricked or made fun of. But you're not.

437
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,314
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

438
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,050
Who was that, Abe?

439
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,161
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

440
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,182
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?

441
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,438
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

442
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,444
I spent the day in a hotel room
in Russellfield.

443
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,491
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

444
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,579
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

445
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,623
Probably just worked, I guess.

446
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:57,668
Yeah, probably so.

447
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,508
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

448
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,970
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

449
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,101
Go ahead.

450
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,149
Hey, Rachel.

451
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,194
Why not the lottery?

452
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,280
We can if you want,
but it's not until Saturday.

453
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,910
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

454
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,747
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

455
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:20,250
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

456
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,752
Exactly what you did.

457
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,755
<i>- The first thing I did is call in sick.</i>
<i>- Okay, I did that.</i>

458
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,717
<i>- Then I drove to the storage facility.</i>
<i>- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.</i>

459
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,428
<i>Then meet me there.</i>
<i>We're going to need both cars.</i>

460
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,640
<i>We need to park yours down the road,</i>
<i>out of sight of the facility.</i>

461
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,643
<i>- Why are we doing that?</i>
<i>- Because we need a ride home.</i>

462
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,311
<i>- What is that....</i>
<i>- It'll make sense.</i>

463
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,605
<i>Okay, I'll be patient.</i>

464
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,192
<i>When I got to the storage room,</i>
<i>I flooded the box with argon...</i>

465
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:49,071
<i>and I had to tighten it up</i>
<i>to secure the leaks.</i>

466
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,032
<i>- There's leaks?</i>
<i>- There's always leaks.</i>

467
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,499
<i>At 8:30 a.m., I set the timer for 15 minutes...</i>

468
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:04,002
<i>I jumped in the car,</i>
<i>and drove to Russellfield.</i>

469
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,379
<i>Okay, I lost it.</i>

470
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,131
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Why the timer?</i>

471
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:12,386
<i>Because the moment we start those</i>
<i>machines is the moment we'll end up...</i>

472
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,222
<i>- getting out of them, and--</i>
<i>- Right. Got it. Sorry.</i>

473
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,016
<i>I don't want to be standing around</i>
<i>when they do.</i>

474
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,480
<i>While I was on the road at 8:45,</i>
<i>the machine kicked on by itself...</i>

475
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,609
<i>and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.</i>

476
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,997
<i>In Russellfield, I got a hotel room</i>
<i>and tried to isolate myself.</i>

477
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,457
<i>Wait, what do you mean "isolate"?</i>

478
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,294
<i>I closed the windows,</i>
<i>I unplugged everything in the room...</i>

479
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,337
<i>the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.</i>

480
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,424
<i>I didn't want to take the chance</i>
<i>of running into someone I knew...</i>

481
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,509
<i>or seeing something on the news</i>
<i>that might....</i>

482
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:56,513
<i>If we're dealing with causality,</i>
<i>and I don't even know for sure.</i>

483
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,807
<i>- I just....</i>
<i>- What?</i>

484
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:02,394
<i>- Took myself out of the equation.</i>
<i>- Err on the side of caution.</i>

485
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,604
<i>Yes.</i>

486
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,232
<i>Then what did you do all day?</i>

487
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,989
<i>- I just sat there. I had some books, but....</i>
<i>- What? Were you nervous?</i>

488
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,201
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.</i>

489
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,582
"Evacipate."

490
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:32,257
<i>At 3:30 p.m.,</i>
<i>I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.</i>

491
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,468
<i>Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.</i>

492
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:38,222
<i>I called my mutual fund company and asked</i>
<i>which stock in their mid-cap fund...</i>

493
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,224
<i>had the greatest percentage gain that day.</i>

494
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>The idea was just to get enough information</i>
<i>for one good trade.</i>

495
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:46,104
<i>Can we just download chart data</i>
<i>and trade on each movement?</i>

496
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,651
<i>But if we do that, I want to use the library</i>
<i>in Russellfield, use their computers.</i>

497
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:08,877
<i>So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15</i>
<i>and cut off the power to the box.</i>

498
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:12,631
<i>It cycled down to a tolerable level</i>
<i>at about 3:19.</i>

499
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:15,843
<i>The trick is to get in</i>
<i>after it reaches a comfortable level...</i>

500
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:19,263
<i>but before it shuts off completely.</i>
<i>There's a window there.</i>

501
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,390
<i>So, does it hurt?</i>

502
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,518
<i>Yeah, it does a little.</i>

503
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,522
<i>It's not bad if you wait for the right time.</i>
<i>It's like a small static shock.</i>

504
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,191
<i>- Once you're in, you're fine, though.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

505
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,736
<i>I know you've done it,</i>
<i>and I can only assume that you don't have...</i>

506
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,780
<i>cancer or male impotence.</i>

507
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,575
<i>But what is your opinion</i>
<i>on how safe this thing is?</i>

508
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,077
<i>I can imagine no way</i>
<i>in which this thing would be...</i>

509
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,288
<i>considered anywhere remotely close to safe.</i>

510
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:47,875
<i>All I know is I spent six hours in there</i>
<i>and I'm still alive.</i>

511
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,421
<i>You still want to do it?</i>

512
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,107
<i>I set the alarm on my stopwatch</i>
<i>for six hours.</i>

513
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:16,278
<i>I regulated the O2 tank,</i>
<i>took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.</i>

514
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,238
<i>Did you?</i>

515
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:20,407
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Did you sleep?</i>

516
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:24,828
<i>Not at first. I've never</i>
<i>considered myself claustrophobic...</i>

517
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:29,082
<i>but I started sweating and I couldn't find</i>
<i>the right flow rate on the tank...</i>

518
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,629
<i>and I was breathing differently than I was</i>
<i>when I was testing it on the outside.</i>

519
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,131
<i>Eventually, I settled down, and...</i>

520
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:40,427
<i>I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine</i>
<i>kicking in, but I remember this moment...</i>

521
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,347
<i>in the dark</i>
<i>with the reverberation of the machine.</i>

522
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,892
<i>It was maybe the most content</i>
<i>I've ever been.</i>

523
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:51,980
<i>I woke up on my own without the alarm...</i>

524
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:55,609
<i>and waited for the machine to cool down.</i>
<i>Cool down from my perspective.</i>

525
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,570
<i>It got to a point where it sounded safe</i>
<i>to get out...</i>

526
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:01,240
<i>but the stopwatch still showed</i>
<i>a couple minutes...</i>

527
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,700
<i>so I trusted the math and waited.</i>

528
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,574
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.

529
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,582
You got out too soon.

530
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:57,045
You have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough.

531
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:59,173
So, we're back here?

532
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,177
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.

533
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,349
All right. Give me a few minutes.

534
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:15,939
<i>From there it was easy.</i>
<i>The bulk of the work was done.</i>

535
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:19,401
<i>I just left everything the way I found it.</i>
<i>I left the machine alone...</i>

536
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,446
<i>and didn't turn it off,</i>
<i>and just cleared out of there.</i>

537
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:26,992
<i>So your double would find everything</i>
<i>the same later that day and get in the box?</i>

538
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:31,622
<i>Right, but also, I or my double or someone</i>
<i>was in the box coming backwards.</i>

539
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:34,958
<i>So who knows what that would've done</i>
<i>if I'd turned the machine off.</i>

540
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,544
<i>Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.</i>

541
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:42,090
<i>So then, at that moment, since my double</i>
<i>was on the way to the hotel in my car...</i>

542
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:46,220
<i>I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,</i>
<i>we'll be able to use your truck.</i>

543
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:10,244
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

544
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:14,248
Good. Today, before 12:30, we'll buy
as many shares as we can of RGWU.

545
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:20,003
<i>They'll say their earnings that quarter</i>
<i>are three and a half times consensus...</i>

546
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,090
<i>and the stock will nearly double</i>
<i>in afternoon trading.</i>

547
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,135
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

548
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,555
What does this company do?
Do they make things or--

549
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,266
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.

550
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:37,062
<i>The volume is so high that the number</i>
<i>of shares we trade won't affect the price.</i>

551
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,942
You really don't know what they do?

552
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:51,326
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

553
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,495
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

554
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,831
I know there's a lot of other stocks
out there...

555
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,126
that do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

556
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:38,582
<i>- My God.</i>
<i>- She's not going to answer.</i>

557
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,459
I know, Abe. That's the question.

558
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:45,589
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

559
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:49,301
you've gone the charity route,
you have this perfect 100-room mansion...

560
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,762
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads.

561
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,848
Basically, you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want...

562
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:55,933
nobody can touch you.

563
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:58,101
- You're back from a two-year--
- Above the law.

564
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:03,065
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

565
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,234
How do you fill your day? What do you do?

566
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,696
Abe, I know that's the question, but it's not
a real question, so why does it matter?

567
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,198
So what's the answer?

568
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,118
Babe, he knows that's the question, okay?
He's asking you the question.

569
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:19,081
What do you mean? What would I do
with my life or what would I do tomorrow?

570
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,457
My God, either.

571
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:26,171
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help...

572
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:29,925
- something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

573
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,930
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

574
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:39,351
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning...

575
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,895
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc...

576
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,774
and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him...

577
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,568
and when he comes out...

578
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,905
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

579
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:56,869
Just one good punch, one good pow.

580
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,623
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

581
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:04,418
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.

582
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:07,087
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

583
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,922
no one would find out or get hurt.

584
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:12,384
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it...

585
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,303
and then I go back and tell myself not to.

586
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,514
Because I just want to know
what it feels like. That's all, really.

587
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,807
I'm so proud.

588
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:22,728
Finally, my husband, the hero.

589
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,154
- We can't do that.
- I know.

590
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,239
Did you call pest control?

591
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:38,869
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

592
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,998
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

593
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,001
<i>But the idea had been spoken...</i>

594
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:49,254
<i>and the words wouldn't go back</i>
<i>after they had been uttered aloud.</i>

595
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,964
So you are understanding this, right?

596
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:53,592
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

597
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:56,720
- I don't think I told you--
- Even if you do stop yourself...

598
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,390
your double, from hitting Platts,
why would he, your double, get in the box?

599
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:03,977
<i>And with no need for it,</i>
<i>no possible real-world application...</i>

600
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,731
<i>no advantage at all to be gained from it,</i>
<i>the idea stayed.</i>

601
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,819
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

602
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:14,780
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

603
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:17,699
- But what if there was a way to--
- Look, Abe, look.

604
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,328
I'm not going to pretend
like I know anything about paradoxes...

605
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,832
or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.

606
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:28,710
Kill your mom before you were born,
whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.

607
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,963
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

608
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:35,133
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

609
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,053
has already been defined,
that this is the second...

610
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:42,057
or third time through, or whatever.
And do you everfeel like....

611
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,895
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

612
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:51,150
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this.

613
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,486
People are always blaming their parents...

614
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:57,906
as if, if their mom had breastfed them,
their lives would be different.

615
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,158
Bunch of whiners.

616
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:02,411
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't
something you wonder about?

617
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,539
What if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be?

618
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:09,751
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

619
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,753
I'm not, either. But what's worse?

620
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,965
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

621
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,640
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm okay.

622
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:32,608
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.

623
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:36,528
- I know that when I decided to tell you--
- Decided to tell?

624
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:41,742
I knew that you are married and that there's
no secrets. Anything I tell you, she'll know.

625
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:43,368
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

626
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:46,121
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days...

627
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:49,666
I surprise her and we all just fly
to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

628
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:53,295
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping--

629
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,298
For now, you can tell her
you had a good day in the market.

630
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,466
- You don't understand.
- No.

631
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:00,052
You don't understand the questions
that come with that.

632
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,679
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

633
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:03,972
to figure out what's next...

634
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:07,643
which, I think, should be building
a bigger box, like the size of a room...

635
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,603
where more than one person could fit in.

636
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,815
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

637
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,317
By the way, this is our guy.

638
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,197
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

639
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,450
What's the return? Holy....

640
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:30,541
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

641
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,834
I don't want to tell them.

642
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,211
I know they have a lot invested
in the group--

643
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,671
I don't want to tell them.

644
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:39,007
If you need me to take the guilt on this one,
fine, okay?

645
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:40,884
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

646
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,679
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want.

647
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:47,015
I'll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years.

648
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,518
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

649
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,479
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better.

650
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,691
But I am not telling them a thing
about this. We're not.

651
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,708
God, everything is so different in there.

652
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,835
You can feel how cut off you are.

653
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,172
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

654
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:21,717
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

655
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:25,220
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside--

656
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,849
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

657
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:35,397
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

658
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,399
It was so uneventful.

659
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:41,195
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

660
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,752
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

661
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:59,087
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

662
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,756
- Turn around.
- You see it?

663
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,258
Where is it coming from? It's your notebook.

664
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:06,470
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

665
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:10,098
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

666
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,647
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

667
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,818
for people.
You think it's the machine? I got it.

668
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,921
Great. I can actually
get some work done today.

669
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,422
Hi, guys, what's going on?

670
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:45,342
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

671
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,885
He says they had to spray again.

672
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,972
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?

673
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,391
You never see anything around here
but those geckos.

674
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,142
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

675
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:55,602
- What?
- Why?

676
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:58,981
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

677
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,818
You know what? You guys, both of you,
you make fun, but there is a difference.

678
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,194
Wait. What did you call him?

679
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,363
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

680
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:07,948
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

681
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:12,161
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

682
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,704
- What?
- Swear to God.

683
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,622
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

684
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:18,083
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

685
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,503
It's funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it.

686
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,047
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

687
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,551
You can't risk your life and
especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

688
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:28,677
for someone like Rachel.

689
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,846
She practically begs
for this to happen to her.

690
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,556
I figured at least you'd understand.

691
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,641
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

692
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:38,437
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.

693
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:41,273
Different? How are things different?

694
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,860
You see it, okay? I know you do.

695
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:49,281
Look, that was the night...

696
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,992
you had told me everything
about the machine.

697
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,787
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

698
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,457
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

699
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:01,335
I wasn't going
to let him scare people like that.

700
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:03,670
I know it was stupid, okay?

701
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:07,299
But I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing.

702
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:12,429
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

703
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:16,058
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.

704
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:19,061
But you have a family now,
and God, especially now...

705
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,979
anything like this would be crazy.

706
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,066
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to....

707
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:27,194
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

708
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:33,367
You little sack of....
Even if you see him, don't tell me.

709
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,079
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

710
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,914
Then what are we doing out here?

711
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,876
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.

712
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:54,763
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

713
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:58,183
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together...

714
00:50:58,308 --> 00:50:59,476
but he never sees us leave.

715
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,062
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

716
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:05,649
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day?

717
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,571
Did you unplug this?

718
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,577
You brought your cell phone?

719
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:20,080
Can I check the caller ID?

720
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:23,876
Yeah, we're not back.

721
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:27,880
Yeah, but you can't take it back
with you, okay?

722
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,803
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

723
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,933
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

724
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,226
Tell me.

725
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,647
That sounds good.
No, I've got to eat with these offsite fags.

726
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:48,066
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.

727
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,113
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

728
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:57,886
- What?
- What?

729
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:01,890
We're supposed to win this by two,
they just turned over with 12 on the clock.

730
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:05,894
- We have to foul.
- No.

731
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,940
What? No, we foul here,
they miss the first free throw...

732
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,234
- and they come back with the three.
- Three points.

733
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:13,527
That's right.

734
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,120
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.

735
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,167
What's up, you guys?

736
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:39,094
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

737
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,888
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

738
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:45,893
How do cell phones work?

739
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,896
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

740
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:51,273
do they both ring at the same time,
or is there....

741
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,525
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

742
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,902
No, it's a network.

743
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:58,071
It checks each area and
when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.

744
00:53:58,155 --> 00:53:59,740
It rings the first one.

745
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:04,953
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

746
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,372
So the one your double has in Russellfield
can't be.

747
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:09,541
Right. I think we broke symmetry.

748
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:14,129
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

749
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,508
You feel all right?

750
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,469
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

751
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:51,834
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?

752
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:55,838
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.

753
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,800
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

754
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,177
We can do this, but we have to do it now.

755
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:05,013
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

756
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:08,350
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

757
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,685
Yeah, for stocks.

758
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:14,189
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.

759
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,067
These kids were down skating by,
hitting cars on the block.

760
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:21,155
So we go right now, do our business
at Platts', get back in the box...

761
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,782
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms.

762
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:27,828
All we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight. That should scare them off.

763
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,913
That way my double
sleeps through the night...

764
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:34,501
they don't have this conversation,
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

765
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:39,882
- They'll be changed. But--
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

766
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,929
Wait, how do we go back that far
if the machines haven't been running?

767
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,643
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

768
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:55,230
I started going by at 5:00,and turning them on, 5:00 p.m.

769
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,192
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question--

770
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:01,278
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

771
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:04,072
- A little of both.
- 5:00.

772
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:07,910
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

773
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,121
I've got the O2 tanks in the car.

774
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,431
- Is that....
- Is that Rachel's car?

775
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:34,561
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.

776
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:36,104
Did you see that?

777
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,567
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

778
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:41,985
What?

779
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,780
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing...

780
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:47,741
sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

781
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:52,287
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

782
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,082
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

783
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:58,126
No, let's just get out
of my neighborhood first. Come on.

784
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,629
- Did you see him today?
- No.

785
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,967
I did. I saw him this afternoon...

786
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:06,802
around 6:00.

787
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:09,137
Are you sure you didn't see him
when we drove past?

788
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,389
No, what?

789
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,976
I'm positive this afternoon
he was clean-shaven. I know he was.

790
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,478
He was ready to go to some function
with his wife.

791
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:19,189
He looks like he's got
a two or three-day growth now.

792
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:22,442
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

793
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,825
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?

794
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,705
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

795
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,416
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

796
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,004
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

797
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:44,715
He's just sitting there.

798
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,886
He got out for a second
and I thought he was coming over...

799
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:52,431
and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.

800
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,142
Hi, sorry to call so late.

801
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,145
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?

802
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:02,733
Yeah, this is James Miller
from Putney and Myers.

803
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:05,694
Hi, Mr. Granger?

804
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,530
Thomas Granger?

805
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:15,204
What are you doing here? Come here!

806
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,887
What happened?

807
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,848
I'm okay. I slipped.

808
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:49,196
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.

809
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:51,448
Yeah. How many do you think I made?

810
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,830
These are set right. I turned them on at 5:00.

811
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,874
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

812
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,210
He could be in one of them right now.

813
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:09,258
I say we shut them off
and see if he's in there.

814
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,094
Were you planning on talking to him?

815
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,429
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

816
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:16,348
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.

817
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:17,683
Are you sure you wouldn't?

818
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:20,727
You're the one he can't get near
without passing out.

819
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:25,566
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.

820
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,776
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

821
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:30,737
Sometimes we do things
but don't know how we got to that point.

822
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:32,281
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

823
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:35,242
I can't think of any reason why I would.

824
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:38,203
Well, I can't either.

825
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,998
What if it was an emergency?

826
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:46,420
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

827
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:49,339
I don't know. What kind of emergency?

828
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,676
<i>The permutations were endless.</i>

829
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:56,889
<i>They tried again going to the source...</i>

830
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:59,725
<i>but even while keeping him separated</i>
<i>from Abe by two rooms...</i>

831
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:00,809
Ask him his name.

832
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:03,645
<i>...Granger's condition</i>
<i>could only be described as vegetative.</i>

833
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,147
What did he say?

834
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,816
<i>From this they deduced</i>
<i>that the problem was recursive...</i>

835
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:11,570
<i>but beyond that, found themselves</i>
<i>admitting, against their own nature...</i>

836
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:14,156
<i>and once again,</i>
<i>that the answer was unknowable.</i>

837
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:15,991
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

838
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:19,661
We didn't have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could've done anything.

839
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:23,790
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

840
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,167
so you don't know what we lost.

841
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,793
It really could not have been much.

842
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:29,713
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.

843
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,048
I know what you're saying.

844
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:32,466
<i>The question should have been...</i>

845
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:35,010
<i>what to do with the comatose man</i>
<i>in the guest bedroom.</i>

846
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:38,805
<i>But in Abe's mind</i>
<i>he was already compiling the list.</i>

847
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:46,730
<i>Two mg of oral triazolam...</i>

848
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:51,652
<i>every seven hours induces a safe sleep state</i>
<i>and a minimal metabolic rate.</i>

849
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:54,863
<i>At this continued state of rest...</i>

850
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,908
<i>the human body breathes</i>
<i>0.3 liters of oxygen a minute...</i>

851
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,536
<i>or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.</i>

852
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,581
<i>A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.</i>

853
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,792
<i>To maintain hydration...</i>

854
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:11,046
<i>the body cycles through a minimum</i>
<i>of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.</i>

855
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,549
<i>Any food would be a luxury...</i>

856
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,385
<i>but the small tank</i>
<i>of medical grade nitrous oxide...</i>

857
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,554
<i>would be needed on the other side.</i>

858
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,474
<i>Past the room that contained their machines</i>
<i>and up two levels...</i>

859
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,351
<i>he made his way to another room...</i>

860
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:29,148
<i>where he had stored what I will refer to</i>
<i>from here on as the Failsafe Machine.</i>

861
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,918
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

862
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:15,671
Really?

863
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:18,340
Your cell and work.

864
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:24,888
I'm not there.

865
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,181
Really?

866
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:32,980
I don't even know what.

867
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,067
I'm just tired.

868
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:41,488
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

869
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:57,713
<i>I was going to come give you</i>
<i>this big speech about how we've been...</i>

870
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,716
<i>friends for a long time and built up trust,</i>
<i>that whole thing.</i>

871
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,259
<i>But how about this instead?</i>

872
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:06,513
<i>If you ditch work this afternoon and promise</i>
<i>to do the few small things I ask you...</i>

873
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,391
<i>I will in return show you</i>
<i>the most important thing...</i>

874
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:12,060
<i>that any living organism has ever witnessed.</i>

875
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:17,733
<i>At this point</i>
<i>there would have been some discussion.</i>

876
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:23,322
<i>Abe would, of course, want to know how.</i>

877
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:28,744
<i>Aaron would have to explain</i>
<i>all about the storage manifest...</i>

878
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:32,289
<i>and how it showed two rooms</i>
<i>under the name Abram Terger.</i>

879
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:35,792
<i>Then Abe would need to know how.</i>

880
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,421
<i>Aaron would explain</i>
<i>that when he went up there...</i>

881
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,381
<i>and found the Failsafe running...</i>

882
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:43,550
<i>he knew exactly what it was.</i>

883
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,054
<i>But Abe would ask how.</i>

884
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,766
<i>And then the bit</i>
<i>about the modular design of the coffins...</i>

885
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:54,603
<i>and how it meant he could fold one up</i>
<i>and take it back inside another.</i>

886
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,272
<i>They are not one-time use only.</i>

887
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,900
<i>They are recyclable, Aaron would say.</i>

888
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,449
<i>How, Abe would ask.</i>

889
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,580
<i>And Aaron would describe</i>
<i>how simple things become...</i>

890
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:17,960
<i>when you know precisely</i>
<i>what someone will have for breakfast...</i>

891
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:20,295
<i>even in a world of tamper-proof lids.</i>

892
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:43,902
<i>How?</i>

893
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:47,823
<i>And that's where</i>
<i>I would have entered the story.</i>

894
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,367
<i>Or exited, depending on your reference.</i>

895
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:56,331
<i>Because when Aaron came back</i>
<i>the second time, it wasn't so easy.</i>

896
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:01,128
<i>He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.</i>

897
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:04,381
<i>And by that time,</i>
<i>he was too exhausted to take me.</i>

898
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,594
<i>But for reasons</i>
<i>that are only evident to me now...</i>

899
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:11,263
<i>I understood that he simply wanted it more.</i>

900
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:14,808
<i>That he just had more invested. So I left.</i>

901
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:18,729
<i>He had already performed the task,</i>
<i>as I had intended to...</i>

902
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:22,274
<i>of recording the conversations of the day</i>
<i>just in case.</i>

903
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:25,486
<i>Through that earpiece</i>
<i>he had a three-second lead on the world.</i>

904
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:28,447
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

905
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,742
I can't. I've got a schedule.

906
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:36,955
<i>He had but to speak aloud the words</i>
<i>that came into his head...</i>

907
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,416
<i>and those around him would fall in line.</i>

908
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:01,438
<i>This is Track 3.</i>

909
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:04,942
<i>Abe is bringing my car around</i>
<i>and I am on my way to the court.</i>

910
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:06,235
<i>I'll see Will there.</i>

911
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,364
<i>I'll invite him to the party and make sure</i>
<i>he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.</i>

912
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:12,157
<i>Will.</i>

913
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,410
<i>You pretentious prick.</i>

914
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:17,788
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

915
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:20,499
<i>- No, it's a radio, man.</i>
<i>- You look like Secret Service.</i>

916
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,961
- You look like Secret Service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

917
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:26,463
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

918
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,006
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

919
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,842
<i>Nice shot, Aaron.</i>

920
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:34,137
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

921
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,390
<i>We could have used that</i>
<i>last week against TI.</i>

922
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:39,726
<i>At least you've got your golf game.</i>
<i>I see you've been practicing.</i>

923
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:43,522
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

924
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:45,566
<i>What are you doing tonight?</i>

925
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:48,777
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

926
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:50,154
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

927
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,739
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

928
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:56,827
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

929
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:59,079
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

930
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,431
I don't think I'm doing this.

931
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,434
Why not?

932
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:24,938
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

933
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:26,940
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

934
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,943
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else...

935
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:32,321
or better yet,
not even talk to her about the party.

936
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:35,449
That's good fortonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

937
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:38,535
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

938
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,206
This guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun.

939
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,791
What do you think he'll do
if he ever finds her alone?

940
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:48,337
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

941
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,632
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

942
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:54,468
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

943
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,470
Now come on, it has to be you.

944
01:08:56,553 --> 01:09:00,015
She said she was there
because you told her you would be there.

945
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:08,398
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

946
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,112
He doesn't fire?

947
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,282
- No. He didn't fire.
- He never fires?

948
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,701
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

949
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:22,579
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.

950
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:25,290
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

951
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:27,793
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

952
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,461
Okay? We're prescient.

953
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:37,886
We can still be careful.

954
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,722
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

955
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:42,391
We definitely can.

956
01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:46,019
He leaves it in the truck
before he goes in. We don't even need to...

957
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:49,690
- but if it makes you feel better--
- What's wrong with our hands?

958
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:53,360
What do you mean?

959
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:55,737
Why can't we write like normal people?

960
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:00,701
I don't know. I can see the letters.

961
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:07,624
I know what they should look like.
I just can't get my hand to make them easily.

962
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,545
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.

963
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:33,609
Guess what today is.

964
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:38,572
No, no. It's your friend Robert's birthday.

965
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,784
He says he likes records,
so I got him The Best of Bread.

966
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,661
No, real records, like vinyl.

967
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:49,291
<i>I can tell you with certainty</i>
<i>what I did that night when it was my turn.</i>

968
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:54,254
<i>But I think it would do little good,</i>
<i>because what the world remembers...</i>

969
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:58,050
<i>the actuality,</i>
<i>the last revision is what counts, apparently.</i>

970
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,595
<i>So how many times did it take Aaron...</i>

971
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,264
<i>as he cycled</i>
<i>through the same conversations...</i>

972
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:06,809
<i>lip-synching trivia over and over?</i>

973
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:10,562
<i>How many times would it take</i>
<i>before he got it right?</i>

974
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:12,523
<i>Three? Four?</i>

975
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:14,858
<i>Twenty?</i>

976
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:19,321
<i>I've decided to believe</i>
<i>that only one more would have done it.</i>

977
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:22,449
<i>I can almost sleep at night</i>
<i>if there is only one more.</i>

978
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:27,496
<i>Slowly and methodically,</i>
<i>he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.</i>

979
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,292
<i>He took from his surroundings</i>
<i>what was needed...</i>

980
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:34,586
<i>and made of it something more.</i>

981
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:50,352
<i>And once the details had been</i>
<i>successfully navigated...</i>

982
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:53,730
<i>there would be nothing left to do</i>
<i>but wait for the conflict.</i>

983
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,280
<i>Maybe the obligatory</i>
<i>last-minute moral debate...</i>

984
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:04,158
<i>until the noise of the room</i>
<i>escalates into panic...</i>

985
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:07,452
<i>and background screams</i>
<i>as the gunman walks in.</i>

986
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:12,708
<i>And eventually he must have got it perfect</i>
<i>and it must have been beautiful...</i>

987
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:15,544
<i>with all the praise and adoration</i>
<i>he had coming.</i>

988
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:18,172
<i>He had probably saved lives, after all.</i>

989
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:23,218
<i>Who knows what would have happened</i>
<i>if he hadn't been there?</i>

990
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:40,611
I know that things are bad, okay?

991
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:45,282
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

992
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,034
I know that you're upset.

993
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:50,787
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

994
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:54,249
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.

995
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,252
Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

996
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:59,379
Aaron, we don't have the money back here...

997
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:01,340
and we'd have to steal our own passports.

998
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,342
Money? We'll make money.

999
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,761
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March Madness.

1000
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:08,806
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1001
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,975
Passports. You know
they're not using theirs, anyways.

1002
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,895
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.

1003
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:17,439
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1004
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:19,191
I'm staying here.

1005
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,193
Why?

1006
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,914
They'll be building their own boxes
in another day.

1007
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:36,250
And yours already knows what they've built.

1008
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,503
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1009
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:42,756
<i>The box Abe is building won't work.</i>

1010
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,008
<i>He's got it wired wrong.</i>

1011
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:47,261
<i>And if they fix that...</i>

1012
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,305
<i>I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.</i>
<i>It's just a gimmick.</i>

1013
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,598
<i>It doesn't work anymore.</i>

1014
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:54,476
<i>Your double will say</i>
<i>they have to move on to something else.</i>

1015
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:56,520
And mine will agree. They're friends.

1016
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:58,438
You're staying? Why?

1017
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,607
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?

1018
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:03,735
What possible reason could there be
to be here?

1019
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:09,658
I guess that
it just won't go back far enough, will it?

1020
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:14,746
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

1021
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:19,001
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it.

1022
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,962
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

1023
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:25,007
There hasn't been a reason
to show you what I'm capable of...

1024
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,426
but I'm telling this you now. Go out there.

1025
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:31,013
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.

1026
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:32,848
But don't come back here...

1027
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:34,892
and don't come near them.

1028
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:37,144
Any of them.

1029
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,579
<i>Now I have repaid any debt</i>
<i>I may have owed you.</i>

1030
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,915
<i>You know all that I know.</i>

1031
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,835
<i>My voice is the only proof</i>
<i>that you will have of the truth of any of this.</i>

1032
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:04,630
<i>I might have written a letter</i>
<i>with my signature...</i>

1033
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,257
<i>but my handwriting</i>
<i>is not what it used to be.</i>

1034
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,513
<i>Maybe you've had the presence of mind</i>
<i>to record this.</i>

1035
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:14,139
<i>That's your prerogative.</i>

1036
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,225
<i>You will not be contacted by me again.</i>

1037
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,559
Good morning.

1038
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:21,396
Every half-meter.

1039
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:24,608
Everywhere.

1040
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:29,112
<i>And if you look, you will not find me.</i>
