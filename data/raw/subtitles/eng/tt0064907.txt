1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,976
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,183
- [Francisco] Save you all.

3
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,254
My name is Francisco Pizarro.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,959
I'm a bastard and
a soldier of Spain.

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,165
Once the world could have
had me for a petty farm,

6
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,334
two rocky fields and
a Senor to my name.

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,006
But the world said no.

8
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,643
Said no and said no.

9
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:22,482
Well now the world is
going to remember me.

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,653
(dramatic music)

11
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,535
- It is quite plain
your majesty that

12
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,106
the petitioner Francisco Pizarro

13
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,874
has suffered great hardships in

14
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,577
his search for this
kingdom of gold.

15
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:56,015
It is also evident that he
is a man of great endurance.

16
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,584
On his first voyage he took with

17
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,221
him 60 men and returned with 34.

18
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,989
On his second
voyage he took with

19
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,960
him 80 men and returned with 12.

20
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,796
All very admirable
no doubt but how many

21
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,499
such voyages can Spain afford?

22
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,168
How much more Spanish
blood must be wasted

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,005
in this quest for a land that
no one knows really exists?

24
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,673
What books have you
read that make mention

25
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,076
of this kingdom of
gold, name them.

26
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:29,315
- Your majesty I
cannot read or write.

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,352
But I say it's there.

28
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,291
- You petition from the
Crown exclusive rights

29
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,161
to explore and
Governor as Viceroy

30
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,229
all territory south of Mexico.

31
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,200
An explorer is not
simply a vagabond.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,135
An explorer makes discoveries.

33
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,237
What in your time have
you ever discovered?

34
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,878
These golden trinkets but
have been cast in Seville.

35
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,714
These maps you have
drawn can be bought

36
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,983
by the dozen in
any street bazaar.

37
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,886
And this Indian savage.

38
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,122
- Jesus Christ is
my lord and savior.

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,859
- Is already converted.

40
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,629
(muted laughter)

41
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,667
You have been a good soldier.

42
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,937
The Crown remembers
its faithful.

43
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,006
Why not forget these
grandiose schemes

44
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,443
and return to Trujillo where
you can live in comfort?

45
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,378
You will be granted
a modest pension.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,382
- All my life fighting for Spain

47
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,885
and the cross is
this how it ends?

48
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,526
- There are other
petitioners awaiting

49
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,094
an audience Your Majesty.

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:54,167
- Your Majesty your
Vedor questions

51
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,004
why so many men died
on my past voyages

52
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,108
and yet I always survived
well that's no accident.

53
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,578
Not in a land where
by day the sun

54
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,280
boils the marrow in your bones

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,316
and by night freezes the
water in your kidneys.

56
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:17,357
When the food runs out you've
had alligators for crawfish,

57
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,826
jaguars for the price of snakes.

58
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,999
At nights vampire bats can
suck out your lifeblood.

59
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,502
But Your Majesty beyond
these gates of Hell

60
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:35,642
lies the kingdom of gold,
of gold Your Majesty.

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,113
Who would you trust to make
a journey through Hell?

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,684
A scholar, a saint, or
a soldier who has fought

63
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,454
with death from
Africa to the Indies?

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,425
- Your capacity for
survival is not in question.

65
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,994
But you are a dreamer.

66
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,697
If you would
accomplish something

67
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,366
my loyal subject you
must be something.

68
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:12,178
- Your Majesty your court
is filled with cold precise

69
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,015
perfect men, they're
all something.

70
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,685
But they dare not dream for fear

71
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,955
of making a mistake
so they do nothing.

72
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:31,064
Your Majesty is how long can
Spain endure doing nothing?

73
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,137
- Make note the petitioner
Francisco Pizarro is granted

74
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,808
providing he finds his own means
to finance this expedition.

75
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,845
The Crown will retain one
fifth of all he discovers

76
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,381
but will give him no
ships, no men, no money.

77
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:56,255
Amendment, Crown does grant
the services of two priests

78
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,358
to bring the mercy
of Jesus Christ

79
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,661
and the words of his holy
gospel to all creatures

80
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,996
whom the petitioner encounters.

81
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,702
(dramatic music)

82
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,484
- General!

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,719
General!

84
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,055
General?

85
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,160
I would like to
be your page sir.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,562
I know Latin sir, 300 words.

87
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,631
And I can write 600
words in Spanish.

88
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,967
- A soldier doesn't
need any of that boy.

89
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,036
- Well I can keep your
charts for you sir.

90
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,705
- What's your name boy?

91
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,906
- Martin sir.

92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,710
(church bell ringing)

93
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,457
(men chanting)

94
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,359
(dramatic music)

95
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,764
- You are the huntsman of God.

96
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,600
The weapons you draw are sacred.

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,070
Oh God show us our
way to beat the savage

98
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,908
out of these dark forests onto
the broad plain of thy grace.

99
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,878
- You will bring to all tribes
the nourishment of pity...

100
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,281
- [Francisco] Took me a
year to raise this Army.

101
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,653
Gentlemen, cutthroats,
mercenaries, and priests.

102
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,156
- Don't think we go
merely to destroy--

103
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,993
- [Francisco] And for all my
promises my promises of gold,

104
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,697
couldn't have done it
without the Cavalier,

105
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,700
my friend the Cavalier do Soto.

106
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,470
- He who helps me lift
this dark man into light

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,707
I absolve of all crime
he ever committed.

108
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,910
Go then and be blessed.

109
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,650
(speaking in foreign language)

110
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,092
- You had word of my coming.

111
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,594
You should not have allowed
anyone to be blessed before me.

112
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,663
- Your pardon Vedor.

113
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,900
I do not understand matters
of before and after.

114
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,902
- That is evident.

115
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,571
General on this expedition
my name is the law.

116
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,740
It is spoken with
the kings authority.

117
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,711
- Your pardon Vedor on this
expedition my name is the law.

118
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,646
They'll be no other.

119
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,047
- [Vedor] In matters military.

120
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,448
- [Francisco] In all matters.

121
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,653
- Pizarro in the name of
Spain our holy country

122
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,423
I appoint you a second
in command to me

123
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,062
subject only to me, adelante.

124
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,797
- Yes General.

125
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,466
- You will do well not
to incur my disfavor.

126
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,603
In the eyes of the Crown
you are still an adventurer.

127
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,641
- Take up your banners.

128
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,610
(trumpet music)

129
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,978
March!

130
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,049
(trumpet music)

131
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:20,086
(dramatic music)

132
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:06,385
(speaking in foreign language)

133
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,899
(dramatic music)

134
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,543
- Hey you brownie.

135
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,881
- Gently, you'll get
nothing from him in terror.

136
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,949
- Well let's see?

137
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,417
- [Hernando] Put up your knife.

138
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,787
Talk to him.

139
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,490
- We want gold.

140
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,895
(speaking in foreign language)

141
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,435
- He has no gold all was taken
by the great king in his war.

142
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,036
- What king?

143
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,307
(speaking in foreign language)

144
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:40,346
- Holy Atahuallpa Inca over
Earth and sky his kingdom is.

145
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,481
- Who's this king,
who did he fight?

146
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:47,419
(speaking in foreign language)

147
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,854
- Holy Atahuallpa.

148
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,591
His father the great
Inca Wyna grew two sons

149
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:57,429
Vasca buy a wife,
Atahuallpa by not wife.

150
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,932
At his death he cut the kingdom

151
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,035
in two for them but
Atahuallpa wanted all.

152
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,038
So he made war and
captured his brother.

153
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,174
Now he is Lord of Earth and Sky.

154
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,414
- And he is the bastard?

155
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,150
Answer.

156
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,854
Atahuallpa is the bastard?

157
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,290
(speaking in foreign language)

158
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,692
- He is the son of the sun.

159
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,061
He needs no wedded mother.

160
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,629
He is god.

161
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,765
- God?

162
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,000
- God.

163
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,903
- Oh my brothers
where have we come?

164
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,973
This is the land of Antichrist.

165
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,876
We must, the cross will
save you, stay him.

166
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:50,015
Repeat Jesus Christ Inca.

167
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,753
- Jesus Christ Inca.

168
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,156
- Jesus the Christ Inca.

169
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,864
- He's a god alright, they're
scared to hell of him.

170
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,667
And a bastard too.

171
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,771
That's civil war,
bastards against bastards.

172
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,373
- We have a surprise for him.

173
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,908
- You hear that Inca god?

174
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,178
You're not gonna like
that because we've

175
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,747
got a God worth 1000 of yours,

176
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,720
a gentle God with
gentle priests,

177
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:32,958
and a couple of great big canons
to blow you out of the sky.

178
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,294
(laughing)

179
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,041
(speaking in foreign language)

180
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,417
(dramatic music)

181
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:07,659
(calm music)

182
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,439
- Listen to them.

183
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,041
There's the world.

184
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,611
Eagle rips the condor,
that condor rips the crow.

185
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,181
Crow would blind all
the eagles in the sky

186
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,216
at once if he had
the beak to do it.

187
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,719
(bird cawing)

188
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,491
(groaning in pain)

189
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,028
A wound from long ago.

190
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,598
A knife to the bone a savage
put it in to me for life.

191
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,837
It troubles me at times boy.

192
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,812
You'll stop before me with your
wounds and your killing too.

193
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,213
I wonder how you'll like that.

194
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,147
- You watch me sir.

195
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:02,981
- I will.

196
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,819
It's a soldiers job
to deal in death.

197
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,854
All your study will
be how to kill them,

198
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,956
what scratches kill
and what to cut.

199
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,427
- But surely sir there's
more to soldiering than that.

200
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,165
- You mean honor, glory,
tradition to the service?

201
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,500
- Yes sir.

202
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,069
- Listen boy know something.

203
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,639
Men cannot just stand
as men in this world

204
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,975
it's too big for them
they grow scared.

205
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,847
They build themselves shelters
called army, church, court.

206
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,316
They're not real boy
they're not true Martin.

207
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,017
Do you see that?

208
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,087
- No sir not truthfully sir.

209
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,355
- No sir?

210
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,890
Not truthfully sir?

211
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,126
Why must you be so young?

212
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,996
Army loyalty is blasphemy.

213
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,467
The world of soldiers is a
yard of ungrowable children.

214
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,402
They wear ribbons.

215
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,339
They make up ceremonies just to

216
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,608
keep up the rest of the world.

217
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,076
They count up the
number of the blue dead

218
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,845
and the green dead and
they call that the history.

219
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,185
Boy.

220
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,293
That's just the flower the
bandit carves on his knife

221
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,396
before he plunges
it into your side.

222
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:32,304
Martin I've had a life of it.

223
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,873
I tell you.

224
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,846
It's nothing but a
game played by brutes

225
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,282
to give themselves a reason.

226
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,617
(bird caws)

227
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,322
Help me up will you?

228
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,362
- [Martin] Is it better sir?

229
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,201
- It's gone now, it's gone.

230
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,274
(coyote barking)

231
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,346
(dramatic music)

232
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,395
(speaking in foreign language)

233
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,766
- I speak for Atahuallpa Inca,

234
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,038
Lord of the four quarters,
King of the Earth and sky.

235
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,740
- I will speak with him.

236
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,843
A king's man must always
greet a king's man.

237
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,480
We bring greetings
from King Carlos

238
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,116
Emperor of Spain and Austria.

239
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,820
We bring blessings from
Jesus Christ son of God.

240
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,789
- We are sent from
the son of god.

241
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,993
He orders you to visit him.

242
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,833
- Where is your king?

243
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,501
- He rests.

244
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,404
A great army rests with him.

245
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,540
It is not wise to
raise his anger.

246
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,809
- I said I came to
give him blessing.

247
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,712
How can that raise his anger?

248
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,981
- Why will you bless him?

249
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:27,119
- He is a god, I am a god.

250
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,687
- General.

251
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,456
- Be silent Father.

252
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,663
Where is your king?

253
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,464
(speaking in foreign language)

254
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,067
- Behind the great mountains.

255
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,337
- Must we march
before we find him?

256
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,173
- One life of Mother Moon.

257
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,743
- A month, for us two weeks.

258
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,813
(dramatic music)

259
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,990
- The way is clear.

260
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,895
Let's have church
on the last day.

261
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:15,434
(dramatic music)

262
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:35,454
(suspenseful music)

263
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,130
- On your feet soldiers.

264
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,902
Boy play your drum.

265
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,807
The church will precede us.

266
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,243
Father.

267
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,446
(drum beating)

268
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,452
(suspenseful music)

269
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,031
- Here you.

270
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,300
One shiver dooms the lot of us.

271
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,137
One yelp of fright you'll
never be heard of again.

272
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,576
We'll serve you like cattle
pressed with a knife.

273
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,313
Come on you cattle crash.

274
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,384
(indistinct dialogue)

275
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,225
(horse neighs loudly)

276
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,862
(suspenseful music)

277
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,906
(calm music)

278
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,948
- Give the order General.

279
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,018
- I know his orders, adelante.

280
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,153
- We came for gold Vedor.

281
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,023
I promised you this kingdom.

282
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,192
Here it is.

283
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,530
Didn't promise you life
or everlasting happiness.

284
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,232
So adelante.

285
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:39,271
(calm music)

286
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:47,339
- I bring greeting from
Atahuallpa Inca, Lord of the
Four Quarters.

287
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,175
- King of the Earth and sky.

288
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:55,814
Atahuallpa god makes
this space empty

289
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,551
for reason his people
do not like strangers.

290
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,320
You must not go from here.

291
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,223
Outside it is great anger.

292
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,561
This day and night god fasts.

293
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:14,566
Tomorrow he will come with his
soldiers here to look on you.

294
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,235
- [Francisco] How many
soldiers will he bring?

295
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,238
- It is not for you to question.

296
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,640
- My captain would like to know

297
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,009
so that he may
prepare his welcome.

298
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,711
- Your captain gave
word he is a god.

299
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,481
A god has no fear.

300
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,563
- The army's encamped
about two miles away.

301
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,166
- There's nothing between
the town and their camp.

302
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,401
Let's pay our respects.

303
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:54,005
- No we wait here
inside these walls.

304
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,074
- No it's a trick
a brownie trick.

305
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,642
He's got us all
marked for death.

306
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,345
- It's the divine hand
of providence Vedor.

307
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,881
- In what way General
explain yourself.

308
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:08,086
- One entrance, one
exit perfect ambush.

309
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,521
- It's madness.

310
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,958
- We're not fighting
10,000, one man.

311
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,762
Get him the rest collapse.

312
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,431
- Even if we can they will kill

313
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,399
every one of us to get him back.

314
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,001
- With a knife at his throat?

315
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,472
What do worshipers do
when you snatch their god?

316
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,975
- Pray to you instead.

317
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,279
- Then pray all.

318
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,986
Disperse, confess them father's,
battle orders first light.

319
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,127
- Brace up boy.

320
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,663
It's what you came for isn't it?

321
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,331
Death and glory.

322
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:54,699
- Yes sir.

323
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,204
- The devil is strong in me.

324
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,207
I believe nothing or
I believe too much.

325
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,177
- I have denied God and
placed my faith in my king.

326
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,982
Oh Lord give me the courage
to reconcile the two.

327
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,120
- If I should die tomorrow
then let it be remembered

328
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,589
that I seek nothing for myself.

329
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,657
I want nothing for myself.

330
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,660
If I must take
the life of others

331
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,831
then let that spring from
the corruption of my flesh.

332
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,468
But oh God keep my soul pure.

333
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,072
(calm music)

334
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,251
- General.

335
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,062
When we met the Inca
priests on the mountains

336
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,198
you told them you were a god.

337
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,066
Why did you say that?

338
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,036
- I sent him news to amaze him.

339
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,771
- I cannot condone blasphemy.

340
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,808
- To conquer for
Christ one can surely

341
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,377
usurp his name for
a night Father.

342
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,112
- No not even for that.

343
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,449
- Then I will recant
at my next confession.

344
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,420
- I'll remind you.

345
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,703
- Where does the
sun rest at night?

346
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:50,415
- Nowhere it's a heavenly
body set by god to

347
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,051
move around the world
in perpetual motion.

348
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,787
- Do you know this?

349
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,356
- All of Europe knows it.

350
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,959
- What if they were wrong?

351
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,762
What if it settled
here each evening

352
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,497
in these great mountains?

353
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,635
A god laid down to sleep.

354
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,075
- To a savage it
must make a fine god.

355
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,344
How fantastic that
anyone on Earth

356
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,747
should dare to say it's
my father up there.

357
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,084
My father the sun.

358
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:33,358
(calm music)

359
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:59,150
(suspenseful music)

360
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,831
(dramatic music)

361
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,703
- They're coming!

362
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,006
They're coming.

363
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,109
They're coming.

364
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,780
They're coming sir.

365
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,650
- Out of sight boy.

366
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,453
- Until the fighting sir?

367
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,023
- No all the time for you.

368
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,959
- Oh no sir.

369
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,561
- Do as he says.

370
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:34,712
(calm music)

371
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:02,507
(grandiose music)

372
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:52,717
(speaking in foreign language)

373
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,153
- Where is the god?

374
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,021
- I am a priest of God.

375
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,058
(speaking in foreign language)

376
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,731
- He doesn't want the
priest he wants the god.

377
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,400
- Our God cannot be seen.

378
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,470
(speaking in foreign language)

379
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,305
- [Translator] I may see him.

380
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,975
- No he was killed by man
and went into the sky.

381
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,677
I am the answer
to all mysteries.

382
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,146
Hark pagan while I expand.

383
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,483
First God created
heaven and Earth

384
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,452
which the better punished
with eternal suffering.

385
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,589
And the good rewarded
with life hereafter.

386
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,193
And this God created
man from dust

387
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,130
and gave him a spiritual life
which we called the soul.

388
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:44,602
No man is free from sin except
our savior Jesus Christ.

389
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,473
He was killed and
crucified on a wooden cross

390
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,342
like the one you see here.

391
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,478
Now Jesus Christ
by his own virtue

392
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,815
rose from the dead
and 40 days later

393
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,051
ascended into
Heaven where he sits

394
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,486
at the right hand of the Father.

395
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,057
He wished that his
apostle Saint Peter

396
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,558
be the prince of all is apostles

397
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,895
and the successor as well
as all other Christians.

398
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,366
And that the Roman pontiffs as
we Christians call the Pope's

399
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:20,171
have the same power given
to Saint Peter by God.

400
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,242
The Roman pontiff who
now lives on Earth

401
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,778
understands that the people
and nations of this kingdom

402
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,214
ignore our creator
their true God

403
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:34,418
and blindly worship idols and
images in the shape of demons.

404
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,888
Therefore he has commanded
our King Carlos V

405
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,459
to bring all men to
belief in the true God.

406
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,263
In Christ's name I charge you

407
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,565
declare yourself
his willing vessel.

408
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,170
(speaking in foreign language)

409
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,839
- By what power do you speak?

410
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,475
- By this the word of God.

411
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,246
- God.

412
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,783
God.

413
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,119
- God?

414
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,356
(yells in foreign language)

415
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,726
(dramatic music)

416
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,434
Francisco Pizzaro!

417
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,504
- Why do you stay your hand
when Christ is insulted?

418
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,940
Let this Satan feel
the power of your arm.

419
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,076
I absolve you all, Santiago.

420
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:44,715
(dramatic music)
(cannons and guns firing)

421
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,708
(upbeat music)

422
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:19,450
(singing in foreign language)

423
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,637
- Enough, enough.

424
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,179
Enough, enough, enough.

425
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,691
(singing in foreign language)

426
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:37,121
(dramatic music)

427
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:55,372
- I am Francisco Pizarro
General of Spain.

428
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,109
It's my honor to speak to you.

429
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,851
Would you not speak to me?

430
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:20,965
- I am Atahuallpa
Kabak, son of the sun,

431
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:30,407
Son of the moon, Lord
of the four quarters.

432
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,744
Why you not kneel?

433
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,281
- Milord I kneel
only to my king.

434
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,461
- Why you come here?

435
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,431
- For God and King.

436
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,735
Spain has many things your
country doesn't possess.

437
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:03,040
- You wanted gold that's
why you came here.

438
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,176
- You have gold?

439
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:13,717
- It is the sweat of the sun.

440
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,524
It belongs to me.

441
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,928
- How much gold do you have?

442
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,738
- Make me free.

443
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,783
I will fill this room.

444
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,284
- [Hernando] It's not possible.

445
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,887
(babbling)

446
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,588
- How long?

447
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:58,796
- Two strikes of my Mother Moon.

448
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,734
(speaking in foreign language)

449
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,170
- [Francisco] No,
you say no, why not?

450
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,941
- You must swear to free me
and you have no swear to give.

451
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,343
- You're wrong my Lord.

452
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,147
- No it's in your face.

453
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,552
No swear.

454
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,189
- I never broke my word.

455
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,557
I never promised you safety.

456
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,226
If I had you'd have it.

457
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,928
- Francisco.

458
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,937
Refuse sir, you
could never free him.

459
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,971
- It'll never come to that.

460
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:41,672
- It could.

461
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,640
- Never do you realize how
much gold that would take?

462
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,209
Even half would
drown us in riches.

463
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,945
- So at your age
gold is no lodestone?

464
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,713
- I promised my men gold yes?

465
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,181
He stands between
them and that gold.

466
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,716
If I don't make this
bargain he'll die.

467
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:53,751
The men will demand it.

468
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,886
- And what's it to
you if he does die?

469
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,187
- I want him alive.

470
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,957
There's a meaning for
meeting this man god.

471
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,658
- General be careful.

472
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,128
I don't understand you in
full but I do know this.

473
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,196
What you do now
cannot be undone.

474
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,266
- Words my Cavalier,
words that don't touch me.

475
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,268
This way the men will have their
gold and I'll have him safe

476
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,770
that's enough for the present.

477
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:19,743
Now my Lord let us
know what we say.

478
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,646
You must strive
to keep the peace.

479
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,448
You must not escape.

480
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,251
You must not urge
your men to help you.

481
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,454
So swear.

482
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,626
(speaking in foreign language)

483
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,899
- I swear.

484
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,136
- Then I swear too.

485
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,606
You fill this room with
gold I set you free.

486
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,212
(speaking in foreign language)

487
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,349
- I think this man
performs what he swears.

488
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,652
Pray God we don't
pay bitterly for it.

489
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,724
(speaking in foreign language)

490
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:46,163
(inspirational music)

491
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,094
- But this is the truth my Lord.

492
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,263
This land belongs to Spain.

493
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,201
Well a few years ago
a great call arose

494
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:02,472
between the king of Spain
and the king of Portugal.

495
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,943
Well Spain claimed this land
because of Christopher Columbus

496
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,779
Portugal because
of Vasco da Gama.

497
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:13,250
His Holiness the
Pope acted as judge

498
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,886
and he gave this land to Spain.

499
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,858
- Who?

500
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,327
- Pope.

501
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,594
- He's mad.

502
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:30,033
He gives away
country are not his.

503
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,508
- [Francisco] I find you
wanting in honesty my Lord.

504
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,980
A month is past your
rooms not quarter full.

505
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,684
- [Atahuallpa] My
kingdom is great.

506
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,254
Porters are slow.

507
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,360
You will see more
gold before long.

508
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,065
- The rumor is I shall
see a rising before long.

509
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:06,303
- If you not trust
me send to Cusco.

510
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:10,374
See how quiet my people sit.

511
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,111
- You leave immediately
with 20 men.

512
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,679
- I will General.

513
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:22,853
- God is tied by
his word like you.

514
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:27,257
But if he raised one
nigh of one finger

515
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:31,928
of one hand you would all die.

516
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,932
- If you declare us false
both these will die before us.

517
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:42,773
- They are my priests,
these can die.

518
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,343
- Mother of God
there's no confession
possible for this man.

519
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,178
- You cannot say that
for certain Father.

520
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,947
- Satan has many forms
and there sits one.

521
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,952
Tell me I'm only
a simple priest.

522
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,056
As an undoubted god you'll
live forever here on Earth.

523
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:04,027
- Here on Earth where god's
come one after another

524
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,665
young and young again to
protect the people of the sun.

525
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:14,171
Then they go up to his great
place in the sky at his will.

526
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,839
- What if they are
killed in battle?

527
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,410
- If it is not the sun's
time for them to go.

528
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,913
He will bring them
back to life again

529
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,082
at the next day's light.

530
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,718
- How comforting and has
any Inca so returned?

531
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:29,920
- [Priest] No.

532
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,787
- Curious.

533
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:36,860
- This means only that all gods
have died in the sun's time.

534
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,161
- [Estete] Clever.

535
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,130
- No true.

536
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,100
- Tell me how can
the sun have a child?

537
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,302
- How could your
God have a child

538
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,737
since you say he has no body?

539
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,573
- He is a spirit inside us.

540
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:53,176
- Your God is inside
you how can this be?

541
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,845
- Well they eat him.

542
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:01,585
First he become biscuit
and then they eat him.

543
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,922
- We have seen this
at praying you say

544
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,925
this is the body of our God.

545
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:15,365
- And then they drink
his blood, is very bad.

546
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:21,872
Here in my empire
we not eat man.

547
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,008
- You are being
deliberately stupid.

548
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,983
Beware Pizarro give him the
slack he will destroy us all.

549
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,461
- Father has great zeal.

550
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:50,433
- Yeah great zeal to see the
devil in the poor dark man.

551
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,737
- Not so poor General.

552
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,307
The man who is the
soul of his kingdom.

553
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,979
Look hard you'll
find Satan here.

554
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,552
Because here's a country which
denies the right to hunger.

555
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,320
- You call hunger a right.

556
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,957
- Course, gives life meaning.

557
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,227
Look around you.

558
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,765
Happiness has no
feel for men here

559
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,900
since they are
forbidden unhappiness.

560
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:24,868
They have everything in common

561
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,436
so there's nothing
to give each other,

562
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,805
a pass of the seasons no more.

563
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:33,476
As indistinguishable as mules,
as predictable as trees.

564
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:41,284
All men are born unequal and
want is their birthright.

565
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,056
Atahuallpa I will not rest until

566
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,158
I have brought you
to the true God.

567
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,296
- No it's not the truth.

568
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:00,403
Where is he?

569
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:05,342
(operatic singing)

570
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:13,483
Where is my father sun?

571
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:21,191
You see now only by his wish.

572
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,595
(operatic singing)

573
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,502
Looking to him.

574
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,976
He will darken
your eyes forever.

575
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:50,287
Do not speak to me
again of your God.

576
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:56,126
He is nowhere.

577
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:07,771
- Milord you shouldn't
anger our holy men.

578
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,274
You promised me you wouldn't.

579
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,644
- They are fools.

580
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,981
- No they're not fools.

581
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,117
- You believe with them?

582
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,859
Look into me.

583
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,470
You do not believe with them.

584
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,906
- You shouldn't say that to me.

585
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,810
- You do not believe with them.

586
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:54,784
Their God is not in your face.

587
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:07,097
(singing in foreign language)

588
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:27,050
How was the song for you?

589
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,219
- Robber birds?

590
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,721
- Yes.

591
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,593
- You're a robber bird yourself.

592
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:40,330
- Yes, no...
Explain.

593
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,166
- You killed your brother
to get the throne.

594
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,204
- He was a fool.

595
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:53,743
Atahuallpa was a man
Vasca was a child.

596
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,981
- He was the rightful king.

597
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,751
- I was the rightful god.

598
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,221
My sky father shouted raise up.

599
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,792
Your brother is fixed
only to tend herds.

600
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:13,430
You were born to tend my people.

601
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:22,639
So I killed him and land smile.

602
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:31,181
- That was my work long
ago, tending herds.

603
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:37,020
- Was not your work,
you are warrior.

604
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,789
It's in your face.

605
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,692
- You see much in my face.

606
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,762
- I see

607
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,800
my father.

608
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:55,872
- You do me great honor.

609
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,712
- No speak the truth.

610
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:09,285
If in your home your
brother was king

611
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:18,294
and only fit for herds you
would attack his crown.

612
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,762
- [Francisco] If I could.

613
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,298
- And then you would kill him.

614
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,034
- Let me put to
you another case.

615
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:30,907
I come to a country
I seize the crown

616
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:34,944
but for fear of an
uprising I cannot

617
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:40,683
keep the crown unless
I kill the king.

618
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,786
What do I do?

619
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:49,559
It's only a game we
play milord only a game.

620
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,663
Did you hate your brother?

621
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,835
- He was ugly.

622
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,641
Putayama was his mother.

623
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,179
My mother was beautiful.

624
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,350
- I didn't know my mother.

625
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:20,823
She wasn't married to my father.

626
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,994
- You are not then...

627
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,996
- Legitimate?

628
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:34,337
No milord no more than you.

629
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,273
- So.

630
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,374
- So.

631
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:45,281
- To be born so is the
sign of a great man.

632
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,684
(laughing)

633
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,753
- I think it is.

634
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,256
(calm music)

635
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:21,818
- Only most important
man wearing this.

636
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:28,257
You must kneel to me.

637
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,679
- I've never been so
distinguished to myself.

638
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,549
(babbling)

639
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,744
(grunting)

640
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,590
- Now you dance.

641
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,993
(laughing)

642
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,865
- Over there.

643
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,935
(calm music)

644
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,215
- Welcome back sir.

645
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:36,619
- Cavalier, Vedor, Candia
I'm glad to see you.

646
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,421
- [Cavalier] What's it
like is there trouble?

647
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,490
- Very quiet and terrible.

648
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,692
They're just standing in the
fields for hundreds of miles

649
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,194
waiting their god to come back.

650
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,163
- If he does they'll
become fighters again.

651
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,798
Then it's us for the line pit.

652
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,334
- How is the General?

653
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,102
- An altered man.

654
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,037
No one's ever seen him so easy.

655
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,707
He spends hours each
day with the Inca.

656
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,144
It seems they have more in
common than their lowly birth.

657
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,311
- The General's going to find it

658
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,280
difficult when he has to do it.

659
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,081
- Do what?

660
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,384
- When he has to kill him.

661
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,487
- He can't do that
not after a contract

662
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,688
witnessed before the whole army.

663
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,891
- You call this rabble an army?

664
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,793
Most of them
volunteered simply to be

665
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,562
absolved of their
previous crimes.

666
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,597
- The General made his
pact with the Inca.

667
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,467
- Well we can't let him
go that's for certain.

668
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,902
- He gave his word.

669
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,805
- Yes Cavalier when a Christian
swears with a Christian--

670
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,774
- Christianity isn't
the issue, it's trust.

671
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,679
- What's Cusco like?

672
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,150
- Nothing but women,
children, and old men.

673
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,485
- The gold room is full.

674
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,122
- The gold room is full!

675
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,257
The gold room is full!

676
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,527
(all shouting at once)

677
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,996
- Where do you
think you're going?

678
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,665
You know the orders.

679
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,400
Nothing till share out.

680
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,303
Penalty for breech
death, now disperse.

681
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,072
- Get back to your stations.

682
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,124
Keep a sharp lookout the
danger isn't over yet.

683
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,327
- I'd say it had
only just begun.

684
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,734
- General how's your journey?

685
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,437
- The country's as
quiet as a grave.

686
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,739
Cusco is like a dead city.

687
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,475
The gold room is full.

688
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,243
- [Francisco] I know it.

689
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,411
- You must make
the share out now.

690
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,714
- Have Diego melt
everything down.

691
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,949
- But there are objects
of great beauty.

692
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,385
- What a tender man you are.

693
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,189
Boy your pen.

694
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:01,564
Milord you are now going
to learn a Spaniards honor.

695
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,133
Take this down boy.

696
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,904
Let this be known
throughout my army

697
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:14,310
the Inca Atahuallpa having
discharged his obligation

698
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:20,583
to General Pizarro
is today a free man.

699
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,785
(dramatic music)

700
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,821
- Milord your freedom.

701
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,091
(dramatic music)

702
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,136
- What is that you have done?

703
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,071
- This is writing milord.

704
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,506
- Explain.

705
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,146
- These are signs.

706
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:53,215
This is Atahuallpa,
this is free.

707
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:59,322
- You put this is sign and
he will see and know free?

708
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,690
- Yes milord.

709
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,426
- No.

710
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,561
- Yes milord I'll do it again.

711
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:08,464
- Here on my hand.

712
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,742
- What's the one you put?

713
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:22,645
- God.

714
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,721
- What is put?

715
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,358
- God.

716
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,162
- God?

717
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:58,447
Show me again more signs.

718
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,063
- What is put?

719
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,231
- What?

720
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,899
- Put put.

721
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,834
- It's only a game.

722
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,203
- The General never
learned the skill my Lord.

723
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,439
A soldier does not need it.

724
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:28,611
- A king needs it.

725
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:35,384
There is great power
in these marks.

726
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,825
You are king in this room.

727
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,497
You must teach us too.

728
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:53,436
We will learn together
like brothers.

729
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,206
- You'd stay with
me here to learn.

730
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:01,110
- No tomorrow I wish go.

731
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,144
- And then?

732
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,180
What then?

733
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,881
- I will not hurt you.

734
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,383
- [Francisco] Nor my army?

735
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,552
- That I not swear.

736
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,719
- You must.

737
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,492
- Do not say this thing now.

738
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,494
- No I do say it.

739
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,131
Before I let you go
Atahuallpa you must swear

740
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:25,868
you will not hurt a
man in all my army.

741
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,336
- I not swear this.

742
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,238
- For my sake.

743
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:37,513
- 2000 of my servants were
killed, 2000 without arms.

744
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,316
- There's a way of mercy.

745
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,552
- It is not my way
it's not your way.

746
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,354
- Swear it to me then.

747
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,958
- Keep your swear first.

748
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,093
- Cannot.

749
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,695
- Cannot?

750
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:57,099
- Not immediately you must
see you are many we are few.

751
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,502
- Is not important.

752
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,337
- It is to me.

753
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,715
- You gave

754
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,351
your word.

755
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:19,388
- And we'll keep it
only not now, not today.

756
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,723
- When?

757
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,924
- Soon.
- When?

758
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:22,791
- Very soon.

759
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,859
- When?

760
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,695
(both shouting at once)

761
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:30,232
(shouting in foreign language)

762
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:35,738
- I will kill every man.

763
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,073
- Will you?

764
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,742
Boy what did I put?

765
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,344
- This is today a free man.

766
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,712
- Continue.

767
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,515
But for the welfare
of the country

768
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:54,456
he will remain for the
moment as guest of the army.

769
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,627
- Ever seen so much gold Father?

770
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,363
(dramatic music)

771
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,789
- Soldiers of Spain
you have fought

772
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,359
and won the good
fight of the cross.

773
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,528
We have overcome
a deceitful king.

774
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,398
To make amends this
treacherous monarch

775
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,001
has delivered to us reparations

776
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,069
which we will now share out.

777
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,672
(men cheering)

778
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,909
- Keep in line lads
you'll all get yours.

779
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,511
There's enough for everyone.

780
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,712
Now these are the orders.

781
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,547
That each man take his share to

782
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,417
his quarters and carve his mark.

783
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,386
- How is the General?

784
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:31,887
- In a bad temper.

785
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,489
His old wound is
acting up again.

786
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,690
- Well I'm sorry to hear that

787
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,825
he's still subject
to distresses.

788
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,460
I had hoped that
victory would have

789
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,329
brought him a calmer spirit.

790
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,930
- Must be his new wealth Vedor.

791
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,933
So much so sudden must be
a great burden for him.

792
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,003
- The burdens of the General sir

793
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,640
are care for his men and
for our present situation.

794
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,443
Let us try to lighten
them for him as we can.

795
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:55,644
- Vedor.

796
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:00,983
- Let us indeed.

797
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,619
One throat cut and
were all lightened.

798
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:09,692
- It would greatly relieve
the Crown if you would cut it.

799
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,659
- If I?

800
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,062
Oh you mean I'm not Spanish so

801
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,330
don't have to
trouble with honor.

802
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,065
- You're not a subject.

803
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,635
It could be disowned by
my king and you have none.

804
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,639
- So Palace of Disinterest
has a crap house after all.

805
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,408
Look man you're the
overseer so do your job.

806
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,978
Go to the General tell
him the brownie must go.

807
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,850
- General mutiny's smoking.

808
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,419
Act now or it'll be a
blaze you'll not put out.

809
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:38,554
- What do I do?

810
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,623
- Take our chances
what else can we do?

811
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,093
You have to let him go.

812
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,627
- What happens then?

813
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,230
Tiny army's wiped
out in five minutes.

814
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,733
The whole story's
forgotten for always.

815
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,634
Later on somebody
else will conquer Peru

816
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,670
and no one will ever
even remember my name.

817
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,872
- What kind of name will they
remember if you kill him?

818
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,674
- A conqueror is that at least.

819
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:01,810
- A man who butchered his
prisoner after giving his word.

820
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,279
There's a name for your ballads.

821
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,482
- I won't be around
to hear them.

822
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,716
What do I care?

823
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,618
What does it matter?

824
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,954
Whatever I do what
does it matter?

825
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,690
- Nothing if you don't feel it.

826
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,060
Look I wish you've never made
this bargain but you made it.

827
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,562
Now you've no choice left.

828
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,064
- This is my kingdom.

829
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,967
In Peru I'm an absolute
I have the choice always.

830
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,369
- No you did have
it but you made it.

831
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,037
- Then I take it back.

832
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,874
- And that will be
from your own fear.

833
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,942
That's not choosing.

834
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,879
- May the Crown
be allowed a word?

835
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:48,457
- I know you your word, death.

836
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,958
- What else can it be?

837
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,561
- Your army's in jeopardy
you care nothing for them?

838
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,965
- You here that Cavalier?

839
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,670
Do you care nothing for them?

840
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:09,578
- I care about them less
than I care about you.

841
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,015
God knows why.

842
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,155
- The issue is simple.

843
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,957
You are the Viceroy
here ruling in

844
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,959
the name of the
king who sent you.

845
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:27,396
You have no right to risk his
lands for any reason at all.

846
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:31,400
- What has this king
ever done for me?

847
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:37,139
Allowed me salary if I
found money to pay it?

848
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,909
Permitted me to fit out this
expedition at my own expense?

849
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:44,213
Allowed me governance if
I found land to govern?

850
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:44,780
Magnificent.

851
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,714
- This is ridiculous.

852
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,116
- For years I strove to
make this expedition,

853
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,419
years of scars and hunger.

854
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,622
If I fail this time
this king of yours

855
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,859
would have cast me off with one
shrug of his royal feathers.

856
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,130
Now I cast him.

857
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:13,542
Francisco Pizarro casts
off Carlos V of Spain.

858
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,010
Go and tell him.

859
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,613
- You miserable creature.

860
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,449
Where would you be without
your king and country?

861
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,550
- My country?

862
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,653
What has my country
ever done for me?

863
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,356
The only place I know in it is

864
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,224
that filthy village
I was born in.

865
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,127
For 22 years I drove
pigs down those streets

866
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,996
because my father
couldn't own to my mother.

867
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,698
22 years without a
single day of help.

868
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,202
When I turned soldier
and dragged my boots

869
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,437
along the roads to Italy I was

870
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,940
so famished I was beyond eating.

871
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,376
I got nothing from my country.

872
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,445
Though I groaned for that
once I'm glad of it now.

873
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,481
Because I owe my
country nothing.

874
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,384
Tell you real.

875
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,020
You'll have to
furnish me with better

876
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,889
argument before I
give up Atahuallpa.

877
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:05,027
- For verse man what
is Atahuallpa to you?

878
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:09,865
- Someone I promised life.

879
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,101
- Promised life how quaint.

880
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:17,439
The sort of chivalrous idea
that you pretend to despise.

881
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,743
If you want to be an
absolute king my man

882
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,013
you have to learn how
to act out of self will.

883
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,683
Break your word just
because you made it.

884
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,152
Till then you're nothing but a

885
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,855
pig man trying to
copy his betters.

886
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,341
- Sir listen to me.

887
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,845
No promise to a pagan
need bind a Christian.

888
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,281
Simply think what's at stake,

889
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:03,018
the lives of 167
of the faithful.

890
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,388
Are you willing to sacrifice
them for one savage?

891
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,194
- [Francisco] You know
lives have no weight.

892
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,199
10 cannot be added up to 1000.

893
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,102
- One, can good count
against one evil?

894
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,703
And this man is evil.

895
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,606
His people kiss his hands
as a source of light.

896
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,844
- As we do yours.

897
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:32,447
All day you play at being God.

898
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,918
You only hate my Inca
because he does it better.

899
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:40,222
I despise you.

900
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,794
Kill who I bid you kill
and I will pardon it.

901
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,765
You with your milky fingers
forcing them the blade.

902
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:56,705
How dare you priests bless
a man going into battle.

903
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:02,110
Rip you scream, tear blind
in the name of Christ.

904
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:10,786
Tell me soft Father.

905
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:20,295
If Christ were here
would he kill the Inca?

906
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:36,778
And you brother De Nizza,
lord of all the answers.

907
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,649
Would you have me kill him?

908
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,684
- Don't try and trap me.

909
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:45,454
I know as well as you how
terrible it is to kill.

910
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,790
But worse it is to spare evil.

911
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,161
When I came here first I
thought I'd found paradise.

912
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,063
Now I know it's hell.

913
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,232
There's a sinful
core of the soul.

914
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,101
For the sake of the free spirit

915
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,336
in each of us it
must be destroyed.

916
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,972
- There's no Christian charity?

917
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:09,845
To save my own soul
I'll kill another man.

918
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:16,451
- To save love in the world
you must kill lovelessness.

919
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:21,656
- Hail to you father
sole judge of love.

920
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,960
No salvation
outside your church.

921
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,428
No love it in either.

922
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:36,805
Father.

923
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,209
I do not know love.

924
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,983
But if I have none
for Atahuallpa

925
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,853
what can I ever know of it?

926
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:54,956
- [Soldier] Go on get him.

927
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:58,627
(all shouting at once)

928
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,551
- I didn't mean to kill him.

929
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,020
We were playing dice
I caught him cheating.

930
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,555
I didn't mean to kill him.

931
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,125
- Fighting's forbidden
you know that.

932
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,360
You know the penalty.

933
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,832
Confess him Father.

934
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,443
Atahuallpa.

935
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,444
- General.

936
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,046
General.

937
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,081
General!

938
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,751
Another fight broke out
so there's one more dead.

939
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:57,319
- Who?

940
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,888
- Mendoza he drew a knife.

941
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,256
I only meant to
split his leg but

942
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,391
he slipped and got
it through the guts.

943
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,393
- You do well to
punish fighting.

944
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,494
- Yes sir.

945
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,696
May I speak free sir?

946
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:11,466
Well to me you're the
greatest General in the world

947
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,634
and we're the greatest company.

948
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,902
- So you want me to
kill him is that it?

949
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:14,736
- Well what other way is there?

950
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,737
The men are out of their wits.

951
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:16,938
There's death all around them.

952
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,907
- Death is all around them.

953
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,643
I promised you gold not life.

954
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,078
I've kept my part
of the bargain.

955
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,112
- I'll give you death.

956
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,614
When I get back to
Spain a commission

957
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,949
will hail you to the state
for what you've said today.

958
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,885
- If I free the Inca Father

959
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,087
you'll never get back to Spain.

960
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,555
- You mad man.

961
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,892
Now see here you put him
underground by sunset

962
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,094
or I'll take the
knife to him myself.

963
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,409
- They ache for your death.

964
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,279
Some of them will
die before you.

965
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,183
- Batalia.

966
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:10,792
- What a touching scene,
prisoners and jailers.

967
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,729
But it's over now General.

968
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,666
Do you think I'm gonna die so

969
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,201
that you can dance with a darky.

970
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,970
- Sorry sir but
it's gotta be done.

971
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,973
- There's nothing you
can do about it General.

972
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,075
The whole camp's against you.

973
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,678
- De Soto?

974
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:33,148
- No General I'm not with them.

975
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,251
But I'm not with you.

976
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,161
- You will have
to kill me first.

977
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,568
- Is no matter.

978
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:58,440
They can not kill me.

979
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,474
- Cannot?

980
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:06,181
- Only my father can
take me from here.

981
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:14,055
And he not execute me
killed by men like you.

982
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:19,461
Men with no word.

983
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:29,537
You may in this
town but never go.

984
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:36,644
And if you kill me tonight
I will raise at dawn

985
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:41,983
when my father first
touch my body with light.

986
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,619
- That's not possible.

987
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:47,389
- All of my people know it.

988
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:51,226
Is why they left
me stay with you.

989
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,129
- Your people let
you stay with me

990
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,531
because they knew I
could not kill you?

991
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,365
- So.

992
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,407
- Don't any kind of reason.

993
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,908
- [Francisco] Is it boy is it?

994
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:10,845
- Sir how can a man die and
they get up and walk away?

995
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,947
- Let's hear your creed.

996
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:17,952
I believe in Jesus
Christ the Son of God

997
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:22,791
that he was crucified dead
and buried and then what?

998
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:23,358
- Sir?

999
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,492
- Then what?

1000
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:27,362
- On the third day he
rose again from the dead.

1001
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,663
- You don't believe it?

1002
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,932
- I do sir I believe on my soul.

1003
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:32,834
I believe with perfect faith.

1004
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:36,738
- But Christ is to be
the only one is that it?

1005
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,040
- It's impossible my Lord.

1006
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,644
- Look at him boy look at him.

1007
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:50,118
Supposing I have gone god
hunting and caught one.

1008
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,687
- But how can that be sir?

1009
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,856
- Because he returns
over and over again

1010
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,625
to the source of
life to the sun.

1011
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:01,496
- [Martin] General it cannot be.

1012
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,201
- You want your freedom?

1013
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:11,106
Go on walk out of the camp.

1014
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,976
They may stop you but what's
that to you you're immortal?

1015
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:19,280
Go on, go on.

1016
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,549
Go on!

1017
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:33,962
- Pizarro you will die soon and
you not believe in your God.

1018
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:38,700
Is why you struggle
and keep no word.

1019
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,803
Believe in me.

1020
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:47,876
For you I will do a great thing.

1021
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:55,650
I will swallow death
and spit it out of me.

1022
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:06,528
- The prisoner has been tried
on the following charges.

1023
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:10,064
Usurping the throne
and assassinating
his brother Vascar,

1024
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,567
worshiping idols,
adulterous practices

1025
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,869
with a plurality of wives,
attempting to incite

1026
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,839
an insurrection against
his Spanish masters.

1027
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,775
On all of these charges how
do you find the prisoner?

1028
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:23,478
- I challenge that
the evidence brought

1029
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,281
on these charges is
wholly insufficient.

1030
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,750
I consider this cruel mockery,

1031
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:33,321
a poor requital for the favors
bestowed on us by the Inca.

1032
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:37,325
If he were in Spain
and his cause brought

1033
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:40,195
before the Emperor our
sovereign who alone--

1034
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,631
- Full account of
these proceedings will
be sent to Castile

1035
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,667
and the Emperor informed who are

1036
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:49,604
loyal subjects to the Crown
and who are its enemies.

1037
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,109
Cavalier I offer
you an opportunity

1038
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:58,313
to have your statement
stricken from the records.

1039
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:07,989
- I will retract nothing.

1040
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:14,362
- On all of these charges
how do you find the prisoner?

1041
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,296
- Guilty.

1042
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,067
- Guilty.

1043
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,104
- Guilty.

1044
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:26,908
- Guilty.

1045
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:31,913
- Guilty.

1046
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:35,283
(dramatic music)

1047
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:44,592
- Guilty.

1048
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:47,662
(dramatic music)

1049
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,535
- The sentence to be carried out

1050
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:57,472
this very night is
death by burning.

1051
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,408
- No no you cannot do it!

1052
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,244
The body must stay in one piece.

1053
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:06,247
- Let him repent his idolatry
and be baptized a Christian.

1054
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,119
He will receive the
customary mercy.

1055
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,954
- Strangling instead.

1056
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,991
- You must do it you
must be baptized.

1057
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,895
You cannot let your
body burn to ashes.

1058
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,731
There must be something left.

1059
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:28,870
Some flesh left for your
father to warm alive at dawn.

1060
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,841
- You must do it my Lord.

1061
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:41,115
- [De Nizza] I baptize
you one Atahuallpa

1062
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:44,419
in honor of John the Baptist
whose sacred day this is.

1063
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,188
- [Vedor] The 29th
day of August 1533.

1064
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,090
- [Estete] And may
our Lord in his angels

1065
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,892
receive your soul with joy.

1066
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,360
- [All] Amen.

1067
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,097
(dramatic music)
