<i>-Opening night</i>
<i>-Opening night</i>

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,036
<i>It's opening night</i>

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,791
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,673
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

5
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,713
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,593
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,314
<i>The doors are open</i>
<i>They're on their way</i>

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,752
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,591
<i>He's done it again</i>
<i>He's done it again</i>

10
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,473
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

11
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,433
<i>We can't believe it</i>

12
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,393
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

13
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,034
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,359
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,313
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,829
<i>There's no denying</i>

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,998
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

19
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,078
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,876
<i>We've seen shit</i>
<i>But never like this</i>

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,153
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,118
<i>The songs were rotten</i>
<i>The book was stinkin'</i>

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,551
<i>What he did to Shakespeare</i>
<i>Booth did to Lincoln</i>

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,558
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,113
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,318
<i>What a disaster</i>

27
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,159
<i>We are still in shock</i>

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,749
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,913
<i>What a bum</i>

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,358
Hello?

32
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,790
Mr. Bialystock?

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,630
Anybody here?

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,628
Mr. Bialystock?

35
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,874
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,116
What do you want?

37
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,595
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,196
Why don't you speak?

39
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,470
Scared. Can't talk.

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,839
All right, I'm sorry.

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,759
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Come on. Come on.

43
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,712
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

44
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,791
Look, just--

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,150
Take a deep breath.

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,396
Let it out slowly.

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,115
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom.

48
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,675
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,997
-...and I've come to do your books.
-Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen--

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,078
-Who is it?
-Hold Me-Touch Me.

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,158
Hold Me-Touch Me.
One of my backers.

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,238
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,590
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,396
-But I don't have to go.
-Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,875
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

56
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,316
Hold Me-Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me-Touch Me?

57
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,078
Kiss Me-Feel Me,
Clinch Me-Pinch Me...

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,474
...Lick Me-Bite Me, Suck Me--

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,477
Here she is. Hold Me-Touch Me.

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,558
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,276
-...I didn't have any trouble at all--
-Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,273
Coming. Coming.

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,674
Hello, gorgeous.

64
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,032
-Hold me, touch me.
-As soon as I shut the door.

65
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,113
Did you bring the checkie?

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,074
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

67
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,555
Here you go.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,677
But first,
can we please play a game?

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,633
One dirty little game.

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,879
All right, my little sex kitten.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,672
What shall we play?

72
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,757
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

73
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,632
-Oh, no.
-No.

74
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,149
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

75
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,238
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

76
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,634
I know.

77
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,960
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,110
I don't think I have the strength.

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,749
...this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,430
You there, well-hung stableboy.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,989
Won't you please help me?

82
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,999
Of course, my little dairy queen.

83
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,636
First I'll take your milk.

84
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,991
Then I shall take your virginity!

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,910
No! No! Never! Never!

86
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,839
Yes. Yes.

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,508
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

88
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,234
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,432
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

90
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,758
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,996
But first, the checkie.

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,909
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,268
Here you go.

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,834
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

95
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,473
<i>-Cash.</i>
-Yes.

96
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,353
That's a funny name
for a play, <i>Cash</i>.

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,199
Yes, so was <i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

98
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,038
I'll see you Thursday.

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,117
-Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

100
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,153
Yes, yes, yes.

101
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,833
You dirty old buzzard.

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,040
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
-Yeah, sure.
-I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

104
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,669
-...feeling up the old lady.
-" Feeling up the old lady."

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,791
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,958
-May I take your coat?
-Oh, thank you.

107
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,957
So you're an accountant, huh?

108
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,430
-Yes, sir. I am, sir.
-Then account for yourself!

109
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,552
Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,358
I know what you're thinking.

111
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,120
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

112
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,595
-Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn--
-Shut up!

113
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,189
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

114
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,359
-Do you know who I used to be?
-Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

115
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,758
-...the king of Broadway.
-No, I'm Max Bialy-- That's right.

116
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,838
-That's right.
-And might I say, Mr. Bialystock--

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,395
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
-...but you're not just a dirty old man.
-Thank you.

119
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,352
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

120
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,279
And there's something about me
you should know.

121
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,913
When I was a kid...

122
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,908
...I had the good fortune
to be taken to <i>Bialy-Hoos of '42</i>.

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,031
-Oh, <i>Bialy-Hoos</i>.
-Yes.

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,993
And I still have the ticket stub.

125
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,031
-Oh, look at that.
-Yeah.

126
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,198
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

127
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,153
...to be a Broadway producer.

128
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,669
A secret desire, huh?

129
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,077
-Kid, can I give you some advice?
-Yes, sir.

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,589
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

131
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,791
Top drawer, to the left.

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,598
Oh, my God.

133
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,559
Will you look at that.

134
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,595
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

135
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,793
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

136
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,833
-A minute?
-Yes.

137
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,234
-Just one minute?
-Yes.

138
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,396
-Okay.
-ln glancing at your books...

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,797
-Go! You have 58 seconds left.
-...I noticed that in the column--

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,195
-You're gonna time it?
-Time is money.

141
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,437
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received."

142
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,473
-And I can't make the figures work out.
-Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

143
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,116
-There's a problem with your figures.
-Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

144
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,550
-Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
-I cannot--

145
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,716
-Fifteen seconds.
-I cannot-- I can't function.

146
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,037
-I cannot function in these conditions.
-Five, four, three, two, one.

147
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

148
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,113
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

149
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,588
My blanket. My blue blanket!

150
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,189
Give me back my blue blanket!

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,994
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

152
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,757
Give it to me! Give it to me!

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,951
Here, here, here.

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,311
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,397
I....

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,749
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,679
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

158
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,952
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

159
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,912
I can deal with it if I want to.

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,591
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

161
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,994
I need to lie down for a minute now.

162
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,550
They come here. They all come here.

163
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,070
How do they find me?

164
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,914
Hey, kid. Hey.

165
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,834
Look at this.

166
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,393
How can I help you?

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,909
-What's wrong?
-You're gonna jump on me.

168
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,838
-What?
-You're gonna jump on me.

169
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,715
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

170
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,751
-Oh, God.
-Please, don't jump on me!

171
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,474
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

172
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,194
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,311
Stop! Calm down!

174
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,590
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

175
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,792
-What's the matter now?
-I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,118
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

177
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,757
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

178
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,235
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

179
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,279
I'm wet!

180
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,074
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

181
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,398
I'm in pain.

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,431
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

183
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,108
...and I'm still hysterical.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,595
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

185
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,949
Move away, you frighten me.

186
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,388
-You're too close.
-I frighten you?

187
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,070
Yes, get over there and stop
touching-- Move over there! Sit down.

188
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,430
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

189
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,153
You still look angry.

190
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,113
I'm sorry. How's this?

191
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,994
Who's my little accountant?

192
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,108
Who's my little accountant?

193
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,995
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

194
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,918
-Are you my little accountant?
-I am.

195
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,031
Yes, you are.

196
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,637
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,319
Well, you know what they say:

198
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,512
"Smile and the world smiles
with you."

199
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,794
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,673
-You feeling better?
-Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

201
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,235
-Good.
-May I speak to you?

202
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,556
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

203
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,991
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,031
I've discovered a serious error...

205
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,834
...in the accounts of your last show,
<i>Funny Boy</i>.

206
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,679
-Where? What?
-Well, according to the backers list...

207
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,874
...you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

208
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,752
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

209
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,315
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

210
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,670
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

211
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,236
...move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,194
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

213
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,073
-That's cheating.
-It's not cheating.

214
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,872
It's charity.

215
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,036
Bloom...

216
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,673
...you see this stickpin?

217
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,189
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

218
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,428
I used to wear handmade
ltalian shoes, $500 suits.

219
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,629
And look at me now.

220
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,992
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

221
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,119
Bloom, you gotta save me.

222
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,514
I'm reaching out to you.

223
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,314
Don't send me to prison.

224
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,035
Help me.

225
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,073
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

226
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,633
-Really?
-Yes, I'll do it.

227
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,434
See, $2000 isn't so much.

228
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,471
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

229
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,036
After all, the lRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

230
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,196
Right. Good thinking.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,870
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

232
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,748
Now, let's see.

233
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,077
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get....

234
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,714
Carry the three, divide by four....

235
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,034
Amazing.

236
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,595
It's absolutely amazing, but...

237
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,279
...under the right circumstances...

238
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,914
...a producer could
make more money with a flop...

239
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,076
...than he could with a hit.

240
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,590
Yes, it's quite possible. lf he were
certain that a show would fail...

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,075
...a man could make a fortune.

242
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,077
-Yes?
-Yes, what?

243
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,953
-What you were saying. Keep talking.
-What was I saying?

244
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,593
You were saying that a producer...

245
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,030
...could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

246
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,798
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,070
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

248
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,989
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

249
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,556
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

250
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,909
Assume away.

251
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
All right. When you produced
your last show, <i>Funny Boy</i>...

252
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,159
...you raised $2000
more than you needed.

253
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,078
But you could've raised a million...

254
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,874
...put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

255
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,913
-But what if my show was a hit?
-Then you would go to jail.

256
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,156
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

257
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,430
...you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

258
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,030
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

259
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,673
-Get it?
-Got it.

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,952
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure-fire flop.

261
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,878
"Our schem<i>e''</i>? What scheme?

262
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,908
What scheme?

263
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,873
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

264
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,436
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

265
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,676
-It was just a thought.
-Bloom...

266
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,872
...worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

267
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,470
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

268
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,829
It's so simple.

269
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,270
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

270
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,516
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

271
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,400
-Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
-Two?

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,876
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

273
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,231
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

274
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,954
And before you can say "step fiv<i>e,''</i>
we close on Broadway...

275
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,913
...take our 2 million and go to Rio.

276
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,554
Rio? That'd never work.

277
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,069
Oh, ye of little faith.

278
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,275
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark</i>
<i>When everything looked bleak?</i>

279
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,118
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

280
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,039
<i>As they struggled</i>
<i>Toward Everest's peak?</i>

281
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,958

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,829
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

284
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,712
What'd they say?

285
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,593
<i>We can do it</i>

286
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,552
<i>We can do it</i>

287
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,673
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>Me and you</i>

288
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>We can do it</i>

289
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,437
<i>We can do it</i>

290
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,712

<i>Caressing you, undressing you</i>
<i>And driving you mad</i>

295
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,152
No.

296
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,270
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

297
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,916
Hear me out. Just think about it.

298
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,632
Stop!

What do you say, Bloom?

308
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,793
<i>What do I say?</i>

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,436

Don't you ever wanna become

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,553
-Where to?
-Central Park.

325
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,354

<i>'Cause I know it's gonna fail</i>

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,992
Fail? How could it miss?
All you need is a little courage.

342
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,634
Bloom, you know what you are?
You're like a--

343
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,558
You're like a....

344
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,753
You're like a fountain waiting
to explode and shoot into the sky!

345
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,349
-I'm a fountain?
-Yes, you're a fountain!

346
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,111
Don't you realize? There's a lot more
to you than there is to you.

347
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,108
Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made
a terribl<i>e e</i>rror in judgment.

348
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,550
You've mistaken me
for someone with a spine.

349
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,320
I'm going back
to Whitehall & Marks now.

350
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,717
-Goodbye forever.
-Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute! Bloom.

351
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,040
Think about it. You'll never get a cab
at this hour! Bloom.

352
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,432
Oh, Lord. Dear Lord...

353
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,272

Where the hell have you been?

360
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,354
You are six minutes late.
This is an accounting firm...

361
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,393
...not a country club.
You can't come and go as you please.

362
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,593
-Yes, Mr. Marks.
-Remember, you're a nobody.

363
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,429
A PA. A public accountant.

364
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,760
And I am a CPA.
A certified public accountant.

365
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,913
A rank a miserable little worm like
yourself could never hope to achieve.

366
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,554
Yes, Mr. Marks.
Thank you for speaking to me.

367
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,193
You're welcome.

368
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,118
What are you gawking at?

369
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,470
You never saw a person
humiliated before?

370
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,434
Now, get back to work. All of you!

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,118

Hold everything!

420
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,955
What am I doing here?
Mr. Bialystock was right.

421
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,118
There is a lot more to me
than there is to me.

422
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,472
Stop the world, I wanna get on!

423

What the hell is going on in here?

424
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,355
Do I smell the revolting stench
of self-esteem?

425
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,279
Bloom,
where do you think you're going?

426
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,836
You've already had
your toilet break.

427
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,999
I'm not going into the toilet.
I'm going into show business.

428
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,157
And, Mr. Marks,
I have news for you. I quit!

429
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,794
And you were right about one thing,
you are a CPA.

430
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,117
-A certified public asshole!
-Hooray!

431
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,548

I'm back! I'm back.
I've changed my mind.

440
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,035
Boy, you are good.

441
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,269

-Never mind, just an old friend.

442
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,552
-What happened?
-Oh, just this--

443
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,230
Just this: When I said that I was
scared that I was gonna go to jail...

444
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,115
...I didn't realize
that I already was in jail.

445
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,993
I've spent my life counting
other people's money.

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,158
...better than.

448
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,113
When's Leopold Bloom
gonna get his share?

449
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,950
When's it gonna be Bloom's day?
I want-- I want--

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,676
I want everything

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,399

Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

463
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,396
-How many plays can a person read?
-Stop complaining.

464
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,591
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

-I've been reading all night.
-Who cares?

466
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,912
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

467
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,513
Here's one.

468
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,472
Act I, scene one.

469
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,114
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

470
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,518
...that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

471
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,830
No, too good.

472
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,555
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted."

473
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,435
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

474
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,633
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

475
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,353
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

476
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,074
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

477
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,157
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

478
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,830
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

479
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,678
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

480
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,758
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

481
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,111
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

482
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,914
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

483
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,348
It's the mother lode.

484
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,516
-What is it? You found a flop?
-A flop.

485
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,392
That's putting it mildly.

486
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,238
This is a catastrophe.

487
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,718
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

488
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,992
A guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night
beauty.

489
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,839
-Well, let's see it.
-Here.

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,676
<i>''Springtime for Hitler...</i>

491

...a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden."

492
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,036
Oh, my God.

493
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,794
"Oh, my God" is right.

494
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,878
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

495
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,516
-Max, this won't run a week.
-A week? Are you kidding?

496
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,030
This play has got to close
on page four.

497
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,559
What's the author's name again?

498
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,958
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York."

499
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,118
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

500
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,632
Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>...

501
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,831
...even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

502
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,394
-Come on.
-This other hat, Max...

503
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,999
...may I wear it?

504
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,156
-No, you may not.
-Why?

505
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,433
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

506
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,949
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

507
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,355
...until you're a Broadway producer.

508
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,278
And you're not
a Broadway producer until--

509
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,711
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

510
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,469
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because....

511
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,558
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

512
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,673
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

513
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:21,918
<i>Ja, ja</i>, my <i>Lieblings</i>.

514
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,557
Let me grab you here.

515
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,751
We have work to do.

516
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,953
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

517
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,914
...which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

518
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,033
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

519
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,515
...Buenos Aires, Argentina.

520
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,551
AQAP.

521
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,318
As quick as possible.

522
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,351
Good.

523
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,916
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

524
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,471
Hilda, where are you going?

525
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,035
Argentina's that way!

526
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,678
Okay, chow time.

527
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,914
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

528
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,953
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

529
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,358
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

530
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,279
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

531
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,155
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

532
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,516
Franz Liebkind?

533
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,712
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

534
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,353
I only followed orders.

535
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,835
I had nothing to do with the war.

536
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,951
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

537
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,392
We lived in the back...

538
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,158
...right across from Switzerland.

539
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,555
All w<i>e e</i>ver heard was yodelling.

540
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,311
-Who are you?!
-Relax.

541
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,556
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

542
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,955
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

543
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,799
-...here to talk to you about your play.
-My play?

544
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,560
You mean <i>Springtime for</i>...

545
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,110
-...you-know-who?
-That's the one.

546
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,312
-What about it?
-We love it. Don't we love it?

547
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,751
-We think it's a masterpiece.
-We want to put it on Broadway.

548
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,350
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

549
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,915
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

550
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,430
...Adolf.

551
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,039
Do you hear?

552
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,516
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

553
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,792
Broadway!

554
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,314
You know,
not many people know this...

555
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,069
-...but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
-Really?

556
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,955
-We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
-No, no, we sure didn't.

557
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,709
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

558
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,878
Filthy British lies!

559
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,437
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

560
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,835
Churchill!

561
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,077
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

562
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,713
Rotten!

563
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,148
Hitler.

564
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,952
There was a painter.

565
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,958
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

566
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,991
Two coats.

567
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,395
Yes. Yes.

568
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,795
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

569
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,673
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

570
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,917
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

571
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,590
...the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

572
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,712
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

573
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,036
...and make your dream a reality.

574
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,156
-No.
-That's what <i>''nein''</i> means.

575
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,148
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

576
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,717
...by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

577
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,797
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

578
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,039
I know.

579
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,435
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

580
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,551
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

581
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,875
Delighted. Delighted.

582
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,594
-...song.
-Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

583
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,031
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

584
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,677
-Rolling?
-Rolling.

585
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,030
-Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
-Alrighty.

586
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,434
-Good.
-Good.

587
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,471
-Key of E?
-ls there any other?

588
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,950
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

589
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,596
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>Und oh, boy</i>

590
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,315
<i>Guten Tag clap clap</i>
<i>Guten Tag slap slap</i>

591
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,988
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>What a joy</i>

592
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,432
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen</i>
<i>Und tanzen und trinken</i>

593
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,030
<i>Tanzen und trinken</i>
<i>Until we get stinkin'</i>

594
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
-Everybody!
<i>-Guten Tag hop hop</i>

595
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,399
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

596
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,236
<i>Guten Tag</i>
<i>Mein lieber Schatz</i>

597
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,796
<i>So we hop our hops</i>
<i>Und we clop our clops</i>

598
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,198
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps</i>
<i>Till we platz</i>

599
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,868
You will sway?

600
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,513
We will sway.

601
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,238
Follow me.

602
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,192
Very good.

603
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,231
Whatever you say.

604
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,758
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

605
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,669
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

606
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,675
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

607
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,633
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

608
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,319
Excellent. Excellent.

609
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,715
Here we are. Here.

610
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,557
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

611
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,512
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

612
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,996
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

613
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,428
Never...

614
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,631
...took that oath before.

615
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,116
One for me, one for you,
<i>und</i> one for you.

616
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,517
Never-- Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

617
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,915
-You're welcome.
-Nice colours.

618
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,758
Oh, look, reversible.

619
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,315
-Oh, yeah, you're right.
-Max.

620
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,954
Max, we never
should have started this.

621
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,196
I think we're getting in too deep.

622
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,311
Too deep? This is nothing.

623
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,080
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

624
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,713
All right.

625
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,309
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

626
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,476
...<i>und</i> repeat after me.

627
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,955
I solemnly swear...

628
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,630
-I solemnly swear...
-I solemnly swear...

629
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,752
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

630
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,748
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

631
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>-Und...</i>
<i>-Und...</i>

632
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,029

-...never, never, never...

...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the memory

-...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the--

-Elizabeth?

638
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,834
<i>Ja</i>, that was his middle name.

639
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,632
Not many people know this...

640
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,870
...but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

641
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,156
ls that right?

642
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,839
Yes.

643
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,039
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

644
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,471
-Good. Now I sign your contract.
-Excellent! Excellent.

645
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,638
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

646
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,158
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

647
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,193
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

648
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,197
Thank you.

649
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,156
Let it go. Let it go.

650
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,918
Halt!

651
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,439
I forgot to tell you.

652
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,870
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

653
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,116
...is dess.

654
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,038
" Dess"?

655
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,878
ls that anything lik<i>e ''</i>death"?

656
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,389
Yeth.

657
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,552
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

658
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,718
...we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

659
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,956
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go....

660
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,393
We're trapped! Trapped!

661
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,313
Got it.

662
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,238
Let's have lunch.

663
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,630
What nice guys.

664
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,193
Broadway.

665
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,359
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

666
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,359
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

667
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,233
...Roger DeBris<i>' e</i>legant
Upper East Side townhouse...

668
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,671
...on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

669
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,269
Who may I say is calling?

670
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,831
Listen, you broken-down

671
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,190
...he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

672
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,470
-Don't ever call here again.
-Who was that?

673
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,636
Wrong number.

674
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,916
Yes?

675
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,510
Well, hi there.

676
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,951
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

677
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,754
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

678
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,474
-...Roger DeBris.
-Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

679
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,274
-Please. Yes.
-Thank you.

680
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,429
I am Carmen Ghia...

681
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,837
...Mr. DeBris'
common-law assistant.

682
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,110
You ar<i>e e</i>xpected.

683
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,670
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

684
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,198
Oh, these. We-- We--

685
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,949
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

686
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,000
-You didn't tell me we had those on?
-I didn't notice them.

687
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,638
-You told me to look straight ahead.
-Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

688
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,709
Oh, Roger.

689
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,753
We're not alone.

690
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,839
Here's Roger.

691
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,228
-Max, he's wearing a dress.
-No kidding.

692
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,317
Roger, good to see you again.

693
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,512
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

694
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,517
Forgive the pun.

695
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,511
-What pun?
-Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

696
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,157
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

697
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,199
By the way, Max, darling,
we loved <i>Funny Boy</i>, didn't we?

698
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,435
Worshipped it.

699
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,835
<i>To be or not to be</i>
<i>You mean a lot to me</i>

700
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,190
-Showstopper!
-Fabulous.

701
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,038
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

702
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,637
-Well, I was--
-I should explain.

703
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,469
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

704
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,434
-We always win.
-I'm not so sure about this year.

705
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,552
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

706
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,877
...but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

707
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,835
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

708
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,157
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

709
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,750
...oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

710
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,078
lf your intention...

711
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,831
...was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

712
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,151
...bull's-eye!

713
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,276
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

714
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,119
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

715
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,311
...but did you read
<i>Springtime for Hitler</i>?

716
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,670
Read it? I devoured it.

717
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,110
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

718
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,074
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

719
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,352
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

720
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,516
...meant Germany.

721
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,995
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

722
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,193
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

723
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,359
World War ll?
Too dark, too depressing.

724
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,279
<i>The theatre's so obsessed</i>
<i>With dramas so depressed</i>

725

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,950
<i>What's the word?</i>

729
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,913
-Gay?
-Exactly.

<i>Don't complain, it's a pain</i>

734
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,511
<i>People want laughter</i>
<i>When they see a show</i>

735
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,871
<i>The last thing they're after is</i>
<i>A litany of woe</i>

736
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,709
<i>A happy ending</i>
<i>Will pep up your play</i>

00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,828
Couldn't agree more.

And you have our blessings,
Roger...

743
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,588
...to mak<i>e Springtime for Hitler</i> just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.

744
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,199
So come on, do it for us. Please.

745
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,358
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

746
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,028
Still, fair is fair.

747
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,515
I should ask my production team
what they think.

748
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,153
Your production team,
who are they?

749
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,351
You'll see. They all live here.

750
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,711
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

751
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,150
This is my set designer, Brian.

752
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,315
Hello.

753
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,557
<i>Keep it mad, keep it glad</i>

00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,396
<i>That everything's perfect</i>
<i>For Mr. DeBris</i>

758
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,670
Scott, my choreographer.

759
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,472
Hi there.

760
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,759
And, finally, last and least...

761
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,714
...my lighting designer,
Shirley Markowitz.

Now, they all just read <i>Springtime</i>.
What did you think of it, fellas?

765
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,357
-<i>It needs glamour</i>
-<i>And glitz</i>

766
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,711
-<i>It needs sequins</i>
-<i>And tits</i>

767
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,230
Leo. Leo, I think we're losing them.

768
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,318
Go say something nice to Roger.
I think he likes you.

769
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,433
-But, Max....
-Go on. It's just show biz.

770
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,393
Mr. DeBris. Roger.

771
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,956
Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

772
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,798
Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom.

773
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,797
Leo.

774
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,469
What is that enchanting
cologne you're wearing?

775
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,238
Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

776
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,716
You mean that smell is you?

777
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,956
Oh, God.

778
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,110
lf I could bottle you, I'd shove you
under my armpits every day.

779
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,276
Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

780
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,439
-I think we're getting in too deep.
-Too deep? This is nothing.

781
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,835
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

782
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,236
<i>And so the rule is</i>

-What should we do?
-Relax. Watch this.

Roger, I--

788
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,836
I think that <i>Springtime for Hitler</i> would
be a marvellous opportunity for you.

789
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,873
I mean, up to now,
you've always been associated with--

790
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,957
Dare I say it? --frivolous musicals.

791
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,037
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

792
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,913
...I've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

793
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,680
Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns.

794
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,348
Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn,
kick, turn.

795
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,232
-Roger.
-It's enough to make you heave.

796
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,637
Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max, I just
couldn't do <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>.

797
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,558
-Why not? Think of the respect.
-No.

798
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,318
-Think of the prestige.
-No, no, no.

799
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,919
Think of the Tony!

800
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,555

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,352

-ls he all right?

802
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,709
-He's having a stroke.
-What?

803
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,990
-Of genius!
-I see it at last.

804
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,191

to do something important.

806

840
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,075
<i>Dramas annoy us</i>

841
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,397

<i>Keep it gay</i>

854
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,120
Exclusive Broadway rights

855
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,756
...and a signed contract
with the worst director who ever lived.

856
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,315
We're in business.

857
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,998
And what a business.

858
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,509
ln the same day,
I'm taking the Siegfried Oath...

859
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,792
...and dancing the conga
with a cop, a sailor...

860
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,753
...and an extremely friendly
Cherokee lndian.

861
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,190
Yeah. Oh, well.

862
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,755
It's not easy
being a Broadway producer.

863
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,077
But together we'll make it.
Partners, Leo. Partners all the way...

864
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,430
...and nothing or no one
will ever come between us.

865
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,949
Nothing or no one, Max.

We don't even know when
we're beginning rehearsals--

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,472
Yes, we just started
casting today. Yes.

876
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,956
-We're casting?
-Yes. Yes, we're casting.

877
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,469

00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,718
That was my first name.

884

You wanna hear my last name?

885
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,513
We don't have the time.
We'll just call you Ulla.

886
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,950
Okay? Yeah. What do you do, Ulla?

887
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,355
-Ulla sing and dance.

-What are you going to sing?
-Well...

893
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,792
...yesterday when I was stepping out
of a big, white Rolls-Royce limo...

894
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,912
...a crazy man
yelled something out the window...

895
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,554
...that inspired me to write this song.

<i>Step right up and strut your stuff</i>

899

<i>People tell you modesty's a virtue</i>

900
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,549
<i>But in the theatre</i>
<i>Modesty can hurt you</i>

901
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,988
<i>When you got it</i>

902
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,231

00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,718
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Shout it out loud</i>

907
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,877
Now Ulla dance.

908
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,476
<i>When you got it</i>

909
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,477

<i>Put your hidden treasures</i>
<i>On display</i>

911
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,836
<i>Violinists love to play an E string</i>

912
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,396
<i>But audiences really love a G-string</i>

913

<i>When you got it</i>

914
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,233

917
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,839
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Let it hang out</i>

918
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,917
-Remember when Ulla dance?
-Yeah.

919
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,269
Ulla dance again.

920
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,952
Ulla dance again!

921
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,235
<i>When I was just a little girl</i>
<i>In Sweden</i>

922
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,149
<i>My thoughtful mother</i>
<i>Gave me this advice</i>

923
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,989
<i>If nature blesses you</i>
<i>From top to bottom</i>

924
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,953
<i>Show that top to bottom</i>
<i>Don't think twice</i>

925
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,196
Now Ulla belt.

926
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,109
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

927
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,470

00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,149
<i>Let the public feast</i>
<i>Upon your charms</i>

930
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,875
<i>People say that being prim</i>
<i>Is proper</i>

931
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,231
<i>But every showgirl knows</i>
<i>That prim will stop her</i>

932
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,670
<i>When you got it</i>

933
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,552
<i>Give it</i>

934
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,515
<i>Don't be selfish</i>
<i>Give it all away</i>

935
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,678
<i>Don't be shy</i>
<i>Be bold and cute</i>

936
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,598
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

937
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,792
<i>When you got it</i>

938
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,592
<i>If you got it</i>

939
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,358
<i>Once you got it</i>

940
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,710
<i>Shout out</i>

941
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,039
<i>Hooray!</i>

942
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,519
Okey-dokey.

943
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,869
You like it?

944
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,275
Like-- Like it?

945
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,870
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

946
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,959
...we're giving you
a standing ovation.

947
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,154
She's in the show.

948
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,115
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

949
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,153
Would you excuse us, my dear?

950
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,078
Nonsense, Bloom.

951
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,157
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

952
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,669
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

953
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,440
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

954
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,474
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

955
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,478
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

956
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,276
Because we need--
Nay, des<i>erve</i> to have ourselves a--

957
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,479
Des<i>erve</i> to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.

958
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,389
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

959
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,318
They'll say:

960
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,874
Offer her the job, please?

961
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,159
Just a moment, miss.

962
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,193
We might have a position for you.

963
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,188
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

964
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,833
Until the show gets going...

965
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,318
...we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

966
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,751
Secretary/receptionist?

967
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,394
Okey/dokey!

968
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,749
I can do that.

969
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,035
Answer telephone.

970
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,151
Bialystock and Bloom.

971
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,918
Bialystock and Bloom.

972
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,314
Smart as a whip.

973
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,556
You're hired!

974
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,829
Well-- Well, all right. lf he says so,
I don't have a--

975
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,190
Secretary/receptionist.

976
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,709
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

977
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,717
Tidy up? Tidy up.

978
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,150
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

979
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,920
-You know, clean.
-Make look nice.

980
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,430
-Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
-Very good.

981
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,676
What time can you be here
in the morning?

982
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,997
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a.m.

983
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,555
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

984
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,752
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

985
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,839
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

986
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,871
Many different herrings.

987
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,709
From to 9 to 11 , Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

988
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,356
And at 11 , Ulla like to have sex.

989
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,790
What time should I get here?

990
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,069
-Eleven.
-Eleven.

991
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,874
Good. Ulla will come at 11 .

992
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,753
Ulla will come at 11 .

993
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,040
God bless America!

994
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,954
God bless Sweden.

995
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,676
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

996
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,348
The most beautiful girl
I'v<i>e e</i>ver seen.

997
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,073
I've never felt this way before.

998
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,272
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

999
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,315
...like hot lava rising higher
and higher and--

1000
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,351
What is that, Max?

1001
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,596
What is it?

1002
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,795
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

1003
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,795
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

1004
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,280
Come here,
I want to show you something.

1005
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,232
-What do you see?
-Nothing.

1006
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,671
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure-fire flop...

1007
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,031
...it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

1008
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,869
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

1009
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,515
How much--?
How much do we put in?

1010
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,358
Bloom...

1011
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,791
...the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

1012
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,197
...are one, never put
your own money in the show.

1013
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,549
And two?

1014
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,153
Never put your own money
in the show!

1015
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,039
-Get it?
-Got it.

1016
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,151
-Good.
-So how do we raise the money?

1017
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,920
How? I'll tell you how.

1018
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,479
From my investors.

1019
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,432
Hundreds of little old ladies...

1020
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,509
...all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

1021
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,395
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

1022
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,830
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

1023
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,951
Scram while I get myself ready.

1024
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,835
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

1025
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,349
...into little-old-lady land.

1026
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,598
<i>The time has come</i>

1027
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,998
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

1028
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,512
<i>To slick my hair down</i>
<i>With brilliantine</i>

1029
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,909
<i>And gargle heavily</i>
<i>With Listerine</i>

1030
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,557
<i>It's time for Max</i>

1031
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,470
<i>To put his backers on their backs</i>

1032
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,834
<i>And thrill them with amazing acts</i>

1033
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,634
<i>Those aging nymphomaniacs</i>

1034
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,470
<i>They were helpless</i>
<i>They were hopeless</i>

1035
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,990
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1036
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,670
<i>They were joyless</i>
<i>They were boy-less</i>

1037
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,156
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1038
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,830
<i>They're my angels</i>
<i>I'm their devil</i>

1039
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,555
<i>And I keep those embers aglow</i>

1040
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,150
<i>When I woos 'em</i>
<i>I can't lose 'em</i>

1041
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,351
<i>'Cause I cast my spell</i>
<i>And they start yellin'</i>

1042
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,834
<i>''Fire down below!''</i>

1043
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,396
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>They were frantic</i>

1044
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,229
<i>Then their prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

1045
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,032
<i>Heaven sent them</i>

1046
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,832
<i>Their Bialy</i>

1047
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:40,434
<i>I'm the celebration of love</i>

1048
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,273
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

1049
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,198
It's Max Bialystock.

1050
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,997
Maxy.

1051
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,788
Fire down below!

1052
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,594
<i>We were listing</i>
<i>We were sinking</i>

1053
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,031
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1054
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,198
<i>We were desperate</i>
<i>We were drinking</i>

1055
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,597
<i>-Then along came Bialy</i>
-Who's your daddy?

1056
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,792
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>We were frantic</i>

1057
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,231
<i>Then our prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

1058
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,714
<i>It's Bialy</i>

1059
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,319
<i>Hey, Bialy</i>

1060
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,351
<i>He's the culmination</i>

1061
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,993
<i>The restoration</i>

1062
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,633
<i>The consummation</i>

1063
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,034
<i>The titillation</i>

1064
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,593
<i>Ejaculation</i>

1065
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,351
<i>He's the celebration of love</i>

1066
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,636
Thank you.

1067
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,191
Bloom! Bloom!

1068
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,391
What, Max? What?

1069
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,160
I've done it. I've done it,
I've raised the 2 million.

1070
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,079
Now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history.

1071
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,430
That's great!

1072
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,549
<i>We can't miss</i>

1073
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,913
I gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3:00 or else--

1074
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,314
Sorry, wrong office.

1075
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,351
Bialystock. Bloom.

1076
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,833
Max. Leo.

1077
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,796
-Ulla?
-Ulla?

1078
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,793
What happened to the office?

1079
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,833
Like you tell Ulla, "tidy up."

1080
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,235
Tidy "oop"?

1081
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,317
How did you find the time
to do all this?

1082
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,796
-I skip lunch.
-Of course you did.

1083
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,594
-Very nice.
-She skipped lunch.

1084
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,472
Almost 3.
That payment to the Shuberts.

1085
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,113
I'll get the cash from the safe.

1086
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,311
You make sure
all those contracts are signed.

1087
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,748
Yes, Max.

1088
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,630
She painted over the numbers.

1089
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,996
Hello, boys.

1090
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,713
Nobody knows
what I went through to get you.

1091
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,319
Ulla knows.

1092
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,513
You had to shtupp
every little old lady in New York.

1093
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,675
That's right. That's right.

1094
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,318
And I've still got
the denture bites to prove it.

1095
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,150
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

1096
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,395
So, Mr. Bloom.

1097
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,795
We are all alone.

1098
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,749
Yes, we are, aren't we?

1099
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,596
Why Bloom go so far camera right?

1100
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,040
Bloom no like Ulla?

1101
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,714
Ulla like Bloom.

1102
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,236
Bloom like Ulla, all right.

1103
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,318
-Maybe a little too much.
-Good.

1104
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,511
I'm glad.

1105
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,351
Why Bloom need blue blanket?

1106
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,152
Oh, it's not important.

1107
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,271
It's just a minor compulsion.
It's that I've--

1108
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,153
I've had it ever since
I was a baby, and I....

1109
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,158
You're a little too close.

1110
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,917
<i>The urge to merge</i>
<i>Can rob us of our senses</i>

1111
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,591
<i>The need to breed</i>
<i>Can make a man a drone</i>

1112
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,032
<i>We must be on alert</i>
<i>With our defences</i>

1113
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,391
<i>For every skirt will test</i>

1114
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,197
<i>Testosterone</i>

1115
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,029
<i>So knowing this</i>
<i>I severed all connection</i>

1116
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,471
<i>With any creature</i>
<i>Sporting silk or lace</i>

1117
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,878
<i>I was firmly headed</i>
<i>In the right direction</i>

1118
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,119
<i>When suddenly I stumbled on</i>

1119
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,551
<i>That face</i>

1120
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,190
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1121
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,391
<i>That dangerous face</i>

1122
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,639
<i>I mustn't be unwise</i>

1123
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,876
<i>Those lips</i>
<i>That nose</i>

1124
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,116
<i>Those eyes</i>

1125
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,393
<i>Could lead to my demise</i>

1126
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,511
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1127
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,631
<i>That marvellous face</i>

1128
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,913
<i>I never should begin</i>

1129
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,111
<i>Those cheeks</i>
<i>That neck</i>

1130
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,231
<i>That chin</i>

1131
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,558
<i>Will surely do me in</i>

1132
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,796
<i>I must be smart</i>
<i>And hide my heart</i>

1133
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,070
<i>If she's within a mile</i>

1134
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,953
<i>If I don't duck</i>
<i>I'm out of luck</i>

1135
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:52,029
<i>She'd kill me with her smile</i>

1136
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,076
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1137
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,157
<i>That fabulous face</i>

1138
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,478
<i>It's clear I must beware</i>

1139
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,591
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

1140
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,631
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

1141
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,068
<i>But it's worth it</i>

1142
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,352
<i>For that face</i>

1143
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,591
Bloom help Ulla down?

1144
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,629
All right. Bloom help Ulla down.

1145
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,998
<i>That face</i>

1146
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,633
<i>That face</i>

1147
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,358
<i>That lovable face</i>

1148
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:58,831
<i>It melts my Swedish heart</i>

1149
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,159
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

1150
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,753
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

1151
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,316
<i>But it's worth it</i>

1152
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,594
<i>For that face</i>

1153
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,633
Again! Arabesque, prepare...

1154
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,671
...pirouette and twirl.

1155
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,871
And goose step, goose step...

1156
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,957
...waltz-clog and kick. Again!

1157
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,550
Arabesque, prepare,
pirouette and twirl.

1158
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,833
And goose step, goose step,
waltz-clog and kick! Again!

1159
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,679
Arabesque, prepare, pirouette!

1160
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,313
-Halt!
-Halt.

1161
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,398
-Halt!
-Halt!

1162
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,795
-This is bedlam! Bedlam!
-This is bedlam! Bedlam!

1163
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,518
Shut up!

1164
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,193
We must have some order here.

1165
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,073
Will all the dancing Hitlers
please wait off-stage right...

1166
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,670
...and all the singing Hitlers
off-stage left.

1167
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,958
Get that way.

1168
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,993
Carmen,
call in a singing Hitler, please.

1169
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,555
Yes, darling-- Roger.

1170
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,275
"Jacques LaPidus."

1171
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,474
"Jacques LaPidus."

1172
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,716
"Jack Lapidus."

1173
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,958
Well, Jack, what are you
going to sing for us?

1174
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,790
I would like to sing
"A Wandering Minstrel I."

1175
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,997
lf you must.

1176
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,596
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>

1177
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,631

-Thank you!
-<i>Patches</i>

1179
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,832
Next, please.

1180
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,395
" Donald Dinsmor<i>e.''</i>

1181
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,750
Well, Donald, if we--

1182
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,629
Well, Donald, I--

1183
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,876
-Hi, how are you?
-That's all right, Donald.

1184
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,510
Now, what are you
going to sing for us, friend?

1185
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,555
I'd like to sing
"The Little Wooden Boy."

1186
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,718
Thank you.

1187
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,071
Next!

1188
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,750
"Jason Green."

1189
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,035
Well, Jason,
what have you been up to lately?

1190
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,233
For the last 16 years, I have been
touring in <i>No No Nietzsche</i>.

1191
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,670
-You played Nietzsche?
-No, no.

1192
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,359
What are you gonna sing for us?

1193
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,755
" Have You Ever Heard
the German Band?"

1194
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,951
-No.
-That is the name of the song...

1195
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,230
...I am going to sing.

1196
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,153
Play it, please.

1197
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,199
Speed it up.

1198
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,997
<i>Haben Sie gehört</i>
<i>Das deutsche Band?</i>

1199
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,474

01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,908
<i>Mit a boom</i>

01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,680
<i>Mit a bing-bang bing-bang boom</i>

1202
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,430
<i>Oh, haben Sie gehört--</i>

1203
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,279
Halt! Halt!

1204
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,199
Halt! No, no, no.

1205
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,073
This man could never play
Adolf Hitler.

1206
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,919
The Führer wasn't
a mousy little mama's boy.

1207
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,519
The Führer was butch!

1208
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,119
And that is not how you sing...

1209
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,912
..." Haben Sie geh<i>ö</i>rt
das deutsche Band?"

1210
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,588
This is how you sing " Haben Sie
geh<i>ö</i>rt das deutsche Band?"

1211
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,631
B-flat. Two-two time!

1212
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,910
Modulate at the bridge!

1213
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,790

1218
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,355
<i>Mit a bing-bang bing-bang boom</i>

1219
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,109
<i>Russian folk songs</i>
<i>Und French ooh-la-la</i>

1220
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,517
<i>Can't compare</i>

1221
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,675
<i>We're saying</i>

1222
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,917

1223
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,917

01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,190
<i>Mit a zing</i>

1225
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,949
<i>Polish polkas</i>
<i>They're stupid und they're rotten</i>

1226
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,311

<i>If it ain't got that</i>

01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,279
<i>Mit a zing</i>

1233
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,232
<i>It's the only kind of music</i>

1234
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,513
<i>That we Hans und our honeys</i>
<i>Love to sing</i>

1235
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,356
That's our Hitler!

1236
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,310
Have your tickets ready.
Have your tickets ready.

1237
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,909
This way, please.
This way, please.

1238
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,236
Take your seats.

1239
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,389
Good evening, sir. Nice to see you.

1240
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,989
-Enjoy the show.
-Thank you.

1241
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,393
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.

1242
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,876
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

1243
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,119
Leo!

1244
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,838
Leo, who said
you could wear that hat?

1245
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,476
Nobody, Max. But I thought now that
I'm the producer of a Broadway show--

1246
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,193
-Has the curtain gone up yet?
-No.

1247
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,238
-Has the curtain come down yet?
-No.

1248
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,670
Then you're not a producer yet.
Give me that hat.

1249
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,314
Mr. Bloom! Leo.

1250
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,988
Your tie is all askew.

1251
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,430
Askew. Oh, thank you, Ulla.

1252
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,631
Have a good show.

1253
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,798
Roll them in the aisles.

1254
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,274
Okey-dokey.

1255
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,038
I will try to.

1256
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,118
But there's just so many of them.

1257
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,113
Gee, I thought we were partners,
sharing everything 50-50.

1258
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,437
Now I'm out in the cold, and you two
are busy askewing each other.

1259
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,039
Askewing? Never, Max.

1260
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,391
Hugs and kisses, yes,
but that's as far as I go.

1261
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,756
Gunter, you will pick me up back here
right after the curtain.

1262
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,636
Oh, God, will they love us?
Will they hate us?

1263
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,955
The suspense is killing me.

1264
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,311
I know.
I feel like I'm going into labour.

1265
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,711
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom.
Well, gentlemen, <i>merde</i>.

1266
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,552
And I just wanna
wish everybody good luck.

1267
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,672
-What? What did you say?
-Bite your tongue.

1268
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,155
Well, what's the matter?
All I said was "good luck."

1269
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,432
-He said it again.
-Hasn't anyon<i>e e</i>ver told you?

1270
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,154
<i>It's bad luck to say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1271
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,874
<i>If you do</i>
<i>I tell you</i>

1272
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,196
<i>It is certain by the curtain</i>
<i>You are through</i>

1273
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,355
Good luck.

1274
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,676
<i>It's bad luck to say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1275
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,599
<i>Once it's said</i>
<i>You are dead</i>

1276
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,950
<i>You will get the worst reviews</i>
<i>You ever read</i>

1277
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,115
Good luck.

1278
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,117
<i>Even at the Comédie Française</i>

1279
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,232
<i>On the opening night</i>
<i>They are scared</i>

1280
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,034
<i>''Bonne chance, mes amis''</i>
<i>No one says</i>

1281
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,754
<i>-The only word you'll ever hear is</i>
<i>-Merde</i>

1282
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,279
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

1283
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,040
<i>It's verboten</i>
<i>Wishing luck on opening night</i>

1284
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,834
<i>Take advice</i>
<i>Don't think twice</i>

1285
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,713
<i>Or your show will surely end up</i>
<i>In the Scheiss</i>

1286
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,718
<i>At the famous La Scala in Milan</i>

1287
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,275
<i>On opening night it's a rule</i>

1288
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,119
<i>''Al bocca lupo, '' they say with élan</i>

1289
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,673
<i>And just for luck they all shout</i>

1290
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,359
<i>-''Vaffanculo''</i>
<i>-I got it</i>

1291
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,199
<i>Now I'll never say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1292
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,836
<i>That's the rule</i>
<i>I'm no fool</i>

1293
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,554
<i>What do I say, I beg?</i>

1294
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,311
<i>What you say is ''break a leg''</i>

1295
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,919
-Break a leg?
-Yeah.

1296
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,553
-Break a leg.
-Break a leg.

1297
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,716
<i>If you're clever</i>

1298
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,989
Good luck.

1299
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,077
<i>You'll endeav our</i>

1300
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,309
<i>To never, never, never, never</i>
<i>Ever, ever, ever say</i>

1301
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,080
<i>On opening night</i>

1302
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,078
Five minutes to curtain.
Curtain going up in five minutes.

1303
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,511
I'm late. I must run!

1304
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,956
-Break a leg!
-Break a leg!

1305
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,512
Franz, what happened?

1306
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,598
I broke my leg.

1307
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,509
Now we'll have to cancel the show
and giv<i>e e</i>veryone their money back.

1308
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,199
Money back?

1309
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,515
Money back?

1310
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,869
Money back.

1311
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,911
Don't ever say that again.
Money back?

1312
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,758
Never.
We gotta think of something else.

1313
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,270
But Franz plays Hitler, Max,
and he has no understudy.

1314
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,153
You're right. What are we gonna do?
There must be a way out.

1315
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,920
lf I could only think of something.
Some way. Some--

1316
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,073
Hold it. I got it.
Roger, you. You could play Hitler.

1317
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,633
You know every line in the show.

1318
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,628
I've seen you at rehearsal, always
moving your lips along with the actors.

1319
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,400
It's an embarrassing habit.
I'm trying to break myself of it.

1320
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,114
But me play Hitler? No!
There's no way I could go on tonight.

1321
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,515
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.

1322
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,597
I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it!

1323
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,677
-Wow, that hurt.
-Roger.

1324
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,393
Listen to me.

1325
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,149
You can do it.

1326
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,351
You know you can do it,
and I know you can do it.

1327
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,835
You've been waiting all your lifetime
for this chance.

1328
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,554
And I'm not gonna let you
pass it up.

1329
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:08,998
You're going out there a silly,
hysterical, screaming queen.

1330
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,998
But you're coming back
a great big...

1331
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,155
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

1332
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,432
I've got to get into makeup.
Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.

1333
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:28,474
And, oh! My lucky
Gloria Swanson mole.

1334
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,953
Got it!

1335
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,272
Leo, the overture.

1336
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,277
Let's go.

1337
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,028
-Max.
-What?

1338
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,831
-Good luck, Leo.
-Good luck, Max.

1339
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,636
<i>Germany was having trouble</i>
<i>What a sad, sad story</i>

1340
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,469

<i>Where could that man be?</i>

1343
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,752
<i>We looked around</i>

01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,712
<i>And then we found</i>

1345
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,469
<i>The man for you and me</i>

1346
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,476
<i>And now it's</i>

1347
01:27:54,680 --> 01:28:01,119
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1348
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:07,634
<i>Deutschland is happy and gay</i>

1349
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,551
<i>We're marching to a faster pace</i>

1350
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:19,718
<i>Look out</i>
<i>Here comes the master race</i>

1351
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:26,755
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1352
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:33,469
<i>Rhineland's a fine land once more</i>

1353
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:38,674
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1354
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,273
<i>Watch out, Europe</i>

1355
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:46,429
<i>We're going on tour</i>

1356
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:51,555
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1357
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,989
<i>Look, it's springtime</i>

1358
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:59,309
<i>Winter for Poland and France</i>

1359
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,475
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1360
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,079
<i>Springtime</i>
<i>Springtime</i>

1361
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,713
<i>Springtime</i>
<i>Springtime</i>

1362
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,069
<i>Springtime</i>

<i>Springtime</i>

1364
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,719
<i>Come on, Germans</i>

1365
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,673
<i>Go into your dance</i>

1366
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,113
<i>I was born in Düsseldorf</i>
<i>And that is why they call me Rolf</i>

1367
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,594
<i>Don't be stupid, be a smarty</i>
<i>Come and join the Nazi Party</i>

1368
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,872
Well, I never!
Talk about bad taste.

1369
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,074
Come on, let's get out of here
before they kill us.

1370
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,639
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

1371
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,432
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,200
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

1373
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,592

<i>Heil to me</i>

1379
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,510
<i>I'm the Kraut who's out</i>

1380
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,950
<i>To change our history</i>

1381
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:01,232
<i>Heil myself</i>
<i>Raise your hand</i>

1382
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,955
<i>There's no greater dictator</i>
<i>In the land</i>

1383
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,038
<i>-Everything I do, I do for you</i>
<i>-Yes, you do</i>

1384
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,800
<i>If you're looking for a war</i>
<i>Here's World War II</i>

1385
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,072

<i>Heil myself</i>

01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,075
<i>Heil myself</i>

1394
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,273
<i>I love you.</i>

1395
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,516
<i>I was just a paperhanger</i>

1396
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,030
<i>No one more obscurer</i>

1397
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,549
<i>Got a phone call from the Reichstag</i>

1398
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,638
<i>Told me I was Führer</i>

1399
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,398
<i>Germany was blue</i>

1400
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,910
<i>Oh, what, oh, what to do?</i>

1401
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,997
<i>Hitched up my pants</i>

1402
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,350
<i>And conquered France</i>

1403
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:21,157
<i>Now Deutschland's smiling through</i>

1404
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,799
<i>Oh, it ain't no mystery</i>

1405
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,355
<i>If it's politics or history</i>

1406
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:30,358
<i>The thing you gotta know is</i>

1407
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,599
<i>Everything is show biz</i>

01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,517
<i>I'm the German Ethel Merman</i>
<i>Don't you know?</i>

1411
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,278
<i>We are crossing borders</i>

1412
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,837
<i>The New World Order is here</i>

1413
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,473
<i>Make a great big smile</i>

1414
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:56,639
<i>Everyone ''Sieg Heil'' to me</i>

1415
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:03,075
<i>Wonderful me</i>

1416
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,193
<i>And now it's springtime</i>

1417
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:12,838
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1418
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:19,431
-<i>Goose step</i>
-<i>Goose step's the new step today</i>

1419
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,955
<i>Bombs falling from the skies again</i>

1420
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:33,632
<i>Deutschland is on the rise again</i>

1421
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:45,278
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1422
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:53,912
<i>U-boats are sailing once more</i>

1423
01:33:54,160 --> 01:34:00,030
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1424
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,196
<i>-Means that</i>
<i>-Soon we'll be going</i>

1425
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,029
<i>-We've got to be going</i>
<i>-You know we'll be going</i>

1426
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:09,753
<i>You bet we'll be going</i>

1427
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,396
<i>You know we'll be going</i>

1428
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:20,199
<i>To war</i>

1429
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,239
Roger!

1430
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,598
"A satiric masterpiec<i>e.''</i>

1431
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,389
No way out.

1432
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,832
"A surprise smash."

1433
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,190
No way out.

1434
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,868
" It was shocking,
outrageous, insulting...

1435
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,832
...and I loved every minute of it."

1436
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,439
No way out!

1437
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,437
How could this happen?

1438
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:44,679
We picked the wrong play,
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

1439
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,235
Where did we go right?

1440
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,154
" Congratulations."

1441
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,229
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking these books...

1442
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,078
...and I'm leaving.

1443
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,840
Don't try and stop me.
I've made up my mind.

1444
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,598
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

1445
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,756
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

1446
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,473
I'm going to play ball with the lRS.

1447
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,477
I'm going to cooperate
with the authorities.

1448
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,319
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour.

1449
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,317
Maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library.

1450
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,159
Please keep in touch.
It's been very nice working with you.

1451
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,994
Leo. Leo. Leo.

1452
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,437
Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.

1453
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,153
Take it easy, all right?

1454
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,555
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

1455
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,988
You're acting out of panic.

1456
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,475
Give me those frigging books!
Give me!

1457
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:42,593
-Give me! Give me! Give me!
-I never should've listened to you.

1458
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,950
I was an honest man
before I met you.

1459
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:48,038
An honest man?
You were an honest mouse!

1460
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,879
-Give me. Give me.
-How I hate you!

1461
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:54,231
Double! Double! Double!

1462
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,118
Fat! Fat!

1463
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,799
I'm not that fat.

1464
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,433
Fat!

1465
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,358
Fat!

1466
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,712
Fatty!

1467
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,829
Fatso!
You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.

1468
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,314
Give me the fat books!

1469
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,195
-Never, never!
-Fat, fat, fatty, fat!

1470
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,238
-Oh, Jesus!
-Give them to me!

1471
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,555
Give me the books!

1472
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,193
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1473
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,197
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

1474
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,834
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

1475
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,837
Now, that's what I call celebrating.

1476
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,590
You. You lousy fruit.

1477
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,553
-You ruined me.
-You ungrateful breeder.

1478
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,672
After he stepped in and saved
your little show, I cannot-- My chains!

1479
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,792
-Leave him alone!
-My ltalian chains! My chains!

1480
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,112
You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

1481
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,470
You must die. You all must die!

1482
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,399
What are you doing,
you neo-Nazi nitwit?

1483
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,875
-Your show's a hit.
-Who cares?

1484
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,752
You made a fool out of Hitler.

1485
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,076
-He didn't need our help.
-He didn't need our help.

1486
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:21,152
Stand still! How can I shoot you
if you keep moving?

1487
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,719
Get back here!

1488
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,797
Under the desk! Under the desk!

1489
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,552
-Darling, quick, back in the closet.
-Okay.

1490
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,638
This is no good.

1491
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,229
I'm not killing anybody.

1492
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,233
You must cooperate!

1493
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,034
All right, Bialystock <i>und</i> Bloom.

1494
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,719
Now I got you.

1495
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,399
Say your prayers!

1496
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,877
Remember I'd tell you
when we're in too deep?

1497
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,798
-Yeah?
-We're in too deep.

1498
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,149
Franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!

1499
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,874
Oh, no, no.

1500
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:04,190
You snivelling cowards!

1501
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,118
Cringing under a desk?

1502
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,233
Clinging to life like baby butterflies.

1503
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,637
Franz Liebkind will show you
how to die like a man!

1504
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,674
Jammed.
Boy, when things go wrong....

1505
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,758
That's it. Next time, no author.

1506
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,030
What are you shooting
at us for anyway?

1507
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,753
You Teutonic twit!

1508
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,117
Wait. Wait a minute.

1509
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,719
I just got an idea.

1510
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,115
A way to close the show.

1511
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,709
Franz, I--

1512
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,551
-There, there.
-Where? Where?

1513
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,752
Franz, listen to me.

1514
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,190
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good.

1515
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,914
-Why don't you shoot the actors.
-The actors?

1516
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,519
Yes, the actors.

1517
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,632
Everybody laughed at your
beloved Führer tonight, and why?

1518
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,559
Because of the actors.
The actors were making fun of him.

1519
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,159
Yeah, you're right, the actors!

1520
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,113
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.

1521
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:14,074
-Kill. Kill all the actors.
-I must kill all the actors.

1522
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,669
Wait a minute!

1523
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,912
What are you talking about?

1524
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,759
What do you mean, " kill the actors"?
You can't kill the actors.

1525
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,190
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

1526
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,311
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

1527
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,988
-Here. Listen--
-Open up, it's the police!

1528
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,031
-The police!
-The police!

1529
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,589
Come on, boys.

1530
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,155
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party. I had nothing--

1531
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,112
You, drop that gun.

1532
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,839
-Ociffers!
-What's going on here?

1533
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,439
This crazy Kraut is crackers!

1534
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,676
He crashed in here
and crassly tried to kill us.

1535
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,952
-Oh, Roger, what alliteration.
-Thank you, darling.

1536
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,955
Okay, youse two can go.

1537
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,991
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1538
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,518
Tried to kill him, eh?

1539
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,718
Officer O'Rourke, take this man in.

1540
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,319
Next stop, Sing Sing.

1541
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,196
Sing Sing?
You'll never take me alive!

1542
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:15,318
-What happened?
-I broke my other leg.

1543
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,356
All right, who are you,
and why was he trying to shoot you?

1544
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,189
I haven't the slightest idea,
Sergeant O'Toole.

1545
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,392
The name is O'Bialystock.

1546
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,388
I was just passing by on me way
to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...

1547
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,149
...and I ducked in to see
what the hell was going on.

1548
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:44,036
And now I'll be on me way,
before me voice gets any higher.

1549
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,832
As we say in the old country, "Taxi!"

1550
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,234
Hold it!

1551
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,879
Hey, sarge, look at this.

1552
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,150
-What?
-I found these two accounting books.

1553
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:59,514
-This one says, "Show to the lRS."
-And what's the other one say?

1554
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,518
" Never show to the lRS."

1555
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,314
I think the three of you
better come downtown with me.

1556
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,752
-Three?
-Yeah, you and them two books.

1557
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,148
Mr. Bialystock?

1558
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,511
Mr. Bloom?

1559
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,870
Where are you?

1560
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:27,709
Everyone is waiting for you
at the opening-night party.

1561
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,957
Ulla, help me.

1562
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,754
What happened to you?

1563
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,193
I know.

1564
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:45,234
You hung up your coat
while you were still in it.

1565
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,840
Thank you for helping me down.

1566
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,713
What were you doing up there?

1567
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,114
Hiding.

1568
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,548
I was hiding.

1569
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,637
From who? From what?

1570
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,955
From the police.

1571
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,277
They were just here.
They've arrested Max.

1572
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,675
-They found the books?
-I don't know what to do.

1573
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,029
Poor Max.

1574
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,834
Maybe I should turn myself in
and go to jail with him.

1575
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,238
Well, my sweet cupcake,
I know we both love Max...

1576
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,639
...but it seems to me
you have two choices.

1577
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,119
Number one, you can go to jail
with Mr. Bialystock...

1578
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,359
...for years and years and years.

1579
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,074
Or number two...

1580
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:50,513
...you can take that 2 million dollars
and Ulla, and go to Rio.

1581
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:54,599
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.

1582
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,677
Oh, what should I do?

1583
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,714
Should I go to jail or go to Rio?

1584
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,395
Mail call.

1585
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,712
Hey, fatso.

1586
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,516
I'm not that fat!

1587
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,312
Says you.

1588
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,551
You got a postcard.

1589
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,711
A postcard? From where?

1590
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,798
Brazil.

1591
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,517
Brazil.

1592
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,429
Who do I know in Brazil?

1593
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,675
Why am I asking you?

1594
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,075
" Dear Max, Rio is everything
you said it was and more.

1595
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,154
Ulla and I think of you
every chance we get.

1596
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,353
<i>In the morning, when we</i>
<i>have breakfast on our terrace...</i>

1597
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,073
<i>...many different herrings.</i>

1598
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,073
<i>In the afternoon, when we rub</i>
<i>each other's sun-drenched bodies...</i>

1599
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:01,150
<i>... with banana-cream coconut oil,</i>
<i>number 15.</i>

1600
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:07,110
<i>And then, in the evening, when</i>
<i>we samba together in the moonlight.''</i>

1601
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:10,437
<i>You'll find your happiness in Rio</i>

1602
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:13,712
<i>The beaches there</i>
<i>Are strewn with pearls</i>

1603
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,071
<i>The tropic breezes</i>
<i>Always blow there</i>

1604
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,670
<i>And so, we hear</i>
<i>Do the girls</i>

1605
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,271
<i>''Sorry, must run. U lla's waiting.</i>

1606
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,393
<i>It's almost 11.</i>

1607
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,231
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

1608
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,558
<i>Your pal, Leo.''</i>

1609
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,598
<i>Just like Cain and Abel</i>

1610
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,075
<i>You pulled a sneak attack</i>

1611
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,714
<i>I thought that we were brothers</i>

1612
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,310
<i>Then you stabbed me in the back</i>

1613
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,308
<i>Betrayed</i>

1614
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,830
<i>Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed</i>

1615
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,359
<i>Like Samson and Delilah</i>
<i>Your love began to fade</i>

1616
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,074
<i>I'm crying in the hoosegow</i>
<i>You're in Rio getting laid</i>

1617
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,157
<i>Betrayed</i>

1618
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,909
<i>Let's face it, I'm betrayed</i>

1619
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:12,513
<i>Boy, have I been taken</i>

1620
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:16,674
<i>Oy, I'm so forsaken</i>

1621
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,313
<i>I should have seen</i>
<i>What came to pass</i>

1622
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,999
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>To watch my ass</i>

1623
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,634
<i>I feel like Othello</i>
<i>Everything is lost</i>

1624
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,034
<i>Leo is Iago</i>

1625
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,514
<i>Max is double-crossed</i>

1626
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,233
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1627
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,476
<i>Did I mention I'm betrayed?</i>

1628
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,513
<i>Now I'm about to go to jail</i>
<i>There's no one who will pay my bail</i>

1629
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,315
<i>I have no one who I can cry to</i>
<i>No one I can say goodbye to</i>

1630
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,877
I'm drowning!

1631
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,513
I'm drowning!

1632
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,438
I'm drowning here!

1633
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:46,110
I'm going down for the last time.

1634
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:51,072
I can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes.

1635
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:56,838
I see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence.

1636
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:01,358
I'm running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.

1637
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:04,313
No, Rex, not on the alfalfa.

1638
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,358
And I see my mother.

1639
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,030
I see Mama standing
on the back porch...

1640
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,993
...in a worn but clean
gingham gown.

1641
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,272
And I hear my mama
calling out to me.

1642
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,754
Alvin!

1643
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,837
Don't forget your chores.

1644
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,838
The wood needs a-cording
and the cows need a-milking.

1645
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,713
Alvin! Alvin!

1646
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,428
Wait a minute.

1647
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,676
My name's not Alvin.

1648
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,956
That's not my life.

1649
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,836
Somebody else's life
is flashing before my eyes.

1650
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,517
What the hell is that about?

1651
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,758
I'm not a hillbilly.
I grew up in the Bronx.

1652
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,112
<i>But wait, now I remember</i>

1653
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,595
<i>How did it begin?</i>
<i>He walked into my office</i>

1654
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,313
<i>With his cockamamie scheme</i>

1655
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,795
<i>You can make more money</i>
<i>With a flop than with a hit</i>

1656
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,195
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

1657
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,356
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

1658
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,074
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>Goodbye, Max</i>

1659
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,635
<i>Lord, I want that money</i>
<i>I'm back, Max</i>

1660
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,068
<i>Come on, Leo, we can do it</i>

1661
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,157
<i>Step one, find the play</i>

1662
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,193
<i>See it, smell it, touch it, kiss it</i>
<i>Hello, Mr. Liebkind</i>

1663
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,628
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,353

01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,397
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

1666
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,478
<i>Step two, hire the director</i>
<i>Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it--</i>

1667
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,671
<i>Two, three, kick,</i>
<i>Turn, turn, turn, kick, turn</i>

1668
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,393
<i>U lla</i>

1669
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,832
<i>Step three, raise the money</i>

1670
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,230
<i>Along came Bialy</i>

1671
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,635
<i>Step four, hire all the actors</i>

1672
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,990
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>
<i>A thing of shreds and--</i>

1673
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,191
<i>Next</i>
<i>The little wooden boy</i>

1674
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,118
<i>Next</i>
<i>That's our Hitler</i>

1675
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,676
<i>Break a leg</i>
<i>I broke my leg</i>

1676
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,836
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1677
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:58,077
<i>A surprise smash</i>
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1678
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,555
<i>It'll run for years!</i>
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

1679
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,398
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

1680
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,232
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1681
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,032
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1682
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,674
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>

1683
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,279
<i>Lousy fruit</i>
<i>Kill the actors</i>

1684
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,993
<i>You ever eat with one?</i>

1685
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:15,033
<i>Then you ran to Rio</i>
<i>And you're safely out of reach</i>

1686
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:16,514
<i>I'm behind these bars</i>

1687
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:21,316
<i>You're banging U lla on the beach</i>

1688
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,910
<i>Just like Julius Caesar</i>

1689
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,236
<i>Was betrayed by Brutus</i>

1690
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:30,631
<i>Who'd think an accountant</i>
<i>Would turn out to be my Judas</i>

1691
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,229
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1692
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:37,479
<i>Is this how I'm repaid?</i>

1693
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,557
<i>To be</i>

1694
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:46,871
<i>Betrayed</i>

1695
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:49,116
<i>Betrayed</i>

1696
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,710
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

1697
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,272
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

1698
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,636
We find the defendant...

1699
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,910
...incredibly guilty.

1700
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,150
Hold me, touch me.

1701
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,476
I'm a little busy.

1702
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,839
Does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf?

1703
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,590
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

1704
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,111
I admit, for the last 20 years
I've been a lying, double-crossing...

1705
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,517
...two-faced, backstabbing,
despicable crook.

1706
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,119
But I had no choice.

1707
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,273
I was a Broadway producer.

1708
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,553
A man without a conscience...

1709
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,149
...and with no one
who gave a damn about him.

1710
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,033
And that, Your Honour,
is what hurts the most.

1711
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:46,195
I thought I'd at last
found a loyal partner.

1712
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:49,195
A man I cared about...

1713
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,397
...and who I thought
cared about me.

1714
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,239
What breaks my heart is now...

1715
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,670
...when I need him most,
he's deserted me.

1716
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,269
I will probably never see
or hear from him ever again.

1717
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,833
That's not true!

1718
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,639
Order! Order in the court!

1719
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,794
And stop that samba!

1720
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,992
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom...

1721
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,919
...Max Bialystock's partner.

1722
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,270
And who are you, my dear?

1723
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,870
My name is
Ulla lnga Hansen Benson...

1724
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:27,029
...Yonsen Tallen-Hallen
Svaden Svanson Bloom.

1725
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,719
Bloom?

1726
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,388
-You're his wife?
<i>-Ja</i>, Your Honour.

1727
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,239
He wouldn't do it
unless we got married.

1728
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,549
What a schmuck.

1729
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,955
Now, Mr. Bloom,
why in the world would you...

1730
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,390
...want to come back here
and give yourself up?

1731
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,114
Why? To speak on his behalf.

1732
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:51,750
We all know that Max Bialystock
is a lying, double-crossing...

1733
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:56,272
...two-faced, slimy,
manipulative, underhanded--

1734
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,993
Please...

1735
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,833
...don't help me.

1736
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,673
Your Honour-- Your honour,
if I may address the court.

1737
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,233
The law was created to protect
people from being wronged.

1738
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:15,069
So whom has
Max Bialystock wronged?

1739
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,192
-Well, not these dear ladies.
-No.

1740
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,391
And not me, not--

1741
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,711
Not me.

1742
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:25,156
I was this nobody.

1743
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,511
No on<i>e e</i>ver called m<i>e ''</i> Leo" before.

1744
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,678
I mean, Your Honour,
I know it isn't a big legal point...

1745
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:35,873
...but even when I was in kindergarten
everybody always called m<i>e ''</i> Bloom."

1746
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:40,194
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that even when I was in Rio...

1747
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:44,916
...and had everything
I'd ever dreamed of...

1748
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,389
...I suddenly realized that--

1749
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,591
That this man....

1750
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,192
This man....

1751
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,151
<i>No one ever made me</i>
<i>Feel like someone</i>

1752
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:01,517
<i>Till him</i>

1753
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:07,350
<i>Life was really nothing</i>
<i>But a glum one</i>

1754
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,791
<i>Till him</i>

1755
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:15,235
<i>My existence bordered on the tragic</i>

1756
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:18,831
<i>Always timid</i>
<i>Never took a chance</i>

1757
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,477
<i>Then I felt his magic</i>

1758
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:26,071
<i>And my heart began to dance</i>

1759
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,870
<i>I was always frightened</i>
<i>Fraught with worry</i>

1760
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:33,270
<i>Till him</i>

1761
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,750
<i>I was going nowhere in a hurry</i>

1762
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,192
<i>Till him</i>

1763
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,559
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1764
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,835
<i>Filled it to the brim</i>

1765
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:58,910
<i>There could never</i>
<i>Ever be another one</i>

1766
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:06,118
<i>Like him</i>

1767
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,033
Leo....

1768
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,673
Leo...

1769
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:21,189
...I never realized.

1770
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,115
-You're a good singer.
-Thank you.

1771
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:30,438
-No, really, like a professional.
-Well, I sang it for you, Max.

1772
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,518
I sang it because I'm your friend.

1773
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,233
You are?

1774
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:40,033
I've had a lot of relationships...

1775
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,196
...but you couldn't call
any of them "friend."

1776
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,311
But come to think of it...

1777
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,757
...no on<i>e e</i>ver, ever really knew me.

1778
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:51,236
<i>Till him</i>

1779
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:56,795
<i>Everyone was always out</i>
<i>To screw me</i>

1780
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,834
<i>Till him</i>

1781
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:06,198
<i>Never met a man I ever trusted</i>

1782
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,632
<i>Always dealt with shysters</i>
<i>In the past</i>

1783
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,110
<i>Now I'm well-adjusted</i>

1784
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:19,190
<i>'Cause I've got a friend at last</i>

1785
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,831
Don't help me.

1786
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:29,158
<i>Always playing singles</i>
<i>Never doubles</i>

1787
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:32,033
<i>Till him</i>

1788
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,278
<i>Never had a pal</i>
<i>To share my troubles</i>

1789
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:54,917
<i>Till him</i>

1790
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:59,871
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1791
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:05,474
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>

1792
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:08,394
<i>There could never ever be</i>

1793
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:14,072
<i>Another one</i>

1794
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:25,832
<i>Like him</i>

1795
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,951
Gentlemen, it breaks my heart...

1796
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,435
...to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

1797
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,278
So I won't.

1798
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:40,040
Five years in the state penitentiary
at Sing Sing.

1799
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,232

Congratulations.

1810
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,957
You now own 45 percent...

1812

-Six hundred percent.

Keep selling.

1814

All right, break it up! Break it up!
Quiet! Give me that.

1815
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:27,871
How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

1816
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,674
No knife fights in rehearsal.

Hi. What are you in for,
lack of rhythm?

1818
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,635
Get in line.
Everybody get in line, right away!

Hey, you.

01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,472
The warden wants to get in
on this thing.

1828

Tell the warden he now owns
100 percent of <i>Prisoners of Love</i>.

Hey, Bialystock, Bloom, Liebkind,
good news!

1834
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,433
This just came from the governor.

1835
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,790
"Gentlemen, you are hereby
granted a full pardon...

1836
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,958
...for having, through song and dance,
brought joy and laughter...

1837
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:31,869
...into the hearts of every murderer,
rapist and sex maniac in Sing Sing."

1838
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,355
-You're free!
-Free?

1839
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,154

01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,593
<i>Blue skies above</i>

1853
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,438
<i>'Cause we're still prisoners</i>

1854
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,119
<i>We're still prisoners</i>

1855
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:31,114
<i>We're still prisoners of love</i>

1856
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:35,393
<i>-Love, love, love</i>
<i>-Love, love, love, love</i>

1857
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,552
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

1858
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:44,552
<i>Love</i>

1859
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,752
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1860
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,791
<i>Up off our backs</i>

1861
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,595
<i>Back on the Great White Way</i>

1862
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,677
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1863
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,438
<i>Back on our tracks</i>

1864
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:13,791
<i>We're back on top to stay</i>

1865
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,993
<i>So when we take your money</i>
<i>Never fear</i>

1866
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:21,795
<i>We'll knock Broadway</i>
<i>Right on its ear</i>

1867
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,718
<i>The cast is great</i>
<i>The script is swell</i>

1868
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,512
<i>But this we're telling you, sirs</i>

1869
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,278
<i>It's just no go</i>
<i>You've got no show</i>

1870
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:30,517
<i>Without the producers</i>

1871
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,839
<i>We'll never quit</i>

1872
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,314
<i>Hit after hit</i>

1873
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:46,275
<i>The producers</i>
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1874
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,311
<i>The overture is over</i>

1875
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,636
<i>The curtain starts to rise</i>

1876
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,831
<i>You're suddenly in clover</i>

1877
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,235
<i>You can't believe your eyes</i>

1878
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:42,431
<i>You're sitting on the aisle</i>

1879
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,756
<i>You break into a smile</i>

1880
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,791
<i>Why this magic feeling?</i>

1881
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,993
<i>And then you realize</i>

1882
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,112
<i>That there is</i>

1883
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:58,279
<i>Nothing like a show on Broadway</i>

1884
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,314
<i>Nothing like a Broadway show</i>

1885
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:05,910
<i>Hearts will skip a beat on Broadway</i>

1886
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:08,509
<i>If you're feeling blue</i>
<i>I'm telling you</i>

1887
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:10,517
<i>That's the place to go</i>

1888
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,676
<i>Movies drag</i>
<i>Their endings sag</i>

1889
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,438
<i>TV's just a bore</i>

1890
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,517
<i>So hit the street</i>
<i>And move your feet</i>

1891
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,153
<i>To the place we all adore</i>

1892
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,717
<i>Because there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

1893
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:26,674
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1894
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,518
<i>It's often been said</i>
<i>The theatre is dead</i>

1895
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:30,312
<i>The critics repeat it en masse</i>

1896
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,238
<i>But the theatre's alive</i>
<i>It's gonna survive</i>

1897
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,953
<i>Although it's a pain in the ass</i>

1898
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:35,878
<i>You waited forever</i>
<i>And finally got tickets</i>

1899
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,832
<i>To get to your seat</i>
<i>You gotta cross pickets</i>

1900
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,758
<i>The guy to your right</i>
<i>Is frightfully tight</i>

1901
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:42,110
<i>The guy to your left</i>
<i>Appears to have rickets</i>

1902
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:44,117
<i>The music's yuck</i>
<i>The lyrics suck</i>

1903
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,072
<i>The casting is all wrong</i>

1904
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,032
<i>And when you reach the bathroom</i>

1905
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,468
<i>The line is five miles long</i>

1906
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:53,753
<i>But still there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

1907
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,669
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1908
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,518
<i>You swear you'll never go again</i>

1909
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,472
<i>It's simply not worthwhile</i>

1910
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,636
<i>You make that v ow</i>
<i>And then somehow</i>

1911
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:08,152
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>

1912
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:11,432
<i>That's why there's</i>

1913
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:15,315
<i>Nothing like a show</i>
<i>On Broadway</i>

1914
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,875
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1915
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:19,399
<i>Till you're in movies</i>

1916
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,639
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1917
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,799
<i>And though it is expensive</i>
<i>At a hundred bucks a throw</i>

1918
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,514
<i>There's nothing</i>

1919
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:36,955
<i>Like a Broadway show!</i>

1920
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,317

<i>-Goodbye</i>
<i>-Get lost</i>

1937

<i>Get out</i>

1938
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,319
It's over.
