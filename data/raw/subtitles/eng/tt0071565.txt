Hey! What's wrong?

24
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,575
Open your eyes!

25
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,995
Nami!

26
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,878
Grandfather!

27
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,963
What happened?

28
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,592
A giant monster will destroy the city

29
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,969
and trample all who flee!

30
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,512
What?

31
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,264
A monster?

32
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,933
So the old man and the girl

33
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,144
are descendants
of the royal house of Azumi?

34
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,063
My big brother knows his stuff!
- 'Course l do.

35
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,108
l've been working
on the upcoming Expo so long,

36
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,486
l'm practically Okinawan now.

37
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,947
Her prophecy was pretty scary.

38
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,919
Here's the entrance
to the Gyokusen cave.

39
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,297
You have to find another guide.
l have work to do.

40
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,216
Got it. Thank you!

41
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,635
See ya.

42
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,306
lt's Shimizu!

43
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,393
- We've been waiting for you!
- Something happen?

44
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,395
We discovered a strange cave.

45
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,980
A cave?

46
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,191
This is it.

47
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,802
Let us get some pictures!

48
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,430
Stop shoving.

49
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,391
No one past this point
till the survey is done.

50
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,269
You there!
Even reporters must follow the rules.

51
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,979
Get back!

52
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,564
Reporters?

53
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,568
What's so funny?

54
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,780
l'm an archaeologist
from Shuri University.

55
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,032
My name's Saeko Kaneshiro.

56
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,242
An archaeologist?

57
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,121
Amazing!

58
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,085
This mural was painted
by the ancient Okinawans.

59
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,379
Ancient Okinawans?

60
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,385
This is a mountain
rising out of the clouds.

61
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,388
And this is the sun.

62
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,599
But what could the two suns mean?

63
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,688
This one's a mystery to me.

64
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,359
These are monsters. Two of them.

65
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,861
Must be some kind of prophecy.

66
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,488
Prophecy?

67
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,782
This one here...

68
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,911
looks like this thing.

69
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,496
What is it?

70
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,292
Perhaps King Caesar,
the guardian deity of the Azumi monarch.

71
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
King Caesar?

72
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,008
The royal house of Azumi has a legend.

73
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,013
Long ago, mainlanders
came here to Okinawa.

74
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,391
They tried to destroy
the house of Azumi.

75
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,602
But a monster appeared,
gleaming like copper,

76
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,313
and saved the royals
and their subjects.

77
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,483
lts name was King Caesar.

78
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,661
"A black mountain...

79
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,414
will appear in the sky.

80
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,961
And when it does..."

81
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,583
Mr. Shimizu!

82
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,380
You're going to Tokyo too?
- Yeah.

83
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,216
First vacation in years. And you?

84
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,968
l'm taking this.

85
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,975
l've deciphered the mural...

86
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,563
but this statue is still a mystery.

87
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,734
l plan to ask Professor Wagura
at Johoku University for help.

88
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,611
Professor Wakura?

89
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,488
Of course.

90
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,742
He's a world-renowned archaeologist,
isn't he?

91
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,288
Excuse me, but who are you?

92
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,582
A freelance reporter...

93
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,501
though some might call me
a muckraker.

94
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,507
Joking aside,
l'm interested in that statue too.

95
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,095
A scoop on that little guy
could really pay off.

96
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,348
l hope you'll keep me in mind.

97
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,354
Look at those clouds!

98
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,652
lt looks like a black Mount Fuji.

99
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,031
"When the black mountain
rises above the clouds...

100
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,366
a great monster will come forth

101
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,535
and destroy the world."

102
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,873
Part of the prophecy from the mural.

103
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,333
The mural?

104
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,712
The prophecy continues:

105
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,965
"But when the red moon sets...

106
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,052
and the sun rises in the west...

107
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,680
two monsters will join forces
to save the world."

108
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,937
A giant monster will destroy the city

109
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,648
and trample all who flee!

110
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,177
Thanks for keeping me company.

111
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,097
Here you are.

112
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,350
No, really. l'll be fine now.

113
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,146
Hey!

114
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,281
- Keisuke.
- Hello, Uncle.

115
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,283
l brought you a visitor.

116
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,457
That was so mean!

117
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,627
You could have said
Professor Wakura was your uncle!

118
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,297
Sorry. Just having some fun.

119
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,340
You're awful!

120
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,051
Uncle, where's Masahiko?

121
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:28,515
He found a strange piece of metal
in an Okinawan cave.

122
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,892
He took it to Professor Miyajima's lab.

123
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,739
Just as l thought.

124
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,575
lt's some sort of space titanium.

125
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,618
Space titanium?

126
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,831
So it came from outer space?

127
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,128
Earthquake!

128
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,684
That's ten days straight,
isn't it, Father?

129
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,077
More on the recent earthquakes.

130
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,289
The tremor measuring two
on the seismic intensity scale

131
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,708
that began near Cape Nemuro, Hokkaido,

132
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,545
is moving steadily south
toward the Tohoku region.

133
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,716
No one knows
what's behind this moving tremor.

134
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,554
Some say a huge creature
is burrowing underground -

135
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,072
Next.

136
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,909
These murals are very strange...

137
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,955
yet l know l've seen them before.

138
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,917
Professor, you should get some sleep.

139
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,419
lt's okay.

140
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,170
l'm fine.

141
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,799
Could you get me some coffee?

142
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,175
Sure.

143
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,052
Make it strong.

144
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,274
Give me that statue!

145
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,221
- Professor!
- Take this and run!

146
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
Keisuke!

147
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,916
Are you okay?

148
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,675
Professor, it's Godzilla!

149
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,112
"When the black mountain
rises above the clouds,

150
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,617
a great monster will come forth
and destroy the world."

151
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,162
The ancient prophecy is coming true.

152
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,916
Yes, but l never imagined
it would be Godzilla.

153
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,252
Uncle, l have to go.

154
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,838
- Where?
- Gotenba.

155
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,257
l'm worried about
Professor Miyajima and my brother.

156
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,802
lt's dangerous!
lt's a war zone by now!

157
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,679
l have to at least try.

158
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,640
Nami!

159
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,810
What's wrong, Grandfather?

160
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,561
A monster!

161
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,190
Godzilla has appeared on the mainland
just like you foretold!

162
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,363
The only one who can defeat Godzilla

163
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,990
is our own King Caesar!

164
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,369
But the mystery...

165
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,872
has yet to be unraveled.

166
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,501
Godzilla!

167
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,756
Wreak vengeance upon the mainlanders,

168
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,218
those who sought to destroy
the royal house of Azumi.

169
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,556
Godzilla!

170
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,634
Anguirus attacking its friend Godzilla?
lt doesn't add up!

171
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,792
What a mess.

172
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,278
l'm positive.

173
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,740
lt's the same metal
that Masahiko found in that cave...

174
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,575
space titanium.

175
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,537
You're right.

176
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,831
lt looks exactly the same.

177
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,584
Masahiko.

178
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,922
Perhaps you'll show me
that cave sometime soon.

179
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,759
Let's go after Godzilla.
l need a closer look.

180
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,012
Sure. We can take my car.

181
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,683
Unusual pipe.

182
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,019
l made it in my spare time.

183
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,397
The metal part contains astanopkaron.

184
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,066
lf you separate the parts,

185
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,027
it generates magnetic waves

186
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,612
that can destroy
positive and negative electrodes.

187
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,780
l'll show you.

188
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,117
Ready?

189
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
Watch the oscillograph.

190
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,584
That's some pipe!

191
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,629
Two Godzillas? What's going on?

192
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,149
l didn't expect the real Godzilla
to show up so soon.

193
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,442
The earthlings must be surprised.

194
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,368
That explains it.

195
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,747
The Godzilla from Mount Fuji is a cyborg.

196
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,457
A cyborg?

197
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,376
lts body is made of space metal.

198
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,046
Mechagodzilla would be a fitting name.

199
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,340
That's it!

200
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,051
Anguirus must have called for Godzilla!

201
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,037
Godzilla...

202
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:13,334
you're mistaken if you think
you're a match for Mechagodzilla.

203
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,232
Now then...

204
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,292
Commander, Mechagodzilla's
head control stopped working.

205
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,377
We can't proceed like this!

206
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,298
We'll have to postpone
our attack on Tokyo.

207
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,345
Bring Mechagodzilla
back to base for repairs.

208
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,782
Masahiko!

209
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,035
Let's catch the first flight
to Okinawa tomorrow.

210
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,998
Mechagodzilla must be
under alien control.

211
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,377
The space titanium proves it.

212
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,547
Maybe we'll find some clues
in the Gyokusen cave.

213
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,909
Commander,
the repairs will take a while.

214
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,330
Sir, if we take too long...

215
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,208
headquarters will learn of our failure!

216
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,835
Don't worry.

217
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,921
We'll find an earth scientist
versed in space technology.

218
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,757
l have it!

219
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,593
Look here.

220
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,265
These tattoos are hieroglyphs
used by the ancient royal family.

221
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,310
And the hieroglyphs carved here

222
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,105
are a modified form of the same.

223
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,775
Now l know
where King Caesar slumbers.

224
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,026
What's it say?

225
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,739
"When the sun rises in the west...

226
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,952
place this statue on the stone shrine

227
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,872
at Azumi Castle."

228
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,793
The stone shrine at Azumi Castle?

229
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,129
So this...

230
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,639
"When the red moon sets
and the sun rises in the west,

231
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,310
two monsters will join forces
to save the world."

232
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,563
That was the prophecy
on the mural, right?

233
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,192
The sun rising in the west...

234
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,736
That's absurd.

235
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,739
What could it mean?

236
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,824
Tell agent R-1 ...

237
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:17,495
to steal that statue at once.

238
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,333
Now that they've solved the riddle,
they can wake King Caesar at any time.

239
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,669
He could rouse other monsters too.

240
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,556
l doubt the aliens expected us
to switch ships

241
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,600
on the way to Okinawa.

242
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,645
We outsmarted them.

243
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,511
lncredible, huh?

244
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,436
Further in?
- Yes, this way.

245
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,568
lkuko, watch your step.

246
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,734
We've been waiting for you, Professor.

247
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,527
Who are you?

248
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,406
l command the force
sent by Black Hole Planet 3

249
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,283
to conquer Earth.

250
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,702
Space aliens, just like l thought.

251
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,873
So you knew already?
lmpressive.

252
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,960
Mechagodzilla is our secret weapon
for conquering Earth,

253
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,796
but we lost control of its head.

254
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,382
lt must be repaired quickly

255
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,718
to keep our conquest on schedule.

256
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,970
So we thought...

257
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:46,477
we might call on the expertise
that earned you a Nobel Prize.

258
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,937
The answer's no!

259
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,147
But Professor...

260
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:56,445
Mechagodzilla uses cyborg technology
developed by our scientists

261
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:01,075
after a thorough analysis of Godzilla,
Earth's greatest monster.

262
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,997
You're a scientist yourself.
Surely that piques your curiosity.

263
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,921
- Don't touch her!
- You stay here!

264
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,506
Father!

265
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,384
- lkuko!
- Father!

266
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,054
Professor!

267
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,348
Father!

268
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,351
Where are they taking them?

269
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,270
Where?
- The death chamber.

270
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,612
Of course...

271
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,450
there's still time to save them.

272
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,389
l wonder
how Professor Miyajima's doing.

273
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,642
l hope they find some clues.

274
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,232
Something wrong?

275
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,318
l feel like someone's watching us.

276
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,030
Really?

277
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,949
What's wrong?

278
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,452
l thought l heard Godzilla's roar.

279
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,293
l don't hear anything.

280
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,961
You're right.

281
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,839
But l'm sure l heard something.

282
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,665
Why are you after that statue?

283
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,792
Answer me!

284
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,331
Keisuke!

285
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,835
The statue's gone!

286
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,673
l chased the thief,
but he fell overboard.

287
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,051
With the statue?

288
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,183
l don't like the way he fell.

289
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,393
What do you mean?

290
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,396
lt was like someone shot him.

291
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,317
You're bleeding!

292
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,364
Hello there.

293
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,785
A fine night for romance.

294
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,942
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,445
You said it was important,
so l locked it in the safe.

296
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,072
l'm in your debt.

297
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,407
- How was your voyage?
- Wonderful.

298
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,326
Glad to hear it.

299
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,246
Enjoy your stay in Okinawa.

300
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:53,375
You made a fool of me.
The stolen statue was a fake.

301
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,919
"Deceive your friend
to deceive your foe."

302
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,584
Mr. Masahiko Shimizu
has been gone two days.

303
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,712
Two days?

304
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,506
And Professor Miyajima
and his daughter?

305
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,008
They were with him.

306
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,303
They said they might be gone
a day or two.

307
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,681
We've had no further word.
lt has us worried too.

308
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,308
l see.

309
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,510
lt seems you're done with the repairs.

310
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,347
Nice work.

311
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,557
Please come down here.

312
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,662
Mechagodzilla will commence
operation at 6:00 a.m.

313
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,463
A toast to Mechagodzilla's return.

314
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,843
Release my daughter and Masahiko
as you promised!

315
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,011
You're right.

316
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,597
l'll see to that immediately.

317
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,558
Come with me.

318
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:25,712
Professor!

319
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,255
Father!

320
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,216
lkuko! Masahiko!

321
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:41,311
Enjoy your little reunion.
lt will be your last.

322
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,900
You had us worried.

323
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,445
l'm glad you two are okay.

324
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,655
Come over here.

325
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,454
- Father!
- Professor!

326
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,174
Are you okay?

327
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,016
Damn them!
They're trying to cook us alive!

328
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,544
- This is the professor's.
- That's right.

329
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,887
Who are you?

330
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,977
An alien?

331
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,815
Where are my brother
and the professor? Tell me!

332
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,901
You'll be joining them soon...

333
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,903
as a corpse.

334
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,635
Just who are you really?

335
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:39,971
l'm with lnterpol.

336
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,056
Nanbara's the name.

337
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,726
lnternational police?

338
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,603
That's right.

339
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,564
We got wind of their strange activities

340
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,649
six months ago.

341
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,861
We cast a net to apprehend them...

342
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,822
and you and your friends
got caught in it.

343
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,575
That's how l tracked you here.

344
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,044
On your feet.

345
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,930
Take us to your secret base.

346
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,966
The heat! l can't take much more!

347
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,344
lkuko, don't give up!

348
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,978
lkuko, hold on!

349
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,203
Open it.

350
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,075
Alpha!

351
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,494
Centaurus!

352
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,645
Get back!

353
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,151
Turn it off!

354
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,070
Masahiko!

355
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,241
Are you all right?

356
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,951
Shimizu!

357
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,619
Hurry!

358
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,329
Let's get out of here!

359
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:36,999
Freeze!

360
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,711
Hands up.

361
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,380
Now!

362
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,350
Watch out!

363
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,729
Hurry!

364
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,816
Quick! This way!

365
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,818
Professor!

366
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,074
Just a bit further.
My car's outside.

367
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,369
Those fools.

368
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:07,924
Wait!

369
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,460
That's the third time
you've saved my life.

370
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,128
The third?

371
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,381
On the ship too.

372
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,341
Right?

373
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,551
Look!

374
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,596
The moon has changed color!

375
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,309
A red moon...

376
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,729
"When the red moon sets..."

377
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,816
The prophecy's being fulfilled
one bit at a time.

378
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,026
Shimizu...

379
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,738
l'm going back in there
to take out those bastards.

380
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,825
You head to Azumi Castle.
- All right.

381
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,995
Let me help him.

382
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,040
Okay by you?
- Fine.

383
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,418
l'm going back in there.

384
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,922
Even if it was to save my daughter...

385
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,341
l helped those people.

386
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,136
l made a pact with the devil.

387
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,514
- You had no choice. You had to -
- No.

388
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:43,227
Only l can destroy
Mechagodzilla's head control.

389
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,938
Right, Shimizu?

390
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,819
All right.

391
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,238
ln that case...

392
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,574
take this.

393
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,868
lt may come in handy.

394
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,789
l'm glad you found it. Thanks.

395
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,397
- How are they?
- Later. Let's get to the castle!

396
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,720
Alpha!

397
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,263
Centaurus.

398
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,372
Hurry!

399
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,879
- ls that it?
- Yes.

400
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,313
Hand over the statue...

401
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,774
or these two die!

402
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,446
Bastards!

403
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,783
You brought all this upon us!

404
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,703
We wouldn't be in this trouble

405
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,914
if you'd left the statue alone.

406
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,499
Shut up!

407
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,418
Grandfather!

408
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,004
Hand it over now!

409
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,008
Saeko...

410
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,510
let's give it to them.

411
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,051
l'm Tamura from lnterpol.

412
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,554
- So you and Nanbara...?
- Yes, we're colleagues.

413
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,390
Really?

414
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,736
lt's two minutes to 6:00!

415
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,659
Look!

416
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,329
The sun! lt's rising in the west!

417
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,758
So that's it!

418
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,094
The sun rising in the west...

419
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,595
is a mirage!

420
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,245
King Caesar.

421
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,835
Commander, King Caesar
has appeared in Manzamo.

422
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,797
So our agents failed to get the statue.

423
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,678
Very well.
First we destroy King Caesar.

424
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,640
Launch Mechagodzilla!

425
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,909
We're too late!

426
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:35,287
We can still stop it
by destroying the control room!

427
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,705
Right! Let's go!

428
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,565
Mechagodzilla...

429
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,235
destroy King Caesar before he wakes!

430
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,919
Where are you going?

431
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,587
Let her go.

432
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,426
King Caesar can only
be awakened by a descendant...

433
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,595
of the royal house of Azumi...

434
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,807
and only Nami is left now.

435
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:49,945
The dark shroud of night vanishes

436
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,283
Dawn is breaking

437
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,870
Time to wake from your slumber

438
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,169
My Caesar!

439
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,214
On the beach l wait
beneath the fading stars

440
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,675
Caesar!

441
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:17,890
Come striding to me boldly
over the blue coral

442
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:23,270
And wipe the tears from my eyes

443
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:28,275
My heart yearns for you

444
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,488
l await your return

445
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:03,685
The dark shroud of night vanishes

446
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:09,525
Dawn is breaking

447
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,612
Time to wake from your slumber

448
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,536
My Caesar!

449
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,540
Beneath the palm trees l wait

450
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:32,881
Come to me boldly
through the red deigo flowers

451
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,636
Come grant my wishes

452
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,892
My heart yearns for you

453
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,896
l await your return

454
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,702
Mechagodzilla, destroy him!

455
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,546
l'm surprised to see
you're still alive, Professor.

456
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,801
But you mustn't underestimate us.

457
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,153
Let's go!

458
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,518
Please observe
Mechagodzilla in action.

459
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,896
Professor...

460
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,067
l must thank you again for your help.

461
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,308
Godzilla's still alive!

462
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,686
The second monster
in the ancient prophecy

463
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,480
must be Godzilla!

464
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,537
Godzilla's still alive?

465
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,373
We'll have to teach him another lesson.

466
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,337
Mechagodzilla, annihilate him!

467
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,402
That's it!

468
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,817
What's wrong? Mechagodzilla!

469
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,880
Damn him!

470
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,549
Godzilla turned himself
into a giant magnet.

471
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,598
Rocket engines, full power!

472
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:43,444
On my signal, toss a piece of the pipe
at each end of the control panel.

473
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:09,929
Move!

474
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,297
l don't believe it.

475
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,801
Mechagodzilla, our greatest weapon,
has been defeated.

476
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,884
lt's gonna blow! Run!

477
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,052
Wait!

478
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,915
ls my father...?

479
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,210
Don't worry.

480
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,046
l'm sure they got out alive.

481
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:00,284
Now the ancestors
of the royal house of Azumi

482
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,037
can rest in peace.

483
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:32,692
THE END
