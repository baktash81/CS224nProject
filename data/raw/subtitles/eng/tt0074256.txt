1
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:52,031
Someone once said if
it was raining brains...

2
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:54,398
Roxy Robinson
wouldn't even get wet.

3
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,064
Roxy spent his life making
two and two into five.

4
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:12,455
He could smell trouble
like others smelled gas.

5
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:14,199
But believe you me...

6
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,734
he shouldn't have taken that
alley by Parito's bakery.

7
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:43,584
Your name Robinson?

8
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,209
Roxy Robinson?

9
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,214
You work for Fat Sam?

10
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:54,715
Whatever game it was,
sure as eggs...

11
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,792
is eggs, Roxy the Weasel
had been scrambled.

12
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,478
I should be filling you in.

13
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,645
This guy's the hero of our story.

14
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:40,693
Name of Bugsy Malone.

15
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:45,909
A nice guy, a little too
popular with the broads.

16
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:50,279
Italian mother, Irish
father. Grown up confused.

17
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:55,393
Kinda mixed up. By the
way, my name's Sam.

18
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,603
Fat Sam, because of my physique.

19
00:03:57,993 --> 00:03:59,184
I ain't no dumb-bell.

20
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,785
And this ain't no bookshop.
This is my place.

21
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,849
Fat Sam's Grand Slam.
Best joint in town.

22
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:07,774
- Hi, Jelly.
- Hi, Bugsy.

23
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:39,862
We interrupt this program
to bring you a news flash.

24
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,458
We have reports of an incident
on the Lower East side...

25
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:47,870
involving the man known
as Roxy the Weasel.

26
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:51,287
Believed to be a member
of the gang of mobster king...

27
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,024
Fat Sam Stacette.
Robinson was the victim of a...

28
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:55,999
sensational event.

29
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,628
We go over to our
reporter on the spot...

30
00:04:59,254 --> 00:04:59,991
So tell me.

31
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,040
How'd you allow this to happen?

32
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,419
Roxy was one of my best!
What have you got to say...

33
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,081
you bunch of dummies?

34
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,860
Call yourselves hoodlums?

35
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,084
You're a disgrace to the
profession. You hear me?

36
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,498
And most of all, a
disgrace to me. Fat Sam.

37
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:22,509
And we all know
who's behind this.

38
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,953
Sure do, boss.

39
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:25,875
Don't need a hatful of brains...

40
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:28,160
- do you?
- Certainly not, boss.

41
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,113
So who is it, dummies?
Tell me! Who?

42
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,696
- Dandy...
- Dan.

43
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,792
Don't mention that
name in this office!

44
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:36,757
Take it easy, boss, sit down.

45
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:39,296
Come in.

46
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:44,376
I'm Blousey Brown. I'm a
singer, for the audition.

47
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,250
A singer. A singer!

48
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,946
I don't need a singer.
Come back tomorrow.

49
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,707
How about my audition?
You said okay last week.

50
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:57,045
Am I going mad? Are my
ears playing tricks on me?

51
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,250
Will you get out of here!

52
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,345
Dancers, dancers, surrounded
by namby-pamby dancers...

53
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:06,174
singers, piano players
and banjo players...

54
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:09,686
when I need brains.
Brains and muscles.

55
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,126
You've got us, boss.

56
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,639
You? You hunk of lard!

57
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,768
You got muscles where
you should have brains.

58
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,875
My canary's got more
brains than you! Dumb salami.

59
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,348
What's funny?

60
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:38,375
Don't worry, I've been trying
to see him for months.

61
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,264
- You have?
- Of course.

62
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,176
- What do you do?
- I'm the greatest tap dancer.

63
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,309
- You are?
- Of course I are. Cross my heart.

64
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,966
But all he says is
come back tomorrow.

65
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:52,229
How many times can
I come back tomorrow?

66
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,344
Anybody who is anybody...

67
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:07,360
will soon walk through that door.

68
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:11,060
At Fat Sam's Grand Slam speakeasy.

69
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,479
Always able to find you a table...

70
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:18,069
there's room for just one more
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...

71
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,435
speakeasy.

72
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,984
Once you get here,
feel the cheer...

73
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,890
like they say in the poem...

74
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,056
Fat Sam ain't humble...

75
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,485
but it's your home sweet home.

76
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,073
Plans are made here...

77
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:32,236
games are played here...

78
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,222
I could write a book.

79
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:37,471
Each night astounds you,
rumors are buzzin'...

80
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,024
stories by the dozen.
Look around you, cousin...

81
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,606
at the news we're making here.

82
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:45,704
Anybody who is anybody will
soon walk through the door...

83
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,774
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...

84
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,737
speakeasy.

85
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,029
There's a politician
sitting by the kitchen...

86
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,434
said he caught his fingers
in the one he was wishin'.

87
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,946
Once you get here,
feel the cheer...

88
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,738
like they say in the poem...

89
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:16,125
Fat Sam ain't humble...

90
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:18,453
but it's your home sweet home.

91
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,233
Plans are made here,
games are played here...

92
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,324
I could write a book.

93
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,775
Each night astounds you...

94
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,957
rumors are buzzin'...

95
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:28,205
stories by the dozen.

96
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,650
Look around you, cousin,
at the news we're making here.

97
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:34,786
Anybody who is anybody will
soon walk through the door...

98
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,413
at Fat Sam's...

99
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,413
Grand Slam...

100
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,047
speakeasy.

101
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:54,589
There's a politician...

102
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
sitting by the kitchen,
said he caught his fingers...

103
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,695
in the one he was wishin'.

104
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,159
Once you get here,
feel the cheer...

105
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,752
Hey, Mac, special on the rocks.

106
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,360
Each night astounds you...

107
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,074
rumors are buzzin',
stories by the dozen...

108
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,416
look around you, cousin,
at the news we're making here.

109
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,529
Anybody who is anybody will
soon walk through the door...

110
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,162
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...

111
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,491
speakeasy.

112
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,044
You know something?

113
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:31,095
You look like you put your
face on backwards this morning.

114
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,676
- You got too much mouth.
- I'll tell my dentist.

115
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,718
- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry. It's your fault.

116
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,768
What's that, a
hockey stick?

117
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,428
No, a baseball bat.

118
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,121
You're a baseball player?

119
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,715
No, a dancer. My mother
made me pack it.

120
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,919
- You a sports nut?
- It's for protection.

121
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,634
- You take it everywhere?
- No, I came about a job.

122
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:59,297
- You get it?
- They said come back tomorrow.

123
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,052
- What's your name?
- Brown.

124
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,682
Sounds like a loaf of bread.

125
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:06,350
Blousey Brown.

126
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:07,547
Blousey Brown?

127
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,379
A stale loaf of bread.

128
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,350
Very funny. Terrific.

129
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,010
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bugsy Malone.

130
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,976
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

131
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,199
It's okay, everybody.

132
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,881
Just a little excitement.

133
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:52,014
Razzmatazz, music. I wanna see
everyone enjoying themselves.

134
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,517
Can't say Fat Sam's place ain't
the liveliest joint in town.

135
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:04,234
Knuckles, this means trouble.

136
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,575
- You know what to do?
- Sure, boss.

137
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:04,785
Step on it, Jackson.

138
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,494
What is this?

139
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:36,892
Irving.

140
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,177
Get me out of here.

141
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:50,816
- Located the gun yet?
- I can't answer that.

142
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:53,729
- Not at liberty to say?
- No. I don't know the answer.

143
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,182
Where do the guns come from?

144
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,715
I'm not at liberty to say.

145
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,880
Ask Captain Smolsky.

146
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,645
O'Dreary, break up the crowd.

147
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,054
- Have you found the gun?
- No comment.

148
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,061
- And the source of the guns?
- No comment.

149
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:15,479
Is it true that only
one gang uses the gun?

150
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:16,442
No comment.

151
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,139
Can I give you a lift?

152
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,051
- You got a car?
- No.

153
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,366
How you gonna give me
a lift? Stand me on a box?

154
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,101
- We could share a taxi.
- Forget it. I don't share fares.

155
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,690
I'm a lady.
Furthermore, I'm broke.

156
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,779
- Who said share fares?
- No?

157
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:44,487
No. I wouldn't dream of it.

158
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,439
- You wouldn't?
- I thought you'd pay.

159
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:47,747
Swell.

160
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:51,934
Let's walk.
It's a nice night.

161
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,787
You shouldn't walk at
night. It's dangerous.

162
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:57,646
We'll be okay. We
got your baseball bat.

163
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,678
Quit the "we" bit.
You mean, I'll be okay.

164
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,824
- Which way you going?
- Which way you going?

165
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,860
- This way.
- Then I'm going this way.

166
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,040
Let me take that.

167
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,446
No, it's all right.
Look, beat it, will you?

168
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,983
- What have you got in here?
- Just a few books.

169
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,527
Few books? You
should start a library.

170
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:28,160
You should shut your mouth.

171
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,567
- Have you eaten?
- Ever since I was a kid.

172
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:34,773
- How come you're so skinny?
- Because I watch my weight.

173
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,174
I do that when I'm broke,
too. How about eating now?

174
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,068
No.

175
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,399
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.

176
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,245
- Not hungry?
- No.

177
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:45,687
I'm starving.

178
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,417
That's more like it.

179
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,529
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

180
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,073
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

181
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:00,079
Goodnight.

182
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:01,587
Goodnight.

183
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,155
Take it easy.

184
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:11,880
Don't do that, Knuckles.

185
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:13,509
It's how I got my name.

186
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,679
Knock it off or
change your name.

187
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,793
Tallulah, how long
we got to wait?

188
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,077
Coming. You don't want me
looking a mess, do you?

189
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:26,005
Snap it up, will you?

190
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:28,535
Put your flaps down,
or you'll take off.

191
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,711
You spend more time
prettying yourself than anyone.

192
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:35,079
If I didn't look this good,
you wouldn't look at me.

193
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,162
I'll see you in the car.

194
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,545
What about my audition?

195
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:43,348
Tomorrow, Fizzy. I'm tired.
Lots of important business.

196
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:46,842
I have to go home.
I promise you, tomorrow.

197
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:47,923
Goodbye. Goodnight.

198
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,127
- You coming, Velma?
- Sure.

199
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,228
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight, Miss Tallulah.

200
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,309
Oh, my purse.

201
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:15,932
Tomorrow.

202
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,269
Tomorrow never comes.

203
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:27,128
What kind of a fool
do they take me for?

204
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:30,220
Tomorrow.

205
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:34,972
A resting place for bums...

206
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:41,217
a trap set in the slums,
but I know the score.

207
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:45,847
I won't take no for an answer...

208
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:52,431
I was born to be a dancer...

209
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,695
tomorrow...

210
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,231
tomorrow, as they say...

211
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,645
another working day...

212
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:10,277
and another chore.

213
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,902
Tomorrow...

214
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:15,267
an awful...

215
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,398
place to be.

216
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:24,398
I gave up yesterday,
but they still want more.

217
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,309
They'll compare me...

218
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:29,769
to Fred Astaire...

219
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,726
when I'm done.

220
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:33,526
Yeah.

221
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,356
Anyone who feels the rhythm
moving through him...

222
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:48,484
knows it's gonna do him good
to let the music burst out...

223
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:54,698
when you feel it, show it,
let the people know it...

224
00:18:54,866 --> 00:19:01,236
let your laughter loose till your scream
becomes a a love shout...

225
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,591
tomorrow...

226
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:24,928
tomorrow's far away...

227
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,370
tomorrow, as they say...

228
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:32,168
is reserved for dreams.

229
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,453
Tomorrow...

230
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:38,824
tomorrow's looking grey...

231
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:45,742
a playground always locked
trains no winning teams.

232
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,345
Won't take no for an answer...

233
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,077
I was born to be a dancer...

234
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:57,170
now.

235
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:03,332
Anyone who feels the rhythm
moving through him...

236
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:04,878
knows it's gonna do him good...

237
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,422
to let the music...

238
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,163
burst out.

239
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,294
When you feel it, show it,
let the people know it...

240
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:17,919
let your laughter loose...

241
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:22,589
till your scream becomes
a love shout.

242
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,731
Going to the speakeasy tomorrow?

243
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:19,022
Depends. I'm trying my
luck at the Bijoux Theatre.

244
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,425
Lena Marelli's show?

245
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,732
She walked out. They're
changing everything.

246
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:25,441
How long have you
wanted to be a singer?

247
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,686
I don't want to be just a
singer, I wanna be a movie star...

248
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:32,805
in Hollywood.

249
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,591
What's so funny?

250
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:36,781
I don't know.

251
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:41,355
Time was when people were
happy being railway engineers...

252
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,513
or nurses.

253
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:43,862
Don't you want to be anybody?

254
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,728
No. I'm happy being me.

255
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:47,190
What do you do?

256
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,591
Oh, this and that.

257
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,689
- Crooked, huh?
- No, in-between.

258
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:52,974
What do you do for money?

259
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,673
- I find boxers.
- You do?

260
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,569
I used to fight myself.

261
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,106
You did? How good were you?

262
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:02,330
- I could've been a contender.
- You could?

263
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:04,931
Sure, but for a few things.

264
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,861
- Like what?
- Like a glass jaw.

265
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,314
Jelly legs, no stamina.

266
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,559
- And most of all...
- What?

267
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:14,987
I got scared.

268
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:17,937
Some contender.

269
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:21,105
- Want another drink?
- No, I had enough.

270
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,024
Come on.

271
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,695
- Thought you didn't have money?
- I haven't.

272
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,667
- Then how you...?
- Relax.

273
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,447
I'll think of something.

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,032
Two more drinks.

275
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:33,647
Look, pal, the food counter's
closed. the bar's closed.

276
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:35,273
My eyes are closing.

277
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,777
The whole joints closed.

278
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:38,442
I didn't want one, anyway.

279
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:48,994
Hello.

280
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:53,910
Operator, could you test this
line? I believe we have a fault.

281
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:58,533
- What number, please?
- Columbus 19785.

282
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:00,657
- I'll call you right back.
- Thank you.

283
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,003
How much I owe you?

284
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,408
Eight banana boozle specials,
with double ice cream.

285
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,032
Three beef spitfires...

286
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,959
two cream donuts
and a salami special.

287
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,288
Four dollars and 80 cents.

288
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:21,000
Excuse me.

289
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:29,130
Hello.

290
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:31,574
Let me out!

291
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,241
What are you doing? Let me out!

292
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,768
We interrupt commentary
of tonight's ball game...

293
00:23:56,088 --> 00:24:00,557
to bring you a bulletin
on gang warfare.

294
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,588
Police now officially state...

295
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,549
that the new weapon
of foreign manufacture...

296
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:08,137
known as the splurge gun
is being widely used...

297
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,008
by mobster gangs.
We now go back to...

298
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,875
our reporter, Seymour Scoop.

299
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,212
What's more, it's just not cricket.

300
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,908
There's a Mr. Bronx
Charlie to see you.

301
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,823
I'll be right in. Show them
into the conservatory.

302
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:50,599
Very good, sir.

303
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,366
Aren't you gonna play no more?

304
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:56,021
Later, my rose. Later.

305
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:03,904
Velia, oh Velia...

306
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,899
the witch of the wood...

307
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:18,733
would I not die for
you if I could.

308
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:24,832
Velia, oh Velia...

309
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,942
- Next!
- Very nice.

310
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,650
Lovely. Next.
Get off the stage!

311
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,580
Don't give up your day job.

312
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,869
I didn't figure
on this many people.

313
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:37,155
They all look like
jugglers and magicians.

314
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,552
Don't worry. You got no
competition. You'll walk it.

315
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:41,665
Hurry up.

316
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,239
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:48,212
I'm proud to be here.
In fact, I'm lucky to be here.

318
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,298
Because as I was coming here...

319
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,902
- How do I look?
- Fine.

320
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,834
- I look terrible.
- Believe me, you look swell.

321
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,502
- Honest?
- Honest.

322
00:26:57,668 --> 00:27:00,374
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. Beautiful.

323
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:03,925
Next.

324
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,503
Once I built a railroad...

325
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:11,086
Not that old chestnut.

326
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,629
Get him off. Next.

327
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,262
Good evening.

328
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:19,057
Suppose you're
wondering why we're here.

329
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,832
You bet.

330
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:21,160
Next.

331
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,303
Not one rabbit...

332
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,587
not two rabbits...

333
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:26,968
but three rabbits.

334
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,886
Next, next.

335
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:31,836
Next.

336
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,383
Yeah, great. Okay.

337
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,924
Next one there, please.

338
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:48,978
Give me your things.

339
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,058
Come on, come on.

340
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:03,177
Blousey Brown, singer.

341
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,290
Oh, nice face.

342
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,392
Great face, could
do a lot with that.

343
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:13,717
Oscar.

344
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:14,720
Oscar.

345
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:15,848
Oscar.

346
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,549
I'm back. I'll give
you one more chance.

347
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,021
Lena, you've come back to me.

348
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,967
I'll give you one more chance.

349
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:27,526
Otherwise, I'm out for
good. Out, out, out!

350
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,770
I won't be humiliated.

351
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:33,764
I'm the star and I
should be treated like one.

352
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,812
Hit it, Joe.

353
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,550
Show business,
it's in my veins...

354
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,223
gotta keep singing
that old refrain...

355
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:49,014
I thrill to all those tunes
that make me wanna dance...

356
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,017
Cheer up. There's
a million other jobs.

357
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:54,151
Sure, standing on the
corner asking for dimes.

358
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:57,562
It's only a matter of time.

359
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,935
I've walked the streets for
months, and the only fancy steps...

360
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:04,222
I've been doing is avoiding
the rent collector.

361
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:06,530
Takes time to be a movie star.

362
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:07,968
We could come back tomorrow.

363
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:11,851
Come back tomorrow? I spend
my whole life doing that.

364
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:13,976
Knock it off. Cool down.

365
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,403
I will not cool down.

366
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:16,600
Don't be stupid.

367
00:29:17,113 --> 00:29:18,814
Will you be quiet up there?

368
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:20,433
I'm rehearsing.

369
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,225
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

370
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:27,665
There's always Fat Sam's place.

371
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:29,644
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.

372
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,199
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.

373
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:33,357
You're good friends?

374
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:37,113
No, but when I see him I cross my
fingers that he won't hit me.

375
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,283
Come on, let's get out of here.

376
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:41,784
You're too good for this show.

377
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:44,578
- Why don't we try Fat Sam's?
- Yeah.

378
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,162
You gotta be kidding...

379
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:51,939
that show business is my business...

380
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,315
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, boss.

381
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:05,871
Relax, relax, will you?

382
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:14,038
I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank you for your work.

383
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,491
Everything's gone so well.

384
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,625
Thanks, boss.

385
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:19,908
Thanks, boss.

386
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:23,001
Fat Sam must've had quite a shock.

387
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,533
- Quite a shock.
- Thanks, boss.

388
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:27,539
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks.

389
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:28,921
Thanks, boss.

390
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,324
Laughing boy.

391
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:36,169
Yonkers. Shoulders.
Bronx Charlie. Benny Lee.

392
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,653
Any moment now Fat Sam will be...

393
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,163
crawling on his knees to me.

394
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:42,207
On his knees.

395
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:45,223
- Where's my flower, boss?
- Yes...

396
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:48,589
soon all Fat Sam will have
is the suit he stands up in...

397
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:49,835
and a suitcase full of memories.

398
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,162
I don't have a flower, boss.

399
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:12,250
What did I do?

400
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:14,675
You googed, Doodle.
You dropped the gun.

401
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:17,128
And I don't allow mistakes.

402
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:18,967
'Cause they put us in the caboose.

403
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,343
- And Sing Sing ain't my style.
- No, boss.

404
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,424
Not that. Anything but that.

405
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,175
I didn't mean to drop it.
It slipped outta my hands.

406
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:29,580
Button your lip.
You're all washed up.

407
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,171
- Give a guy a break.
- Get him!

408
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:42,313
Now listen to what I
say, and listen good.

409
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,139
There's only room for one
Mr. Big in this town.

410
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,431
And that's me, Dandy Dan.

411
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:51,094
The time has come for
us to play our next card.

412
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:54,429
Believe me, Fat Sam
and his dumb bums...

413
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,351
ain't gonna stand in our way.

414
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,262
We could've been anything...

415
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,186
that we wanted to be.

416
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:04,306
But don't it make your heart glad...

417
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:09,515
that we take pride in it...

418
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:13,268
we became the best at being bad.

419
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:18,307
We could've been
anything we wanted to be...

420
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,855
with all the talent we had.

421
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:27,473
No doubt about it,
we whine and we pout it...

422
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,682
we're the very best at being...

423
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,930
bad guys.

424
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,096
We're rotten to the core...

425
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,854
congratulations,
no one likes you anymore...

426
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:41,058
bad guys...

427
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:42,950
we're the very worst.

428
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,701
Each of us contemptible...

429
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,830
we're criticized and cursed...

430
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:49,732
we've made the big-time...

431
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,153
malicious and mad...

432
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,035
we're the very best at being bad.

433
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,060
Look at me, I'm dancin'.

434
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:03,075
We could've been anything
we wanted to be...

435
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:06,726
we took the easy way out...

436
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:12,366
with a little training,
we've mastered complaining...

437
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:15,033
made us seem unnecessary...

438
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,358
we're so rude, it's scary...

439
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,920
We could've been anything
we wanted to be...

440
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:24,280
with all the talent we had...

441
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:27,856
with a little practice

442
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:30,019
we made every black list...

443
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:31,694
we're the very best...

444
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,773
at being bad...

445
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:36,164
we're the very best...

446
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:38,036
at being bad.

447
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:39,036
Where you shovin' me?

448
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:42,708
We're the very best at being bad.

449
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,456
What are you doing?

450
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:04,664
Get in here, you bunch
of peanut brains.

451
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,869
Get in here, you dummies.

452
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:09,532
We got business
to do. Move it!

453
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:20,800
Come on, get in here.

454
00:34:21,582 --> 00:34:22,839
We got business to do.

455
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,588
We can't waste
all this time.

456
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:26,370
Right.

457
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,712
Let's get down to it.

458
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:31,124
Don't do that, Snake Eyes.
It's thinking time.

459
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,760
And don't do that, Knuckles.

460
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:35,034
Sure thing, boss.

461
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:36,787
Let's start at the beginning.

462
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:40,262
We're being outsmarted
by that lounge lizard.

463
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,583
And we're gonna get back on top.

464
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:44,090
Back on top.

465
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,542
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy...

466
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,350
- into line.
- You bet, boss.

467
00:34:48,773 --> 00:34:52,421
We've been a little slow off
the mark, but dumb bums we ain't.

468
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:55,001
No, dumb bums we ain't.

469
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:57,342
Hand me a pie.

470
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:04,185
- Louie, over there in the corner.
- Me, boss?

471
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:06,179
Why me?

472
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:07,621
Louie, into the corner.

473
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,097
What did I do?

474
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,254
Nothing, Louie.

475
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:13,514
You see? Missed.

476
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:15,941
Okay, Lou. You can sit down.

477
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:19,275
Even a dumb bum like
Louie is too quick for us.

478
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:23,183
That's our trouble.
We're behind the times.

479
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:24,853
I don't get it.

480
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:28,213
We'll never get back on top
with this kind of hardware.

481
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:29,679
It's old-fashioned.

482
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:33,669
In short, we gotta
get that gun.

483
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,898
- Hello.
- Want some information?

484
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,448
- Start gabbin'...
- It's about the splurge gun.

485
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:43,685
It's at the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company.

486
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,556
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

487
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:51,942
We've had a little break.

488
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,028
Who knows the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company?

489
00:35:56,394 --> 00:36:01,062
My friend tells me that's
where they stash the guns.

490
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:02,936
Get moving!

491
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:06,365
Not you, Knuckles.
Stay here with me.

492
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:07,266
Sure, boss.

493
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,581
Hello. What?

494
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,539
I don't believe it.
The whole gang?

495
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:30,422
Everybody?

496
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,961
That leaves you and
me. We're on our own.

497
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,695
What we gonna do?

498
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,749
Don't do that! How many
times I got to tell you?

499
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,747
Do nothing. Act like
everything was normal.

500
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,345
- What does that mean?
- You can't speak Italian?

501
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:56,046
No, boss, I'm Jewish.

502
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,914
Then read the translation!

503
00:38:23,688 --> 00:38:25,231
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.

504
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:28,053
- Still practicing?
- Still practicing.

505
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,851
Suddenly everybody wants
to be in show business.

506
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:37,087
Hi. Tallulah. I've
come to see Fat Sam.

507
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,512
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy.

508
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,025
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Hi.

509
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,931
Have a drink while you wait.

510
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:49,144
Yeah, why not?

511
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,556
Go feed the ducks, will you?

512
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:55,221
Oh, Tallulah.

513
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:56,630
I said, beat it.

514
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,984
Long time no see.

515
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:10,432
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.

516
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,886
You used to come see me every night.

517
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:17,681
- I've been busy.
- Busy doing what?

518
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:19,521
This and that.

519
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:26,147
Fizzy, cut the ivory
and hit the shoe leather.

520
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:29,020
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,358
You're aces, Bugsy.

522
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,942
I always found you special.

523
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:43,639
Careful, you're racing my mother.

524
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,581
Come on, give a girl a break.

525
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:48,443
Sure you've got the right fella?

526
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:51,231
- You're not like those other saps.
- No?

527
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:52,391
No.

528
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:55,950
You've got lovely brown eyes.

529
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,729
They'll be black eyes
if Fat Sam catches us.

530
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:03,150
- How about smearing my lipstick?
- Careful.

531
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,601
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.

532
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:08,906
So call him.

533
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,486
Blousey.

534
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:21,993
Blousey.

535
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,476
Blousey.

536
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,108
It's the broad about the audition.

537
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:35,321
He's busy. Come back tomorrow.

538
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:36,902
No, no, no.

539
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,580
Hey, honey. I'm all ears.
Be with you in a minute.

540
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:45,376
Carry on as normal.
Don't let 'em know we're beat.

541
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:47,340
- Business as usual.
- Right.

542
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:49,158
- Calm and collected.
- Right.

543
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:51,647
So they don't know we're
scared. I mean, concerned.

544
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:52,871
Sure, boss.

545
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,868
I'm feeling fine...

546
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:13,323
filled with emotions...

547
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:16,830
stronger than wine...

548
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,624
they give me the notion...

549
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,880
that this strange new feeling...

550
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:27,955
is something that
you're feeling too.

551
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,540
Matter of fact...

552
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:39,790
I'm forced to admit it...

553
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:42,374
caught in the act...

554
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,594
and maybe we've hit it...

555
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,342
this strange new feeling...

556
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:52,750
is something you're feeling...

557
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:55,079
Okay, honey. That's enough.

558
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:59,915
A little contemporary for
me, but very nice. You're hired.

559
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,343
That was great. That
really was. Terrific.

560
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:18,802
Blousey.

561
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:21,050
Come back, will you?

562
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:23,755
What's the use?

563
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:25,376
I've got to go.

564
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:34,087
Blousey.

565
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:38,016
Where is she? Blousey.

566
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,642
Show's going swell.

567
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,693
Just the way I want it to be.

568
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:16,024
Same number of
drinks, same everything.

569
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,976
They mustn't know
they've got us on the run.

570
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:23,040
Here, I wanna show you something.

571
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:28,035
I've sent for someone to
help us out of our predicament.

572
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:30,699
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.

573
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,142
A doctor?

574
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,267
Not a doctor, a hoodlum.

575
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:38,409
I thought we were hoodlums.

576
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:41,658
Not a dumb bum. This
guy is the real McCoy.

577
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,608
Not Looney Bergonzi!

578
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,902
The Looney Bergonzi?

579
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:48,862
The very same, mad
as a hatter, Bergonzi.

580
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:52,148
Best man in Chicago.
Here's what we do.

581
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:56,326
We meet Dandy Dan.
Looney hides in the back seat.

582
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,112
- You drive.
- Right.

583
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:02,981
- But I don't drive.
- You what?

584
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:05,658
You don't drive?

585
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,165
Then we get ourselves a driver.

586
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,496
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Is Blousey there?

587
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:21,712
- She won't see you.
- Tell her I'm sick.

588
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,992
- You're sick?
- Sick of waiting.

589
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,289
Beat it.

590
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:31,456
Give a guy a break.

591
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,288
I brought you some flowers.

592
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:34,991
I'll see Tallulah gets them.

593
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:37,453
Quit being smart. They're for you.

594
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:38,740
Five minutes, girls.

595
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:41,032
- I have to go.
- I was thinking of getting a job.

596
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:43,539
You don't get paid for
standing in bread lines.

597
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:48,211
A legit job. We could save
enough money to go to Hollywood.

598
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,207
Believe it when I see it.

599
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:55,582
- Bugsy, you drive?
- Sure, why?

600
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:59,337
- Like to earn some green stuff?
- Long as it ain't cabbages.

601
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:02,202
Step inside. I got
a proposition for you.

602
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:05,129
Flowers? For me?

603
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,342
How nice.

604
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:09,587
Put these in water.

605
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:21,209
Hello?

606
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,383
Who shall I say is
calling? One moment.

607
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:00,096
- Hello.
- Dandy Dan, is that you?

608
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:03,509
- This is Dandy Dan speaking.
- I wanna arrange a meeting.

609
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,254
- Sure. Where?
- Outta town.

610
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:10,235
Agreed. Just you and a driver.

611
00:46:10,596 --> 00:46:14,021
- When?
- Monday. 11 A.M..

612
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,422
Right, I'll be there.

613
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:17,897
Got him, the knuckle.

614
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,937
Got him, the salami.

615
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:22,151
Let's go and enjoy the show.

616
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,604
My name is Tallulah...

617
00:46:34,894 --> 00:46:36,731
my first rule of thumb...

618
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:41,768
I don't say where I'm going,
or where I'm coming from.

619
00:46:42,157 --> 00:46:46,611
I try to leave a little
reputation behind me...

620
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:51,608
so if you really need to,
you'll know how to find me.

621
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,318
My name is Tallulah...

622
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:05,451
I live till I die...

623
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,316
I'll take what you give me...

624
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:10,413
and I won't ask why.

625
00:47:10,816 --> 00:47:14,354
I've made a lot of friends
in exotic places...

626
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:16,724
I don't remember names...

627
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:20,359
but I remember faces.

628
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:37,281
Lonely, you don't
have to be lonely...

629
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:45,859
come see Tallulah, we can
chase your troubles away.

630
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:51,739
If you're lonely...

631
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:56,362
you don't have to be lonely.

632
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:02,496
When they talk to Tallulah,
you know what they say...

633
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:07,534
no one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer...

634
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:12,449
Tallulah had her training
in North Carolina.

635
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,212
My name is Tallulah...

636
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:26,118
and soon I'll be gone...

637
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:31,002
an open invitation
is the road I travel on.

638
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:36,047
I never say goodbye
because the words upset me.

639
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,582
You may forgive my going...

640
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:41,366
but you won't forget me.

641
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:53,336
Lonely...

642
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:58,050
you don't have to be lonely...

643
00:49:00,258 --> 00:49:06,174
come see Tallulah, we can
chase your troubles away.

644
00:49:08,889 --> 00:49:12,213
If you're lonely...

645
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:17,169
you don't have to be lonely...

646
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:22,970
when they talk about Tallulah,
you know what they say...

647
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:28,047
no one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer...

648
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,223
Tallulah had her training
in North Carolina.

649
00:50:17,653 --> 00:50:18,266
They're coming.

650
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:19,819
Looney, keep your head down.

651
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:43,890
What can I do for you?

652
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,449
How about some straight talk?

653
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:47,645
Suits me.

654
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:50,582
- You've been taking liberties.
- I've been taking what's mine.

655
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:53,108
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.
- Too bad.

656
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:57,019
I'm sure we can talk
it over. I'm a businessman.

657
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:59,331
Yeah, a dime-a-dozen gangster.

658
00:50:59,574 --> 00:51:01,775
Button your lip.
Don't talk dirty to me.

659
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,485
I don't like your
mouth. Have some respect.

660
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:07,266
You'd slit your own
throat for two bits.

661
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:09,358
Keep your wisecracks.

662
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,561
Keep talking.

663
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,915
I have my position to think of.

664
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,285
Right now it's not worth a nickel.

665
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,411
You're a dirty rat, Dan.

666
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:20,781
You've been watching
too many movies.

667
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,858
Okay, Looney, let him have it.

668
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:24,838
Charlie, Yonkers,
it's a double-cross.

669
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:27,458
Okay, freeze.

670
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:36,750
Looney.

671
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,252
What's the matter with you?

672
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:52,506
Hey, you guys.

673
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:53,544
Over here!

674
00:51:53,754 --> 00:51:54,785
Over here!

675
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,551
Come back, dummies!
They're getting away.

676
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:01,172
Come back here.

677
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:05,621
Come on, step on it.

678
00:52:08,144 --> 00:52:09,256
Come on, let's go.

679
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,040
We're going to lose them.

680
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,699
Drive faster.

681
00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:38,289
Dan, you're a rat!

682
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:43,336
You're a dirty rat!

683
00:52:43,678 --> 00:52:45,255
Come on, they're gonna get us.

684
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:55,886
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.

685
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:21,881
Come on, Malone.

686
00:53:23,428 --> 00:53:26,280
You're a dirty
double-crossing rat!

687
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:29,525
Look out.

688
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,354
Don't stop!

689
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:34,260
There's a bridge!

690
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:35,568
Put the brakes on!

691
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:41,101
We lost them.

692
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:52,405
Go and cluck somewhere else.

693
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:56,703
Here. Get yourself a new suit.

694
00:53:57,645 --> 00:53:59,188
Get rid of the sack you're wearing.

695
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,230
Thank you, Mr. Stacetto.

696
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:04,318
Here's my tailor's card.

697
00:54:04,727 --> 00:54:06,768
You ain't got to
pay for six months.

698
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:08,351
Thank you very much.

699
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:11,946
Think nothing
of it. Let's go.

700
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:22,857
What do you think?
Don't I look cute?

701
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:24,572
I don't know.

702
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:26,147
Come on, Dotty,
what do you think?

703
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,868
I think the color's wrong.

704
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:30,648
What are you talking about?

705
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:32,651
Purple's my color.

706
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,398
Don't I always wear purple?

707
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:35,861
It matches your nose.

708
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:37,110
Maybe it's the length.

709
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:40,786
It's the latest length. Look!

710
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:44,613
Maybe the frills stick out
too much. Like your ears.

711
00:54:45,405 --> 00:54:47,786
Frills are in. Look at
this photo of Lena Marelli.

712
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:49,987
Lena Marelli is
not Bangles Dobell.

713
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,442
You think it'd
look better on you?

714
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:53,785
It'd look better on a horse.

715
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:57,701
Jealous. Can I help it if my
looks are ahead of their time?

716
00:54:58,326 --> 00:54:59,244
What?

717
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:00,361
Full of character.

718
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:01,204
Kind of earthy.

719
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:02,842
Like a bucket of mud.

720
00:55:03,464 --> 00:55:05,665
You creep. Get lost!

721
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:12,985
How about you? Do you
think I look terrible?

722
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:18,588
Do I look cute or terrible?

723
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:22,916
Honestly?

724
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:27,257
Bangles Dobell, you look terrible.

725
00:55:29,711 --> 00:55:30,664
What are you looking at?

726
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:32,334
Nothing.

727
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:11,383
Blousey.

728
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:19,627
Blousey.

729
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,378
Blousey.

730
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,767
It's for you. It's Bugsy.

731
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:35,685
Give him my love.

732
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:38,307
Thanks.

733
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:39,715
Hello.

734
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,841
Blousey, it's Bugsy.

735
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:42,642
Where are you?

736
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:46,879
Around. I can't talk,
but I just made 200 bucks.

737
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:48,549
You printed it yourself?

738
00:56:48,891 --> 00:56:50,088
No, I earned it.

739
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,018
Doing what?

740
00:56:51,363 --> 00:56:52,180
Oh, this and that.

741
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:53,915
Hang on a minute.

742
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:55,466
I can't hear you.

743
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,280
There's a train going by.

744
00:56:58,644 --> 00:56:59,597
Who gave you the money?

745
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:01,427
Fat Sam.

746
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:03,439
He gave you 200 dollars?

747
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:05,763
And the loan of his
sedan for the afternoon.

748
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:07,610
He loaned you his sedan?

749
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:09,853
I don't believe it.
You're putting me on.

750
00:57:12,893 --> 00:57:13,732
I believe you.

751
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:17,804
He's a sinner...

752
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:20,809
candy-coated...

753
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,028
he always seems to be alone...

754
00:57:27,598 --> 00:57:33,395
but they love him,
Bugsy Malone.

755
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:39,121
A city slicker...

756
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:43,264
he can charm you with a smile...

757
00:57:43,732 --> 00:57:46,438
a style all his own...

758
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:51,232
everybody loves that man...

759
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:54,907
Bugsy Malone.

760
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:03,537
Hard-headed Bugsy...

761
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,197
makes his mind up...

762
00:58:07,295 --> 00:58:10,393
don't mess with Bugsy,
or you'll wind up...

763
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:15,692
wishing you'd left him alone.

764
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:19,867
He's a man, a mountain,
he's a rolling stone...

765
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:24,128
and when he leaves you...

766
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:26,653
sad and lonely...

767
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,122
cry, I couldn't say.

768
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:31,324
But it's known...

769
00:58:32,494 --> 00:58:36,118
that everybody
wants that man...

770
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:39,108
Bugsy Malone.

771
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:52,374
Mustard with onions or ketchup?

772
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:53,314
Mustard with onions.

773
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:55,242
Oh, and this, too.

774
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,910
- What's this?
- A present.

775
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,372
- Open it up.
- You got to be kidding.

776
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,781
I don't kid around.

777
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,613
It's beautiful.

778
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:04,833
Nice, huh?

779
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:05,880
What is it?

780
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,087
What is it? A viewer.

781
00:59:08,495 --> 00:59:10,072
Look through here.

782
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,247
Pictures of Hollywood stars.

783
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:13,282
Bugsy...

784
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:15,868
it's fantastic. It really is.

785
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,468
If only I could get to Hollywood.

786
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,368
You can.

787
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:20,512
Sure.

788
00:59:20,675 --> 00:59:21,792
I know, in the front row...

789
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:22,915
of the Roxy Theatre...

790
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:23,958
on East 38th Street.

791
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:25,965
No, really get to Hollywood.

792
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:27,291
Keep talking.

793
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:28,753
1.80 for the viewer, right?

794
00:59:29,506 --> 00:59:30,888
10 cents for the hot dogs.

795
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:34,457
Leaves 198 dollars for...

796
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:35,296
Surprise me.

797
00:59:35,465 --> 00:59:36,962
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?

798
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,473
How many tickets you need?

799
00:59:38,838 --> 00:59:39,916
Two tickets to the ball game?

800
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,503
To Hollywood, dummy.

801
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,745
This can't be true.
Are we really going?

802
00:59:44,939 --> 00:59:45,949
Knock it off.

803
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:47,293
You're putting me on.

804
00:59:47,765 --> 00:59:48,616
It's the honest truth.

805
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:50,346
I'm picking them up tomorrow.

806
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:53,257
Now I better get
Fat Sam's car back.

807
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:54,840
Or I'm not going anywhere.

808
01:00:35,604 --> 01:00:36,523
Is anyone in there?

809
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,552
Hello?

810
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:42,837
Are you hurt?

811
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,818
Help! Somebody
help me, please!

812
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:51,051
Somebody, please!

813
01:00:51,237 --> 01:00:52,088
Somebody help!

814
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:54,605
Help me, please!

815
01:01:08,893 --> 01:01:10,185
They take your money?

816
01:01:14,191 --> 01:01:16,034
Yeah. Nearly 200 dollars.

817
01:01:16,663 --> 01:01:19,057
Thanks anyway for helping me.

818
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:20,182
It was nothing.

819
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:22,940
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.

820
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:25,145
- You're not?
- No.

821
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,037
Best punching I ever saw.

822
01:01:27,499 --> 01:01:29,121
- Ever been coached?
- No.

823
01:01:29,744 --> 01:01:31,605
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.

824
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:34,356
Why not? You could be a champion.

825
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:37,753
- Never had the chance.
- I know who could help you.

826
01:01:37,914 --> 01:01:39,955
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.

827
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,866
- You must know Slugger's Gym?
- No.

828
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:46,238
- You don't know much, do you?
- Nope.

829
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,032
What's your name?

830
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:50,065
Smith, Leroy Smith.

831
01:01:50,534 --> 01:01:52,655
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there.

832
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,583
You got yourself a manager.

833
01:01:55,952 --> 01:01:58,312
- Know the first thing I'm gonna do?
- No.

834
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:01,124
Treat you to one heck of a meal.

835
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,234
- Thought they took all your dough.
- Who needs money?

836
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:09,549
Look at this, O'Dreary.

837
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:14,460
You cracked it this time, Captain.

838
01:03:14,931 --> 01:03:16,639
Get the plaster.
We'll take a mold.

839
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,252
Come on, get the plaster.

840
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:23,130
Careful. Up a bit.

841
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:27,750
Left a bit.

842
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:28,835
Come on, hurry up.

843
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,766
Hold it straight. Be careful.

844
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:40,250
You idiots!

845
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:45,002
Hello. What?

846
01:03:45,314 --> 01:03:48,803
They got the still.
The whole lot's gone.

847
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:52,672
Not the sarsaparilla racket,
too. Get round here now.

848
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:54,520
- I can't, boss.
- Why not?

849
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:55,965
I'm all tied up.

850
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,631
I don't care if you're
busy. Get here right away.

851
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:03,972
Careful, you idiots.

852
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,313
O'Dreary.

853
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:06,295
Don't worry...

854
01:04:06,485 --> 01:04:09,185
we'll break you out
at headquarters.

855
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:24,521
- Hi, Bugsy. How you been?
- Swell, Cagey Joe.

856
01:04:25,024 --> 01:04:27,855
I'd like you to meet the
next heavyweight champion.

857
01:04:28,016 --> 01:04:29,592
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.

858
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:32,226
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.

859
01:04:32,653 --> 01:04:35,273
- Ever been in the ring before?
- No.

860
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,027
- So you wanna be a fighter?
- No.

861
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:40,470
Sure he does. He's a natural.

862
01:04:40,937 --> 01:04:41,895
Look at those fists.

863
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:43,364
Did you ever see such fists?

864
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:44,562
Hit it, Leroy.

865
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:49,246
You see? A born champion.

866
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:50,800
What's your name again?

867
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:52,939
Smith. Leroy Smith.

868
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:55,737
With your help...

869
01:04:56,028 --> 01:04:57,491
he could be champion in no time.

870
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:09,687
So you wanna be a boxer...

871
01:05:10,117 --> 01:05:11,500
in the golden ring.

872
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,489
Can you punch like a train?

873
01:05:14,794 --> 01:05:15,952
Tell me just one thing...

874
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:19,663
can you move like a
hummingbird's wing?

875
01:05:20,031 --> 01:05:21,028
Oh, that's fast!

876
01:05:21,194 --> 01:05:24,233
Can you bob, can you weave?

877
01:05:25,123 --> 01:05:26,990
Well, you might as well quit...

878
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:28,690
if you haven't got it.

879
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:34,332
So you wanna be a boxer,
can you pass the test?

880
01:05:35,538 --> 01:05:38,868
I can tell if you got it,
I've trained the best.

881
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:43,937
When you work and sweat
like a buzz saw...

882
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:45,399
and you near lose your mind...

883
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:47,414
when you find out your
boy has a glass jaw.

884
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:49,501
So you might as well quit...

885
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:51,740
if you haven't got it.

886
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,663
Put him in the ring,
look at what you've found...

887
01:05:55,906 --> 01:05:56,938
we can use the fun...

888
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:57,873
pushing him around.

889
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,580
We'll show him the ropes...

890
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:02,005
and destroy his hopes...

891
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:03,866
put him in the ring...

892
01:06:04,036 --> 01:06:06,258
let him feel the sting...

893
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:07,114
we can make him dance...

894
01:06:07,283 --> 01:06:08,786
we'll pound him to bits...

895
01:06:09,454 --> 01:06:12,913
then he'll call it quits.

896
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:18,298
Come on, Leroy.

897
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:25,298
So you wanna be a boxer,
wanna be the champ...

898
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:30,168
there's a golden boy inside
you, not a punchy tramp...

899
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:33,550
if you listen and you learn,
there's an honor you can earn...

900
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:38,200
when you see the crown,
you're a king, not a clown.

901
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,401
But you might as well quit...

902
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:42,673
if you haven't got it.

903
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,584
Put him in the ring,
something new to punch...

904
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,795
let me have a swing...

905
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,380
then we'll go to lunch...

906
01:06:51,209 --> 01:06:52,757
then he'll get the drift.

907
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,722
Put him in the ring,
chicken à la carte...

908
01:06:56,085 --> 01:06:57,973
let me have a wing,
tearing him apart.

909
01:06:58,136 --> 01:06:59,599
The chicken will crow...

910
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:03,585
let me have him, Joe.

911
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:23,052
He's got it.

912
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:26,499
You sure this is going to work?

913
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,476
Sure. Looks like a splurge gun.

914
01:07:29,857 --> 01:07:30,475
Doesn't it?

915
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:34,682
- Sort of.
- Nonsense.

916
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:38,304
Anything Dandy Dan can
do, I can do better.

917
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:40,462
Are you ready?

918
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:41,471
Ready.

919
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:44,642
Don't do that!

920
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:45,726
Sorry, boss.

921
01:07:46,111 --> 01:07:47,048
All right, take aim.

922
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:50,718
Ready.

923
01:07:55,323 --> 01:07:55,936
Get set.

924
01:07:58,475 --> 01:07:59,109
Fire.

925
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:04,807
Missed!

926
01:08:05,477 --> 01:08:07,234
Back to the drawing board.

927
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:10,270
Knuckles!

928
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:11,932
Knuckles, speak to me.

929
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:12,731
Knuckles.

930
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:28,259
It's all your fault, hear me?

931
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:50,076
Hello?

932
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:54,075
Not the grocery racket, too?

933
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:56,475
Yeah.

934
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:01,816
That's the whole empire
gone. Hear me? Everything.

935
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:03,605
They'll be coming here next.

936
01:09:04,214 --> 01:09:05,291
There's only one thing for it.

937
01:09:05,877 --> 01:09:07,938
You have to get him to help me.

938
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,627
Who? The Lone Ranger?

939
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:14,356
No, Bugsy Malone. Call him.

940
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:21,543
I'm in trouble, and all I got for
company is a female comedienne.

941
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,231
I'm in trouble, bad trouble.

942
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:26,277
Is he there?

943
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:28,740
No. There's no answer.

944
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,536
Then get him to me poysanally.

945
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:32,897
Personally?

946
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:37,198
- Poysanally.
- Poysanally.

947
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,838
So long, lover boy.

948
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:11,474
I like men at my feet.

949
01:10:11,955 --> 01:10:13,298
What you doing here?

950
01:10:13,885 --> 01:10:14,917
I brought you a message.

951
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,172
What's wrong with Western Union?

952
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,102
Thought you'd like the company.

953
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,669
I'll buy you a drink.

954
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:23,544
Where?

955
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:25,559
How about Fat Sam's?

956
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:27,960
Won't he be there?

957
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,002
He sure will.

958
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:31,254
Maybe I'll stay home.

959
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,926
Don't flatter yourself...

960
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:35,046
it's him that wants to see you.

961
01:10:35,717 --> 01:10:36,330
Come on.

962
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:38,876
Before your suspenders strangle you.

963
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,560
Quit whistling, it makes me edgy.

964
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,422
Yes, boss.

965
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:08,603
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, boss.

966
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,777
What's funny? You find me amusing?

967
01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:21,647
I wasn't smiling at you.

968
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:22,566
Honest, I wasn't.

969
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:24,198
You find my suit funny?

970
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:24,972
No, boss.

971
01:11:25,242 --> 01:11:25,979
It was your flower.

972
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:30,189
Yeah, it is kinda droopy.

973
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,477
Yeah, a little.

974
01:11:32,323 --> 01:11:33,765
In fact, it's very droopy.

975
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:35,816
Very droopy, boss.

976
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,011
Hold it a minute.

977
01:11:38,723 --> 01:11:39,760
It needs some water.

978
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:43,773
Don't ever laugh at me again...

979
01:11:44,021 --> 01:11:45,523
or I'll ram that
smile down your throat.

980
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:49,509
I'm Fat Sam, don't forget
that. Number one man, Mr. Big.

981
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,987
Always have been,
always will be. Now get out.

982
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:00,231
Careful, the floor is wet.

983
01:12:09,026 --> 01:12:09,638
Hi, honey.

984
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:11,302
Here he is.

985
01:12:11,612 --> 01:12:12,809
Hey, Bugsy.

986
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:13,779
How you doing, Sam?

987
01:12:14,444 --> 01:12:15,940
Glad to see you.

988
01:12:19,161 --> 01:12:19,819
Pull up a chair.

989
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:20,934
Fix him a drink.

990
01:12:21,285 --> 01:12:23,232
A special on the rocks.

991
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,237
What can I do for you?

992
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:27,014
Bugsy...

993
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:27,897
I'm in a jam.

994
01:12:28,754 --> 01:12:33,281
Dandy Dan's gonna take
over my organization.

995
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:34,902
You still got this.

996
01:12:35,073 --> 01:12:37,999
If Dan gets his way,
I won't have a dime.

997
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:43,449
Can you leave us alone?
This is men's talk.

998
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,026
That's all right,
I'm unshockable.

999
01:12:46,251 --> 01:12:47,102
Go fix your make-up.

1000
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:48,785
I've already fixed it.

1001
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:51,317
Then go make yourself
look more beautiful.

1002
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,986
You know that's impossible.

1003
01:12:54,615 --> 01:12:55,573
Anything's possible.

1004
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,082
I'll go and manicure my gloves.

1005
01:13:04,328 --> 01:13:06,489
Bugsy, believe me...

1006
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,500
my gang's gone. My
business is in ruins.

1007
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:11,444
My friends don't wanna know me.

1008
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:12,750
I'm a wreck.

1009
01:13:13,341 --> 01:13:16,120
In short, I need your help.

1010
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:17,326
Why me?

1011
01:13:17,716 --> 01:13:21,494
'Cause you've got
brains, not pretzels.

1012
01:13:22,713 --> 01:13:24,449
No, it's not my line.

1013
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,413
400 dollars.

1014
01:13:35,013 --> 01:13:35,750
Do we have a deal?

1015
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:37,488
Hello?

1016
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,009
Bugsy, it's for you.

1017
01:13:41,553 --> 01:13:42,550
I think it's Blousey.

1018
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:44,456
You got a deal.

1019
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:47,584
Hold on, he won't be a second.

1020
01:13:49,376 --> 01:13:50,334
See you, Bugsy.

1021
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,003
Hello, Blousey.

1022
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,417
What are you doing there?

1023
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:56,334
Just business.

1024
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:57,496
With Tallulah?

1025
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,510
No, with Fat Sam.

1026
01:14:00,012 --> 01:14:00,936
Did you get the tickets?

1027
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,794
No, you see...

1028
01:14:03,966 --> 01:14:04,964
You promised me.

1029
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:05,741
I know.

1030
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:07,838
But Hollywood can wait, can't it?

1031
01:14:08,102 --> 01:14:10,382
You had no intention of
taking me to Hollywood!

1032
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:14,011
I do! But there's something
I've got to do first.

1033
01:14:14,482 --> 01:14:15,799
You promised me.

1034
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:19,471
Trust me. I can't
talk now. I'll call you.

1035
01:14:20,481 --> 01:14:24,390
Only a fool...

1036
01:14:24,556 --> 01:14:28,544
like fools before me...

1037
01:14:29,353 --> 01:14:36,506
I always think with my heart.

1038
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:41,647
Only a fool...

1039
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:45,947
that same old story...

1040
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:53,423
seems I was born
for the part.

1041
01:14:53,611 --> 01:14:57,440
It's a lesson that I've learned...

1042
01:14:57,986 --> 01:15:02,713
and a page I should have turned.

1043
01:15:03,764 --> 01:15:10,645
I shouldn't cry, but I do.

1044
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,974
Like an ordinary fool...

1045
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:21,058
when her ordinary
dreams fall through.

1046
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:37,604
How many times have I mistaken...

1047
01:15:38,824 --> 01:15:39,902
What can you see?

1048
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:55,191
How many times have I mistaken...

1049
01:15:55,619 --> 01:16:02,319
love songs and laughs
for the blues.

1050
01:16:02,861 --> 01:16:06,916
When a road I've walked before...

1051
01:16:07,237 --> 01:16:11,870
ends alone at my door...

1052
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:19,645
I shouldn't cry, but I do...

1053
01:16:19,837 --> 01:16:28,824
when my ordinary dreams
fall through.

1054
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:35,041
- Splurge guns!
- Where?

1055
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:38,029
In the crates. Look
what it says on the truck.

1056
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:38,834
I can't.

1057
01:16:39,043 --> 01:16:39,815
Can't you read?

1058
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:42,746
Sure. But I'm short-
sighted. What's it say?

1059
01:16:43,213 --> 01:16:46,283
It says: Splurge
Imports Incorporated.

1060
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:49,028
Dock 17, East River.

1061
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,794
- Must be where the guns are.
- Right.

1062
01:16:54,295 --> 01:16:54,907
Look out!

1063
01:16:55,097 --> 01:16:58,161
It's a lesson that I've learned...

1064
01:16:58,385 --> 01:17:03,371
and a page I should have turned...

1065
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:10,548
I shouldn't cry but I do...

1066
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:15,078
like an ordinary fool...

1067
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:23,264
when her ordinary
dreams fall through.

1068
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,002
Blousey, miss your train?

1069
01:17:29,168 --> 01:17:30,824
What have I done?
Bugsy let you down?

1070
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:33,336
The broad needs her head testing.

1071
01:17:33,503 --> 01:17:34,501
You better believe it.

1072
01:17:37,212 --> 01:17:38,136
Oh, yeah.

1073
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:40,342
Can I have my job back?

1074
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:44,591
Sure, the more
the merrier. Go right in.

1075
01:17:46,384 --> 01:17:47,496
Hi, Blousey.

1076
01:17:48,088 --> 01:17:48,773
Hi, Blousey.

1077
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,133
Ever see a broad
carry a torch so high?

1078
01:17:53,005 --> 01:17:55,312
Yeah, the Statue of Liberty.

1079
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:08,386
This must be the place.

1080
01:18:10,768 --> 01:18:11,846
Two guards on the door.

1081
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:13,430
Two on the roof.

1082
01:18:14,095 --> 01:18:14,934
Two on the pier.

1083
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:17,681
- What we gonna do?
- Go home?

1084
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,001
There must be a way in.

1085
01:18:19,313 --> 01:18:20,975
Don't be stupid. We'll never get...

1086
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:21,801
past them.

1087
01:18:22,727 --> 01:18:24,722
You're right. Let's go.

1088
01:18:27,182 --> 01:18:28,725
What we gonna do, Leroy?

1089
01:18:29,928 --> 01:18:31,141
We need more men.

1090
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:33,562
We need an army.

1091
01:18:34,104 --> 01:18:35,805
No armies around here.

1092
01:18:35,989 --> 01:18:36,601
Yeah, I know.

1093
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,230
Hang on a minute.

1094
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:11,364
Don't complain about the way
your life has wound up...

1095
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:19,947
think of all the time you waste,
and time's a precious thing...

1096
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:27,897
sure you've hit the bottom,
but remember you're building up...

1097
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:35,703
every day's another step that
takes you closer to the sky...

1098
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:38,273
so give it a try.

1099
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:52,461
Don't be depressed about
the way luck deceived you...

1100
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:57,268
fortune sailed away,
you missed the boat...

1101
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,369
and found you'd been left behind.

1102
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:01,868
What's the matter with you?

1103
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:08,603
Fight and fight some more,
till the world receives you...

1104
01:20:11,367 --> 01:20:16,579
Lady Luck is fickle, but
a lady can change her mind.

1105
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:21,039
Come on, guys, who's with me?

1106
01:20:21,221 --> 01:20:22,232
No!

1107
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:23,926
What's the matter with you?

1108
01:20:24,589 --> 01:20:25,586
All right, here's somebody.

1109
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:26,789
Me too.

1110
01:20:26,959 --> 01:20:28,581
What about the rest of you?

1111
01:20:28,743 --> 01:20:29,581
And you?

1112
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,000
Why not?

1113
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:33,672
Come on.

1114
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,363
Don't sit around complaining...

1115
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:40,300
about how your life's wound up...

1116
01:20:42,933 --> 01:20:48,384
be a man, you can't be certain
you'll lose till you try.

1117
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:12,080
Don't sit around complaining
about how your life's wound up...

1118
01:21:14,212 --> 01:21:17,642
you can't be certain you'll lose...

1119
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,462
till you try.

1120
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:22,057
So give it a try.

1121
01:21:22,723 --> 01:21:23,993
- Is everybody with me?
- Yeah!

1122
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:25,546
Come on.

1123
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:56,182
There they are.

1124
01:21:56,473 --> 01:21:57,346
This is what we'll do.

1125
01:21:58,183 --> 01:21:58,941
Get Baby Face.

1126
01:21:59,105 --> 01:21:59,718
Get Baby Face.

1127
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:15,270
Get Baby Face.

1128
01:22:16,823 --> 01:22:18,878
I'm Baby Face. What am I saying?

1129
01:22:19,348 --> 01:22:20,465
I gotta have courage.

1130
01:22:20,897 --> 01:22:22,440
Give this to Baby Face.

1131
01:22:22,782 --> 01:22:24,723
Big courage.

1132
01:22:24,947 --> 01:22:25,724
Give it to Baby Face.

1133
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,722
Thanks. Just what I need.

1134
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:31,651
Okay, you know what to do.

1135
01:22:32,195 --> 01:22:33,113
I'm scared.

1136
01:22:33,477 --> 01:22:35,020
Will you get out there!

1137
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:37,222
Yeah, right, get out there.

1138
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,156
I'm a big movie star now.

1139
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,447
Geronimo!

1140
01:23:21,157 --> 01:23:21,769
Get that guy.

1141
01:23:24,745 --> 01:23:25,602
Dummies.

1142
01:23:26,415 --> 01:23:27,911
Come back here.

1143
01:23:49,009 --> 01:23:50,870
Come on, open the boxes.

1144
01:24:12,926 --> 01:24:16,210
My name is Tallulah,
my first rule of thumb...

1145
01:24:16,379 --> 01:24:18,161
Stop fooling around.

1146
01:24:18,584 --> 01:24:19,428
Sorry, Bugsy.

1147
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,661
I don't have to tell you
how important this is.

1148
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:28,988
This is gonna take
the lid off City Hall.

1149
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,787
- This is the big one.
- The big one.

1150
01:24:32,052 --> 01:24:33,753
The shake-down.

1151
01:24:33,977 --> 01:24:35,638
The shake-down.

1152
01:24:36,006 --> 01:24:38,002
The pay-off.

1153
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:39,911
The pay off.

1154
01:24:40,557 --> 01:24:41,414
It's got to be good.

1155
01:24:42,187 --> 01:24:44,786
It's got to be good,
it's got to be neat...

1156
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,481
Quit repeating everything!

1157
01:24:48,807 --> 01:24:49,804
You shouldn't have any trouble.

1158
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:54,416
Just Fat Sam and
a few dance hall girls.

1159
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,518
Good luck and off we go.

1160
01:24:59,883 --> 01:25:01,221
Three cheers for Dandy Dan.

1161
01:25:01,467 --> 01:25:03,015
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1162
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:04,713
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1163
01:25:05,061 --> 01:25:06,456
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

1164
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:08,352
Too kind, guys.

1165
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:44,804
Jelly, Jelly, open up!

1166
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:48,399
They're here!

1167
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:54,054
Just act normal.

1168
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:55,762
Get to work.

1169
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:57,931
Girls, off you go.

1170
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:00,180
Razzmatazz, let's
hear some music.

1171
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:18,944
Okay, this is our moment.

1172
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:22,065
Keep a cool head and
keep those fingers pumping.

1173
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:25,437
Remember, you'll be writing history.

1174
01:26:29,323 --> 01:26:30,786
Fat Sam ain't humble...

1175
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:33,221
but it's your home sweet home...

1176
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:34,695
plans are made here...

1177
01:26:37,247 --> 01:26:38,608
Okay, everybody, freeze.

1178
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,575
Let them have it.

1179
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:36,153
Amazing scenes...

1180
01:27:36,344 --> 01:27:38,204
have been reported
on the lower East side.

1181
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,132
It's been a frightful bad show.

1182
01:27:49,043 --> 01:27:50,381
So, this is show business?

1183
01:28:24,063 --> 01:28:29,799
We could've been
anything we wanted...

1184
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:35,629
and it's not too
late to change...

1185
01:28:38,968 --> 01:28:42,592
I'd be delighted...

1186
01:28:42,762 --> 01:28:44,259
to give it some thought...

1187
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:49,593
maybe you'll agree
that we really ought...

1188
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:56,849
We could've been
anything we wanted...

1189
01:28:58,515 --> 01:29:01,799
that decision is ours...

1190
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:08,342
it's been decided,
we're weaker divided...

1191
01:29:09,231 --> 01:29:12,561
let friendship
double our powers.

1192
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:19,802
We could've been
anything we wanted...

1193
01:29:21,029 --> 01:29:23,554
and I'm not saying we should...

1194
01:29:25,725 --> 01:29:29,428
but if we tried it...

1195
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,053
we could be the best...

1196
01:29:32,225 --> 01:29:34,307
at being good guys.

1197
01:29:34,657 --> 01:29:36,154
Flowers of the earth...

1198
01:29:36,862 --> 01:29:38,723
who can guess how much...

1199
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:41,068
a real friend is worth.

1200
01:29:41,318 --> 01:29:43,314
Good guys...

1201
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:45,224
shake an open hand...

1202
01:29:45,915 --> 01:29:47,696
maybe we'll be trusting...

1203
01:29:47,858 --> 01:29:49,854
if we try to understand.

1204
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:51,948
No doubt about it...

1205
01:29:52,114 --> 01:29:54,155
it must be worthwhile...

1206
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:58,185
friends tend to make you smile.

1207
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:03,183
We could've been anything...

1208
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:05,526
that we wanted to be.

1209
01:30:06,037 --> 01:30:09,107
That decision is ours.

1210
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:11,894
It's been decided...

1211
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:14,164
we're weaker divided...

1212
01:30:14,908 --> 01:30:17,919
let friendship
double our powers.

1213
01:30:20,947 --> 01:30:25,934
You give a little love
and it all comes back to you.

1214
01:30:29,197 --> 01:30:34,364
You know you'll be remembered
for the things you say and do.

1215
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:41,733
You give a little love
and it all comes back to you.

1216
01:30:46,995 --> 01:30:51,483
You'll be remembered for
the things you say and do.

1217
01:30:55,506 --> 01:31:00,113
You give a little love
and it all comes back to you.

1218
01:31:03,369 --> 01:31:08,456
You'll be remembered
for the things you say and do.

1219
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:13,884
You give a little love...

1220
01:31:14,045 --> 01:31:16,830
and it all comes back to you.
