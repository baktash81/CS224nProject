1
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:07,255
I'm glad to see you.

2
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,576
Please.

3
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THE TWINS

4
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,826
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,267
Opening of the will to
her two children,

6
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:55,330
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,778
"In accordance with the will,

8
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:02,780
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

9
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,850
the notary, Jean Lebel,

10
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,045
is named executor."

11
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:10,315
Hmm ... I must tell you here

12
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,288
that it was your mother's decision.

13
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:17,693
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

14
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,991
You know ...

15
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,161
... your mother was more
than an employee.

16
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,635
To my late wife and me

17
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,039
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

18
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,568
I could not refuse.

19
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,314
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

20
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,715
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

21
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,083
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

22
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,521
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

23
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:48,188
"Burial"

24
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,592
"Notary Jean Lebel will

25
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,996
bury me without a coffin, naked

26
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,329
and without prayers."

27
00:05:56,436 --> 00:06:00,497
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

28
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,173
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

29
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,204
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

30
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,713
and my name engraved nowhere."

31
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,114
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

32
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,521
"To Jeanne and Simon"

33
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,923
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

34
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,393
which cannot be removed easily."

35
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,133
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

36
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:35,400
"This envelope is for your father."

37
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,374
"Find him

38
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,309
and hand him the envelope."

39
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,116
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

40
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,742
I've heard enough.

41
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,892
Oh ... but it's not finished.

42
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,818
Continue.

43
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,457
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

44
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,570
"This envelope is for your brother."

45
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,340
"Find him and hand it to him."

46
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,615
"When these envelopes
have been handed

47
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:20,446
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

48
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,521
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

49
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,819
a stone may be placed
on my grave

50
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,020
and my name engraved on
the stone."

51
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,011
I admit it's a bit strange.

52
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,379
Is there stuff to sign?

53
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,650
No, not today.

54
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,020
OK.

55
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,654
Thank you, Jean.

56
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,319
- Shall we?
- Wait.

57
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,864
You know, the history
of our father.

58
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,302
You know, we have no brother.

59
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,738
Why did you let her write this?

60
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:19,202
I understand your surprise.

61
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,575
It's ... it's very surprising.

62
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:22,681
Stop pretending to be innocent!

63
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,374
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

64
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,748
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

65
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,184
They are part of a will.

66
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:31,847
There's that, too.

67
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:52,534
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

68
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,239
We'll sleep on it, then ...

69
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,246
We'll meet again, huh?

70
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,851
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

71
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,887
Sit down, Simon.

72
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,751
Look, Jean ...

73
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,587
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

74
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:12,359
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

75
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,695
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

76
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,565
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

77
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,761
Simon ...

78
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,396
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

79
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,134
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

80
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,869
For once in your fucking life

81
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,072
make it something normal.

82
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,439
This is not negotiable.

83
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,663
Take your time.

84
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,427
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

85
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,934
I know it's very unusual, but ...

86
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,936
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

87
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,326
We have a large family now.

88
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,540
She spoke of a traitor?

89
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,270
In a big family, there's always a dog.

90
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,006
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

91
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,706
Fucking crazy woman!

92
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,284
I'll fix that with Jean.

93
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,824
Fix what?

94
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,520
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

95
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,668
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

96
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,883
Where are you going?

97
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,178
You bury her any way you like!

98
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,843
Oh, stop!

99
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,180
You feel guilty because
you were not there

100
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,325
when she died.

101
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,256
You feel guilty because
you were there

102
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,691
when she had her accident.

103
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,387
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

104
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,226
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

105
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,858
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

106
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,196
Well, she's gone!

107
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,237
It's over, I'm at peace!

108
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,004
I have fucking peace!

109
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,243
I'm at peace now.

110
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,516
Yes, I see.

111
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:59,595
Mathematics as you
have known so far

112
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,691
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

113
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,738
to precise and definitive problems.

114
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,364
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

115
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,967
The subject will be
intractable problems

116
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:14,704
that will always lead

117
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,749
to other problems just
as intractable.

118
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,613
People around you will
repeatedly insist

119
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,745
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

120
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,915
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

121
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,824
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity.

122
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,165
Welcome to pure mathematics,

123
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,291
the land of loneliness.

124
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,428
This is my assistant,

125
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,403
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

126
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,932
Hello!

127
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,978
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

128
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,287
What does your intuition
tell you?

129
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,293
Your intuition is always right.

130
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,659
That's why you got potential

131
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,199
to becoming a real mathematician.

132
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,963
But over there, you'll need help.

133
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,130
Do you have any family there?

134
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,338
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

135
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:23,006
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

136
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,208
and b) you have another brother.

137
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,443
This is ridiculous

138
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,953
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

139
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,546
You need to know.

140
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,220
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

141
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,893
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

142
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,630
You need a starting point.

143
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,677
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

144
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,044
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

145
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,175
You never start with the
unknown variable.

146
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,053
My mother used to speak about
a village

147
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,021
called Der Om, in Fouad.

148
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,524
She graduated in French

149
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,026
at the University of Daresh.

150
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:14,099
If she studied, there is hope.

151
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,193
Said Haidar.

152
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:20,931
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

153
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,507
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

154
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,543
You can trust him.

155
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,450
What are you doing?

156
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,683
Mom! Are you Okay?

157
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,562
Madam, that's my towel, please.

158
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,389
Mom?

159
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,369
Mom!

160
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,251
Mom?

161
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:06,821
What happened?

162
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,935
Where's Jeanne?

163
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,429
Mom?

164
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,648
Does she suffer from migraines?

165
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:30,778
No.

166
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,084
- Memory loss?
- No.

167
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,353
Loss of balance?

168
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:36,518
No.

169
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,254
Absent-minded?

170
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,332
She's always absent.

171
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,866
No, she was never absent.

172
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,367
Wahab, come.

173
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,064
Just get out of my sister's way.

174
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,294
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

175
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,143
Nicolas, stop!

176
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,738
Go back to your country.

177
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:36,879
Wahab!

178
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:40,543
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

179
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,276
Give me.

180
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,822
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

181
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,257
You have sullied the
family honor.

182
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:50,827
- Enough!

183
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,660
Go home!

184
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,598
Go home!

185
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,573
Outside.

186
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,474
What have you done!

187
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:17,088
You have humilliated us!
You have sullied the
name of our family!

188
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,985
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

189
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:27,129
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

190
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,166
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

191
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,265
I'm pregnant, grandma.

192
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:38,469
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

193
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,839
Why have you done this?

194
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,845
Do I have to kill you?

195
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,984
What will I do with you?

196
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,794
Come.

197
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,431
Eat if you want your
child safe.

198
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,606
Listen to me.

199
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,774
There's nothing here for you.

200
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,878
I'll help after the birth.

201
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,146
I want you to go away.

202
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:35,659
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

203
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,960
There, you'll go to school.

204
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,328
To learn to read,
to learn to think

205
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,560
out of this misery.

206
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,503
Promise me and I'll help you.

207
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,939
Promise me you'll go to school.

208
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,015
I promise you, grandmother.

209
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,821
I promise.

210
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,572
Shh.

211
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,322
Shh.

212
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:52,312
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

213
00:26:55,527 --> 00:27:01,762
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

214
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:15,003
Be careful.
Don't worry.

215
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:51,182
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

216
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,310
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

217
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:14,837
One day I'll find you, my son.

218
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,338
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

219
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,533
but I can't help you

220
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,644
because at the time,

221
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:00,972
I taught

222
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:04,480
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

223
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,516
Specifically, the period

224
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:11,611
where Euler had
succeeded

225
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,657
to give the first

226
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,988
formal mathematical resolution

227
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:21,861
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

228
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,992
Diderot defied the Court

229
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,037
saying:

230
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:28,230
"Gentlemen ..."

231
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:32,002
I-ft plus

232
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,508
Equals zero.

233
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,674
So, God exists!"

234
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,182
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

235
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,261
Hello! Do you speak French?

236
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,267
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

237
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:03,067
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

238
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,034
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

239
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,604
Are you kidding me?

240
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:11,909
I wasn't even born.

241
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,211
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

242
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,512
I'm not kidding.

243
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,679
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

244
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,347
I have come from far away.

245
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,119
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

246
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:32,730
You are very kind.

247
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,704
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

248
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,366
Najat, that's me.

249
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,973
You have time to waste?

250
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:43,580
That tells me something.

251
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:48,118
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

252
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:50,644
It's been a long time.

253
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,251
People who leave usually
change identities.

254
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,932
It is striking nonetheless.

255
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,408
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

256
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,005
Look here.

257
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:23,310
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

258
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,257
It is a prison in the south.

259
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,456
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

260
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:34,622
- No.

261
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,200
You're definitely not from
here.

262
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:42,304
You don't know the South.

263
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,300
If the international community

264
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,204
does not intervene now

265
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,205
The refugees in overcrowded

266
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,244
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

267
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,048
She has arrived.

268
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,319
OK.

269
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,192
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

270
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,697
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

271
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,197
The National Party supports

272
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,892
militias of the Christian right,

273
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,936
who make open threats against
the refugees.

274
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,063
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

275
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,004
And have the support

276
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:55,409
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

277
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:58,744
But you ...you're a Christian.

278
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:01,374
We are for peace.

279
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,885
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

280
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,463
Nawal!

281
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,724
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

282
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,564
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

283
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,750
Nawal, come back.

284
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,217
Stay here.

285
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,819
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

286
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,794
There will be clashes.

287
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,129
Stay with me.

288
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,015
There is shooting outside ...

289
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,919
To the table, girls!

290
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,959
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

291
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,826
It's not a reason not to eat!

292
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,297
Aioua?

293
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:03,804
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

294
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,068
May God protect us!

295
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,235
That's why they closed
the university.

296
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:11,746
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

297
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,220
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

298
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,680
For how long?

299
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,417
We start tomorrow.

300
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,358
The rest of the family
is already there.

301
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,020
And the school?

302
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,532
Anyway, the school will close.

303
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,003
Only God knows how long.

304
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,766
And Le Journal?

305
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,097
Don't be afraid.

306
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:40,676
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

307
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,539
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

308
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,513
Exactly, Rafqa.

309
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,177
Exactly.

310
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:03,394
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

311
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,400
I will join you soon.

312
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,731
You will not go there now!

313
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,905
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

314
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,600
You heard your father.

315
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,771
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

316
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,249
The studies are finished.

317
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,582
I think of him every day.

318
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,418
That's my child.

319
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,389
I want to find him alive.

320
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,984
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

321
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,416
Hurry, Nawal.

322
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,570
- Your name?
- Nawal.

323
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,074
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

324
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,072
Where are you going?

325
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,447
South.

326
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,603
What for?

327
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,112
To meet my husband.

328
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,559
Wahab.

329
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,655
You have only daughters?

330
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,091
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

331
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:08,726
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

332
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:42,215
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

333
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:43,859
There.

334
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,764
The children?
Where are the children?

335
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:51,098
You should speak with those
who were there.

336
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:56,672
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

337
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,768
They fear reprisals will come.

338
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,339
The children may be with them.

339
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:11,451
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

340
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:17,288
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

341
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,813
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

342
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:47,356
I am a Christian.

343
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,930
My daughter! My daughter!

344
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:09,974
Mom!

345
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:39,587
Hi, Simon, it's me!

346
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,487
I am in Mama's village.

347
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,422
I wish you were here with me.

348
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:44,459
Listen.

349
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:09,650
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

350
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,483
I told you never to come here again!

351
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:50,815
Hello!

352
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,151
Souha?

353
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,669
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

354
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,101
I told you not to say that again!

355
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:10,835
Hello.

356
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:12,406
Can I help you?

357
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,387
Hello.

358
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:23,189
Does anyone speak French
or English?

359
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,555
Where's Sami?

360
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,228
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

361
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:39,299
Hello!
Hello!

362
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,432
Hello!
