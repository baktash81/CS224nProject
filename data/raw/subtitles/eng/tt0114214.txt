1
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:24,707
50 feet north of the wagon.

2
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,995
Or was it 50 feet
south of the wagon?

3
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,788
I can't remember.

4
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:03,167
You ain't gonna take my gold.
No, sir!

5
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,021
Asshole.

6
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:41,290
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

7
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,895
Damn you!

8
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:56,016
Don't you leave me here. I'm gonna
kill you if I ever see you again.

9
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:00,100
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

10
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:08,739
MARSHAL

11
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:37,389
5'8". Am I right?

12
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:41,112
I ain't ever wrong.

13
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:46,697
That's a girl. Thanks.

14
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:56,534
- How about a room?
- Whores next door.

15
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:03,657
- Say that again.
- Whores next door.

16
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:16,514
Now, do you have a room available?

17
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,193
A room and bath.
Yes, ma'am. Coming up.

18
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:25,354
Katie, let's go get the lady a room
and a bath.

19
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:50,846
Barkeep,
I want a bottle of champagne.

20
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:56,012
And don't you dare open it.
I want to know what I'm drinking.

21
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:04,220
- You want to play poker with me?
- You keep playing with yourself.

22
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:04,321
This is a very special pack.

23
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:08,876
I put an ace in it
every time I kill a man.

24
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:33,892
Interested in first-class whisky?
Fine cigars, lndian ink, or perfume?

25
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:39,691
John Herod owns that house. He gets
50 cents of every dollar in town.

26
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:38,020
Just shine my boots.

27
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:54,461
- What does the town get?
- They get to live.

28
00:07:56,011 --> 00:08:00,325
Another gun in town.

29
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,314
Hi, Scars.

30
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:22,602
Stand back.

31
00:08:56,164 --> 00:09:00,285
That makes ...15.

32
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,913
- I just got out of prison.
- Congratulations.

33
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:25,632
- I got 35 years, but got out early.
- How long did you do this time?

34
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,751
Three days.

35
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:33,360
- You're pretty.
- You're not.

36
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:38,555
- I need a woman.
- You need a bath.

37
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:50,368
I'm so clumsy, I must be blind.

38
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:03,277
- We prayed you'd come to help us.
- This is strictly business.

39
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:09,121
- These candelabras are worth $200.
- That's not good enough.

40
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,898
Is that it?

41
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:33,490
Don't mind my daddy.
He's just stupid.

42
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:39,019
You look like you've been riding
a long time. Where are you from?

43
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,398
Are you here for the contest?
I've never seen a woman carry a gun.

44
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:47,379
If you're a good shot,
maybe you could ...

45
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:55,682
I guess I'd better go now.

46
00:11:57,564 --> 00:12:02,402
Gold teeth!
I've got all sizes. Gold teeth.

47
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:07,888
I've got uppers. I've got lowers.
You're wasting my time.

48
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:14,085
Quiet!

49
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:20,167
I now declare
the quick-draw competition open.

50
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:25,653
Each man who enters the contest
will fight once a day.

51
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,594
Anybody can challenge anybody.
Fight times to be drawn from a hat.

52
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:39,462
For the duration of the contest -

53
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:45,186
- fighters are entitled to whatever
they want, courtesy of Mr. Herod.

54
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,771
But the man who wins the contest
gets this ...

55
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:55,169
$123,000!

56
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:59,616
Do we have any real gunmen
in this room?

57
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,568
Compliments of Mr. Herod
and Wells-Fargo.

58
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,861
All right, gentlemen,
what do you say?

59
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:11,859
- Do we?
- Yes.

60
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:19,559
Gutzon.

61
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:25,125
- I am the Swedish champion.
- Mr. Gutzon is the first to go up.

62
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,725
Anyone else?

63
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:34,169
- Put an ace up there for me.
- Ace Hanlon.

64
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:38,618
You'd better put me
and my friend Eugene on the list.

65
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,579
I ain't joining no contest.

66
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:46,818
Did I hear a clucking? Did somebody
bring a chicken in here?

67
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:52,015
- I'll kill you with my bare hands.
- No, it's a gunfight.

68
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:55,465
We aim, we fire, you die.
You'll get the idea.

69
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,543
The fighting begins tomorrow.

70
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:02,285
- Put my name up there.
- Anybody else?

71
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:06,792
- Sergeant Cantrell.
- How do you spell that?

72
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,916
Correctly.

73
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,833
- Anyone else?
- Spotted Horse.

74
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,712
Many white men will leave this town
in wooden boxes.

75
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,523
Spotted Horse. Any others?

76
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:26,998
- Put my damn name up.
- Scars.

77
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:36,868
I'm worth $3,000 in four states.
75 offences and no convictions.

78
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:42,827
My name's Fee ...
but everyone calls me The Kid.

79
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:46,273
Congratulations.

80
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:53,555
I can wake up at dawn, rob two
banks, a train, a stagecoach, -

81
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:57,557
- shoot the feathers
off a duck's ass at 300 feet, -

82
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:03,562
- and be back in bed before you
wake up next to me. How are you?

83
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:09,919
- Just fine.
- Virgil Sparks, the pride of Texas.

84
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:16,446
Horace said you drink this.
You sure must want to die young.

85
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:20,455
I do now.

86
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,539
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

87
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,614
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

88
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:12,824
- How many brave men do we got?
- 12, Mr. Herod.

89
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:17,220
13 if you count Foy,
but he and Ratsy aren't back yet.

90
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:22,145
They'll be here. They're just
running a little errand for me.

91
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,610
- Add my name to the list.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:59,919
- We beat the hell out of him.
- He ain't nothing.

93
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:07,511
Hello, Cort. I was beginning to
worry you wouldn't make it in time.

94
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:13,094
It's been a while. I hear you have
a mission down in Hermosillo.

95
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:17,095
Is that right?
Your own little piece of heaven.

96
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:23,133
Sunshine, cactus flowers
and you and the orphan children.

97
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:27,425
We burned that mission down,
just like you said.

98
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,226
All that work, Cort ...

99
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:36,842
All those years of hard work
destroyed for no reason.

100
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:43,865
It must make you angry.
You used to be fast.

101
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:48,230
Are you still fast?

102
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:52,188
Don't I get an answer?

103
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,071
Have you taken a vow of silence?

104
00:17:57,402 --> 00:18:01,444
I said, are you still fast?

105
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:04,679
Faster than you.

106
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:11,880
But I have renounced violence.

107
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,826
We'll see.

108
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:21,831
String him up.
In here, on the chair.

109
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,753
Adjust your collar, Reverend.

110
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:37,204
Pull him up, Foy.

111
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:52,883
Let me make it clear ...
I want you in that contest.

112
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,851
No.

113
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,933
Think about it.

114
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,431
Last chance.

115
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:31,952
- Yes or no?
- Go to hell.

116
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:40,115
Sign me up.

117
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,356
- No women in quick-draw.
- There's no rules against ladies.

118
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:49,484
It's just that women
can't shoot for shit.

119
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:56,127
Adios, Reverend.

120
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,716
Put 'em both in the contest.

121
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:22,113
Move it, Preacher.

122
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:25,960
Take him out by the trough.

123
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:03,199
- Come back here.
- No!

124
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:07,077
Come back here! You hear me?

125
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,719
Daddy!

126
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:30,419
Good morning. You definitely
had a good time last night.

127
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:36,819
Want some breakfast? Or how about
some more of what we had last night?

128
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:41,719
You certainly won
that drinking contest.

129
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:46,821
But then again, I won you in poker.

130
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:54,427
You puked and passed out,
so let's not plan the wedding yet.

131
00:21:55,234 --> 00:22:01,837
- Why do you sleep on this thing?
- That way nobody will steal it.

132
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:12,374
- Who are you gonna challenge today?
- Herod.

133
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:22,422
Bad idea. I'm the only guy who can
take him and I ain't gonna rush it.

134
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:29,112
- Why not?
- Hell, he's my father.

135
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,933
Have you been challenged yet?

136
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:25,302
You have now. I'll go get us a time.

137
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:29,665
These are my boys.
They don't get to church much.

138
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,184
Daddy's gonna kill you, Preacher.

139
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:53,352
- Sleep well?
- Not as well as you.

140
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,038
- I saved your life last night.
- You just stretched it out a bit.

141
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:05,085
- I might already be in heaven.
- Sorry.

142
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:20,430
- Don't you even want to fight back?
- Of course I do.

143
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:24,191
I'd like to kill them all
for what they've done ... but I won't.

144
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:30,434
- Killing people is wrong.
- Some people deserve to die.

145
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:39,315
It was a little lean this week.
The whisky was flat.

146
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:46,004
Horace, your excuses
are getting worse every week.

147
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:51,769
I took everything
out of the register, sir.

148
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:55,973
- That's all there was.
- Barkeep ...

149
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:22,419
I challenge you ...

150
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:27,667
- I'm not fighting you.
- You ain't got no choice.

151
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:32,350
- I told you!
- What are you doing here?

152
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:36,794
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here for the money.

153
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:41,577
The rules say
you have to accept every challenge.

154
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,155
If you've got a problem with that,
get out of town.

155
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:51,204
- I've got no problem.
- The lady fights Mr. Kelly.

156
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:55,120
They fight at seven o'clock tonight.

157
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:17,169
- Pick a card, honey.
- Thank you.

158
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:31,683
He's so hot.

159
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:34,806
Hold it up.

160
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,809
Ace of spades.

161
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:51,928
Thank you.

162
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:57,778
I heard you blew a little girl's
thumb off in Reno doing that.

163
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:03,140
- I'm the best you'll ever see.
- So I keep hearing.

164
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:07,185
Shall we find out?

165
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:03,146
Look, girls, there he is.

166
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,520
It's lights out, Kid.

167
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:31,892
I'm gonna be pissing on your grave
tonight. You're through!

168
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,571
Quiet!

169
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,936
- What's the odds on The Kid?
- Three to one.

170
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:52,384
Gentlemen, remember,
you must not draw -

171
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:57,101
- until that clock
makes the first chime of the hour.

172
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,502
What if somebody gets excited
and starts shooting early?

173
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:08,708
Any cheats
will be eliminated from the contest.

174
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:18,557
Whoever is standing after the draw
is the winner.

175
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:26,915
If both men are still standing,
you must continue firing.

176
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:30,873
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

177
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:40,263
I'll only wound you, Kid.

178
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,630
You're a kind man.

179
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,657
Damn, am I fast!

180
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:16,028
Did you even see me, I was so fast?

181
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:24,272
Mr. Swedish Champion, are you done?
Stay down if you're finished.

182
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:28,035
Yes, I give up.

183
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:36,274
- The Kid's the winner.
- Am I fast or is Sweden very small?

184
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:52,847
Come on, Kid, I'm gonna
get you something to drink.

185
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,526
How does it feel, Cort?

186
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:03,846
Does it remind you
of the good old days?

187
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:09,140
Is your heart beating faster?
ls your pulse racing?

188
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:16,577
- Good shooting, Kid.
- Good shooting?

189
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:24,021
If the Swede had been any slower,
birds would've nested in his hat.

190
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:27,102
Come on, Kid.

191
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:36,907
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet. See.

192
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:44,475
Four bullets in my arm, three in
my left leg and two in the back.

193
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,512
Another bullet went through my lip.
Another through my left foot.

194
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:55,918
Today a bullet went into my head
and it's not even come out yet!

195
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,810
- It's time.
- I'm not gonna fight.

196
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,930
You don't want to fight?
We'll see about that.

197
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:16,212
Get up! Come on,
don't keep Mr. Herod waiting.

198
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:20,223
Come on, Preacher, move it.

199
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:25,382
- Turn the other cheek, Preacher.
- Kick his ass!

200
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:28,781
He's gonna forgive us all.

201
00:34:32,953 --> 00:34:37,232
And that concludes
the lessons for today.

202
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,097
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.

203
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:48,772
- The reverend needs a gun.
- There's plenty of other gun shops.

204
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:54,064
- Nowhere as cheap.
- No place is cheap enough for you.

205
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:59,346
Your mouth gets faster every day.
Pity your hands are so slow.

206
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:05,585
- I ain't got slow hands.
- Put your hand on the counter.

207
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,904
Put your gun hand on the counter.

208
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:19,548
See, Cort. Here's a gunfighter's
hand, and here's a farmer's hand.

209
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:22,358
I ain't got a farmer's hand.

210
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,280
Cort and me are killers,
the genuine article, but you ...

211
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:31,835
You're from different stock.

212
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:36,205
My friend here needs a gun.

213
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,132
This is the Eagle-butt Peacemaker.
Solid ivory handle.

214
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:50,492
Only 30 of these were ever made.

215
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:59,778
This is the customized
Remington new model.

216
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,736
It's more accurate than the Colt.
The handles are solid silver.

217
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:14,301
Used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner.

218
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:26,192
This is the best help a man can get.
A Smith & Wesson Schofield .45.

219
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:32,035
Me and Jesse James think
it's the best handgun in the world.

220
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:35,590
Trigger guard removal
saves drawing time.

221
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,152
But if you're drunk,
you'll kill your feet.

222
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:44,879
- When did you last hold a gun?
- You know when.

223
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:50,281
I got offered 120 for this Colt.
You want to try it out?

224
00:36:56,032 --> 00:37:01,472
- Have you got $120, Cort?
- I don't have any money.

225
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:06,074
The Lord provides me
with everything I need.

226
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:11,032
We're wasting this boy's time then.

227
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,322
I'll be a good Samaritan.
What's the cheapest gun you've got?

228
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:22,082
The cheapest piece of crap you've
got in the whole miserable store.

229
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,766
All right ...

230
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,487
- Five bucks.
- Sold.

231
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,731
What are you doing?

232
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:47,529
The Preacher's got the Lord on
his side. He only needs one bullet.

233
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:53,494
Otherwise he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town.

234
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:59,097
- That gun shoots straight.
- It's okay, I won't draw.

235
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:08,504
You will. I know you. When it comes
down to it, you'll pull the trigger.

236
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:16,029
I've got money on you, Preacher.

237
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,875
- I've got 20 bucks on you, Foy.
- That's money in the bank, Jimmy.

238
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:11,481
Preacher boy, you're a dead man.

239
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:01,353
Bless me, Lord.
Forgive me for my sins.

240
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:36,949
- He shot me!
- You didn't lay down and die.

241
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:40,825
You said you weren't gonna fight.

242
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:47,519
It felt natural, didn't it?
Nice and smooth.

243
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:55,271
I thought you weren't gonna fight.

244
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,368
You're pretty fast.
I hope I don't have to fight you.

245
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,124
- You have a choice to be here.
- He made you do it.

246
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:16,493
I was the only one
who pulled the trigger.

247
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:20,206
This ain't much of a town
for a preacher.

248
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,977
- I wasn't always a preacher.
- Cort was an outlaw. Like us.

249
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:34,615
Weren't you?

250
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:39,597
In fact, he used to ride with me.

251
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:47,204
Of course, that's all changed now.
He's a man of peace.

252
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:50,650
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

253
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:54,249
Easy ...

254
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:58,377
There was a time
when you couldn't tell us apart.

255
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:09,784
Is that true?

256
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:12,938
- Is that true?
- Yes.

257
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:19,258
I should've let you die.

258
00:42:26,194 --> 00:42:30,029
It's yours. Go ahead, take it.

259
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:32,392
You smell good.

260
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:45,344
- What are you looking at?
- A dirty old man and a little girl.

261
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:50,786
This is a business discussion.
I'm offering her a job.

262
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:58,983
Just make sure you wash
wherever he touches you.

263
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:10,275
One of these days, I'm gonna
have to shoot you up real good.

264
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:32,689
Mr. Hanlon, I wanted to ask you
about lndian Wells.

265
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:38,485
- Did that fight really take place?
- It sure did.

266
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:45,088
- You gunned down four men?
- I had a gun in each hand.

267
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:50,175
The truth is
I am just as good with either hand.

268
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:56,897
You must be the fastest gun
in the West ... or the biggest liar.

269
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:02,018
It's a pity
you weren't there to find out.

270
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:10,350
But I was. I was the one who really
killed the Terence brothers.

271
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:16,624
I doubt that a lying chicken-shit
like you was even in the same state.

272
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:32,121
How about that left hand, Ace?

273
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:38,475
How about that left-handed draw?

274
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,838
Mr. Ace Hanlon,
scourge of the sagebrush.

275
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:10,036
The terror of Tucson.

276
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:15,121
A bladder full of hot air.

277
00:46:48,998 --> 00:46:51,468
Daddy!

278
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:03,482
String him up! Put him on a chair.

279
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:07,241
Daddy!

280
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:20,205
They're calling for you
on the street.

281
00:47:20,776 --> 00:47:26,332
Are you really gonna do it?
What if you get killed?

282
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,654
Then I won't have to answer
any more of your dumb questions.

283
00:47:30,822 --> 00:47:33,941
- Miss ...
- What?

284
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:37,097
You can do it.

285
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:56,109
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

286
00:48:24,211 --> 00:48:27,809
The last fight of the day.

287
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:30,933
Fire at the first chime.

288
00:48:31,095 --> 00:48:34,533
You're gonna die now, girl.

289
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:39,776
You're dead meat.

290
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:46,338
Look at you. Are you scared?
You're trembling like a leaf.

291
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,672
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

292
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:52,020
The lady is the winner.

293
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:56,620
- Damn!
- Come back here.

294
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:21,112
Quick-firing resumes
tomorrow at noon.

295
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:25,875
- I think you're great.
- Grow up.

296
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:30,301
Thanks.

297
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:52,791
DINNER TONIGHT
JOHN HEROD

298
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:39,411
Thirsty?

299
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:43,369
No need to go to all that trouble
just for me.

300
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:48,698
Last night The Kid.Tonight Herod.
You're a busy woman.

301
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:52,985
- Any man you're not interested in?
- Yeah, you.

302
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:22,921
You're looking at me and thinking:
We have nothing in common.

303
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:27,523
But we do. We're both winners.

304
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:30,919
How do you feel
after surviving your first day?

305
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:35,288
- The same as yesterday.
- No. Your eyes are shining.

306
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:40,527
You've passed a test.
You feel alive.

307
00:52:41,193 --> 00:52:46,954
I guess it doesn't excite me
as much as it does you.

308
00:52:50,618 --> 00:52:53,612
You think I do this contest
because it's fun?

309
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,413
Look at this town. These people
would kill you for your bootlaces.

310
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:04,616
This way I get to face my enemies.
They can't shoot me in the back.

311
00:53:04,786 --> 00:53:10,978
- And of course I always win.
- One day your luck will run out.

312
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:14,268
I don't win because I'm lucky.

313
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:18,932
Apres vous.

314
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:46,082
- Why did you come here tonight?
- You invited me.

315
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:50,130
You could've turned me down.

316
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:56,853
- I wanted to see what you're like.
- What kind of man am l?

317
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,211
The kind people hate.

318
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:10,731
I'm not trying to be popular.
The people in this town need me.

319
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:15,023
I bring a sense of order
to their lives.

320
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:19,305
- Not law, order.
- Like hanging a preacher?

321
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:24,863
He's no preacher. He's a fraud.

322
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:29,425
If a man is a killer,
that's what he is.

323
00:54:29,593 --> 00:54:34,590
That same man can't tell me
it's not in his blood any more.

324
00:54:34,756 --> 00:54:40,231
- He's the worst kind of liar.
- Why does he upset you so much?

325
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:49,275
I find myself almost
uncontrollably attracted to you.

326
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:57,678
I'd think a man like you
would have a woman.

327
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:03,287
I was married to a beautiful woman.

328
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:08,594
- She was unfaithful.
- Where is she now?

329
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:12,716
I told you ... she was unfaithful.

330
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:23,939
- Why are you really here?
- Like I said, for the money.

331
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:27,097
I'd give you all the money you want.

332
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:30,657
I wouldn't feel like I'd earned it.

333
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,538
Yes, you would.

334
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:46,034
- Did you ever kill anyone?
- Sure.

335
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:58,195
I don't think so. It all comes down
to how far you're prepared to go.

336
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,439
All the way.

337
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:10,961
My father was a judge.

338
00:56:10,962 --> 00:56:12,161
That surprises you.

339
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:17,461
He used to make my mother and
me watch people being hanged.

340
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:23,103
One day he said there was
too much bad in this world.

341
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:29,101
''He took a bullet, put it in
his gun and spun the chamber.''

342
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,234
Then he took it in turns.
Clicking it at each of us..

343
00:56:34,532 --> 00:56:37,285
..until he finally blew
the back of his head off..

344
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:40,581
..with the final click.

345
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,260
Understand this..

346
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:55,171
There is nothing on this
earth that frightens me now.

347
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,302
Nothing.

348
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:00,383
l have to go.

349
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:05,271
l shouldn't have come here.

350
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:10,109
Who are you?

351
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:13,150
Let me go.

352
00:57:47,524 --> 00:57:50,810
l apologize for my
undignified behaviour..

353
00:57:50,903 --> 00:57:53,109
..but sometimes it's hard
to get a drink around here.

354
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:05,703
l was only a kid when l
hitched up with Herod.

355
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:20,219
He singled me out because l was..

356
00:58:20,312 --> 00:58:23,350
..a little smarter and a
little faster than most.

357
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,822
First completely
fearless man l had ever met..

358
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,947
..and he wanted me to
be just as same as him.

359
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,158
We used to go revenue collecting..

360
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:41,412
''..along the border,
just the two of us.''

361
00:58:41,505 --> 00:58:43,249
Like some families go on picnics.

362
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:45,253
We are down the
galls taking the bank..

363
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:50,171
..And walked out to a
street full of federal soldiers.

364
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:51,510
We got shot up so bad.

365
00:58:56,273 --> 00:59:01,813
''This padre hid us in his mission.
He tended our wounds, fed us..''

366
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,650
..talked to both of us for hours.

367
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:12,370
''When we were strong enough to head
home, Herod told me to shoot him.''

368
00:59:14,878 --> 00:59:15,992
When l said no..

369
00:59:18,174 --> 00:59:23,133
..he put a gun to the back of my head
and started to count down from ten.

370
00:59:31,564 --> 00:59:32,845
So l killed the priest.

371
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:39,487
''lt doesn't matter what l do now.
l'm already damned, l know that.''

372
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,568
Don't go down that road. You
don't have to become like me.

373
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:56,504
Why did you call me up here? - Well.. l
wanted to ask you one simple question.

374
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:00,045
Who brought you here to fight me?

375
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,058
Mr. Herod..

376
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:17,945
l'm just a gentleman adventurer moves in
the town for the challenge of a gunfight.

377
01:00:20,038 --> 01:00:23,907
l thought Ace Hanlon was the
hired gun. l was so sure of it.

378
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:28,996
But he was just a buffoon.
You're not.

379
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,465
''My name's Clay Cantrell,
and l'm a shootist.''

380
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:39,972
l've killed 1 7 men.

381
01:00:41,606 --> 01:00:46,482
Killing is purely a business preposition
for me. lt doesn't give me any pleasure.

382
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:49,357
My employer is confidential.

383
01:00:52,203 --> 01:00:53,862
Do we have business together today?

384
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:58,199
''As soon as the rain stops, l'm
going to make an example of you.''

385
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:14,389
''Then he said, 'Give me the gun'.''

386
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,103
What could l do? l gave it to him.

387
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:20,976
Like hell l did.
- You got him?

388
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:23,312
Yep! That's the story
of a flat nose Freddy..

389
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:26,740
..who currently resides
six feet under. - How man?

390
01:01:29,413 --> 01:01:31,573
lt's a big thing for
you to enter the contest.

391
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:35,413
You've made your point.
Now l want you to step down.

392
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:37,119
No disgrace.

393
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,708
l'll step down when you step down.

394
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:46,009
l'm telling you to step down.
Your time will come.

395
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:50,354
Not with you still around.

396
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,019
Don't ever cross me.

397
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:57,978
And don't try to stare me
down like you're doing now.

398
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:03,740
l'm not sick or old. And
you're not half the man l am.

399
01:02:15,218 --> 01:02:16,498
Round two.

400
01:02:18,013 --> 01:02:22,842
''Four fights today, featuring
the eight remaining contestants.''

401
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:26,598
The winner is the
contestant left standing.

402
01:02:27,191 --> 01:02:28,306
Left alive.

403
01:02:31,572 --> 01:02:37,526
''Left alive! From now on,
we fight to the death.''

404
01:02:38,162 --> 01:02:43,287
''Well.. Well..! What a surprise,
John, you changing the rules?''

405
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:45,283
Any problem with that?

406
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:50,586
Well.. l was
planning to kill you anyway.

407
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:57,267
''Gentlemen, the street is yours.''

408
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,188
l'm confused.

409
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:52,450
All l hear from you.. you
spineless cowards is how poor you are.

410
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:55,920
''How you can't afford
my taxes, my protection.''

411
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:59,998
Yet somehow you've all
managed to find the money..

412
01:04:00,927 --> 01:04:03,335
..to hire a professional
gunfighter to kill me.

413
01:04:08,436 --> 01:04:09,930
Where's all this money coming from?

414
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:14,349
What am l to think?

415
01:04:17,655 --> 01:04:20,776
''lf you've got so much to spare, l'm
just gonna take some more off you.''

416
01:04:21,326 --> 01:04:23,236
Because you clearly
ignore the message

417
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:26,080
This is my town!

418
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:35,209
''lf you live to see the dawn,
it's because l allow it.''

419
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,048
l'm in charge of everything.

420
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,391
l decide who lives or who dies.

421
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,368
Your gunfighter's dead.

422
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:01,456
Old news.

423
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:39,616
ls it possible?

424
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,542
ls it possible to
improve on perfection?

425
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,672
The man's dead.
The Kid's the winner.

426
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:51,092
l heard him. l heard
him move his hand.

427
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:54,646
''l tell you people, l
am on a different level.''

428
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,850
''lnfact, l am the new
Goddamn mayor of this town.''

429
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,314
Wonderful!

430
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,783
He stinks worse dead.

431
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:10,741
Storm coming up. No more fights
till we see what it's gonna do.

432
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,112
Fix on me fellas.

433
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:21,750
We're gonna have to bury this old
man deep. He stinks something awful.

434
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:44,527
Get up!

435
01:06:50,211 --> 01:06:51,836
Go. Get the hell out of here.

436
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:53,750
Get the hell out of here!

437
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:15,236
Yep!

438
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:20,153
That little girl is
gonna be a real good earner.

439
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,943
''Deal me in, boys.
- All right!''

440
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,446
l feel lucky.
- Was she good?

441
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:53,989
Wriggled like a fish.

442
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:00,409
Get up!

443
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:13,011
''Bitch! l'll kill you. - Outside,
you bastard! - l'll kill you.''

444
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:15,096
Outside!
- You have got it.

445
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:22,477
You Goddamn filthy bitch!
l am gonna..

446
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:42,129
''No, no. Please.
Don't kill me.. no.. no.''

447
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:47,013
''No please. No, please don't kill
me.. John. Don't kill me, please.''

448
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:51,182
John. John.

449
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:53,474
Finish him off!
- No. No.

450
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:57,610
This contest isn't over
until one of you are dead.

451
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:02,990
Please forgive me. Don't kill me.
Please. Oh please. Please..

452
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,413
No.. No..

453
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,213
This contest is not over yet.

454
01:09:24,646 --> 01:09:25,761
A drink.

455
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:30,350
Thank you.

456
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:40,362
Die!

457
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:05,015
Gold teeth. A whole
mouthful of gold teeth.

458
01:10:08,072 --> 01:10:09,816
And the Lady moves to round three.

459
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,992
There's always
forgiveness if you ask for it.

460
01:10:43,532 --> 01:10:44,942
Come on. Preacher.

461
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,096
''Thank you, Ratsy.
- Goodbye.''

462
01:11:32,466 --> 01:11:36,296
''Hey! What are you doing?
Not quitting, are you?''

463
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,593
l know this is
probably the wrong time but..

464
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:48,643
..l like you and l want you to stay.

465
01:11:49,527 --> 01:11:53,062
How can you live like this?
- Live like what?

466
01:11:54,742 --> 01:11:57,862
Aren't you even going to stay
for Cort's fight? - No. l'm not.

467
01:11:57,955 --> 01:12:00,624
Wait it will start any minute now
and then.. - l don't care about them.

468
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,450
''l don't care about you, or
anybody else in this town.''

469
01:12:10,009 --> 01:12:11,208
l'm through.

470
01:12:19,145 --> 01:12:21,636
l don't think you heard me right.
l said l liked you.

471
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:32,530
Spotted Horse cannot
be killed by a bullet.

472
01:13:45,707 --> 01:13:48,032
The man's dead. Cort's the winner.

473
01:13:49,628 --> 01:13:51,171
He killed that lndian.

474
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:10,895
Spotted Horse cannot
be killed by a bullet.

475
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:12,398
Give me another bullet.

476
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:15,147
l thought l explained the rules
to you very carefully.

477
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,151
You have to kill the man.

478
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:27,329
''Give me another bullet,
John. Somebody give me a bullet!''

479
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:31,417
38 Long Colt.

480
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,388
'l shall not kill.'
That's what you told me.

481
01:14:38,477 --> 01:14:42,179
'l have renounced all violence.'
- Now Goddamn it!

482
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:47,478
Now!

483
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:32,159
''Congratulations, looks like you're
going to the next round, Preacher.''

484
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,745
Applause him.

485
01:15:48,354 --> 01:15:49,813
Bravo.

486
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:55,104
Welcome back.. Killer.

487
01:16:01,994 --> 01:16:03,370
Bastard!

488
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:08,991
Give me that.

489
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,921
- l knew l'd find you here.
- You know who l am?

490
01:16:46,755 --> 01:16:49,875
Of course l do. l
brought you into this world.

491
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:00,723
- Your father.. - l don't
want to talk about it .

492
01:17:01,356 --> 01:17:06,435
You've been hours looking
for his grave. He's not here.

493
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:11,567
Herod's men.. they
smashed the gravestone l made.

494
01:17:13,872 --> 01:17:16,279
And then they burned his body
till there was nothing left.

495
01:17:19,253 --> 01:17:24,546
There are good people here.
They're just cowards.. like me.

496
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:32,509
''And they're waiting, hoping for
someone like you to come and stop him.''

497
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:36,891
l can't! l can't kill him!

498
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:41,730
l had my chance and l was scared.

499
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:48,864
- l'm scared of dying. -
You've been dead since it happened.

500
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:53,209
You're more scared of living.

501
01:17:55,378 --> 01:17:57,917
lt will be the same
if you keep riding.

502
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:05,390
l pulled this from the fire.

503
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:09,224
He was the best friend l ever had.

504
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:15,275
String him up. Put him on a chair.

505
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:20,609
- Say your prayers.
- Here's the rope.

506
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,849
Daddy! No!

507
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:53,440
Put her down Goddamn it!

508
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:55,450
No!

509
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:20,305
''Hello, bunny.''

510
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,184
What's wrong with you?

511
01:19:48,973 --> 01:19:52,093
What the hell! That's Mr.
Herod's prisoner.

512
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:59,688
l hope you don't think l've sunk
to some base level of humanity.

513
01:20:00,988 --> 01:20:03,859
The Bible speaks of turning..

514
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:06,440
Ploughsheds and sword against evil.

515
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,777
And l feel that it must be
God's will that l'm here.

516
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:12,284
So l..

517
01:20:13,668 --> 01:20:14,914
l..

518
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,501
And l..

519
01:20:27,226 --> 01:20:28,508
Oh God..

520
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:39,652
Why are you doing this to me? - Because
we could both be dead tomorrow.

521
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,309
Promise me.. Promise me
you'll leave Herod for me.

522
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,119
l challenge you.

523
01:22:02,213 --> 01:22:03,377
Go away.

524
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,802
l'm not fighting
anybody else. l wanted you.

525
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,339
l've already been challenged.

526
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:19,687
''Sir, it's time for me to
see if l'm my father's equal.''

527
01:22:26,368 --> 01:22:28,195
You would fight your own son.

528
01:22:30,164 --> 01:22:33,665
l'm gonna kill you if l have to
ride all the way to hell to do it.

529
01:22:33,836 --> 01:22:35,496
Do you have some
particular problem with me?

530
01:22:39,426 --> 01:22:40,706
l'll let you know.

531
01:23:01,702 --> 01:23:04,870
l'm not fighting you.
- l'm not fighting you.

532
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:09,210
l came here to kill Herod. And
that's what l'm gonna to do.

533
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:13,751
Stand down.
- l will not stand down.

534
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:16,511
Stand down and let me take him in
the final. He'll be just as dead.

535
01:23:21,644 --> 01:23:23,552
Let me make something
clear to both of you.

536
01:23:24,187 --> 01:23:27,723
You are going to fight.
Nobody walks out on this contest.

537
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:29,394
No body stands down.

538
01:23:30,737 --> 01:23:32,314
You don't tell me what to do.

539
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:37,652
lf you try to leave
town my men will kill you.

540
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,739
''lf refuse to fight,
my men will kill you.''

541
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,573
You had your chance to
quit and now it's gone.

542
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:04,143
Clear the street!

543
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:10,730
Round three! Only
four contestants left.

544
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:17,790
Mr. Herod fights The Kid.
Then the Lady fights Cort.

545
01:24:18,502 --> 01:24:19,701
Clear the street!

546
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:24,669
You don't have to do this. Everybody
out here knows you're the best.

547
01:24:25,635 --> 01:24:29,336
lt ain't about that. l'm his son.

548
01:24:30,642 --> 01:24:32,718
lf this is the only way he
is going to admit that..

549
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:38,982
..so be it.

550
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:44,737
What can you possibly get
out of this? What do you want?

551
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:55,954
All l want is his respect.

552
01:25:45,481 --> 01:25:46,678
l love you.

553
01:25:51,738 --> 01:25:53,481
Bravo!
- We are with you.

554
01:26:04,211 --> 01:26:06,419
Drop out. You've made your point.

555
01:26:08,884 --> 01:26:13,049
''The gunfight is in the head,
not in the hands.''

556
01:26:16,184 --> 01:26:18,473
The only thing that
makes him invincible..

557
01:26:19,937 --> 01:26:22,013
..because you all think he is.

558
01:26:23,817 --> 01:26:26,191
Maybe five years ago
he was the fastest..

559
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:28,691
..but..

560
01:26:29,533 --> 01:26:31,609
..time catches up with everyone.

561
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:38,332
He's just a little bit slower than
he used to be. And as for myself..

562
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,783
..could you believe it?

563
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,206
l just reached my peak.

564
01:27:06,912 --> 01:27:08,192
Shit. That was fast!

565
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:14,665
No! No! Oh my..

566
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:18,215
Oh my God!

567
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:46,200
''Did l get him?
- Yeah, Kid, you got him.''

568
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:48,198
Did l kill him?

569
01:27:50,047 --> 01:27:54,875
''You were so fast, Kid.
- l don't want to die.''

570
01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:59,137
l don't want to die.

571
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:08,264
l know.

572
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:37,809
lt was never proved
that he was my son.

573
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:45,193
lt was a farmer that..
He wasn't mine.

574
01:28:51,995 --> 01:28:55,115
l gave him a way out.
He wouldn't take it.

575
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:04,112
What kind of ink do you have?
- Any kind you need.

576
01:31:39,986 --> 01:31:44,400
lf neither one of you fire by
the time l count down from ten..

577
01:31:45,285 --> 01:31:47,028
..my men will gun you down.

578
01:31:55,755 --> 01:32:00,050
Ten.. nine..

579
01:32:00,134 --> 01:32:04,133
- Draw your gun. No point
both of us dying - Eight.

580
01:32:06,183 --> 01:32:08,058
- Seven. - Draw that gun damn it!

581
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,179
''- Six. - Kill me, Ellen.''

582
01:32:12,483 --> 01:32:14,939
Five.
- Kill me! - Four!

583
01:32:16,071 --> 01:32:19,522
Kill me! Three!
- Kill me! Or l'm gonna kill you.

584
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,951
Two!
- Please.

585
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:23,360
One!

586
01:32:50,738 --> 01:32:52,018
She's dead.

587
01:32:53,615 --> 01:33:00,284
''Oh, Jesus! She's dead! Leave her
alone. You vultures. Don't touch her!''

588
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:03,240
''Nice shooting, Reverend.''

589
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:07,086
''May l go, say you put a fox
in hen house and you'll have..''

590
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:08,715
..chicken for dinner every time.

591
01:33:10,636 --> 01:33:12,878
''You're gonna burn for this,
you son of a bitch.''

592
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:16,552
ls this what you wanted all along?
Wait till you get some.

593
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:25,939
Son of a bitch!

594
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:34,946
''Of course we'll fight,
but the rules say tomorrow.''

595
01:33:35,374 --> 01:33:39,206
l'll even let you name the time.
- Dawn.

596
01:33:54,103 --> 01:33:55,563
Break my nose twice?

597
01:33:59,568 --> 01:34:01,478
Now we'll see how fast you can draw.

598
01:35:17,328 --> 01:35:20,164
Who did that?
- l did that. Mr. Herod.

599
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:22,374
That how you ruined the contest.

600
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:24,911
You've got 20
seconds to get out of town.

601
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:29,171
''That's not fair. l've only ever
done what you told me to, Mr. Herod''

602
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:32,629
''You now have 15 seconds.
- Goodbye, Ratsy.''

603
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,551
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

604
01:35:36,643 --> 01:35:40,392
What do you think Cort?
There's a lot of..

605
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:41,856
..people here that
want entertainment.

606
01:35:42,483 --> 01:35:45,936
l could draw with my left hand.
How does that sound?

607
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:52,115
''Of course unlike Mr. Ace Hanlon, l
really can fight with both hands.''

608
01:35:52,912 --> 01:35:55,155
How do you feel? l'm nervous.

609
01:35:56,374 --> 01:35:59,661
lt takes a lot to scare me.
l love the sensation.

610
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:07,136
''Time's up, Ratsy!''

611
01:36:14,354 --> 01:36:15,848
''l always wanted to fight you, Cort.''

612
01:36:16,983 --> 01:36:18,525
Ever since the first time l saw you.

613
01:36:20,737 --> 01:36:23,228
lt's just this itch
that l had to scratch.

614
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:43,546
''Whatever happens, if he's still
standing in the end, gun him down.''

615
01:38:53,962 --> 01:38:56,798
You're dead! You're dead!

616
01:39:27,919 --> 01:39:30,670
''Sorry, John. Changed the rules.''

617
01:39:31,923 --> 01:39:36,337
Now on all our fights are fair.
- Who are you?

618
01:39:53,992 --> 01:39:55,783
You stole my life.

619
01:39:57,453 --> 01:40:00,573
''Let her go, you son of
a bitch! Let her go!''

620
01:40:05,879 --> 01:40:10,294
Hey please.. don't make
my little girl watch this.

621
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:13,263
''Just let.. let her go,
before you kill me.''

622
01:40:13,348 --> 01:40:16,302
''Oh! l can't do that. Tell you,
l've had my three shots.''

623
01:40:17,102 --> 01:40:19,511
l'll give you three shots
to save your daddy's life.

624
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:22,389
Leave her you son of a bitch.

625
01:40:22,735 --> 01:40:26,981
''Shoot the rope, and if it breaks,
your daddy can live.''

626
01:40:27,404 --> 01:40:28,864
You got my word.

627
01:40:30,033 --> 01:40:32,905
''You can.. You can do it, darling.''

628
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:41,079
''l can't. - You can do it,
darling. Come on just..''

629
01:40:41,172 --> 01:40:45,669
..just hold the gun in both
hands and pull the hammer back.

630
01:40:47,013 --> 01:40:51,059
l can't.
- You can. You can do it.

631
01:40:51,768 --> 01:40:55,220
No. l can't.
- Don't you worry about this.

632
01:40:56,816 --> 01:41:01,775
None of this is your fault.
Don't you blame yourself anyhow.

633
01:41:02,364 --> 01:41:07,406
Just remember that
your daddy loves you.

634
01:41:09,622 --> 01:41:14,701
How long l'll always love you..
Just remember that. Now. Come on.

635
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,790
Come on.

636
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:30,678
That's close enough.

637
01:42:04,772 --> 01:42:08,605
You're not fast enough for me.
- Today l am.

638
01:43:31,792 --> 01:43:33,333
The law's come back to town.
