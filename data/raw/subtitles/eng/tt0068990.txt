1
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,642
<i>Ouch!</i> Shh!

2
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:56,179
- I bumped my knee.
- Who cares about your dumb old knee?

3
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,282
Now, be quiet and stay down.

4
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:01,350
Okay?

5
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:18,331
What are you doing that for?

6
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,566
'Cause that's what they always do.
Who?

7
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,634
The Indians.

8
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:30,474
Now you stay here, and I'll
tell you when to come.

9
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,542
Okay?

10
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,186
<i>Oh, boots. Stay down, okay?</i>

11
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:49,821
- Shh.
- Be quiet, boots.

12
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:54,825
Shh!

13
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,327
No, boots. Shh! Down!

14
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,329
<i>Boots, hush up out there!</i>

15
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,169
Oh, boots. Get away.
<i>You hear me, boots?</i>

16
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,638
<i>Hush up out there!</i>

17
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,708
Here. This oughta shut ya up.

18
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,578
Oh, for Pete's sake.

19
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,787
How did he do that?

20
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:42,365
Sam.

21
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,611
Quick, take these. Hurry.

22
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:11,789
Well, if it isn't big
chief red top himself?

23
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,324
I don't see
much of you, Samantha,

24
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,626
since your ma took to bargain
huntin' at the supermarket.

25
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,661
Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.

26
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,464
Everybody's squeezin' out
the small-business man.

27
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,532
And those empties
don't help either.

28
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,901
It does seem to me...

29
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:30,838
I get more of these
things back than I sell.

30
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,841
How's that grandpa
of yours doin'?

31
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:37,444
I haven't been to see him for a while.
Oh, he's okay.

32
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,946
Well, that's six bottles.
Be 12 cents.

33
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,948
You want the usual? Yes, sir.

34
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,417
Maybe you ought to ask
this young lady what she wants.

35
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,820
- She wants the same as me.
- Samantha?

36
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,756
That's right.
I want the same as him.

37
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
Okay.

38
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,495
Two suckers on the house
and the bottles in jelly beans.

39
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,531
But you better watch out,
Napoleon.

40
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,533
When a woman starts agreeing
with everything you say,

41
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,335
she's really got
her eye out for you.

42
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,776
I don't think it's right.

43
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:15,278
It's not stealing. I mean, we
gave him his bottles back.

44
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,613
But they were his bottles.

45
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,982
Well, anyway, I don't eat
the jelly beans myself.

46
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,784
They're for Charley.
Who's Charley?

47
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,686
Who's Charley?
You wanna meet him?

48
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:30,590
Yeah! Okay, I'll take ya,

49
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:34,793
but you gotta promise to help me on exams tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to.

50
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,630
Well, okay. Good. Come on.

51
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,609
<i>Here, Charley!</i>

52
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:56,578
Over here, Charley! Come on!

53
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,714
Over here, Charley. Come on.
Charley's a horse.

54
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:03,818
Yeah. Over here, Charley.
Come on.

55
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,754
He knows ya? Of course he does.
Here, Charley!

56
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,690
What are you trying to do?
I'm gonna get on him.

57
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,726
He's teachin' me how to ride, so I
can be a cowboy like my grandpa was.

58
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,828
Your grandpa was a cowboy?

59
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,030
Yep. And he's part Indian too.

60
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:20,800
I don't believe you. He can't
be an Indian and a cowboy.

61
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:24,069
My grandpa can. Here, Charley!
Come on!

62
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:27,105
Yeah. Here's
your candy, Charley.

63
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:37,113
- Come on. He can carry the two of us.
- I can't ride.

64
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:41,584
Just hold on, okay? Come on. Hurry
up, before he finishes the candy.

65
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,719
Hurry, he's almost finished.

66
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,889
Hold on tight.
He's gonna go now.

67
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,124
Where to? Across the
field to the water.

68
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,459
The candies make him thirsty.

69
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,894
Come on. Giddyap. Come on.

70
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,897
Come on. Giddyap, Charley.
Giddyap. Come on.

71
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,566
See, isn't it fun? Yeah.

72
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:03,535
Aren't you supposed to have a
saddle and a bridle to hold?

73
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:07,739
Nah, that's only for people who don't
know how to ride. Giddyap. Yee-ha!

74
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:12,143
Come on, Charley! Come on!
That's it.

75
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,047
He likes that. Yeah.

76
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:25,055
Come on.

77
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:27,891
Thanks for the ride, Charley.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Charley.

78
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:31,494
You're the best horse, Charley.
Good-bye. Good-bye!

79
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,933
Can you see her?
There's nobody there.

80
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,168
Good. She's probably still out.

81
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,703
She ever hit you for bein' late?
No.

82
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,938
I don't think housekeepers
are allowed to.

83
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,973
She just jabbers at me a lot.

84
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,608
Well, I'd better make
a run for it, napol...

85
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:55,079
oh, hi, gertrude.

86
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,114
<i>So you finally decided</i>
<i>to come home, hmm?</i>

87
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:59,082
Do you know what time it is?

88
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:02,118
No, ma'am. <i>It's 6:00.</i>

89
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,553
Now I don't know what you've
been doing, young lady,

90
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,621
but let's get one thing
straight around here.

91
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:10,191
<i>While your mother and father are
away, I'm responsible for you.</i>

92
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:14,128
I expect to see you home by 5:00.
Now, is that understood?

93
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,998
Yeah. <i>Oh, go to your
room and get changed.</i>

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,166
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

95
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,634
See ya, Napoleon.

96
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,172
What have you got
all over your dress?

97
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,841
It's horse hair. Horse hair!

98
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,185
Grandpa, I'm home!

99
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:46,522
<i>I'm home, grandpa!</i>

100
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:01,235
Hi, grandpa. Ahoy there, mate.

101
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:03,604
Say, you're late.

102
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,973
You been behavin' yourself?

103
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,475
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,743
Gotta keep things
shipshape around here.

105
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:14,580
Permission to speak, sir?
<i>Permission granted.</i>

106
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:18,016
Grandpa, all the other kids are
goin' to the movies. Can we go?

107
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,184
Well, now, that depends.

108
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,553
Depends on what?

109
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,555
On whether or not
you're gonna give...

110
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:27,090
Your grandpa's achin' back
a rub or not.

111
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:30,025
Sure.

112
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,764
Now, go on. Go on, now.
Get the liniment. Okay.

113
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,708
Did captain Morgan really die
in a Spanish prison, grandpa?

114
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,244
Not on your life, he didn't. There wasn't a
prison in the world could hold old Morgan.

115
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,846
There's nothin' as tough
as an old sea dog.

116
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,051
Do you think I could ever do all
the things you did, grandpa?

117
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,887
Well, if you eat your vittles
and keep your curiosity up...

118
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,889
And your wits about you,
you will.

119
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:12,761
<i>¶¶</i>

120
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:16,798
What is it, grandpa?
Well, darned if I know.

121
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,738
<i>¶¶</i>

122
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:42,154
Step right up.
Join the celebration.

123
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:45,957
It's a real, live lion!

124
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,859
Golly!

125
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:51,127
Hey, uh, what are
you celebratin'?

126
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,597
Oh, we are celebrating
an ending, my dear friends.

127
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,600
An ending? To what?

128
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:00,970
<i>To a... a lifelong partnership.</i>

129
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,772
Yes, um, and
two glorious careers.

130
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,840
Oh, permit me.

131
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,276
Dimetri, the clown.

132
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,245
Brrrrrrrr. ¶ Ba-da ¶

133
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:15,281
Uh, I'm, uh, Seth Wilson.

134
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,283
And I'm Napoleon.

135
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:21,086
And major, eh?
The king of beasts.

136
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,589
<i>Won't you join us?</i>
<i>Oh, please. I beg of you.</i>

137
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,924
Are you sure he won't object? Oh,
no, no, no, he won't object.

138
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:30,827
He's the most kind
and gentle king of beasts.

139
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,062
Would you do the honors, please?
The honors?

140
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,964
Oh, yes, yes.

141
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,737
<i>Have you seen such a thing?</i>

142
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,943
So you're retirin'?

143
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,882
Dimetri is finally
going home... to Europe.

144
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,886
- Is the lion goin' with ya?
- Well, uh, that is the predicament.

145
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,854
That is the sadness.

146
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,490
<i>Why? What's the matter?</i>

147
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,292
Old friends should
never be separated.

148
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:12,028
Oh, you mean you can't
take him with you.

149
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,064
<i>What are you gonna do with him?</i>

150
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,466
Well, I'm searching
for a happy place...

151
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:21,268
Where his majesty will be
treated like his majesty.

152
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,303
Have you tried a zoo?

153
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,305
Oh, I have, I have.

154
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:28,775
And they have been
very kind and helpful, but...

155
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:32,145
They cannot find a place for
an old, milk-drinking lion,

156
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:34,147
an old veteran of joy.

157
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,983
Hey, my grandpa used to be
a lion trainer!

158
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:39,752
That was a long time ago,
Napoleon.

159
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,888
- Did you work in the circus?
- <i>No!</i>

160
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,957
<i>He trained lions</i>
<i>for the emperor of Ethiopia!</i>

161
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,026
<i>That was quite</i>
<i>a long time ago, Napoleon.</i>

162
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,496
My dear friends,
my beloved friends,

163
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,831
the major is yours.

164
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,167
<i>You mean that</i>
<i>you're givin' him to us?</i>

165
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,502
Not I, but fate.

166
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:04,172
Oh, no, no, no, no. None of that.
We can't have a lion in our home.

167
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:07,942
- <i> Why not?</i>
- Well, because he's a wild animal, that's why not.

168
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,978
- Oh, no.
- He doesn't look very wild to me.

169
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,981
And besides, you said
you were a lion trainer.

170
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:17,384
<i>We can't have him in our home. He's too expensive.
We wouldn't be able to feed him.</i>

171
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:20,220
Why he must eat like a... like
a... like a... <i>oh, no, no, no.</i>

172
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,956
Not major. He just drinks milk.

173
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,792
He has bad teeth.

174
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:28,094
Oh.

175
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:35,300
- Please, grandpa.
- No, no. We... we haven't got any place to keep a lion.

176
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:38,436
Yeah, we have. We have a cage.

177
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:42,172
Cage?

178
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,378
Oh, it's gonna take at least
a dozen quarts of milk...

179
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,114
<i>To keep this boy goin'</i>
<i>for just one day.</i>

180
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:55,383
Don't worry, grandpa. I'm gonna
save all my pocket money...

181
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,386
Just to buy milk.

182
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:01,489
Hold on now. He isn't too
well acquainted with us yet.

183
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:04,158
He might be a little
feisty in the mornings.

184
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,561
Oh, grandpa. Ah, ah, ah, now.

185
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,596
Ah-ah-ah.

186
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,832
He knows us. He's part
of our family now.

187
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,239
Here ya are. Okay.

188
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,877
- Look at him, grandpa.
- I'm a lookin'.

189
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,145
Did I say a dozen quarts
of milk?

190
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,514
What he's gonna need
is a whole cow.

191
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,116
<i>Oh!</i>

192
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,384
Well, one thing at least.

193
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,019
He started the hens
back to layin'.

194
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,259
Eh-eh, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah.

195
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,128
Oh, grandpa. Gyah.

196
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,630
Here. Have some more milk.

197
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,433
Well, I declare.

198
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,143
Bye, grandpa.
Oh, you off to school?

199
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,145
Yeah. Now don't
dawdle on the way.

200
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:12,180
I don't want that teacher
complainin' about you again. Okay.

201
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,219
Bye, major. Have a nice day.
See you when I come home.

202
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,988
You'll watch him for me, won't you, grandpa?
Of course I will.

203
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,323
And you remember
what I told you.

204
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,491
<i>I will.</i> Don't gossip about him.

205
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,627
If the authorities hear about him,
they'd take him away. Darn busybodies.

206
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,662
Yeah.

207
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,231
Bye, grandpa. Oh, Napoleon.

208
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah? You drop this off at the
post on your way, will ya?

209
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,168
Where's it goin'? New York.

210
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,171
Oh, yeah. Good-bye. Nyah.

211
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:16,498
Yeah. That's right.

212
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,369
Couple of old-timers,
you and me, hmm?

213
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:30,977
Let's go see Charley.
No, I gotta go home.

214
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:34,680
Well, why? I just gotta.
That's why.

215
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:37,949
You wanna come over to
my house and play? No.

216
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,384
Can I come to yours? No!

217
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,991
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,626
Now can you keep a secret?
You know I can.

219
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,996
Then come on. Am I
supposed to guess or what?

220
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:55,964
You're not supposed
to do anything.

221
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:58,032
You'll just see it
when you see it.

222
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,637
It's a real, live lion!

223
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,672
<i>His name is major.</i>

224
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:08,274
Think I could come in
and pet him?

225
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,276
Come on in.

226
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:20,717
He won't hurt ya. Pet him.

227
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,453
See? He's nice.

228
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,755
Sure is a nice lion.

229
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:31,459
Sure is. Couldn't be any nicer.
He drinks milk.

230
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,427
Must drink an awful lot.

231
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,494
He does.

232
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,265
Ah, see? See? Look, look, look.

233
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,267
See what he's doin'? See?

234
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,302
He won't even... ahh.

235
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:53,041
Twenty-six quarts
in three days?

236
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:59,313
Sure gonna make a dent in the pension check.
Oh, yeah, that's right.

237
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,448
Here ya are, Napoleon.
Thanks, Mr. Gutteridge.

238
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,384
Thank you.

239
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,324
You know, Seth... hmm?

240
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,027
You're lookin'
a mite peaked lately.

241
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:21,129
You feelin' all right?

242
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,764
Right as rain, amos.

243
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,367
Well, it stands to reason with all
that milk you've been drinkin'.

244
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,369
I'm not drinkin' it.

245
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,771
<i>What are you doin'?</i>
<i>Bathin' in the stuff?</i>

246
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,607
<i>Yeah. How'd you guess?</i> What?

247
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,242
Any doctor'll tell ya.

248
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:42,645
Milk baths. When a man gets to be
my age, milk supples the flesh.

249
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:47,248
You ought to try it on
that ornery hide of yours.

250
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,517
<i>Gonna help me, Napoleon?</i>
<i>So long, amos.</i>

251
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,353
So long, Seth.

252
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,355
Good-bye, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thanks again.

253
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,423
Bye, Napoleon.

254
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,768
You nappin', grandpa?

255
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,470
Wh-wh-what? Me? Nappin'?

256
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:16,674
No. No. I was just
squinchin' my eyes,

257
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:19,109
lookin' for smoke signals.

258
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,778
Smoke signals? Where?

259
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,248
Mmm, over on yonder hill there.

260
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,785
Wild Indians, they send out their
messages along about this time of day.

261
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:32,154
Didn't I ever tell you?

262
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,756
No! Golly!

263
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,226
Hold it. I-I do believe
there is one now.

264
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,728
<i>No. No, it's just a cloud.</i>

265
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,798
No, grandpa, I think
that<i> is</i> a smoke signal.

266
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,833
Yeah.

267
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,640
Come on, maj. Giddyap.

268
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:57,809
Ah, you're slow as molasses.

269
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:01,879
Gosh! Now git. Come on.

270
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,649
That's okay.
It was a good ride,

271
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,717
even if you can't gallop.

272
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,319
Okay.

273
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,492
Now, maj... now, you...
Get... in there.

274
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,530
Now... now go on!

275
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:27,166
<i>Get in there. Your milk's
waitin' and everything, maj.</i>

276
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:30,569
Come... maj! Get in there.

277
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,640
There! Finally.

278
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,808
Golly.

279
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,443
I'm gonna go see grandpa, okay?

280
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,657
Hi, grandpa.

281
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,359
Ah, mornin', officer.

282
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,527
Me and maj have had
our ride already.

283
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,797
<i>You were sleepin' so sound, I didn't
wanna wake ya. You gettin' up?</i>

284
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,234
I thought maybe I'd spend
a day in bed.

285
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,936
I'm not feelin'
so well this mornin'.

286
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,005
Is your tummy bad again?

287
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,507
Somethin' like that.

288
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,310
Hey, want me to fix you
breakfast in bed, captain?

289
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,879
Why, I'd like that.

290
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,948
Okay. I'll fix ya somethin'
real special, okay?

291
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,334
Why, thank you.

292
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,402
My, my, this looks good.

293
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:56,573
- What's this?
- Oh, that's an onion sandwich.

294
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,607
Oh.

295
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:03,678
What's this?

296
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,048
Oh, that's chocolate, strawberry and
vanilla ice cream, all melted up.

297
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,651
Oh, my, my. That is tasty.

298
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:13,720
But I think I...
I'll just save that.

299
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:17,657
Set it over there, will ya?
I'll just take my coffee. Okay.

300
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:32,972
Oh, that's the instant kind,
since I don't know how to perk.

301
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:35,474
But I put in two extra spoons.

302
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,943
It's good. It's good.

303
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,579
But I think I'll
just save this too.

304
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,747
Okay. Set it there.

305
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:50,019
I better go
clean up the kitchen.

306
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:53,589
- Napoleon?
- Yeah, grandpa?

307
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:56,758
Come here a minute, will ya? Sit down.
I... I want to talk to you.

308
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,762
What are we gonna talk about?
Us, Napoleon.

309
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:03,464
We are going to talk about us.

310
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,767
We've been a...
a good crew, haven't we?

311
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:10,537
The two of us? Shipmates? We've had
some good times together, haven't we?

312
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,475
- We sure have, captain.
- The trouble is, your old grandpa is gettin' older.

313
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,811
We both are.
I'm gonna be 11 in August.

314
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:22,681
Trouble is,
this old body of mine...

315
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:25,550
it just... it's just
gettin' older.

316
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:28,753
Uh, wrinkled old hands...

317
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:31,388
And tired old muscles.

318
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,691
The ticker just keeps missin'
a tick now and then.

319
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:39,662
Then I take a deep breath, I
just keep coughin' all the time.

320
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:44,033
- But everybody coughs, grandpa.
- Mm, yeah.

321
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:46,068
What are you gonna do...

322
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,805
With an old machine that
just keeps breakin' down?

323
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,974
- Ya fix it.
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:55,509
What about when
you can't fix it no more?

325
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:02,082
Well, you gotta trade it in
for a new one.

326
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,884
That's just what
I'm going to do.

327
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:09,087
I'm gonna trade this old machine
of mine in for a new one.

328
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:12,089
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

329
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,691
What do you mean, grandpa?

330
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:17,693
Oh, it's nothin' to be
concerned about.

331
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:20,195
Nothin' to be scared
or frightened about.

332
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:25,099
It's just that, uh,
my old body is... is dyin'.

333
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:27,734
I'm not surprised.

334
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:32,171
<i>It's a wonder it didn't do it years
before, the way I've treated it.</i>

335
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:35,874
I never knew anyone
who died before.

336
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:40,211
Nobody ever really dies,
Napoleon.

337
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,180
The thing that's real in you...

338
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:47,083
Just keeps goin'
on and on forever.

339
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:51,920
<i>You know, in a way,</i>

340
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:56,457
<i>we're like the seasons...</i>
<i>life is.</i>

341
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,759
You're born in the spring.

342
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:02,529
Then you grow up
during the hot, warm summer.

343
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:05,632
And autumn's the time
when you reach maturity.

344
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,967
You're at your peak.

345
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:12,137
And then...
then there's the winter.

346
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:16,508
It gives us all a chance
to go quickly back to spring...

347
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,810
And start all over again.

348
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,614
But you still have to go away and
leave me, don't you, grandpa?

349
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:27,184
<i>No, no, that... that</i>
<i>doesn't follow at all.</i>

350
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,719
You see, I've always wanted
to take my rest...

351
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,987
Up... up... up there
on the hill...

352
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,590
Where we used to like to sit
and watch the sunset.

353
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,594
<i>Of course, I've made my peace</i>
<i>with my almighty,</i>

354
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,929
so I know he's not
gonna be too concerned...

355
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:46,131
About my not havin' an expensive
funeral and all that.

356
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:51,869
<i>And besides, your Uncle,</i>

357
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:55,272
he'll see to all those things.

358
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:59,943
You never said I had an Uncle
or anything like that before.

359
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:04,013
<i>Well, ya have. And he's</i>
<i>your last livin' relative.</i>

360
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:10,718
He's the one I wrote
and told him all about you.

361
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:14,988
Is he gonna come
and stay with us?

362
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,291
Well, I haven't heard
from him yet, but he'll be here.

363
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:22,627
When I go away, he is the one
that's goin' to take care of you.

364
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,196
What's his name?

365
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,032
Charley Hammond.

366
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,104
I know a horse named Charley.

367
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:41,540
Do ya, now?

368
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:54,885
Gee, I hope your grandpa's
feelin' better.

369
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,987
Yeah, I'm gonna go in
and see him right now.

370
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:58,955
We'll feed major
a little later.

371
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:01,624
Wait here, will ya? All right.

372
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,696
Grandpa, I'm home!

373
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,034
Oh, I'm sorry, grandpa.
I didn't know you were asleep.

374
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,737
Grandpa?

375
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,111
Grandpa?

376
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,157
<i>Remember, son, it's nothin'</i>
<i>to be frightened about.</i>

377
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,693
<i>Just means that</i>
<i>old grandpa's set free...</i>

378
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:46,761
<i>To get around again.</i>

379
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:14,119
What's the matter, Napoleon?
Somethin' wrong?

380
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,157
Did you ever know anyone
that died before?

381
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,825
<i>No. Did...</i>

382
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:28,162
<i>my grandpa just did.</i>

383
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,229
Oh, Napoleon.

384
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:34,832
It's...

385
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:38,702
it's nothing to be
scared or worried about.

386
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,138
Just means that...

387
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:46,674
My grandpa's free to do
what he wants to now.

388
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:51,744
See, that's just
his old body in there.

389
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:56,414
You know, my grandpa
said that...

390
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:00,418
Nobody ever really dies
because...

391
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,187
The thing that's real
inside of you...

392
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:06,689
Goes on and on
forever and ever.

393
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,993
I think that's very beautiful,
Napoleon, but...

394
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:14,395
Who's gonna look after you now?

395
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:18,132
My Uncle. Where's he?

396
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:21,869
In New York. When's he coming?

397
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:24,338
I don't know just yet.

398
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,973
He's supposed to write.

399
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:47,792
What's it say?

400
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:52,462
"Unclaimed mail."

401
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:54,697
Do you know what that is?

402
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,866
I think it means that...

403
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:59,901
Nobody was there
to get the letter.

404
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:01,936
Huh, Napoleon?

405
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:05,472
Was that your only Uncle?

406
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,310
Well, haven't you got
any more relatives? No.

407
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:13,845
Well, then, you have to
live at the orphanage.

408
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,414
That's where they put people
that don't have any relatives.

409
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,884
I won't go. They'll make ya.

410
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,887
No, they won't, 'cause I'm not gonna
tell anybody my grandpa's dead.

411
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:25,155
Well, you can't keep
that a secret.

412
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,057
Yes, I can, and you
better not tell anybody.

413
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,193
But they'll see the funeral.

414
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,396
There's not gonna be
any funeral.

415
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,465
I'm gonna bury my grandpa
up there on our hill,

416
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,968
where we used to sit
and watch the sunset.

417
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,171
That's what he always wanted.
He told me that.

418
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:45,406
Well, who's gonna do it?

419
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:48,242
I'll have to do it myself.

420
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:50,911
He's too big for you to bury.

421
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:54,380
Then I'll have to
hire somebody.

422
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:57,116
Do you know anybody I could use?
No.

423
00:30:57,118 --> 00:31:00,018
You'll have to go see
the employment office.

424
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,087
But you better hurry. They
probably close at 5:00.

425
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:35,384
- How ya doin', general?
- I'm a captain.

426
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:38,887
Well, if you're a captain,
where's your hat?

427
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:41,656
I haven't got it yet.
I just became a captain.

428
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:44,558
- Oh.
- Next, please.

429
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:49,295
Hi. Occupation?

430
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:51,964
Well, I have a degree in political
science, but what I really want...

431
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,232
we have this job
in a lumber camp,

432
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,300
but if you qualify,
it's steady employment.

433
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:58,935
Well, ma'am, I don't want it
to be too steady.

434
00:31:58,937 --> 00:32:02,004
<i>I'm still going to school.</i> Sorry.
That's all we have.

435
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,673
Well, don't you have just...
just a little odd job?

436
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,575
I have to buy a book:

437
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,610
<i>Thompson's theory</i>
<i>of modern organization.</i>

438
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:13,981
We only deal with people who are
interested in regular employment.

439
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:15,983
Closed for now.

440
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:18,018
Right, right.

441
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,588
Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
Appreciate it.

442
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,432
Hello again.

443
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,668
I was wondering if we could
talk a minute. Sure.

444
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,705
What do you want to talk about: Ecology,
the political scene, stock market? No.

445
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:44,341
Hello, Napoleon. <i>Hi, gertrude.</i>

446
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,545
Napoleon, huh?

447
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,980
Yeah. What's your name?

448
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:54,315
Daniel Arlington Williams III,

449
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,317
but you can just call me
Danny, all right? Okay.

450
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,319
What are we gonna talk about?
Well,

451
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:01,121
I wondered if you
wanted to work for me.

452
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:05,158
Well, that all depends. You think
you can afford my services?

453
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,027
I don't know.
How much does that...

454
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:12,531
<i>Thomas's organization...</i>
whatever it is... cost?

455
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:17,002
It's a book.
Costs about, oh, $4.50.

456
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:19,371
I have that much. <i>Did you
come by that honestly?</i>

457
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,140
Yeah, it's mine.
Will you work for me?

458
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:27,376
Okay. What do you
want me to do?

459
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:31,513
It's a secret. You gotta
promise not to tell anybody.

460
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:36,684
I promise. I cross my heart.
I promise.

461
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:42,289
Well,

462
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:46,192
I want you to help me
bury my grandpa.

463
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,557
Now, I'd like you
to tell me again...

464
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,160
Exactly what your grandfather
said about your Uncle and...

465
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,232
What's that?

466
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:34,668
Oh, that's major, my lion.

467
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:38,538
It's time for his milk.

468
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,275
Your lion.

469
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:55,218
Then my grandpa said he didn't want
anything like a fancy funeral.

470
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,386
He just wanted to be buried
up there on our hill,

471
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:01,122
where we used to go
and watch the sunset.

472
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:08,061
I guess a man can have his own private
burying grounds if he wants to.

473
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:10,063
The thing is,
we can't keep it a secret.

474
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:13,766
Just until my Uncle gets here.

475
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:16,368
Else they'll take major
away from me for sure.

476
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:21,506
Yeah, I guess they would.

477
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:29,379
Well, we'll need
some wood and tools.

478
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:32,148
Danny? Yeah?

479
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,217
Be nice if we could be
ready by sunset.

480
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:39,721
Okay.

481
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,533
For everything has a season...

482
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:58,436
And a time for every purpose.

483
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:05,141
A time to be born
and a time to die.

484
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
And as the setting sun...

485
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:15,616
Comes to rest
on this beautiful day,

486
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:21,154
so rests our friend peacefully
in the arms of mother earth.

487
00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:43,307
Now like the sun
that has set...

488
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,676
<i>So it can rise again,</i>

489
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:48,578
<i>so rests our friend, that
he can rise in a new life.</i>

490
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:55,451
<i>We shouldn't feel sorrow...</i>

491
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,519
For the setting sun,

492
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:03,491
nor should we cry
for our lost friend.

493
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,463
I think that's all.

494
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,634
Napoleon, you have anything
you want to say?

495
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,636
Thanks, Danny.

496
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,485
Grandpa,

497
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,488
I love you.

498
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,567
You know something? Hmm?

499
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:58,505
I'm having second thoughts this
morning about the whole thing.

500
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:01,407
What's the matter?

501
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,842
I can't go.

502
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:07,445
I mean, I can't just take off
and leave you here alone.

503
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:10,247
I told you I'll be all right
until my Uncle gets here.

504
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:13,483
That's another thing. This whole
Uncle business sounds pretty iffy.

505
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:16,919
Now, what happens
if he doesn't get here?

506
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,422
You sure there's no place
you can reach him now?

507
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:24,426
Uh-uh. He's...
he's on his way here.

508
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,461
Must be Sam for school.

509
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,863
Come on in, Sam.

510
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,800
Hi, Napoleon. Hi, Danny.

511
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:38,602
Hiya, Sam. How ya
feelin' this morning?

512
00:38:38,604 --> 00:38:41,838
Fine, thanks. Good. Why don't
you sit down and join us?

513
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Napoleon, according
to what you've told me,

514
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:46,676
your Uncle should be here
by the end of the week, right?

515
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,445
Okay, I'll stay here
until then.

516
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,581
Oh, but I'll be all right
on my own.

517
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:56,985
- Why don't you come and stay at my house?
- Can he do that?

518
00:38:56,987 --> 00:39:00,288
Sure he could. There's just me and gertrude.
My folks are away.

519
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,390
Well, that's the answer.

520
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:04,658
I mean, now I can go back
to the cabin without worrying.

521
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,629
I'll bet it's neat up
there in the mountains.

522
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,664
Beautiful.

523
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,266
Hey, do you think maj and me can
come up and stay with you someday?

524
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,401
Of course you can.
You too, Sam. Come up.

525
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:20,872
We'll have a big picnic. You can bring maj.
Got lots of milk for maj.

526
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,412
What's this for?

527
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:31,047
Show us where ya live.

528
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:34,049
Well, I live right...

529
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:38,919
right... there.

530
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,655
That's 14 Miles straight across
the mountains from here.

531
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:44,958
That's two valleys, three ridges, some of
the roughest country you've ever seen.

532
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,361
- That's definitely not the way.
- Bet I could make it.

533
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:50,363
Forget it.
What you have to do is...

534
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:53,866
<i>You take the highway right here</i>
<i>up to pinewood junction.</i>

535
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:57,469
Now a guy named gypsy's
got a service station there.

536
00:39:57,471 --> 00:40:00,972
He lends me his shack. I take
care of his sheep and goats.

537
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:03,741
Anyway, you just ask gypsy, and he'll take
you up the back road in his jeep, all right?

538
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:06,910
- Okay.
- Let's not wait for any social calls.

539
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,612
You know what I mean, Napoleon? If
anything goes wrong... anything...

540
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:11,680
you find gypsy,
and he'll get in touch with me.

541
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,848
Okay, but nothin's
gonna go wrong.

542
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,983
Will you be comin'
back here soon, Danny?

543
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,952
Yeah, I should be back
in a couple of weeks.

544
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,321
When your Uncle arrives, you'll
tell him everything, okay?

545
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:23,489
All right.

546
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,960
Good-bye, Danny.
Good-bye, Danny.

547
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:31,429
See you soon. Bye.

548
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,497
See ya! Bye.

549
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:41,938
Will you, Napoleon?
Will I what?

550
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,006
Come and stay with us.

551
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,910
No, I gotta stay here and take care of maj.
Like right now.

552
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:53,981
I swear,
that grandfather of yours.

553
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,184
He's comin' into
his second childhood.

554
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:02,054
First milk baths,

555
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,156
then stuffin' himself
with candy.

556
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:06,191
No wonder he's feelin' poorly.

557
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:09,994
You tell him I'm comin' down
to see him tonight.

558
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:12,096
Oh, oh, you can't do that.

559
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:14,565
Why can't I do that?

560
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,768
I been comin' to see your grandpa
regular since before you were born.

561
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,103
Well, he...

562
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:26,574
- because he's gonna be out tonight, that's why.
- Then I'll see him tomorrow.

563
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:35,782
Maybe Mr. Gutteridge
won't come tomorrow.

564
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,217
Of course he will.

565
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:41,253
He and my grandpa
were best friends.

566
00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:43,955
What if Danny won't let ya
stay with him?

567
00:41:44,924 --> 00:41:47,491
He will,
when I tell him that...

568
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,525
I don't have an Uncle and all.

569
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,764
I still think you oughta
find gypsy like Danny said.

570
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:59,267
Oh, sure. And take maj
on the bus with me.

571
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:02,003
No, sir.

572
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:06,207
I'm gonna hike right over those
mountains, just like Danny does.

573
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:08,809
Sure wish I could go with ya.

574
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:14,180
See if you can do it.
I can't. I'll be right back.

575
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:40,938
Well, if you're gonna take
doodle-doo with you,

576
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,707
you can't put him
in the knapsack.

577
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:45,775
Of course not, ya nut.

578
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:51,746
He's for you.

579
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:55,182
Oh, Napoleon,
you shouldn't have.

580
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:57,784
I love him.

581
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,887
Would you like me to come and
feed your other chickens?

582
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:04,857
No, I'm gonna turn them loose.

583
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:09,661
Well,

584
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:11,729
I better get home.

585
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:16,099
Good-bye, Napoleon.

586
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:22,071
I really wouldn't mind
goin' with ya.

587
00:43:22,073 --> 00:43:26,742
I mean, if you're
afraid or anything.

588
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:29,578
Afraid? Why would I be afraid?

589
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,047
I mean, I've got maj
with me, haven't I?

590
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,316
Afraid.

591
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:37,584
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:39,087 --> 00:43:41,120
Good-bye, Napoleon.

593
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,952
What are you doin' here?
I'm comin' with ya.

594
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,954
No, you're not.

595
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,623
What about gertrude?
She'll be all right.

596
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,925
What do you mean,
she'll be all right?

597
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:27,362
I left her a note. Said I was gonna stay with
you and your grandpa for a couple of days.

598
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,199
Please, Napoleon.
I want to be with you.

599
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,168
You'll get scared.

600
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,838
No, I won't! Not with you
and maj to protect me.

601
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,906
<i>Well...</i>

602
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:45,177
okay. But you gotta promise
never to cry.

603
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,245
I promise.

604
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,847
Okay. Come on.

605
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:12,090
Napoleon!

606
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,794
<i>Napoleon!</i>

607
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:22,432
- <i> Napoleon, help!</i>
- <i> What? What's wrong?</i>

608
00:46:22,434 --> 00:46:25,268
Napoleon, look!

609
00:46:26,504 --> 00:46:30,939
<i>Oh, no. Go get him, maj!</i>
<i>Go get him!</i>

610
00:46:33,476 --> 00:46:35,776
Go get him, maj!

611
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:42,282
- Get him, maj.
<i>- Come on. Fly, doodle-doo.</i>

612
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:46,952
<i>Go on, get out of here!
Get out of here! Hey!</i>

613
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:48,987
Go on, get!

614
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:16,345
That a boy, maj.
You really showed him.

615
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:22,549
Here, doodle-doo. Here, boy.
Come on. Come on.

616
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:25,785
<i>Come on, boy. There.</i>

617
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:30,456
Good boy. He's okay.

618
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,258
Just a little scared. There.

619
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:40,797
What are ya shakin' for?

620
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,399
I thought it was gonna
get me, Napoleon. I...

621
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:48,003
don't worry. Nothin's gonna get
ya as long as maj is around.

622
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:51,906
Here.

623
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:54,375
I'll give him some of my sandwich.
He loves it.

624
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:16,593
Why won't he come?

625
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:20,897
'Cause he's a cat.

626
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,532
Cats don't like water.

627
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,535
Oh! That's a good boy, major!

628
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,570
Oh, major. Whoa.

629
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,941
Oh, major.

630
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:37,943
Golly.

631
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:41,112
If he doesn't like water,
what does he do when it rains?

632
00:48:41,114 --> 00:48:43,147
Gets wet.

633
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,265
Napoleon.

634
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:08,370
I don't like to complain,
but... my foot hurts.

635
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:11,306
I'm tired. I know.

636
00:49:11,308 --> 00:49:15,543
I was gonna stop for the night as soon as I
could find a good place to build a lean-to.

637
00:49:18,948 --> 00:49:20,981
Hey, wait just a second.

638
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:31,390
Hey!

639
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,262
Hey, you know somethin'? There's
a barn just over the hill.

640
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:39,430
We can spend the night there.

641
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:43,266
We gotta be careful
nobody sees us. Come on.

642
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:48,137
Come on, major. Come on.

643
00:49:59,983 --> 00:50:03,017
There's nobody there.
Come on. Let's go.

644
00:50:28,173 --> 00:50:32,074
It's nice.
I'm glad we found it.

645
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:34,076
Yeah, it's okay for tonight.

646
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:41,616
Here you go, doodle.

647
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:44,952
You'll love it here.

648
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,475
It's not here.
What's not there?

649
00:51:12,477 --> 00:51:14,610
Pinewood junction.

650
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:17,079
I'm looking for
the back road...

651
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:20,182
That leads from gypsy's...

652
00:51:20,184 --> 00:51:22,350
Up to Danny's place.

653
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:25,419
It's just not here.

654
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:28,054
Well, sure you got
the right map?

655
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:30,656
Of course I'm sure.

656
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:33,125
We can't see anything at night.

657
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:35,560
I'll look for it
in the morning.

658
00:51:38,197 --> 00:51:40,597
'Night. 'Night, maj. 'Night.

659
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:55,410
Napoleon, are... are you scared?

660
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,745
No.

661
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,714
Don't you ever get scared?

662
00:52:00,716 --> 00:52:05,151
<i>What's there to be scared about?
</i> Lots of things.

663
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:08,353
<i>Like what?</i> The dark.

664
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,257
Now, the dark
never hurt anybody.

665
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:16,293
Things in the dark.

666
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:18,695
Things like what?

667
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:21,798
Things that jump out
and scare ya.

668
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,768
- That's all in your imagination.
- Still scares me.

669
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:30,704
Now that's kinda dumb.

670
00:52:30,706 --> 00:52:33,573
I mean, my grandpa said that...

671
00:52:33,575 --> 00:52:36,876
People just make things up in
their mind to be scared about.

672
00:52:36,878 --> 00:52:39,144
Now go to sleep.

673
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,398
How do you make it work? It's easy.
All you have to do is squeeze it.

674
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,566
Don't squeeze it too hard,
or she'll kick ya.

675
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,804
Hey, it works.

676
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:30,187
I'm glad we decided to leave him there.
He seems a lot happier.

677
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:34,824
Yeah, doodle always liked
to be with hens. Come on.

678
00:53:57,814 --> 00:54:02,216
<i>It's gettin' awful steep.</i>

679
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:05,652
I told ya: Just don't
look down, and hang on.

680
00:54:12,793 --> 00:54:15,894
Napoleon, look at him.

681
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:20,798
Aw, maj. Now that's no place to lie down.
Now get up.

682
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,568
I feel like I'm gonna slip.
What am I gonna do?

683
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,870
Can't you kinda inch...
inch around him?

684
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:28,872
I can't.

685
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:32,941
<i>Well, climb right over top of him
and put your foot right there.</i>

686
00:54:37,613 --> 00:54:40,246
He's just a little scary,
but don't worry.

687
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:45,751
Give me your hand.
Come on. Now, jump.

688
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,786
Got ya.

689
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:52,756
Okay, there's a...
there's a little spot.

690
00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:55,391
Now stay there.
Stay there. Stay.

691
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:59,528
What are we gonna do
with him, Napoleon?

692
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,331
We gonna have to
get him goin' again.

693
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:12,537
Oh, major.

694
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:21,578
Major! Go, major!

695
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,580
Go!

696
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:26,516
Major, go on! Major!

697
00:55:26,518 --> 00:55:28,851
<i>Napoleon!</i>

698
00:55:28,853 --> 00:55:32,588
I'm okay. I'm okay.

699
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,690
Napoleon.

700
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:36,825
- Oh.
- Napoleon!

701
00:55:36,827 --> 00:55:42,063
Don't get scared.
Just... just let me think.

702
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:47,401
I know.

703
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:50,504
Throw major's rope down to me.
Maybe it'll reach.

704
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:00,879
There. Okay.

705
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:03,648
Pull me up, maj! Pull me up!

706
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,883
Here, major. Here, major!

707
00:56:05,885 --> 00:56:09,853
Come on, major. Good boy.
Come on, major. Pull.

708
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:11,788
That's it, maj.
That's it. Pull!

709
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,090
<i>Pull! Come on, major.</i>

710
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:17,560
Pull! Pull me up!

711
00:56:17,562 --> 00:56:21,430
Okay. Made it.

712
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:24,332
Thanks, major. Thanks a lot.

713
00:56:24,334 --> 00:56:26,701
I-I didn't think anything
was gonna happen to her.

714
00:56:26,703 --> 00:56:29,970
I thought she was spending the night
with a boy and his grandfather.

715
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:32,038
That's what she wrote
in the note.

716
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,875
You read it yourself. Yes, ma'am. Did
she spend most of her time here?

717
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:38,777
With Napoleon, yeah.
Yeah. Now you say...

718
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:41,880
The last time you saw the boy, he was
walkin' down the street with a strange man?

719
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:43,882
Kind of a hippie type, you say?

720
00:56:43,884 --> 00:56:45,884
That's right.

721
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:48,586
Now he's the one you should
be checking on right now!

722
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,653
Excuse me, uh, chief.

723
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,357
Oh.

724
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:10,738
It's too bad you
don't like water.

725
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,540
It makes your feet
feel real nice.

726
00:57:35,395 --> 00:57:37,161
Sam!

727
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,663
<i>A bear!</i>

728
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:44,134
Sam! Sam!

729
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:46,870
<i>Get out of here!</i>

730
00:57:46,872 --> 00:57:50,106
<i>Sam! Sam!</i>

731
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:54,810
- It's a bear, maj!
- Come on, major, it's a bear!

732
00:57:54,812 --> 00:57:57,779
Come on.

733
00:57:57,781 --> 00:58:00,448
<i>- Napoleon, he won't budge!</i>
<i>- Sam!</i>

734
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,084
Get up! Major!

735
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:06,419
Come on.

736
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,187
Major, get up! It's a bear!

737
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:10,822
Don't just stand there
drinkin' your milk!

738
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,824
Get up, major! Move!

739
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,726
<i>It's a bear!</i>

740
00:58:15,728 --> 00:58:18,962
<i>Major!</i>

741
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:25,667
Go get him! Good! Good! Go get him!
Good! Go get him!

742
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,537
Come on.

743
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:39,810
Get him, major! Go away, bear!

744
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:55,023
Major, go get him!

745
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:01,195
Sock it to him! Come on!

746
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:06,866
Oh!

747
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:27,750
Good boy. Good boy, major.

748
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:30,853
Oh, major, you saved us.

749
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:34,089
He sure beat up that old bear.

750
00:59:35,058 --> 00:59:37,525
Aw, he's so strong.

751
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:40,961
That's why they call him
king of beasts. Yeah!

752
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,069
Napoleon, wait.

753
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:01,877
Just try and imagine
somethin' nice in your mind.

754
01:00:01,879 --> 01:00:04,713
It'll stop you thinkin'
about being tired.

755
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:07,515
All I can think about
is sittin' down.

756
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:11,552
I'll bet we'll be able to see Danny's
cabin from the top of this hill.

757
01:00:14,723 --> 01:00:17,190
Chocolate cake with...

758
01:00:17,192 --> 01:00:20,660
Strawberry ice cream...

759
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:25,730
And marshmallows with whipped
cream and... cherries.

760
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,168
Cake, apple pie.

761
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,236
Chocolate syrup.

762
01:01:03,597 --> 01:01:05,630
There's nothing.

763
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:14,636
Hey, now you promised
you wouldn't do that.

764
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:17,739
<i>I know, but...</i>

765
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,807
My feet hurt,

766
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:23,177
and I wish my mom and dad
were here, and...

767
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,679
Napoleon, do you think
we're gonna die?

768
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:28,415
Die? Of course not.

769
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:35,121
I know exactly
where we are... almost.

770
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:44,363
Okay. See those
mountains over there?

771
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:48,066
Well, those are these here.

772
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:52,970
We oughta be
right about... here.

773
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,873
But...

774
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,909
They have a lake right here.

775
01:02:01,379 --> 01:02:04,813
I don't see a lake
around here? Do you?

776
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:08,983
Napoleon, we're lost.
Now what are we gonna do?

777
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:14,788
Well, maybe we are
a little lost right now.

778
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,890
<i>But you know,</i>

779
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,095
we could just stay here for weeks
and weeks and live off the land.

780
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:26,398
<i>Just like the Indians.</i>
Could we do that?

781
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,000
Sure.

782
01:02:29,002 --> 01:02:32,269
You're so good at everything.
I mean it.

783
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,337
I really admire you.

784
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:39,909
I'm sorry I was crying.

785
01:02:39,911 --> 01:02:44,746
That's okay. Girls can't
help it all the time.

786
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:46,781
Now you just stay here
and rest.

787
01:02:48,084 --> 01:02:50,451
I'm gonna go on a hunting trip.

788
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:53,086
Hey, you can't
leave me here alone.

789
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:55,088
Well, maj is with ya.

790
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:58,123
Well, you'll be right
back, won't ya? Sure.

791
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,293
I'll bring back some food too.

792
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:08,491
Got him!

793
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:12,561
Oh! Got him. Ah.

794
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,831
Shoot.

795
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,037
Hmm? Just me.

796
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:27,974
Did you get anything?

797
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:30,042
Yeah. What'd you get?

798
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:37,882
Eeew. What is it?

799
01:04:37,884 --> 01:04:41,252
Snails. I found them under
a rock next to the river.

800
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:43,254
You eat 'em? Sure.

801
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:46,190
<i>People eat 'em all the time.</i>
<i>They're really special.</i>

802
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:49,393
They look horrible.
Let me see you eat one.

803
01:04:49,395 --> 01:04:53,930
No, I've already had mine.
I'm not hungry anymore.

804
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:57,033
I would have rather
have had fish.

805
01:04:57,035 --> 01:05:00,036
Oh, well, I caught one,

806
01:05:00,038 --> 01:05:02,471
but I decided to let it go.

807
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:07,375
But these are better
for you anyway.

808
01:05:07,377 --> 01:05:10,010
Well... no, that's okay.

809
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:14,613
I... I guess I'm not
very hungry anymore either.

810
01:05:14,615 --> 01:05:17,482
Did you see anything? No.

811
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,984
I'm gonna go on a
scouting trip right now.

812
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:22,186
I'm gonna find out
where we are.

813
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:26,156
Napoleon. Don't worry.
Maj is here with ya.

814
01:05:26,158 --> 01:05:28,191
I'm just gonna go over
to the next Ridge.

815
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:31,961
I'll bet that's where Danny's
place is, okay? Okay.

816
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:33,996
Good.

817
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,425
Major! Now you sit down!
Do you hear me?

818
01:06:06,427 --> 01:06:09,227
<i>Major, where are you going?</i>

819
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:13,130
Come back here. Napoleon!

820
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:15,165
Major!

821
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:22,138
What's gotten into you anyway?
You wanna get us more lost?

822
01:06:29,979 --> 01:06:32,245
Napoleon!

823
01:06:32,247 --> 01:06:34,313
Napoleon!

824
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:37,716
Danny!

825
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:40,285
<i>Danny!</i>

826
01:06:45,524 --> 01:06:48,291
Danny!

827
01:06:48,293 --> 01:06:50,393
<i>It's me, Napoleon!</i>

828
01:06:50,395 --> 01:06:52,695
Hey! Hey, Napoleon! Hey!

829
01:06:52,697 --> 01:06:55,396
We're coming to visit you!
Danny!

830
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:01,734
Danny! Danny, we found you!

831
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:08,607
Danny, I'm so glad we found ya.

832
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,742
You crazy kids.
How'd you get here?

833
01:07:10,744 --> 01:07:15,113
- Over the mountains.
- Over the mount...

834
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,116
do you know how lucky you are? I
could've been 100 Miles from here.

835
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:21,152
Well, we were attacked by a bear and
a Mountain lion, and we got lost.

836
01:07:21,154 --> 01:07:23,287
Now wait a minute.
What happened?

837
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,422
What about your Uncle
and your parents?

838
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,494
Danny,

839
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:34,463
could we have something to eat?

840
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:36,465
And some milk for maj?
Sure. Okay.

841
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:39,501
But I wanna hear the
whole story, all right?

842
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:47,640
You should have told me
the truth about your Uncle.

843
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:52,711
You mean you have no idea
where he is now?

844
01:07:54,614 --> 01:07:57,147
Well, why can't I come up
and live with you, Danny?

845
01:07:57,149 --> 01:08:00,617
Because it's not that simple.
For one thing, Samantha's here.

846
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:03,686
Gertrude's probably got in touch with your family by now.
Can you imagine how they feel?

847
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:07,656
I only wanted to help Napoleon get here.
I was gonna go home after that.

848
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:11,660
Right, right. But in the
meantime, they're worried sick.

849
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:16,064
<i>It's all right to do your own thing, but when
somebody gets hurt, that's something else.</i>

850
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:18,800
Well, I'm not gonna live
in town anymore.

851
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:21,736
<i>And if you don't want me,</i>

852
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:25,673
me and maj'll just go live up with
the Indians like my grandpa did.

853
01:08:25,675 --> 01:08:29,143
Napoleon, it's not a game.

854
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:31,445
Now, I'd like ya here.
It's just not possible.

855
01:08:31,447 --> 01:08:36,249
I really don't wanna go back
to any dumb old orphanage.

856
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:40,720
- Orphanage?
- Yeah, he's scared of orphanages.

857
01:08:44,258 --> 01:08:47,626
Orphanage is like...

858
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:51,062
it's a dirty word you read in storybooks.
They're not like that.

859
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:54,598
<i>Look, there's a lot of kids like you, all right?
And that's too bad.</i>

860
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,200
<i>But there's also</i>
<i>good, kind people...</i>

861
01:08:57,202 --> 01:09:00,336
Who gather you together and
make a family and a nice home.

862
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:04,740
A place where everybody has
friends, and you play games.

863
01:09:04,742 --> 01:09:08,677
<i>And you get an education.
</i> School?

864
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:11,513
Look, don't knock it. Without
education, you're nothing.

865
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:14,782
<i>You get an education,</i>
<i>you can do anything you want.</i>

866
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,584
And the thing you should want to
do most right now is be useful.

867
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:24,323
- You know what I mean by being useful?
- I think so.

868
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:26,825
Danny, are you useful?

869
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:33,832
Well, um... no, I wouldn't say
I'm useful, not right now, but...

870
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:38,302
well, I do other things around
here besides tend goats, you know?

871
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:42,272
I, uh, I think,

872
01:09:42,274 --> 01:09:45,341
study and... I'll get
my master's degree soon.

873
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,310
What's that? <i>Never mind.</i>

874
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:51,479
The point is that if I can still
go to school, so can Napoleon.

875
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:55,649
And then later on, you can be with the Indians,
a sea captain, a cowboy, anything you want.

876
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:58,485
But what about maj?

877
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:02,855
Major can stay here with me, and you can
come up and visit him when you want.

878
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:05,457
<i>All right?</i>

879
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:07,559
Well, I don't know, Danny.

880
01:10:07,561 --> 01:10:09,594
<i>Napoleon.</i>

881
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:16,199
Can I think about it?

882
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:20,702
Yeah. Sure. You think about it.

883
01:10:20,704 --> 01:10:23,638
Danny, what about me?

884
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,673
You.

885
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:29,243
Right after supper,

886
01:10:29,245 --> 01:10:31,378
I'll head into town, and
catch a nap on the way.

887
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,280
In the morning
I'll talk to gertrude,

888
01:10:34,282 --> 01:10:36,282
and we'll get the whole thing
straightened out, all right?

889
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:40,586
- Are we going with ya?
<i>- No, sir. No way.</i>

890
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:45,157
<i>I think once across</i>
<i>the mountains is enough.</i>

891
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:48,226
<i>- Besides, I got a baby-sitter for ya.
- A baby-sitter!</i>

892
01:10:48,228 --> 01:10:51,162
<i>Yeah. His name's mark.</i>

893
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,764
<i>Came out of nowhere a few
days ago, just like you.</i>

894
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:56,567
<i>Well, where is he?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

895
01:10:56,568 --> 01:10:59,369
<i>He's probably in the woods. He spends a lot
of time there. I think you'll like him.</i>

896
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:02,271
<i>He's kinda quiet.</i>

897
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:06,574
There is...

898
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:09,176
Mark, you look like
you just saw a lion.

899
01:11:09,178 --> 01:11:11,378
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

900
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,848
He's as tame as a pussycat. Belongs
to the two kids. He's really tame.

901
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:18,918
His name's major.
Come here, major!

902
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,921
<i>I'll introduce you to him.</i>

903
01:11:21,923 --> 01:11:25,624
<i>Here, major!</i>

904
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:30,195
Hi, mark.

905
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:15,805
Yes, what? Good morning.
My name is Danny...

906
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,674
<i>hey!</i>

907
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:20,676
<i>Lady, if you're gertrude,</i>
<i>I have to talk to you.</i>

908
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:23,378
J-just a minute.
I'm alone in the house.

909
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,247
I-I have to put on a robe.

910
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:28,983
Uh, you stay right there. <i>Okay.</i>

911
01:12:35,858 --> 01:12:37,891
Hello, police?

912
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,633
Lady?

913
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:53,336
<i>It's important.</i>
<i>It's about Samantha.</i>

914
01:12:56,841 --> 01:12:58,874
Gertrude, she's all right.

915
01:12:58,876 --> 01:13:02,544
<i>Can you hear me? She's okay.</i>
<i>I came by to tell you that.</i>

916
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,812
Hello?

917
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,830
All right, mister,
take it easy.

918
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:25,798
What's goin' on? Come on.
Up against the door.

919
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,833
What? You're under arrest.

920
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:30,969
What'd I do?

921
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:33,755
"You have the right
to remain silent.

922
01:13:33,756 --> 01:13:36,540
<i>"If you give up the right to remain silent,
anything you say can and will be used...</i>

923
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:38,943
<i>"Against you in a court of law.
</i> Fellas, you got the wrong guy.

924
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:42,513
You have the right to speak to an attorney and to
have attorney present during all questioning."

925
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:44,748
Now wait a minute. Okay.
Come on. Let's go.

926
01:13:50,054 --> 01:13:53,455
That's him!
He's the one, all right!

927
01:13:53,457 --> 01:13:57,025
What did you do with them?
Where are those poor children?

928
01:13:57,027 --> 01:13:59,160
I've been trying to tell you,
they're okay.

929
01:13:59,162 --> 01:14:02,730
They're up in my cabin. If you
let me explain and listen to me.

930
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:04,665
The chief'll do all
the listening and the talking.

931
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:08,635
You just take it easy and don't
cause any trouble, okay?

932
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:11,204
<i>Gertrude! Is he the one?</i>

933
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:13,039
He certainly is!

934
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:21,079
And if he's harmed
one hair on her head, I'll...

935
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,081
iva, will you drive me
to the police station?

936
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,083
Indeed I will.
Let me get the car.

937
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,718
Okay, give me five minutes.

938
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:35,791
That all you got? That's all.

939
01:14:35,793 --> 01:14:38,894
The chief'll be here in a few minutes.
His wife said he was on his way.

940
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:40,996
All right, Pete,
get him printed.

941
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:43,131
Come on, this way.

942
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:45,199
See if there's a make on him.

943
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:52,606
Right hand first.

944
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,983
Are the kids all right?

945
01:15:05,786 --> 01:15:08,253
<i>Where'd they catch him?</i>

946
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:11,155
<i>Come on, gertrude. You step
right up and tell them!</i>

947
01:15:11,157 --> 01:15:14,258
Well, did you get it
out of him?

948
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,693
Where are they?

949
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:19,495
<i>All right, quiet down,</i>
<i>everybody.</i>

950
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:21,630
I wanna know where Samantha is!

951
01:15:21,632 --> 01:15:23,865
Lady. Gertrude.

952
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:27,235
<i>Gertrude, I keep telling
everybody, but nobody's listening.</i>

953
01:15:27,237 --> 01:15:29,270
The kids are up at my cabin.
They're fine.

954
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,740
I don't know what all
this hassle's all about.

955
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,775
Look, fella,
two kids have disappeared.

956
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:36,777
An old man lies dead and buried
in his own backyard.

957
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:38,779
And you were there, right?
Right.

958
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:41,248
So you got a lot of questions
to answer, so take it easy.

959
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,250
All right. Come on, Pete.
Stay out of it.

960
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,186
Let the chief handle it. Come on, everybody.
Let's move it.

961
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:50,190
I'm not going anywhere until I know
Samantha's safe. And neither am I!

962
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:58,763
All right, you. Come on.
Sit down over here.

963
01:15:58,765 --> 01:16:01,198
You know, you guys
are really beautiful.

964
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,168
All you have to do is send somebody up to the cabin.
This whole mess'd be over.

965
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,236
Look, fella, if everything is as cool
as you say it is, there's no hurry.

966
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:09,271
So let's just wait till
the chief gets here, okay?

967
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,954
All right, all right. We'll do
everything by the book. That's right.

968
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:43,902
Hey, fella. Sit down. Wait a minute.
Look at this.

969
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:46,771
This guy, this psycho, he's up there with the kids.
Will you listen to me?

970
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,773
He's dangerous. It says it right here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,709
What are you trying to pull? I'm telling
you the truth. We gotta get up there!

972
01:16:51,711 --> 01:16:53,977
- <i> Will you let go of me and listen?</i>
- Fella, take it easy!

973
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:57,046
Just wait till the chief gets
back, and we'll be all right.

974
01:16:57,048 --> 01:16:59,048
Hey!

975
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,921
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!

976
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:09,957
Out of my way! Hey, watch it!

977
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,699
There he goes. I got him.

978
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,170
Get back inside.
Put out an a.P.B.

979
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,272
Take your car
and cover the other side.

980
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,856
Hey, buddy!

981
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,193
<i>He's got my cycle.</i>

982
01:19:06,195 --> 01:19:08,228
<i>Hey, slow down, buddy!</i>

983
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:10,930
- <i> What are you doing? Get out of here!</i>
- Whoa!

984
01:19:10,932 --> 01:19:13,399
<i>You harebrained punk! Look out!</i>

985
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:17,235
<i>Oh, get out of here!</i>

986
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:51,331
Car two, repeat.
I don't read you.

987
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:53,900
He's on a cycle. He's
headed north on number 27.

988
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:56,335
Should we, uh, set a roadblock?
Over.

989
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:58,737
Uh, check and advise.

990
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:02,107
All right, see what you can find out about him.
Is that Pete? Yes, sir.

991
01:20:02,109 --> 01:20:04,943
Car two, whatever you do,
don't take your eyes off him.

992
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:07,312
We'll set up a roadblock
at Dawson's Ridge. Roger.

993
01:20:07,314 --> 01:20:09,447
Put Adams and susskind on it too.
Right.

994
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:11,916
This could turn out
to be a big deal.

995
01:20:11,918 --> 01:20:14,351
If we lose sight of him now, he could
take off anywhere up there in the brush.

996
01:20:14,353 --> 01:20:17,153
Do you want me to call
the state patrol? <i>Yeah.</i>

997
01:20:17,155 --> 01:20:20,789
And, uh, chief Thomas
at carsonville.

998
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:23,858
Let's get everybody on it. Notify the airport.
Get a copter ready for me.

999
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,860
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Okay.

1000
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:28,996
<i>H.C.G. 440, this is 22. Request copter.
Stand by.</i>

1001
01:20:56,789 --> 01:20:59,055
Slow down! Slow down! Hey!

1002
01:20:59,057 --> 01:21:01,991
<i>Hey, fella!</i>

1003
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:07,395
<i>Hey, what do you think</i>
<i>this is, a racetrack?</i>

1004
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,966
Nut!

1005
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:24,010
Get that dozer out of the way!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1006
01:22:25,003 --> 01:22:27,269
There he goes.

1007
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:37,978
Look out!

1008
01:22:41,383 --> 01:22:43,516
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1009
01:22:43,518 --> 01:22:47,586
<i>I don't know. Why don't you</i>
<i>guys learn to drive that thing?</i>

1010
01:22:55,194 --> 01:22:57,561
<i>A jeep. Let's take it.</i>

1011
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:08,271
<i>Hey, where you going</i>
<i>with my jeep?</i>

1012
01:23:08,273 --> 01:23:10,306
Don't worry about it.

1013
01:23:33,497 --> 01:23:36,364
Easy. Easy. Take it away.

1014
01:23:36,366 --> 01:23:38,933
Oh! Hey, you! Hey, you!

1015
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:41,001
<i>Come back here!</i>

1016
01:23:47,207 --> 01:23:50,674
Go ahead. Go ahead. Look out!

1017
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:06,720
Go get him, boys.
Right through here.

1018
01:24:22,737 --> 01:24:25,003
Up there!

1019
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,626
Okay, we've got you. Go ahead.

1020
01:25:26,628 --> 01:25:29,528
Chief, Mike. Yeah?

1021
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,663
About the escaped psycho,
he's a Lulu.

1022
01:25:31,665 --> 01:25:34,599
Just give it to me straight!
Yes, sir.

1023
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,634
He escaped ten days ago.

1024
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:40,471
He used to live in carsonville, so he
could be in our area. Over and out.

1025
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:44,107
How do you like that? The
guy was tellin' the truth.

1026
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:47,810
He sure was. Hey, look!

1027
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:55,683
He didn't want us to nail him
till he got us up here.

1028
01:25:55,685 --> 01:26:00,087
Take her down quick. Close
to the cabin. Right.

1029
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:38,790
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1030
01:26:40,326 --> 01:26:43,327
<i>Hi, Danny.</i>

1031
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:45,362
Hi, Dan.
What's all the noise about?

1032
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:47,430
Sounds like a helicopter
or something.

1033
01:26:47,432 --> 01:26:49,732
<i>Where did mark go?</i>

1034
01:26:49,734 --> 01:26:53,736
You kids all right? <i>Sure.</i>

1035
01:26:53,738 --> 01:26:55,738
Hey, it was a helicopter,
wasn't it?

1036
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,740
Yeah.

1037
01:26:57,742 --> 01:26:59,875
What's been going on here?
Just a game.

1038
01:26:59,877 --> 01:27:03,712
Then all the noise and mark ran out
like he was scared or something.

1039
01:27:03,714 --> 01:27:06,981
We were his prisoners,
and he was a wicked giant.

1040
01:27:06,983 --> 01:27:10,584
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1041
01:27:10,586 --> 01:27:13,453
Nothing's wrong, is it, Danny?
Everything's gonna be all right.

1042
01:27:13,455 --> 01:27:15,455
Sam, look. It's the police.

1043
01:27:15,457 --> 01:27:18,257
<i>What are they doing with mark?</i>

1044
01:27:18,259 --> 01:27:20,425
Are they taking him to jail?

1045
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:22,460
No, they're just taking him
to a hospital.

1046
01:27:22,462 --> 01:27:24,895
A hospital? Yes.

1047
01:27:24,897 --> 01:27:27,364
You see, mark's been sick.

1048
01:27:27,366 --> 01:27:30,266
The hospital thinks it's better
if he came back with them.

1049
01:27:31,602 --> 01:27:35,604
Gosh! He sure
didn't look sick to me.

1050
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:42,710
You know, he was the best
giant I ever played with.

1051
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:44,778
<i>Good-bye, mark!</i>

1052
01:27:47,716 --> 01:27:52,251
You mean, we get to ride back in a helicopter?
That's what I said.

1053
01:27:52,253 --> 01:27:55,420
But the lion'll have to stay up here
with you, for this trip anyway.

1054
01:27:55,422 --> 01:27:57,955
No. No more. Thank you.
You sure?

1055
01:27:57,957 --> 01:27:59,990
We got through
to Samantha's parents.

1056
01:27:59,992 --> 01:28:02,325
They'll be at the airport. Good.

1057
01:28:02,327 --> 01:28:05,294
They're home! Napoleon!

1058
01:28:05,296 --> 01:28:07,362
Next time you're in town,
stop by my office.

1059
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:10,031
I'll serve the coffee. Okay.

1060
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:13,000
Danny! Napoleon,
he's run away again!

1061
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:15,268
What?

1062
01:28:17,472 --> 01:28:20,773
See. There he goes.

1063
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:23,375
<i>Let me see.</i>
<i>Maybe I can handle it.</i>

1064
01:28:23,377 --> 01:28:26,411
Okay.

1065
01:28:42,462 --> 01:28:44,528
Napoleon!

1066
01:28:48,733 --> 01:28:50,766
Where ya goin'?

1067
01:28:50,768 --> 01:28:52,868
I thought we had a deal.

1068
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:58,873
No. I just said
I'd think it over, Danny.

1069
01:29:03,745 --> 01:29:06,378
I decided...

1070
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,747
I better go live
with the Indians...

1071
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:11,082
On account of major and all.

1072
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:16,920
There aren't
any Indians around here.

1073
01:29:16,922 --> 01:29:19,088
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1074
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,657
Yes, there are. I'll show ya.

1075
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,726
Just over this Mountain.

1076
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:43,744
<i>Boy, it's a big world, huh?</i>

1077
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:48,581
Nobody can make it alone.

1078
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:51,617
We all need people to help us.

1079
01:29:57,491 --> 01:29:59,757
Mark needs people
to help him, and they will.

1080
01:30:02,728 --> 01:30:06,362
<i>You'll need people to help you.</i>

1081
01:30:07,765 --> 01:30:09,798
Trust them, Napoleon.

1082
01:30:14,771 --> 01:30:17,104
Trust me.

1083
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:25,077
Danny.

1084
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:34,684
Well, about the Indians...

1085
01:30:34,686 --> 01:30:37,519
<i>well...</i>

1086
01:30:40,957 --> 01:30:43,023
I meant over the next Mountain.

1087
01:30:48,129 --> 01:30:51,864
Come on. Hurry up, maj!
