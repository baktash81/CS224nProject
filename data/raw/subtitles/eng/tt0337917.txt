1
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,365
Oh, no.

2
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:31,758
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, Madeline. What are you doing?

3
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,597
Homework.

4
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:40,603
Over spring break? You're not climbing,
are you? I don't want you to be climbing.

5
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:43,231
No, Mom. I'm not climbing.

6
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:47,075
- They've been waiting for you.
- Just one second.

7
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:49,943
I'm gonna be late, so I'm gonna need you to...

8
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,107
Pick up Max from day care. Surprise.

9
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:56,483
It's not gonna be forever.
It's just until I finish this project.

10
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,648
- All right. I'll be right down.
- Down?

11
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:02,488
- Over. You know what I mean.
- OK.

12
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:05,722
I'll see you a little later. I love you.

13
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:15,338
Good afternoon, Mrs Phillips.
Nice of you to join us.

14
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,175
Are you aware that your company's deadline
for getting my bank online was 23 hours ago?

15
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:27,846
Mr Brisbane, I did inform you that
due to the age of the building...

16
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:32,822
The primary shareholders will be here
for the opening of the bank next Friday night.

17
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:37,190
As I have said, the system will not
have been tested and I cannot...

18
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,787
That party will take place
with or without your consent.

19
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,266
- This is a complex...
- Hartmann.

20
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:48,534
Don't tell me how to run my bank, all right?
You work for me, remember?

21
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:53,437
Now, when I turn around,
both of you will be gone.

22
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,226
And the race is under way.

23
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,512
Number 11, Bad Chad, into the pits.

24
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:43,187
As they go into turn number one.

25
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:02,876
Hey, retard. I'm losing the race
cos you don't know what you're doing.

26
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:07,351
I can't believe Mom made me hire you
as my lead mechanic. Damn!

27
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,512
Done!

28
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,959
You better pray this works.

29
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:28,765
Looks like number 11, Bad Chad,
is finally out of the pits.

30
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,743
Come on, man. Come on, come on.

31
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:42,048
Chris "The Crusher" pulling tight.
Bad Chad back into the pack.

32
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:50,488
Looks like that front axle may have gone out.
Number 11, Bad Chad, is out of the race.

33
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:55,430
- Good job, dorkus!
- You stupid...

34
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,899
Gus!

35
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:20,247
There she is. My leading lady. My star.

36
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:24,955
Sound, speed and... action!

37
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,843
Maddy!

38
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,314
Maddy!

39
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,156
Hey! Fartknocker!

40
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,323
I'm gonna kill you.

41
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,361
Stop it.

42
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,573
Cut it out. Cut it out!

43
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,133
Not so tight! Let go.

44
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:18,843
- Hi.
- Come on. Pick on someone your own size.

45
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,578
Climber girl.

46
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,413
Go contaminate someone else.

47
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:30,153
Look, here comes Captain Cool.
Loser number three.

48
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,858
I'm having a barbecue at my house
if you guys wanna come.

49
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:36,400
- Definitely.
- Hey.

50
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:40,562
I don't if you heard but Bad Chad picked up
a shift at your momma's bank.

51
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:43,232
I'll be with Lieutenant Ferrell in security.

52
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:46,242
One step closer to being a cop.

53
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:51,439
Don't worry, Ferrell won't let Bad Chad
carry a weapon. He's an intern.

54
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:54,040
Trainee! Buttmunch.

55
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,952
Sorry. He's training to be a buttmunch.

56
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:07,858
So immature. Isn't he?

57
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:12,267
OK, folks.
Race number three will start in five minutes.

58
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,741
So let's get ready to step on the gas
and let's kick some butt. It's race time.

59
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,408
Butt?

60
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,542
But what? Hey, kiddo. What's up?

61
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,816
Mom needs me to pick up
Max from day care. Again.

62
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,824
- Won't be forever, sweetie.
- Now you sound like Mom.

63
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,985
And that's so terrible?

64
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:44,060
You OK?

65
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:48,094
Is this a new style that the kids are sporting?

66
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,940
- Dad, don't freak out.
- When do I ever freak out?

67
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:58,950
It's just that there are a thousand other sports
that don't involve falling 100ft to your death.

68
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:02,248
You said standing on Everest
was the best day of your life.

69
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,814
No. No, I said it was one of
the best days of my life.

70
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:10,156
Look. See, I even wore the hat you gave me.

71
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,992
I don't understand what the problem is
with me trying to be like you.

72
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:20,037
Do we have to discuss this every day?

73
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:22,106
Just till I turn 18.

74
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:32,205
OK, race fans.
Here we are. The last race of the day.

75
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,182
Drivers, get in position.

76
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,951
Mr P, can I ask you a very serious question?

77
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,889
Only if you want a very serious answer.

78
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:44,189
Do ladies like guys
who build stuff with their hands?

79
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:48,061
Or do they go for the nerds
who play computer games and stuff?

80
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:55,063
What he means is, do women prefer a low-IQ
Ã¼ber-male who only know about spark plugs,

81
00:09:55,173 --> 00:10:01,737
or do they prefer a true artist
who has both sensitivity and a brain?

82
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:06,874
That's a very difficult question, boys,
but I'm afraid I'm not the one to ask.

83
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,215
- Hey, Madeline Rose.
- No, no.

84
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,550
Dad, don't call me that.

85
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:18,056
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

86
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,435
It's an old climber's trick.

87
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:31,507
You'll have a scar.
Why do you get all the cool stuff?

88
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:36,411
It's true. Women love scars.
This drives Maddy's mom crazy. Check it out.

89
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:38,744
- That's gross.
- You can touch it.

90
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,411
- Is this when you fell?
- Yeah. 100ft free fall.

91
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,545
OK. OK. OK.

92
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,386
Stop touching. Bad touch. OK.

93
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,935
- Hey, stranger.
- Not you too.

94
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:06,068
- Now, this is a nutritious dinner.
- Please, don't give me a hard time.

95
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:11,437
We just miss you. Especially Maddy.

96
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:17,748
And I don't wanna have to set my alarm
for the middle of the night

97
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:21,485
just so I can have a date with my wife.

98
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,718
Would you like to go dancing?

99
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,829
I have to go back to work. I can't...

100
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,500
You have to do this first. OK?

101
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:46,983
Quit messing around.
I can't hold you up. I can't...

102
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,610
Tom? What's going on?

103
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:52,019
I can't feel my legs.

104
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:54,853
Where does it hurt? Tom?

105
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,417
Can you hear me? Tom?

106
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,987
Tom?

107
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:07,262
The injury probably occurred
during his accident.

108
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:13,004
There must be something that you can do.
Isn't there any kind of emergency surgery?

109
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:19,448
Not here. A private medical facility in
Denmark has done testing on this injury.

110
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,008
OK. Let's go, then.

111
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,647
It's experimental,
and even though it's been successful...

112
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:29,386
- We'll try anything.
- Your insurance won't cover it.

113
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:32,321
- How much?
- What?

114
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:35,662
How much does the surgery cost?
We'll pay for it.

115
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,531
$250,000.

116
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:45,906
We'll pay it, Mom.
Mom, tell her we'll pay it.

117
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,970
Mom... we can pay it.

118
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,041
Mom, tell her we'll pay it. Please.

119
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,013
$250,000?

120
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,254
What happens if your dad
doesn't get the operation?

121
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,594
We'll go door to door. Everyone
loves your dad. They'll give us money.

122
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:20,008
- I could sell my camera.
- It's $250,000. You know how much that is?

123
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,672
I have a coin collection.

124
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,442
They're rare.

125
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,587
What if I borrow half?

126
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,390
And then I can make...

127
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:42,689
No, it doesn't exceed that.

128
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,226
Personal collateral?

129
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,632
We own a go-kart track.

130
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,610
Let's cut to the chase, shall we, Mrs Phillips?

131
00:13:56,714 --> 00:14:01,083
You're not qualified
for a personal loan of this size.

132
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:04,280
I understand, but my husband is sick
and I was hoping...

133
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,722
Yes. Yes, I am aware of that, Mrs Phillips.

134
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,827
Doesn't it mean anything
that I work for the bank?

135
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,259
But you're freelance, aren't you?

136
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,127
From a security company.

137
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:26,302
A company, which, under your guidance,
has been unable to provide my bank

138
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:33,112
with a fully operational security system
in the allotted time stated in the contract.

139
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,758
Don't you have a heart?

140
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,792
This is not an emotional issue, Mrs Phillips.

141
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,668
A bank has no heart.

142
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,875
Only paper in a vault.

143
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:09,644
It's strange not being able to move.

144
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,123
I've been staring at the same spot
on the ceiling for the past three hours.

145
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:17,889
Mom can't come up with the money, Dad.

146
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:20,896
I escaped death on that climb, Maddy.

147
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,994
20ft from the summit my gear stuck.

148
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,836
There was this perfect crack
all the way up to the top.

149
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,842
- You free climbed it?
- It was so easy.

150
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,572
I lost concentration and I fell.

151
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,175
But somebody or something was looking
out for me so I could go home, see you,

152
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:44,244
get to know what a great girl you are.

153
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:51,558
In a way that fall was the best thing
that could have happened to me.

154
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,994
You know I'd do anything for you.

155
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:56,932
Dad, we'll come up with the money.
I promise.

156
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:02,763
...200ft-high steel chamber
which houses the Lion Safe.

157
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:07,538
The system provides the best of new
technology and tried and true security,

158
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:11,412
making Harderbach Financial
the most secure a bank can be.

159
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:17,216
The entire system is run on a generator,
making power loss a virtual impossibility,

160
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:21,691
meaning the system would remain safe
even in the event of a city-wide blackout.

161
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,886
The project began in the fall of 2000,

162
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:29,263
and is the most advanced security install
to date for any bank in North America.

163
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:34,862
The halls are lined with hundreds
of motion-sensitive cameras.

164
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,134
Until the system has been fully tested,

165
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:40,904
the halls will be patrolled
after hours by attack dogs.

166
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:43,071
This all leads to the Lion Safe.

167
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:46,139
The safe is suspended
nearly 100ft off the ground

168
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,653
and is equipped to hold over $25 million
in cash and gold bullion.

169
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:55,488
Safety deposit boxes line the walls of this
chamber. Slated to be finished in April...

170
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,460
Are you crazy? We can't rob a bank.

171
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,993
- We'll pay them back.
- How?

172
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,431
I don't know. I'll work. I'll do anything.

173
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:07,232
You understand what happens
if we get caught?

174
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:10,832
We go to jail forever. Until we're 21.

175
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,342
No one will ever suspect us.

176
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:16,470
Adults treat us like
we're five years old anyway.

177
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:20,807
Tomorrow I'll go to work with my mom
and check out the bank.

178
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:24,410
Gus, you need to find out
who the architect is of the bank

179
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,922
and see if you can get a floor plan or a model.

180
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,688
And Austin... Austin'll take care of the dogs.

181
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:33,196
What dogs?

182
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,993
- Rottweilers.
- Vicious killing dogs.

183
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,198
Gus, come on. This is serious. Tomorrow I'll
try to check out my mom's security system.

184
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:45,332
- Mrs Phillips, who's that with you?
- My daughter.

185
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,606
I'll try to take as many pictures as I can.

186
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,775
You guys, I really need you.

187
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:59,516
- All right. For Mr P.
- For your dad.

188
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,889
OK, Maddy. Here we go.

189
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,701
Maddy.

190
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:51,237
Do you have any idea how fast you were
going? Save it, pal. License and registration.

191
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:59,006
That is the eye of God, Chad.

192
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,278
Do you see these people?

193
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:05,913
These are not people.
These are snakes in paradise.

194
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:10,289
Waiting for your weakest moment,
any chance you give them.

195
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:13,090
These people... not to be trusted.

196
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:20,268
My sweethearts.

197
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:23,738
Maddy, I love that you wanted
to come to work with me today,

198
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:26,606
but I have a lot of work to do
so I need you to keep up.

199
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:29,236
- Can I see the safe?
- That's just the old safe.

200
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:33,044
- The real one's upstairs.
- What are those?

201
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,483
- A motion detector.
- Can I see the new safe?

202
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:39,386
If Miss Fancy-pants Phillips
would have listened to me,

203
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:43,484
we wouldn't need
all this hi-tech flimflammery.

204
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:45,789
The dogs!

205
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:50,666
Dogs would have done all the work.

206
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:53,931
Dogs and my black belt.

207
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,073
Back to the monitor, maggot!

208
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:07,948
- Is your office upstairs?
- Yeah. I need to be near the safe.

209
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,478
Whoa. That thing looks like it's alive.

210
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:16,857
It's got a motion detector.
The guards can't watch all 100 cameras,

211
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:21,159
so when the camera picks up movement,
the light goes on and they can see us.

212
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,358
Watch. Stay completely still.

213
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,034
Climber girl.

214
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:36,677
It's pretty cool.

215
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,853
They'd better fix the ISP.
That side of the building is SLL.

216
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,222
Molly?
I didn't think you were coming in today.

217
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:55,788
The party is Friday so I wanted to make sure
the system is as close as possible.

218
00:20:55,866 --> 00:21:00,894
I spoke with Brisbane about the loan
and he wouldn't budge. I'm really sorry.

219
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:04,168
Oh, God.
We'll have to figure out some other way.

220
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:07,404
- Would you like a tour?
- Alan, that's really...

221
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:10,412
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Great.

222
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:15,213
We'll start this way. I'll take good care of her.
Now, we're gonna begin...

223
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:25,356
I paid that phone bill!
I paid that phone bill last week!

224
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,494
Hi. My name's Aust...

225
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:34,868
- Easy!
- My name's Austin and I make movies.

226
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,531
Director.

227
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:40,099
Really? How may I help you?

228
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:44,443
I got this dog for my birthday and I was
hoping I could use him as a stunt dog...

229
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:47,608
- What kind of dog do you have?
- Budweiser?

230
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,578
- Rottweiler?
- Yeah.

231
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:53,418
I just happen to be a Rottweiler expert.

232
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:57,688
There is a really nice boy here
who's going to write an essay

233
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:02,130
about the design
of the Harderbach Financial building,

234
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:07,899
and he needs a floor-plan drawing
that he can use as a visual aid for his essay.

235
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:14,536
Are you freaking nuts?
You can't give bank floors plan to a kid!

236
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,712
Normally he's very nice.
But it's a little more difficult with banks.

237
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:24,914
I mean, imagine if you were a bank robber.

238
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:31,458
It's that last time I got a C in my essay
because I didn't have any visual aids,

239
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:33,792
and my stepdad, he...

240
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:36,093
Well, he gets a little...

241
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:47,936
Stay here.

242
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:01,823
You can't see it now,
but by the party we are hoping it's primo.

243
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:07,159
Down here is the security room,
ultra hi-tech. Your mom designed that, too.

244
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:13,100
You might notice the keypads, designed
to keep people out of the important areas.

245
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,129
- Who has the codes to all these?
- They're different from room to room.

246
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:20,870
But I have a code
that is good for the whole building.

247
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:23,839
- Cool.
- Come on.

248
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:33,719
D. E. N. I. R. O.

249
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,293
De Niro.

250
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:41,961
Look at that view.

251
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,062
This is the coolest office in the building.
It belongs to Mr Brisbane.

252
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:51,039
Check this out.

253
00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:00,316
And get this. Your mom has rigged it so you
can control all the cameras from right here.

254
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,378
You talking to me?

255
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:07,685
Are you talking to me?

256
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,429
It's De Niro. I still do some acting.
This bank manager thing's just temporary.

257
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,193
Come on. You try.

258
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:23,605
- I don't know what to say.
- Say anything.

259
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,834
- Hi.
- Disgusting.

260
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:28,537
Good.

261
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:44,091
In this room there's a tunnel that leads to the
safe. I can only tell you a bit about the safe.

262
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:47,755
Only your mom understands the whole thing.
She designed it.

263
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,927
Whoa! No!

264
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,631
I can't wait till we get rid of these things.
They get me every time.

265
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:00,275
Down!

266
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:04,642
Rottweilers respond
to German commands only.

267
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,548
Ausfahrt, Killer! Ausfahrt!

268
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,613
Say "Ausfahrt," kid.
Do it or he'll rip your throat out.

269
00:25:14,124 --> 00:25:16,217
- Ass fart!
- Ausfahrt!

270
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:21,155
You must show them respect.

271
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:23,392
Ouch fart!

272
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,993
Wrong answer.

273
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,766
Ass fart! Ass fart!

274
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,812
Go away! Ass fart!

275
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,789
Get outta here, kid,
before I turn him loose on you.

276
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,334
No respect!

277
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:01,429
Come on. Come on.

278
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,955
Don't ever tell anybody where you got it.

279
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:30,192
I would never. Thank you.

280
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:57,017
They're gonna send out a search party for me.
Can you get back to your mom's office?

281
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:59,927
- Yeah. Thanks, Mr Hartmann.
- OK. Bye.

282
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,657
I'll see you tomorrow.

283
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:04,030
- Mr Hartmann?
- Yeah?

284
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,197
I think you'd make a really good actor.

285
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:10,567
Thanks.

286
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:18,948
The party's in two days. That's when
we'll hit the bank. Austin, how are the dogs?

287
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,210
The dogs are under control.

288
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,776
- Gus, the model looks cool.
- Piece of cake.

289
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:27,618
I thought that secretary was gonna adopt me.

290
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,126
Do you guys think we could do it?
Get the money?

291
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:44,105
- Are you kidding? Of course.
- Yeah, of course.

292
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:48,304
You, you're the best climber
in the whole state.

293
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:52,246
Yeah, and Austin's
some freak-of-nature computer genius.

294
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,409
Yeah, and Gus is...

295
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:00,389
Gus is disgusting.

296
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:07,260
Austin, this should be the height of the gate
at the bank. Watch carefully, OK?

297
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:15,435
OK, Austin. Your turn.

298
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:22,305
The kart doesn't control you.
You control the kart.

299
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,471
- Go.
- I got it!

300
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:30,978
Whoa. Hey! Whoa. Whoa.

301
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:41,030
Is there any way
you can make them quieter and faster?

302
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:49,672
You want a window or an aisle?

303
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,713
100psi of pure NOS.

304
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:27,170
OK, work for your daddy.

305
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:37,082
It's worked! I'm a genius!

306
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:40,748
How am I gonna stop?
Maybe I'm not a genius!

307
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:00,707
Mr Hartmann's a nice guy.
Do you have your script?

308
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:04,042
- Always prepared.
- "I'm always prepared."

309
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:08,551
Austin, you just have to get him
to say to turn the alarm off.

310
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,950
I know. I know.

311
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:15,252
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm coming. Wait for me!

312
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,728
Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.

313
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:22,128
All right.

314
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:24,564
Maddy's home alone and scared of the dark.

315
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:28,365
You play her dad,
who walks in just as the alarm blares.

316
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,769
What do I do for a living?

317
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:35,308
I'm glad you asked.

318
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:38,779
You work for a specialized branch of the CIA.

319
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:42,818
I like that.
I've always wanted to play an assassin.

320
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,787
Here's your chance. You are a CIA assassin.

321
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,289
Can I get a water, please?
Can I talk to you for a second?

322
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,624
OK.

323
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:02,228
Which is stronger? Hair or no hair?

324
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:10,279
- I think hair.
- OK.

325
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:14,609
Six slick Schick supershavers.

326
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,416
OK.

327
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,189
This is scene one, take one.
Sound, speed and...

328
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:26,953
action.

329
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,626
- Dad, is that you?
- Hey, take it easy. It's only me.

330
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:36,030
You were really good today, Austin.
Seriously, really good.

331
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:40,166
I just try to stay out of the way of my actors
and let the magic happen.

332
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:54,650
- Gus, we have to go over the plan.
- Go over the plan with your boyfriend.

333
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,124
What? He's not my boyfriend!

334
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:01,130
- So you'd rather go out with Gus?
- I never said that.

335
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:05,066
Are all boys this stupid?
I don't wanna go out with either of you.

336
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:08,831
If we're so stupid,
then why don't you rob the bank yourself?

337
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:12,136
- Fine! I will!
- Good luck rigging your go-kart.

338
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:15,701
Have a good time hacking into
the bank's computer by yourself.

339
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:19,373
This whole bank idea sucks.

340
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:39,394
Dad, I have to talk to you.
I'm gonna steal $250,000 from Mom's bank.

341
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:42,828
I have to climb 100ft to get to the safe,

342
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:46,865
way higher than
I've ever, ever climbed before.

343
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:52,176
And I have to lie to my two best friends
to get them to do it with me.

344
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:03,687
Well, Maddy... 100ft is too dangerous.

345
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,554
You know that's how far I fell.

346
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,757
Yeah, I know, Dad.

347
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:15,304
Plus, it's illegal to steal money. You know
Mom'll get fired if anyone ever found out.

348
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:17,896
I thought about all that.

349
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:24,607
But wouldn't it be worth it
if it means you could get better?

350
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:31,213
Yeah, Maddy, it probably would be.

351
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:44,000
I've been thinking since yesterday and I've...

352
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:47,265
I love you.

353
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:53,467
Here. I have the other half.

354
00:33:57,447 --> 00:34:00,473
- Please say all that again.
- Stop.

355
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:08,415
- Promise to help with the mission?
- Yeah.

356
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:13,292
Just don't tell Gus, cos we need him
and he probably wouldn't do it if he knew.

357
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:14,921
He'd be devastated.

358
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:18,456
- What about Austin?
- You're much cuter.

359
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:21,595
I've actually liked you the whole time.

360
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:24,606
Yes! I knew it!

361
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:30,036
Here. I have the other half.

362
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:34,982
Promise to help with the mission?

363
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:44,460
- OK.
- Cool.

364
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:47,621
Let's go over the plan one last time.

365
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,893
I took Maddy's pictures from the bank,
the model that Gus brought home,

366
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,200
and I scanned them into the computer.

367
00:34:57,307 --> 00:35:03,075
Using those elements, I created a digital
blueprint of the building. Check it out.

368
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:05,010
- VoilÃ .
- Whoa!

369
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:07,549
That is awesome!

370
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:14,483
I mean, it's OK...
if you like that kind of stuff.

371
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,085
Wow.

372
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:23,897
Here's where the party's gonna be.
Mostly contained in the lobby.

373
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,560
It's gonna be fancy so we'll need to blend in.

374
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:33,075
Security's on the second floor, so we'll have
to get past your brother to get to the elevator.

375
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:43,246
And, Austin, you'll hack into the bank's
camera system from Brisbane's office.

376
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:48,857
Gus, we're gonna make our way to the safe.

377
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:59,425
It's suspended 100ft off the ground,
so the only way to get to it is to climb.

378
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:04,063
Whoa.

379
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,634
Maddy, are you sure you're gonna
be able to make this climb?

380
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,976
I mean, it's double the size of the water tower.

381
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:15,916
You guys take care of yourjobs.
I'll take care of mine.

382
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:23,215
They're doing a lot of tests on your father
tonight, so I wanna be there.

383
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:25,846
So I'm gonna need you to look after Max.

384
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:30,018
Mom, I can't. I'm going out with Gus
and Austin. You never think about me.

385
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:33,359
- If you're not gonna come to the hospital...
- I can't.

386
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:37,958
Maddy, you're gonna
baby-sit Max tonight. OK?

387
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:40,800
That's it.

388
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,641
One more thing.

389
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:49,670
I do think about you, Madeline. Every day.

390
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:52,307
All the time.

391
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:11,691
- Nice bandanna.
- Nice turtleneck.

392
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:18,737
- What's he doing here?
- I have to baby-sit him.

393
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:22,006
He's gonna ruin everything
we've just worked for.

394
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,073
He hasn't made a sound his whole life.
I don't think he's gonna start now.

395
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:28,846
What if we mess up?

396
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,855
We're my dad's only chance.

397
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:35,583
I'm ready.

398
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:38,753
- You ready?
- Let's hit it.

399
00:37:57,582 --> 00:37:59,140
Ew, gross!

400
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,219
Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt.

401
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:06,655
Sure, like I'm really gonna
take a picture of my butt.

402
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:26,804
Grab a burger? Only four of us?

403
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:50,051
It's all clear.

404
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,655
Here you go, Maddy.

405
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:02,230
When I get up there, I'll disable the motion
sensors. You can come up the stairs.

406
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,604
Careful, Maddy.

407
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:15,082
Maddy, camera.

408
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:38,536
I gotta get Chad and Ferrell out of that booth.

409
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:41,203
Don't worry, we got it covered.

410
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:45,079
Strike. And strike. Like a cobra.

411
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:57,660
Lesson one, Chad.

412
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:01,095
Never take your eyes off the enemy.

413
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,630
Take this for a test ride.

414
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:19,014
Dude. The way your feet smell,
it's just... it's not normal.

415
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,782
God, Gus!

416
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,121
Oh, my God.

417
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,165
Gotcha.

418
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,101
Motion detected, north staircase.

419
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:46,268
Check the monitors.
Check the monitors.

420
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:49,871
I don't see anything.

421
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,713
That's when your enemies are
most dangerous, when you can't see them.

422
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:58,845
This is a test, I just know it.

423
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:04,051
I'll go downstairs, make a round.

424
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:08,689
You stay here and take care of your privates.

425
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:14,636
You stay in this booth!

426
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:32,582
It worked. Sort of. Ferrell's gone,
but now Bad Chad's alone in the booth.

427
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,590
We'll think of something.

428
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:52,604
I got it. I'm gonna distract him. When I give
you the signal, get into the elevator.

429
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,406
I'll meet you there.

430
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:58,539
Hey, Maddy. What's the signal?

431
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:00,174
Maddy!

432
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:04,711
Maddy, get away from Chad. He's a lunatic.
My brother really thinks he's a cop.

433
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:08,384
This wasn't part of the plan.
Maddy, don't go in there.

434
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:16,927
Hi.

435
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:19,594
What are you doing here?

436
00:43:19,703 --> 00:43:22,729
I was at the party. I was totally bored.

437
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,768
What are you doing?

438
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:28,470
Just my job.

439
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,647
You look different.

440
00:43:37,922 --> 00:43:41,483
Why are you such ajerk
to your brother all the time?

441
00:43:41,592 --> 00:43:42,991
Well...

442
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:46,426
You know he completely idolizes you?

443
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,124
- Gus?
- Yeah.

444
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:52,566
To him, you're like Yao Ming or Shaq.

445
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:55,799
- Which one? There's a big difference.
- Yao Ming.

446
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:59,173
- Definitely Shaq.
- You think?

447
00:43:59,276 --> 00:44:02,143
- Yeah, I think so.
- Sweet.

448
00:44:02,246 --> 00:44:06,615
He thinks you're gonna be a great cop.
He told me.

449
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:15,756
You should come downstairs. The police
chief is here to check on my mom's security.

450
00:44:15,826 --> 00:44:19,284
You could show him
how serious you are about yourjob.

451
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:26,029
Ferrell told me not to leave the booth.

452
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:30,937
I just came from the party.
Don't worry, he's not down there.

453
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:37,038
She winked at me.

454
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:40,014
- Gus really thinks I'm cool?
- Yeah.

455
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:42,551
Maybe that's the signal. Go.

456
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,654
Where's the chief?

457
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:51,955
What I love about this is the wave
it sends through the body. Unbelievable.

458
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:53,291
Oh, God.

459
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:11,514
- Come on, Maddy.
- Come on.

460
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:13,550
Hurry. Come on.

461
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:34,761
All right. Go to 22.

462
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:43,177
Freeze. Red light.

463
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:53,921
Go, go, go.

464
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,119
- Red light.
- How long do we have to stay like this?

465
00:45:58,228 --> 00:45:59,855
Go.

466
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:02,532
Red light.

467
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:10,035
Green light.

468
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:12,867
Go, go, go!

469
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:41,766
All right, you guys. I'm online.

470
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,330
Max, stay here. I'll be right back.

471
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:47,638
I gotta go bust this bank
so we can save Dad. Give me five.

472
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,009
Yeah. I'll be right back.

473
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:54,341
Red light.

474
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,510
Green light.

475
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,588
Red light.

476
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:00,749
Go!

477
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:06,929
Austin.

478
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:09,159
Check.

479
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:12,030
Do you see any dogs in there?

480
00:47:12,136 --> 00:47:16,266
I'm searching now. Nothing in the cages.
They must be somewhere else.

481
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,104
It's all clear. OK.

482
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,602
Camera panning... off.

483
00:47:38,328 --> 00:47:41,024
No. Max. No!

484
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:46,227
Go back, Maddy.

485
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,298
Austin?

486
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:55,911
Max, no. Not the camera.
It's not a toy. Not a toy.

487
00:47:56,747 --> 00:48:00,012
- Austin!
- Max.

488
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:03,212
OK, I got it. Go.

489
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:13,053
How do you know
the dogs aren't gonna be waiting?

490
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:15,393
I don't. But I guess we find out.

491
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:37,612
Whoa, that's high.

492
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:45,220
Goodbye.

493
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:47,286
Don't look down. You'll be fine.

494
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:52,425
What is this? Another door?
How do you open this one?

495
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:55,530
Open sesame!

496
00:48:57,374 --> 00:49:00,309
This one doesn't even
have any numbers on it.

497
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:03,943
Whoa! Cool!

498
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:15,282
Mr... Lieutenant Ferrell?

499
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:18,225
- What?
- I saw something in Sector 5.

500
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:22,755
All right, I'll be right up.
Don't get your panties in a wad.

501
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:49,852
Whoa.

502
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,520
Maddy, we are so grounded.

503
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:59,967
Say goodbye to my Xbox,
my iPod, my go-kart.

504
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:07,034
I'm gonna have to take out the trash,
do the dishes, massage Grandma's cold feet...

505
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,874
- What?
- I saw something in Sector 5.

506
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,483
- In that region.
- Sector 5?

507
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,484
I was just in Sector 5!

508
00:50:23,827 --> 00:50:26,318
That was me, you idiot!

509
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:35,704
Chad, did I ever tell you the story about the
boy who cried Sector 5 one too many times?

510
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:39,368
Holy...

511
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:41,842
That's where they keep all the money?

512
00:50:42,646 --> 00:50:44,409
Thanks a lot, Mom.

513
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:48,478
This is Mr Brisbane's office. Look at that view.

514
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:50,850
Someone's coming. Get down.

515
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:56,852
So I finally have you all to myself.

516
00:50:56,927 --> 00:51:00,260
I like to come up when I know he's not here.

517
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:03,925
It's too high to climb to the safe.
There must be a way to bring it down.

518
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:06,366
Then come help me look.

519
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:09,768
Gus!

520
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:12,364
Gus, come help me.

521
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:32,086
Holy...

522
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:38,059
You know The Planet of the Apes?

523
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,798
- I was in that movie.
- I love that movie!

524
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:50,071
Whoa, that's fresh!

525
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:56,143
- What did you do?
- I just stepped on this dude's eye.

526
00:51:57,054 --> 00:52:00,490
These numbers
match the ones all over the wall.

527
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,286
They're safety deposit boxes.

528
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:09,630
I bet you if we press one...

529
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:25,637
My mom's gonna kill me. Retract 3212.

530
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:33,686
Hit 2357.

531
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,123
Mama.

532
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:44,760
That's right. Come to Mama.

533
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,027
Oh, yeah!

534
00:52:53,677 --> 00:52:55,611
Mr Hart...

535
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:02,107
And that concludes our tour of the ninth
floor. Let's get you back to the party.

536
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:08,050
Stockholders.

537
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:21,304
This is gonna work.

538
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:25,068
You can't climb this. It's too dangerous.
You'll never make it.

539
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,904
- I'm doing it.
- Austin,

540
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:31,879
you've got to hack into the main whatever
and find some way to bring down the safe.

541
00:53:31,982 --> 00:53:33,847
- Check. Searching now.
- Gus.

542
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:36,909
I love you. Now do what I say.

543
00:53:37,754 --> 00:53:41,053
OK? 5344.

544
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:53,500
I'm searching for the hydraulic controls
for the safe, but... I can't find anything.

545
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,698
- What's going on in there?
- 2244.

546
00:53:56,773 --> 00:53:59,105
- You don't wanna know.
- I do.

547
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:02,940
- What's next?
- 4231.

548
00:54:06,883 --> 00:54:08,612
- Gus!
- Sorry.

549
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:13,417
You're killing me here, dude.
Focus. Retract 4232.

550
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:22,259
Good evening, everyone. How are you?
Having a wonderful time, are we? Terrific.

551
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:24,765
To our generous board of directors.

552
00:54:24,868 --> 00:54:29,134
Here's to the only type of success
that really matters -

553
00:54:29,973 --> 00:54:32,373
financial.

554
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:35,376
Cheers.

555
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:40,075
OK, Gus, last one. 5343.

556
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:48,088
Security breach. Security breach.

557
00:54:53,063 --> 00:54:56,430
Security breach. Security breach.

558
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:02,097
Do something. Do something now.

559
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,407
Anything.

560
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:08,343
Oh, shoot. Tape.

561
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:10,470
Austin, tape. Run the tape.

562
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,491
Mr Hartmann, the alarm has sounded.

563
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:28,860
Take it easy. It's only me.
Just turn the alarm off.

564
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:34,801
- I should let out the dogs.
- Calm down, princess. It's fine.

565
00:55:34,871 --> 00:55:42,039
Really. No, nothing to worry about.
I'm right here. Just turn off the alarm.

566
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,147
Should I...

567
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:47,846
Kill the alarm.

568
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:59,829
Well, it seems that our security system works.

569
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:02,160
Yes. It's just a false alarm, everyone.

570
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:07,067
So why don't we all just relax and enjoy
this wonderful party? What do you say?

571
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,967
Wonderful. Please.

572
00:56:10,674 --> 00:56:14,576
Something's going on.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

573
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:17,738
Hey! Watch the monitor!

574
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,881
You can do this.

575
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:40,829
Maddy, be careful.

576
00:56:53,683 --> 00:56:56,914
My parents grounded me for a week
when I left my bike outside.

577
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,854
Imagine what they'll do if they catch us now.

578
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:06,588
We'll figure out a different way.
It's too dangerous.

579
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:11,429
Not listening to me. She doesn't understand.
She's climbing up this stupid wall.

580
00:57:11,534 --> 00:57:15,300
- Austin, maybe she'll listen to you.
- That'll be a first.

581
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:19,865
I wonder if we can finish
the eighth grade in prison.

582
00:57:21,077 --> 00:57:25,309
Wait. If we're in jail our parents
can't ground us. Right?

583
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:45,599
Come on. This cannot be happening.
The cam's stuck. It's stuck.

584
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:51,332
20ft from the summit my gear stuck.

585
00:57:52,575 --> 00:57:55,840
There was this perfect crack
all the way up to the top.

586
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,682
He free climbed it.

587
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:17,665
Maddy, are you free climbing this?

588
00:58:18,134 --> 00:58:19,692
Maddy, no.

589
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:28,471
Maddy, we never even got to kiss.

590
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:42,411
- She's looking down. She's looking down!
- Tell her not to.

591
00:59:43,186 --> 00:59:45,780
Why did I look down? It's high.

592
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,948
Maddy, don't look down.

593
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:51,023
That's high.

594
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:53,753
That's not high.

595
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,793
Gus looks like an ant. OK.

596
01:00:06,776 --> 01:00:08,141
OK.

597
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:11,638
One.

598
01:00:12,482 --> 01:00:15,076
Two.

599
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:18,249
Two and a half.

600
01:00:19,756 --> 01:00:22,054
- Maddy, no.
- Three.

601
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,561
Maddy!

602
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:33,261
Gus?

603
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:38,669
Oh, no.

604
01:00:38,775 --> 01:00:43,439
She set off a timer. She has two minutes
to enter the code before the alarm goes off.

605
01:00:43,513 --> 01:00:47,472
Maddy, you've triggered a timer.
You've gotta reach the keypad.

606
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:11,702
D. E. N. I. R. O.

607
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:15,942
- Access denied.
- Oh, no!

608
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:19,641
De Niro's not the code? I can't believe it.

609
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:24,513
I can't break the access code, Maddy.

610
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:28,813
Your mom designed the safe.
The code must be something she chose.

611
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:31,861
What could it be?
What did you use?

612
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,389
Maxwell.

613
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:43,138
- Access denied.
- No!

614
01:01:43,206 --> 01:01:46,642
Come on, Maddy. Think.

615
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:50,637
Maddy. Come on.

616
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:55,212
What could it be?

617
01:01:55,318 --> 01:01:58,082
Mom, what did you use?

618
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:02,683
Dad.

619
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:10,259
Access denied.

620
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,872
I do think about you, Madeline. Every day.

621
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:20,034
All the time.

622
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:36,248
Madeline.

623
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,554
Access code accepted.

624
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:58,912
She used my name! My name is the code.

625
01:02:58,982 --> 01:03:01,382
In your face, Harderbach Financial!

626
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:03,214
Gus?

627
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:06,483
- What happened?
- She made it. She's in the safe.

628
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:13,555
- Is the money there?
- Gus, 250 grand coming at you.

629
01:03:18,668 --> 01:03:22,434
No. It's down here.

630
01:03:23,439 --> 01:03:25,634
Good job, Max.

631
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:34,780
I'll meet you guys at the karts.

632
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:40,254
- Austin, we're on the move.
- Exit code requested.

633
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:45,693
Five, four, three, two, one.

634
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:50,164
Code red. All sectors beginning lockdown.

635
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:52,257
Come on, Maddy. Run.

636
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:55,797
Hurry up. Come on!

637
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:10,846
Code red. Intruder alert.
Code red. Intruder alert.

638
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:16,481
Hello. We have a code seven
at Harderbach Financial.

639
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,153
Send everyone. I mean everyone.

640
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:27,393
Release the dogs.

641
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:32,065
Hurry! It's closing!

642
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,678
Dive!

643
01:04:41,984 --> 01:04:48,389
Do not panic, ladies and gentlemen.
Would you please take care of this thing?

644
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:04,506
We gotta get to the hospital.

645
01:05:07,777 --> 01:05:11,235
He hasn't said a word in his life
and now he won't shut up.

646
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,882
Let's go see Dad, all right?

647
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,520
Doggy.

648
01:05:23,926 --> 01:05:26,224
Austin, you got this one?

649
01:05:26,562 --> 01:05:28,393
- Run.
- Run?

650
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:30,762
All you had for us was "run"?

651
01:05:33,636 --> 01:05:35,399
Help! No biting!

652
01:05:43,312 --> 01:05:45,473
Get away from me!

653
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:54,449
Gus! Austin!

654
01:05:58,895 --> 01:06:01,659
Not the money!

655
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:09,629
We gotta get down that chute.

656
01:06:10,106 --> 01:06:11,300
Austin!

657
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:14,968
Come on. Come on, you guys, we have to go.

658
01:06:23,786 --> 01:06:26,482
Maddy.

659
01:06:26,956 --> 01:06:28,583
Ausfahrt!

660
01:06:37,466 --> 01:06:40,094
Fart? That's the code word?

661
01:06:40,169 --> 01:06:43,696
Come on, you guys. Let's get to the chute.

662
01:07:09,365 --> 01:07:11,731
What have we here?

663
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:16,999
- It's not what you think. We were just...
- Save it, doll face!

664
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:21,510
- We were at the party...
- Zip it! Or I'll zip it for you.

665
01:07:22,645 --> 01:07:25,637
Well. Young Chadley.

666
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:29,981
Looks like we've caught
our first little trespassers.

667
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:35,183
And since no one is here to claim them,

668
01:07:35,258 --> 01:07:39,251
then no one will hear them scream.

669
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:44,029
First we're gonna...

670
01:07:45,368 --> 01:07:47,996
Where's my thingy?

671
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:51,039
Looking for this, Lieutenant?

672
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:55,199
Get it off!

673
01:08:08,024 --> 01:08:10,584
What are you gonna do, bro?

674
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:15,754
You just get that money to Mr P, all right?

675
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:18,959
Don't you forget who got you out of this one.

676
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:21,764
Bad Chad don't do this kind of thing all the...

677
01:08:27,043 --> 01:08:29,739
You guys, we really gotta go.

678
01:08:42,058 --> 01:08:44,583
Geronimo!

679
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:53,459
OK, here goes nothing.

680
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:57,471
Mother?

681
01:09:10,686 --> 01:09:12,347
- Where's Max?
- Max?

682
01:09:12,455 --> 01:09:14,423
Max?

683
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:26,329
Max, you all right?

684
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:45,344
- What's that?
- What?

685
01:09:46,355 --> 01:09:48,619
Round your neck.

686
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:55,658
Well... Well...

687
01:09:57,166 --> 01:10:00,363
I guess we got something to tell you.

688
01:10:00,469 --> 01:10:02,733
Oh, yeah?

689
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:08,866
You guys, we do not have time
for this right now. Come on, let's go.

690
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,015
I am not going anywhere
until I find out why Gus has on my chain.

691
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:19,081
She played us.

692
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:22,350
That sucks, Maddy.

693
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:26,828
- Let's get outta here, man.
- I'm right behind you.

694
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:38,006
I guess it's just me and you, Max.

695
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:52,282
I think I'm low on gas.

696
01:10:52,388 --> 01:10:55,289
You should have enough to get back.

697
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:02,086
Love hurts, huh?

698
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:07,727
You kids in the karts, pull over now.

699
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:10,363
Pull over immediately.

700
01:11:11,107 --> 01:11:14,941
Gus, I don't wanna be ajuvenile delinquent.

701
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:18,104
Austin, pedal to the metal.

702
01:11:18,214 --> 01:11:21,206
2-11, Harderbach Financial.

703
01:11:21,283 --> 01:11:24,912
Car 22 in pursuit. Two go-karts
fleeing the scene of a robbery.

704
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:31,723
22, repeat. Sounded like you said "go-karts."

705
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:35,388
Gus, I am out of gas. I'm slowing down.

706
01:11:35,464 --> 01:11:38,831
- Jump onto my kart.
- What? Are you crazy?

707
01:11:39,802 --> 01:11:42,771
Hurry up. The cops are right behind us.

708
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:44,499
One, two...

709
01:11:46,408 --> 01:11:48,933
What happened to three?

710
01:11:51,313 --> 01:11:54,180
- OK, buddy, hang on.
- Now turn.

711
01:11:54,283 --> 01:11:56,251
- Look up.
- I got it.

712
01:11:59,522 --> 01:12:01,956
Gus, they're right behind us.

713
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,160
- Look out for the curb.
- Hold on.

714
01:12:14,336 --> 01:12:17,772
- Yeah! They're stuck.
- 22 requesting backup.

715
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:24,503
Wait! Steer. Go, go, go!

716
01:12:26,315 --> 01:12:27,680
Come on, kart!

717
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:31,879
This is the LAPD. You are surrounded.
Pull over your go-kart.

718
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:33,887
Now we have a spotlight.

719
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:36,651
You have left the scene of a crime.
Pull over.

720
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:39,216
Gus, we're dead. We'll never get away.

721
01:12:39,328 --> 01:12:42,320
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Don't worry.

722
01:12:42,798 --> 01:12:44,857
Chopper one, splitting off.

723
01:12:47,803 --> 01:12:52,399
- The helicopter's going away.
- What's he doing?

724
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:55,204
OK, Austin. Now let's
get rid of these two cops.

725
01:12:55,311 --> 01:13:00,715
You are about to experience
100psi of pure NOS. Hold on.

726
01:13:03,986 --> 01:13:07,012
Here they come. Chopper one, we've got 'em.

727
01:13:07,089 --> 01:13:10,547
- The helicopter's back.
- Do not approach the helicopter.

728
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:14,254
- Gus, what are you doing?
- We have you surrounded.

729
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:16,888
- Stop your go-kart.
- We're going under.

730
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:19,900
- Don't go under!
- I'm gonna do it.

731
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:29,402
- That was crazy.
- I know. It was close. I'm so good.

732
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:33,106
Gus, look at the road.
Look out for this truck. Gus, look!

733
01:13:33,215 --> 01:13:35,080
Duck!

734
01:13:52,401 --> 01:13:55,427
Did you see that helicopter? That was great.

735
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,934
- You think Maddy made it?
- Yeah.

736
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:02,374
I'm sure she did.
I mean, the cops followed us, right?

737
01:14:02,444 --> 01:14:05,709
Yeah, I'm sure she made it.
I'm sure you're right.

738
01:14:13,622 --> 01:14:16,614
We've gotta go back, don't we?

739
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:19,888
Yeah, let's go get her.

740
01:14:19,962 --> 01:14:22,624
OK, Austin, jump on now.

741
01:14:22,731 --> 01:14:25,097
Let's go. Let's get Maddy.

742
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:29,098
Duck!

743
01:14:31,507 --> 01:14:35,500
- Faster, faster!
- They'll never catch us, Austin.

744
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:38,609
All right, Max. Almost there.

745
01:14:41,183 --> 01:14:43,413
Only one more block.

746
01:14:52,328 --> 01:14:55,195
3-72, I think we've found them.

747
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:57,094
Hold on, Maxie.

748
01:14:58,934 --> 01:15:00,458
We're back.

749
01:15:00,536 --> 01:15:03,300
What are we gonna do?
We'll never outrun them.

750
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:06,603
- I got it covered. Don't fall behind me.
- OK.

751
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:09,143
You kids in the karts, pull over now.

752
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:12,271
- They're getting closer.
- Not for long.

753
01:15:12,348 --> 01:15:14,680
Operation Jack.

754
01:15:30,232 --> 01:15:31,722
I am a genius!

755
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:34,997
Car 14, we've been disabled
at the corner of Grand and...

756
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:40,007
- Thanks, guys. Now keep up.
- We're right behind you.

757
01:15:41,009 --> 01:15:44,172
Alan, I just heard.
How much did they get away with?

758
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:47,306
- Who's this?
- She's the head of security.

759
01:15:47,383 --> 01:15:51,843
Three suspects. They got away on go-karts.
They hit you for $250,000.

760
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,549
- Go-karts?
- We also found this in the vault room.

761
01:15:56,692 --> 01:15:58,751
They used it to climb up to the safe.

762
01:15:58,861 --> 01:16:02,058
- Do you have the perpetrators in custody?
- Not yet.

763
01:16:02,164 --> 01:16:07,500
Why would someone break into a safe
with $25 million and steal only 250,000?

764
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:12,597
Excuse me. There she is! She is our so-called
head of security. This is all her fault!

765
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:15,677
- Actually, I did...
- With all due respect,

766
01:16:15,744 --> 01:16:18,713
Molly told you the security system
had not been tested.

767
01:16:18,781 --> 01:16:23,582
Really? You just got your walking papers,
didn't you, Hartmann?

768
01:16:23,685 --> 01:16:26,552
Are you talking to me?

769
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:29,523
Are you talking to me?

770
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:36,258
You must be talking to me cos there's nobody
else here. So you must be talking to me!

771
01:16:39,435 --> 01:16:42,029
Excuse me.

772
01:16:42,738 --> 01:16:47,232
Monsieur Nuffaut, I must apologize
for this strange debacle. I assure you...

773
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:50,039
It's not me you owe an apology to, Brisbane.

774
01:16:50,112 --> 01:16:55,311
Of course, if the head of security
told you the system is not ready,

775
01:16:55,417 --> 01:17:00,616
then it seems like a - how do you say? -
knucklehead move to have this soiree.

776
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:08,620
Je suis dÃ©solÃ©, madame. The blame falls
squarely on your shoulders. On y va, chÃ©rie.

777
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:13,099
Monsieur Nuffaut. Oh, FranÃ§ois!

778
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:25,068
Couldn't stay away, huh?

779
01:17:25,147 --> 01:17:27,240
Let's go save your dad.

780
01:17:43,866 --> 01:17:46,096
Maddy.

781
01:17:46,168 --> 01:17:48,932
Daddy. Daddy.

782
01:17:56,678 --> 01:17:58,976
Maddy. What are you doing?

783
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:01,379
I have the money for the operation.

784
01:18:01,483 --> 01:18:04,941
- What are you talking about?
- I got the money!

785
01:18:05,654 --> 01:18:07,884
Honey.

786
01:18:08,724 --> 01:18:11,386
What have you done?

787
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:15,956
Maddy, we gotta go!

788
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:20,126
What are you doing?

789
01:18:34,082 --> 01:18:36,380
Madeline, what...

790
01:18:39,221 --> 01:18:41,485
Mom, I have the money. We can go.

791
01:18:54,703 --> 01:18:57,900
Molly, what is this?

792
01:19:09,785 --> 01:19:15,052
I warned him that
the system wasn't online yet.

793
01:19:15,123 --> 01:19:17,216
I know.

794
01:19:21,697 --> 01:19:27,226
And to prove to everyone
just how vulnerable the bank was,

795
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:31,432
I had my daughter and her two friends -
three kids - rob the bank.

796
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:35,271
If you look in my contract you will see
that I have a license to perform

797
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:40,906
undisclosed tests to the system until such
date as the system is deemed fully operable.

798
01:19:44,386 --> 01:19:46,581
Are you buying any of this?

799
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:52,116
Yeah.

800
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:56,254
Molly was authorized
to hire consultants to test the system.

801
01:19:57,232 --> 01:19:59,325
This was all a plan.

802
01:20:00,268 --> 01:20:02,793
A brilliant plan.

803
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,486
Mrs Phillips, is it true your daughter's
a leading suspect in the robbery?

804
01:20:24,593 --> 01:20:25,685
Ready?

805
01:20:25,794 --> 01:20:31,630
We understand three children were involved
in a high-speed pursuit, ending up here...

806
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:37,536
The details are sketchy, but it appears the
children have robbed Harderbach Financial...

807
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:42,770
And a source inside the bank is saying the
robbery was actually some kind of plot to...

808
01:20:42,844 --> 01:20:49,010
Stories are swirling, but this reporter has
learned that one of the children has a father...

809
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:54,350
The child has not been identified
but the father is registered as Tom Phillips.

810
01:20:54,456 --> 01:20:59,018
Mr Phillips runs a local go-kart track
and is expected to return home tomorrow,

811
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:02,221
since his insurance
will not cover his operation.

812
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:05,458
I'm Maria Quiban, Channel Ten News.

813
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:18,211
You know what you did was wrong.

814
01:21:19,881 --> 01:21:24,875
- Yeah, I know.
- I know I haven't really been there for you.

815
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:29,251
But that's gonna change. OK?

816
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:38,922
- I love you.
- I love you too, Maddy.

817
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:42,331
You have such a big heart.

818
01:21:43,839 --> 01:21:46,501
You guys gotta come down the track.

819
01:22:03,692 --> 01:22:05,751
They're coming.

820
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:16,230
What are they doing?

821
01:22:16,304 --> 01:22:20,138
- Waiting to buy tickets.
- Come on. Let's go.

822
01:22:29,818 --> 01:22:32,048
- Hey, Maddy.
- Hey.

823
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,418
Skip, the tickets are only three bucks.

824
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:37,720
Keep the change. Tell your dad to feel better.

825
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:41,320
- It's three dollars.
- Here's 100 from my parents.

826
01:22:42,731 --> 01:22:45,256
Thank you. Wait. Here's your ticket.

827
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:48,268
- Six dollars.
- Help Mr P feel better.

828
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:03,780
- How much?
- 400.

829
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:06,514
- I have 300.
- Here's two here.

830
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,520
Well?

831
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:18,588
Even with the donations
from the news station, we're still short.

832
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:21,766
- Molly?
- Mr Hartmann.

833
01:23:21,837 --> 01:23:28,504
You forgot something. The consultant fee for
the company you hired to pull off the robbery.

834
01:23:33,715 --> 01:23:36,115
Holy... $50,000?

835
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:38,618
The hair. The hair.

836
01:23:39,387 --> 01:23:44,848
That should get you close. And the president
of the bank has authorized a personal loan.

837
01:23:45,493 --> 01:23:49,156
- Mr Brisbane already said...
- He's not with the bank anymore.

838
01:23:49,231 --> 01:23:52,462
So call me for whatever you need.

839
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:55,002
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

840
01:23:57,672 --> 01:24:00,140
I finally got my starring role.

841
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:06,309
$50,000!

842
01:24:06,381 --> 01:24:08,679
Yeah!

843
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:20,653
Throw it. Throw it, Maxie.

844
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:49,519
Here we go.
Get ready for the first race of the day.

845
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:53,220
And I know who you want calling the races,
and it sure ain't me.

846
01:24:53,295 --> 01:24:55,058
Hey, Dad.

847
01:24:56,398 --> 01:24:58,093
Thank you, Madeline.

848
01:25:07,575 --> 01:25:11,409
All right, race fans.
Who we got in the first race?

849
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:14,573
It's John "The Rammer" McGillicutty.

850
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:19,586
He's brought his kart Demolition.
Watch out for him, he's number four.

851
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:22,817
Oh, my God! You know what time it is.

852
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:26,724
So let's hit the gas, and kick some... butt.

853
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:29,093
It's race time!

854
01:25:29,164 --> 01:25:33,430
- Dada.
- That's right. That's your dada.

855
01:26:07,102 --> 01:26:09,127
Why do I have to choose between you?

856
01:26:09,204 --> 01:26:13,163
Cos you can't have two boyfriends. Come on.

857
01:26:30,558 --> 01:26:34,517
OK. I've made up my mind.

858
01:26:37,132 --> 01:26:38,861
Turn around.

859
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:50,166
No matter what, we'll still be friends, right?

860
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:54,545
Are you kidding?
You're gonna be our best man.

861
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:59,249
- Go get her!
- Maddy!

862
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:03,416
Maddy, wait up.
Come on, you're gonna choose.

863
01:27:03,525 --> 01:27:06,392
- Pick me! Austin's a geek!
- Gus is a blockhead!

864
01:27:06,494 --> 01:27:10,988
You're wrong, guys.
You'll never catch me, my legs are longer.

865
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:14,661
You'll never catch me!
