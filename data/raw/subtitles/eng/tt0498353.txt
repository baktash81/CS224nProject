in Slovakia.

10
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,388
It's this...

11
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,158
It's some kind of factory...

12
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,197
...Where these people,
these very rich people...

13
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,459
...they pay to torture and kill kids.

14
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,697
Mostly backpackers.

15
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,772
And they killed tWo of my friends.

16
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,384
They take you from this hostel...

17
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,089
...and they bring you
to this factory and...

18
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,462
I Went there looking for Josh.

19
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:32,105
He Was one of my friends
and they took him there and...

20
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,673

21
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,844
They killed him.

22
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,210

It's some kind of hunting club. They...

28
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,326
They all have the same tattoo.

29
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,628
It's a dog.

30
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,361
It's a bloodhound dog.

31
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,645
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

32
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,049
Why?

33
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,603
Because someone Was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

34
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,205
...With this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

35
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:25,712
Security tapes from this station
shoW him entering from a platform...

36
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,050
...Where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

37
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,748
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

38
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,232
You Were on that tape.

39
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,872
Did his tattoo look something like this?

40
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,003

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,720
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

50
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,189

00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:47,761
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

53
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,401
Somebody starts asking questions...

54
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,468
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

55
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,706
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I Was a kid.

56
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,707

00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,605

00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,679

No.

106
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,696

Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

108
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,494
Because, Dad, no college students

And, you knoW, it's for old people.

She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,530
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

120
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,936
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

121
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,769
She's not that bad.

Lorna, We're gonna grab a drink.
You Wanna go?

127

Whatever. She'll Watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

141
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,836

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,974
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

176
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,183
Oh, my God. Lorna, What happened?

177
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,558
Some guy took my iPod.

178
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,953
What?

179
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,958
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

180
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,659
- Yeah. I'll go check.
- Okay.

181
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,763
It had everything.

182
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,471
That's aWful. I'm so sorry.

183
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,836
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,438
Here you go.

185
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,387
It's those fucking guys.

186
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,692
The fucking guys, the Italian guys
from the room doWn the hall.

187
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,596
- What do We do?
- Just be quiet.

188
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,370
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,912
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

190
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,115
Oh, my God!

191
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,549
HoW did you knoW this Was mine?

192
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,951
I saW some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

193
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,758
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

194
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,694
I'm a little Worried he might
come back looking for me.

195
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,365
Well, do you Wanna come in here
and hang out With us?

196
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,430
- Really?
- Yeah, We have an extra seat.

197
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,761
- Yeah, come in.
- Totally.

198
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,130
Thank you.

199
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,734
I think...

200
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,807
...We all need a little of this.

201
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,211
Oh, aWesome.

202
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,775
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

203
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,909
Thank you.

204
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,619
As my father alWays says:.

205
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,050
"Nazdrovia. " To your health.

206
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,234
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

207
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,237
I kind of Wanna go home.

208
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:13,902
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed tWice on the overnight train.

209
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,979
There are so feW safe places
left in Europe.

210
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,878
So Where are you going?

211
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,543
On a little spa vacation.

212
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,054
Where?

213
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,817
Slovakia.

214
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,254
Wait, Wasn't there, like,
some War in Slovakia?

215
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,591
There hasn't been War in Slovakia
for 50 years.

216
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,025
That's Bosnia, darling.

217
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,530
- Oh, like you kneW.
- I did so.

218
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,258
What are the spas like there?

219
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:40,098
They're the best natural hot springs
in the World.

220
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,367
I go tWice a year. It's great to get aWay
from the Italian guys.

221
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,908
They get to be a bit much.

222
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,104
WoW, hot springs?

223
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,682
That sounds so therapeutic.
I Wanna go.

224
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:56,413
It's very easy. You just have to
sWitch trains in Prague.

225
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,820
It could be nice.

226
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,586
You knoW? I had enough gross guys
for one Weekend.

227
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,597
Okay, We'll go.

228
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,764
Do you knoW of a good place to stay?

229
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:20,135
- Smart move With the shoes.
- What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

230
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,739
Hi. Can I help you?

231
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,435
- I need a room for my friends, please.
- Yeah, cool.

232
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,637

233
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,645
American. Good.

234
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,585
Yeah, cool. It's 10 Euros for night.

235
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,850
No. I got this one.

236
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,323
No. It's on me.

237
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,793
- Thank you.
- Money.

238
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,792
Thanks.

239
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,534
Here are your keys.

240
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,700
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

241
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,742
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

242
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,778
It's Dozinky. I knoW that.
They have it every year.

243
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,674
- Yeah.
- Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

244
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,945
Oh, my gosh! Could We go?

245
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:39,114
- It sounds kind of gay.
- Excuse me.

246
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,797
Oh, We are so going to
the harvest festival.

247
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:51,334
- Come on. This Way.
- Thank you.

248
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,839
You're Welcome.

249
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,610
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

250
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,336
WoW, this room feels so timeless.

251
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,437
Are you kidding right noW?

252
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,666
Oh, my God!

253
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,774
Sexy.

254
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,513
Come here.

255
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,670
Yes! Yes!

256
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,642
Yeah!

257
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:53,078
That's What I'm talking about, huh?

258
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,370
Todd, What's up?

259
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,737
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

260
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,648
Really?

261
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:31,122
WoW, I didn't think-

262
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,159
Jesus. You sure?

263
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:41,325
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right noW.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

264
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,693
Okay.

265
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,797
See you.

266
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,175
No respect for me.
No respect for mother earth.

267
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,251
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

268
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,523
Well, that's just fine.
We can all ride home in silence.

269
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,763
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

270
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,602
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right noW?

271
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,831
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

272
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:25,067
I get to Write about
hoW beautiful this village is...

273
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,769
...and I get to Write about
What a raving bitch you are.

274
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,351
She comes back sWinging!

275
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:35,248
- Well-played.
- Thank you.

276
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,491
Dollar!

277
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,284
Dollar!

278
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,490
Do you guys have a dollar?

279
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,096
- I got it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

280
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,234
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

281
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,774
I have Smints.

282
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,439
Would you like a Smint?

283
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,719
Bitches!

284
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,493
Welcome to Slovakia.

285
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,070
You both have corner suites
With vieWs of the river.

286
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,339
Here are your pagers.

287
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,313
Perfect. Thank you.

288
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,217
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

289
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:46,390
Really?

290
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,060
Because you look like
your dog just died.

291
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:51,958
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shoWer and I'll feel better.

292
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,394
- All right.
- Thanks.

293
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,502
Oh, my God!

294
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,495
Hey, guys!

295
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:00,990
Yes?

296
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,094
For the apartment.

297
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,336
AWesome, dude.

298
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:08,234
Those sWords are like 1000 Euros.

299
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,568
Trust me, she can afford it.

300
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:14,445
Does she get, like,
a really big alloWance?

301
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:17,113
No, it's more like an inheritance.

302
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,244
Her mom died When she Was 12 and,
like, left her everything.

303
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,319
And so she keeps her dad
on an alloWance.

304
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,249
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,657
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she Wanted to.

306
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,559
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

307
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,186
Yeah!

308
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,196
Badass.

309
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,460
Let me see this motherfucker.

310
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,236
You're up, bro.

311
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:23,748
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

312
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,382
Come on, man, sit doWn.

313
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,951
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

314
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,955
I didn't knoW and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

315
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,650
Dude, What are you doing? Sit doWn.

316
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,762
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say When she sees this?

317
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,365
My Wife is not gonna
really understand.

318
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,036
Is there some other option?

319
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:48,399
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

320
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:49,741
Yeah.

321
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,169
Let's do it. Come on, man.

322
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,402
Why don't you sit doWn?
These guys aren't playing.

323
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:56,273
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

324
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,473
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

325
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,016
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

326
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,711
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time-

327
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,089
Is there any problem here?

328
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,750
No, no. I just didn't knoW
that this Was part of it.

329
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,764
Stuart.

330
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:19,768
This is not like going to a Whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

331
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,442
Get in the fucking chair.

332
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,713
Yeah.

333
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,385
Come on, man. Look at this.

334
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,022
I'm fucking proud of mine.

335
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,480
Look What I found!

336
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:07,679
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

337
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,048
...and those little kids right there
made it.

338
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,917
- Oh, my gosh, really?
- Yeah.

339
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,058
- I'm gonna go say thank you.
- Okay.

340
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,660
They don't speak much English.

341
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:23,567
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

342
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,496
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

343
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,262
Thank you.

344
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,775
Well, cheers.

345
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,943
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

346
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,845
Come!

347
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,957
Come on, Borat.
Let's see What you got.

Three o'clock.

00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,244

No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

363
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,384
I could have helped you.

364
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,924
Excuse me?

What he say to you?

370
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,514
Nothing. He just Wanted to dance.

371
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,948
He Won't bother you anymore.

372
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,086
Oh, he Wasn't bothering me.

373
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,893

00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,572

375
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,115
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Don't Worry about it.

376
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,288
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

377
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,013
No, it's all right.

378
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:08,187

Beth! Beth!

382
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:26,578
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman Wants to
take me on a boat ride...

383
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,713
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

384
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,644
...and he doesn't speak English,
but We understand each other.

385
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:36,787
Yeah. Just promise me you Won't
go on a boat ride With him, okay?

386
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,286
Why not?

387
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,355
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

388
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,154
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

389
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,662
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
Want you to stay here Where it's safe...

390
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,697
...We're all together,
We don't get separated.

391
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:52,132
Just promise me
you Won't go on a boat ride With him.

392
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:04,071
Lorna, promise me
you Won't go on a boat ride With him.

393
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:08,948
Beth. It's okay.

394
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,452
- Okay. You promise?
- Okay, okay, okay.

395
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,289
Okay.

396
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,388
Roman.

397
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,130
Okay, tWo, please.

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,136
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thanks.

400
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,836
So, What brings you
to this corner of the World?

401
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,444
Her. Firestarter.

402
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,141
And you?

403
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,783
I honestly don't knoW.

404
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,321
I'm sorry, there's probably...

405
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,465
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

406
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,295
Why travel all this Way
just to talk With an ugly American?

407
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,495
You're not that ugly.

408
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,230
Really?

409
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,033
Well, cheers to that.

410
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:06,734
Cheers.

411
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,705
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

412
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,276
Yeah.

413
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,884
I get to listen to them have sex later.

414
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,113
Can We sWitch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

415
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:23,154
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

416
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

417
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,532
That's- That's a long story.

418
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,369
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

419
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,574
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

420
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,766
- ... I'm sure We'll meet again.
- I'm sure We Will.

421
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,740
All right. Good night.

422
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,339
Good night, Beth.

423
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,712
Did I tell you my name?

424
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:48,179
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

425
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,215
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

426
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,459
Good to meet you, Stuart.

427
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,517
Good night.

428
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,231
Lorna!

429
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,767
Lorna!

430
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:21,950
Lorna.

431
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,446
Excuse me.

432
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,024
Lorna!

433
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,593
Lorna!

434
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,763
Beth, I'm sorry!

435
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,703
You promised.

436
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,104
I knoW.

437
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,300
I'm sorry!

438
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,449
It's so peaceful.

439
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,686
It's so secluded.

440
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,821
Roman, What are you doing?

441
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,173
Come to me.

442
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,951
Close your eyes.

443
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,312
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,150
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,693

448
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,288
Oh, fuck!

Beth!

450
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,594
I cannot leave her alone With this guy.

451
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:50,234
You knoW, you just go ahead
and I'll Wait for Lorna.

452
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:52,403

455
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:57,805
Fuck!

456
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,773
- Dude, are you coming?
- Are you okay?

457
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,674
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

458
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,712
- Are you all right?
- Dude, I'm fine.

459
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,075
Have another cocktail.

460
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,421
All right, good night.

461
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,287
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

462
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:17,757
- We are?
- Yeah.

463
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:21,091
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

464
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,496
He's fine. But can We please go
get some rest? Come on.

465
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,500
Oh, you're so sWeet. No, I'm fine.

466
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,673
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

467
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,669
I'm sure you Will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

468
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,903
Good night, Miroslav!

469
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,256
I'm sorry. He Was just so shady.

470
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,316
Whatever. I Wanted to fuck him, but...

471
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,187
I knoW you did. I'll make it up to you.

472
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:56,492
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go doWn the hole again tonight.

473
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,928
Do you have a AA?

474
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,102
Mr. Rabbit!

475
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,599
Come here, Rabbit!

476
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:13,911
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

477
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,347
No, but I remember the last.

478
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:17,715
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

479
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:22,622
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

480
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:26,093
It Wasn't anything he said or did, but
something Was different. You kneW it.

481
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:30,257
I knoW What you mean. It's like you can
sense it the Way an animal senses it.

482
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:31,959
Exactly. Like an animal.

483
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:35,695
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

484
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,705
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody. "

485
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,038
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

486
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,875
But like an animal, you can sense it.

487
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,309
You knoW that this guy's got the balls
to do What feW others can.

488
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,113
And that's you after today, my friend.

489
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:55,384
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

490
00:44:55,594 --> 00:45:00,395
What We do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

491
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,127
- Where's your pager?
- It's back in the room.

492
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,600
- Come on. What the fuck?
- I just figured you had yours.

493
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:09,603
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

494
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,743
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

495
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:15,504
I don't Wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it-

496
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:20,242
- It's different from taking on an image.
- I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

497
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:22,750
It's time We fucking do it.

498
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,664
To the next level.

499
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,924
To the next level. No, Wait.

500
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,965
Isn't it bad luck to toast With Water?

501
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:42,037
Yeah. Bad luck
for Whoever meets us today.

502
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:49,236
Yeah. Let the games begin.

503
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,326
Hard, hard, hard.

504
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,197
Hey.

505
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:17,141
- Hey, did she call?
- No. I just checked.

506
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:20,576
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

507
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:24,146
- Hey, I tried.
- Keep trying.

508
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,475
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

509
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:28,653
Sure.

510
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:30,684
I bet she's making him
breakfast right noW.

511
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,413
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

512
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,886
Thank God.

513
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,492
At least she has something
to Write about in her journal.

514
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,865
Please! Please!

515
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,874
Please! Stop!

516
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,272
No!

517
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,074
Stop! Please! Please!

518
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:00,447
Please! Please!

519
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:03,354
Please, no!

520
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,009
