00:00:56,528 --> 00:01:03,083
<i>I don't know how all of this
could really be so</i>

5
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:09,405
<i>Not even dreams
could be stranger than this</i>

6
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:18,059
<i>Still, this can't be just a tale
Since only life could conjure</i>

7
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:23,521
<i>Something so unbelievable!</i>

8
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,429
<i>But what is real?</i>

9
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:34,329
<i>A truthful and wise story
Is always just a tale</i>

10
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:41,743
<i>Except it's real
Except it's real...</i>

11
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,801
<i>You might ask
when lifted by some inner vision</i>

12
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:55,368
<i>Why it's always so important to believe</i>

13
00:01:56,215 --> 00:02:03,286
<i>Well, then accept what you're hearing
And this treasure seen</i>

14
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:09,362
<i>A solace and support
in times to come</i>

15
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,277
<i>All this is real</i>

16
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:20,372
<i>'Cos a truthful and wise story
Is always still a tale</i>

17
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,368
<i>Except it's real
Because this tale is true</i>

18
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,370
<i>If it is good...</i>

19
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,685
We all know the difference
between animals and people.

20
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:40,852
People take medicines,
and read books,

21
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,136
and they like to go to the cinema.

22
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,541
While animals don't do any of
these things.

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,606
With time, people overcame animals,

24
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,460
and started to solve most of their
problems with the help of animals.

25
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,480
But quite often they forget
about gratitude.

26
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:58,156
Just as in our story.

27
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,315
<i>All this is real</i>

28
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:09,459
<i>A truthful and wise story
is always still a tale</i>

29
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,369
<i>Except it's real</i>

30
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,493
<i>'Cos this tale is true</i>

31
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,800
<i>If it is good...</i>

32
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:36,353
This story is about a hippopotamus,
called Hugo.

33
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:39,814
Or more precisely,
about Hugo and the sharks.

34
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:44,442
The whole thing started in a faraway
place, on the Hummingbird-islands.

35
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,314
This is Hummingbird Island,
a little before the trouble started.

36
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,921
The inhabitants had earned a living
growing cloves from time immemorial.

37
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,324
And they were ruled over
by sleepy sultans.

38
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,957
At the time of our story
Sultan Mahdjin sat on the throne.

39
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,946
Thanks to his wise
and circumspect reign

40
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,450
the treasury grew ever bigger.

41
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:13,464
Ships came from all over the world to buy
the most fragrant cloves they could offer.

42
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:18,546
The dockers carried the precious
cargo of faraway lands to its shores,

43
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,983
striding in the shallow waters
without a moment's rest.

44
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:25,917
And in return,
they loaded the ships with spices.

45
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,218
The treasury grew

46
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:32,742
and the lines of singing dockers
grew ever longer.

47
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:39,464
<i>Sing-song, we sing our song</i>

48
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:46,511
<i>Thus my legs won't tire
As long as these work songs are sung</i>

49
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>Whether they're bags or crates
The hungry ship will fill up</i>

50
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:05,130
<i>Sing-song, we sing our song</i>

51
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>Sing-song, we sing our song</i>

52
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:15,135
<i>Sing-song, Sing-song</i>

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,248
<i>We sing our song!</i>

54
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:36,225
<i>We sing the song of labour</i>

55
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:42,565
<i>Your woman is tidy
Busy preparing your food</i>

56
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:52,940
<i>Offering dinner
And gently she embraces you</i>

57
00:05:57,193 --> 00:06:02,054
<i>Sing now, the song of labour!</i>

58
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:06,614
<i>Sing now, the song of labour!</i>

59
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,605
The pleasant and happy life
of the Hummingbird-islands

60
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:18,607
was disrupted by
the thunderous attack of the sharks.

61
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:22,379
<i>Aaah, labour...</i>

62
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:27,967
<i>is only for the horse!
We ain't no god-damn oxen!</i>

63
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,561
<i>To pull the plough! Yeah!</i>

64
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,808
<i>Hell, no!</i>

65
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:39,346
<i>A royal banquet lies ahead!
The whole world is our spread!</i>

66
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:41,555
<i>Let's feast!</i>

67
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:48,724
<i>What heavenly rain
When blood spurts from the vein!</i>

68
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,179
<i>Oh, what a thrill </i>

69
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,989
<i>it is to kill!</i>

70
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:02,689
<i>When they sing songs!
Sing songs!</i>

71
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,697
<i>When they sing songs</i>

72
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,876
<i>Of agony!</i>

73
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,606
<i>Of agony!</i>

74
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:32,018
<i>Sing songs! Sing songs,</i>

75
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,666
<i>Of agony!</i>

76
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,903
Sharks! Help me!

77
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,873
Stop! What's all this commotion?

78
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,406
Stop!

79
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:27,945
Look, Sir!

80
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:36,194
Slackers! Brigands!
What are you doing here?

81
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:40,009
Back! Everybody get back
to your places!

82
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:44,290
What a loss
for the state treasury!

83
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,339
Continue your work at once!

84
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,519
Save the goods!

85
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,739
Me! Save me!

86
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,526
I am Aban Khan!

87
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:57,518
The Minister of Justice and
Financial Affairs of our most wise

88
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:00,071
and glorious ruler, Sultan Mahdjin!

89
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:03,704
I demand that you tell me
what is the meaning of all this?

90
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,107
A rebellion?

91
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,230
I can tell you, Sir, if you really want!
The people are protesting!

92
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,824
Protesting? That's ridiculous!

93
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,760
And what is it
they are protesting against?

94
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,647
They are protesting against the
presence of the sharks!

95
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:23,608
Sharks! Don't make me laugh!
That's bullshit!

96
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,523
Silly superstition of the natives!

97
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,822
Everybody get back to work!
Do you hear me?

98
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:33,020
There are no sharks in
the Sultan's port!

99
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,114
And what do you say about this, Sir?

100
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:42,003
Sharks! In the Sultan's port!

101
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,160
Oh, gracious minister!
Shouldn't we report this to the Sultan?

102
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:48,028
I must report this to the Sultan!

103
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:51,823
Sharks! In the Sultan's port!

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,533
A national tragedy!

105
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:59,007
Our wealth is in danger!
And so is my position!

106
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:03,679
Hurry, to the Sultan's palace!

107
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:11,565
Aban Khan's dismay
was not unfounded.

108
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,650
If the sharks keep on disturbing
the work of the dockers,

109
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,815
all the cloves would be left on shore,

110
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:21,052
and soon there would be
famine in the country.

111
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,972
My lord! Oh, my lord!
There are sharks in the port!

112
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:02,984
Sharks! Sharks! Oh! Ah!

113
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,674
Your Majesty!

114
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:08,979
What?

115
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,769
May pigeons dwell in our pantry!

116
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:15,592
How is it possible, that after all this
heavenly peace

117
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,244
and prosperity our ports are suddenly
overrun

118
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:22,501
- by sharks! - How could there be
sharks in such shallow water?

119
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,157
Indeed, Your Majesty, the sea-level's
been barely higher than a Pygmy's knee,

120
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,445
for the last few centuries,

121
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,479
but considering the unusually
heavy rains

122
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:37,307
of the last few months,
the decreasing air-pressure,

123
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,859
and the East-north-east monsoon...

124
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,616
Blast your
East-north-east monsoon!

125
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,875
You always blame it
on the monsoon!

126
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:49,769
The ships cannot wait in the port
for too long!

127
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,284
I want to hear of a solution!
At once!

128
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:57,988
I suggest we dry out the port,so the ships
can anchor much closer to the beach!

129
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:06,138
You stupid, sluggish-headed,
donkey-eared, pea-brain!

130
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,024
May the executioner
play with your skull!

131
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:11,186
How am I to finance the cost
of all that, d'you think?

132
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,611
Whilst all the cloves are rotting away!

133
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,870
Am I to make a spectacle
out of the sharks

134
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,561
for Western tourists perhaps?

135
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:26,382
Where is the court-magician hiding now?
Wake up, you lazy-ass and come here!

136
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,917
Your Majesty! I just had
a ridiculous dream!

137
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,372
About sharks in the port!

138
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,243
What is your wish, Your Majesty?

139
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,484
Aaah! I want to talk to you
about the sharks!

140
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,801
Oh! Sharks are very
cunning beasts!

141
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,254
The Magician of magicians!

142
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,523
Turning dust into water
in no time!

143
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,549
Charming! Great!

144
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,477
Good! Good! But can you deliver
my port from the sharks?

145
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,508
It's not easy to
fool a shark's wits.

146
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,502
Sharks live in water.

147
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,860
And of course, magic-dust
is always to be kept dry.

148
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,619
I'll show you a little tricky-trick, Your Majesty!

149
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:11,721
It's good, eh?

150
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,798
May you have calluses
on all your fingers!

151
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,695
I'm surrounded by charlatans!

152
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,600
Take a card!

153
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:27,565
Get out of here! Out! Go! All of you!

154
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,174
Is there anything we can do for you,
oh, glorious Sultan?

155
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:34,562
Yes! Serve yourselves to the sharks,

156
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:37,901
and give them all food-poisoning!
Get out!

157
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,706
Oh, Nimara! Why are all rulers

158
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:20,475
so forsaken when in need?

159
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,735
Oh, Nimara! I wish you were
a sea-dwelling creature,

160
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,424
and could tear those
cursed sharks to pieces!

161
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,869
Nimara! A riddle!

162
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:43,110
What is it that walks like an
elephant, yet swims like a whale,

163
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:46,350
kills the sharks, yet sharks

164
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,815
cannot kill it?

165
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:59,107
<i>It walks like an elephant
But swims like a whale</i>

166
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,748
A river-horse! Only a river-horse!

167
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,947
A river-horse, oh, Majestic, Sultan!

168
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:36,708
By all the stars of Allah, yes!
The river-horse is the solution!

169
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:40,067
The noble river-horse! Nimara!

170
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,649
My best friend, who is wiser
than any of you,

171
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:45,438
helped me to solve this riddle!

172
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:48,374
But oh, shining one!
Are you certain about this?

173
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:52,140
May you and your doubts be eaten
by jackals! No more debate!

174
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,513
Get me hunters, wagons and cages!
Go to the continent!

175
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:58,656
And bring me 12...

176
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,726
- Water fleas!
- Waterball-games!

177
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,376
Water organs!

178
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,143
River horses!

179
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:11,201
Bring me a dozen of them,

180
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,528
and then we'll set them free
in the port!

181
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:15,551
But before that, my dear Aban Khan,

182
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,255
you're to lead the expedition,
for a premium daily fee, of course!

183
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,430
Now, let my betrothed ones enter!

184
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:32,804
And thus Aban Khan mustered an
army of porters, hunters and seamen,

185
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,966
and he travelled to Africa with the intention

186
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,989
of entering the Jungle.

187
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,078
A hippopotamus-hunt!

188
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:47,103
It's worse than a nightmare!

189
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:50,942
The hippo is the biggest
failure of nature!

190
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:53,417
The joke of Allah, the all-mighty!

191
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:57,394
The laziest,
ugliest and dullest

192
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:00,065
creature on Earth!

193
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,277
By the prophet's beard, I'm telling you,

194
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,238
the Sultan's sympathy for beasts

195
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:19,921
is way beyond normal common sense!

196
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:23,947
The Expedition pushed deeper
and deeper into the jungle

197
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:28,032
searching for the 12 river-horses.

198
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,898
Faster, you dogs! Hurry up!

199
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:34,531
Move it! Get lively!

200
00:17:57,222 --> 00:18:00,031
Come on! You blockheads!

201
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,574
I've found one!

202
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:12,530
Come on, you rheumatic sloths!
Forward!

203
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:15,300
Itchy-dirty dogs!

204
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,796
Move your legs!

205
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,619
Whoever finds the first river-horse

206
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:25,291
will get a extra-bonus!

207
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,600
There they are!

208
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:36,395
Laziness is a world-phenomenon
these days.

209
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:43,324
Phew, look at those beasts
bathing in the mud!

210
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:47,693
They just lie in
their own filth all day long!

211
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:51,877
How could anyone call them horses?
Rather they're...

212
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,494
Pigs... River-pigs!

213
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:03,027
You just lie there! River-uglies!

214
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,363
Aban Khan has come to take you away!

215
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:27,071
<i>He walks like an elephant
yet swims like a whale</i>

216
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:33,795
<i>He won't ever win a beauty contest
As features are fairly mixed up!</i>

217
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:39,775
<i>A pot bellied fatso,
yet he's still charming and cute</i>

218
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:45,255
<i>And I very-very much love this river-foal!</i>

219
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,625
<i>A pot-bellied fatso</i>

220
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:52,689
<i>Yet he's still charming and cute </i>

221
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:57,392
<i>And I very-very much love this river-foal!</i>

222
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:18,229
<i>A pot-bellied fatso,
yet he's still charming and cute,</i>

223
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:23,645
<i>And I very-very much love this river-foal!</i>

224
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:31,426
<i>A pot-bellied fatso
Yet he's still charming and cute</i>

225
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,470
<i>I accept him in my heart
No matter how hard you laugh!</i>

226
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:37,544
<i>I sing it in Latin as well
for you to remember</i>

227
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,825
<i>I love the Hippopa T-A-M-U-S!</i>

228
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:10,481
Come closer, my friend!

229
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:13,343
Make me a shh-shh-shh...

230
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,682
Just leave this to me, Your Highness!

231
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,794
Come on! Show us what you can do!

232
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,326
Idiot!

233
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,638
The dark sorcery of the court-magician

234
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,917
made homeless the river-horses.

235
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,589
Little Hugo was
the most frightened of them all.

236
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,787
One, two, three, four,

237
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,988
five, six, seven,

238
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:38,510
eight, nine, ten,

239
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,218
eleven,

240
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:44,559
We need one more!
I must find another one!

241
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:48,723
I must...

242
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,710
I want that big one
as the twelfth!

243
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:56,058
Catch him! Quickly!

244
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,965
You screwed up!

245
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,533
Catch him!

246
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:11,514
We got him!

247
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,738
Careful! Don't let him go!

248
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:20,146
Will you really
let him fool you like that?

249
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:24,462
If you let the river-horse-king
slip away from your clutches,

250
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,938
you'll end up in a junkyard!

251
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,277
We got it! We caught him!

252
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:52,861
His Lordship is ours now!

253
00:25:57,373 --> 00:26:00,201
Just try to put yourself
in Hugo's situation!

254
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,569
What could he possibly feel

255
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,596
seeing his father and mother being
locked into cages and carried away?

256
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:12,795
Now we can drink
to our success!

257
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:17,185
Or at least to the river-horses'!

258
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:24,049
Just look at this four-legged
walking mountain!

259
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:27,201
I'm going to name Your Mountainness,

260
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,510
after Charlemagne!

261
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:33,083
Why Charlemagne, Your Highness?

262
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:36,167
Because Charlemagne was the greatest

263
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:39,201
ruler in history, you fool!

264
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,656
Even greater than the Sultan?

265
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:43,846
Come on, you fool!
Why bring him up?

266
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:46,949
After all, even I'm
greater than the Sultan!

267
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:53,262
Thus the hunting expedition
and the 12 river-horses

268
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,540
turned back to go home
to the Hummingbird-islands.

269
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:59,425
Nobody noticed that a 13th
hippo was travelling with them too.

270
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:03,162
It was none other,
than Hugo, who decided

271
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,892
to follow his mommy
and his royal daddy.

272
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,916
Even though he was almost
scared to death

273
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:11,499
when he saw the ocean
for the first time in his life!

274
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,955
The ship was heading towards the
port of the capital, where the Sultan

275
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:16,870
was waiting impatiently.

276
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:20,459
May the seagulls dot
Aban Khan's turban!

277
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:23,484
How long can it take to catch
12 river-horses?

278
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,216
Buffalo tread on my chattering tongue!

279
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:32,966
The Sultan's Expedition has returned!

280
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,918
Ah! Aban Khan! You've returned,
even if not too soon!

281
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:49,340
But it's better to have a hundred
thousand slugs, than a single snake!

282
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,502
But where are the river-foals?

283
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:55,095
Behold, Your Majesty!

284
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:16,593
You're right to marvel at them,
my dear Nimara!

285
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:20,865
Hoh! My dear Aban Khan!
You outdid yourself!

286
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:26,187
Sharks! Your final hour has come!

287
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:46,227
Your Majesty, it looks like the plan
hasn't work out!

288
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:50,096
With all due respect, but it was
a very silly idea to start with!

289
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:53,047
If only you would listen to me,
Your Highness,

290
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:56,267
Let out Charlemagne!

291
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,196
Music!

292
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:23,432
And so, the Sultan's plan
DID work out in the end.

293
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:26,515
Their new home was rather unusual
for Charlemagne's group at first,

294
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:28,470
but they soon learnt to like it.

295
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:31,121
And in the evenings the grateful
inhabitants of the island

296
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,939
came to the port carrying
a rich feast for them,

297
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,277
thus rewarding their saviours.

298
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:40,198
They especially liked the youngest one,
and when they saw him, they shouted,

299
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,371
- Hoog-gho!
- Hoog-gho!

300
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,435
The 'hoog-gho' cries
flew over the beach,

301
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,882
and on their tongue it meant,
"There he is!"

302
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:54,478
So, the little hippo was named Hugo,
after the word, 'hoog-gho'.

303
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:59,024
Time has passed. The river-horses
played in the port's waters,

304
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,396
and enjoyed the love
of the locals.

305
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:04,145
In the meantime commerce
started to boom again,

306
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:07,444
and it flourished
even more so than before.

307
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:13,528
They built piers and bought
some giant cranes,

308
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:16,159
so, in other words, the port
became modernized,

309
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:20,549
therefore the dockers didn't have
to stride into the water anymore.

310
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:24,457
Which also meant, the sharks
provided no obvious danger anymore.

311
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,212
The island-country became
more prosperous than ever,

312
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:29,490
thanks to the river-horses.

313
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:32,416
And as their fortunes changed,

314
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,655
the people forgot about those

315
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,092
to whom they owed all this.

316
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:40,451
And since they didn't really
need the river-horses anymore,

317
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,416
quite soon they became a nuisance.

318
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:53,443
And gentlemen!
Why are there hippos in the port?

319
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:56,379
Hippos in the port?
What a question!

320
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,168
We've always had river-horses
in the port!

321
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:17,897
For weeks on end
the deserted river-horses

322
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:21,864
kept waiting to be fed,
but all in vain.

323
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:40,083
Only some garbage fell down
to them from the piers.

324
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,712
They were hungry and desperate.

325
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,119
And having no other options left...

326
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:42,558
Ri... ri... river-horses!

327
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,806
Damned hippos!

328
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:51,852
I wish they would have rushed
to the Sultan, who loved the hippos.

329
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:55,569
But instead the farmers turned
to the evil Aban Khan for help.

330
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,067
- Why do I have to be at the front?
- Come on, does it matter? Move!

331
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,903
Don't argue about this now!

332
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:38,369
Gentlemen!

333
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:42,532
What is the reason
for your kind visit?

334
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,693
Aban Khan! Our great lord!

335
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,609
We are disturbing you
because of the crops!

336
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,869
- Because of the crops?
- Yes! Yes!

337
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:52,745
Congratulations to you!

338
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,103
Thanks to my wise guidance,
clove-exports

339
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:59,270
grew by 25% during

340
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,743
the last financial year!

341
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:03,022
But.. but...
but the crops are gone!

342
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,881
- What?
- They were eaten by...

343
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:12,282
- ...the hippos!
- The hippos?

344
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,017
But this is terrible!

345
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,139
This is a national catastrophe!

346
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:23,531
Gentlemen! You won't be disappointed!
Just put your trust in me!

347
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:25,642
But what are we to do now?

348
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:29,413
When a man is being attacked,
my dear friends,

349
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,007
there is only one thing he can do!
Only this!

350
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,008
You! And you!

351
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,247
And you, from the other side!

352
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,861
I'll sit in the first boat.

353
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:45,321
Follow me!

354
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:51,193
Keep quiet!

355
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:55,126
It was a nice and quiet, moonlit night,

356
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,600
when Aban Khan and the upset farmers

357
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,448
set out on this cruel mission.

358
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:03,035
The minister in his madness

359
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:05,893
saw the hippos as if
they were menacing clouds.

360
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:09,389
And he wished to kill the lot,
at all cost.

361
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,190
I just killed you!

362
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,765
Great!
This was the old girl!

363
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:45,202
But where is the king?

364
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,529
The king is mine!

365
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:51,732
There he is!
Put a hole through him!

366
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:55,984
To Hell with you, you devil!

367
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,827
We finished him off!
It's a job well-done!

368
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,186
Sink!

369
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:18,308
Sink!

370
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:20,881
Sink!

371
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,990
Not even Hugo's father,

372
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:31,980
the enormous king could escape

373
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,494
Aban Khan's weapons.

374
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:39,149
All the river-horses of the port

375
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:43,111
were massacred on this
terrible night.

376
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:46,199
Except for Hugo.

377
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,383
But where is Hugo?

378
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:14,309
Finish him off as well!

379
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,913
Help!

380
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:31,368
Help!

381
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:37,937
You! You! You! Don't!

382
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,227
Pull me out! Pull me out!

383
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,109
You just go!

384
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:50,310
Come on!

385
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:53,576
Just go, wherever you want!

386
00:38:56,463 --> 00:39:00,037
I'll catch you soon, anyway!

387
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:14,666
Just save your wretched skin!

388
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,747
Just go!

389
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,986
No matter where you run,

390
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:26,462
I'll catch you soon enough!

391
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:42,157
<i>Now I know why it's so dangerous
to have a hungry belly</i>

392
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:45,857
<i>It's so terrible
when my belly rumbles...</i>

393
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:50,252
<i>I'd eat everything with an A
a corncob, cake or fish</i>

394
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:54,089
<i>I'd devour an entire hill of food
It wouldn't be too much!</i>

395
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:58,940
<i>A magic-garden in my mind
Pies on trees and rivers run...</i>

396
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:01,616
<i>Honey-rivers run</i>

397
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,526
<i>Look, aren't they sweet?</i>

398
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:07,629
<i>Like a fig, but flies away.</i>

399
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,867
<i>My wish is so banal
an orange or half-banana</i>

400
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:18,166
<i>But I've none
So am I to starve?</i>

401
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:22,374
<i>I'd eat the croissant of the Moon
and all the P-s of a pretzel</i>

402
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>It doesn't matter
Just give them to me!</i>

403
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:31,124
<i>Others have honey-sweet festive days
While I'm just starving here!</i>

404
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,862
<i>Death by hunger!</i>

405
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:36,468
<i>Look, aren't they sweet?</i>

406
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,942
<i>How amazing!</i>

407
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,277
<i>Look, aren't they sweet?</i>

408
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:44,608
<i>Spreads its wings and flies... </i>

409
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:06,566
This fish is probably
as big as a horse!

410
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:51,744
<i>Rivers and lakes may all dry out
as time passes by</i>

411
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:56,585
<i>The ancient tree may be
felled by the storm</i>

412
00:43:57,577 --> 00:44:03,410
<i>But though attacked by Hell itself
Yet it never yields</i>

413
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,898
<i>Because it is as solid as a rock</i>

414
00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:11,610
<i>Just like friendship...</i>

415
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:17,264
<i>When it guards the magic
of the enchanting tales!</i>

416
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:20,191
<i>Just like friendship...</i>

417
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:24,855
<i>The purity of dreams
Now, that's friendship!</i>

418
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:38,981
Oh! It's late! I must go home now!

419
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,416
I still have to do my homework!

420
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,659
You know, we're to hand in
an assignment tomorrow.

421
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:47,755
And I haven't even started it yet.
Well, take care!

422
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:52,292
This is how Hugo found himself
a friend, Jorma,

423
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:55,051
who caught him as if he were a fish
in the Khurissan-lake.

424
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:57,349
This was a great catch!

425
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:17,100
Hurry up, Jorma!
You'll be late for school!

426
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:19,064
I talked with your teacher
yesterday!

427
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,067
He really complained
about you!

428
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:25,445
- I know, Dad! - Jorma must
hand in his homework today!

429
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:30,002
Obviously it's something
about truancy!

430
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:36,241
- Hi, Jorma!
- Hi!

431
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:42,353
Where's your homework, Jorma?

432
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,122
Get off my suspenders!

433
00:45:50,594 --> 00:45:53,854
The teacher will really
punish you today! Booo!

434
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,477
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

435
00:46:00,772 --> 00:46:03,777
<i>An eccentric, so one-of-a-kind
That he's unmatched</i>

436
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:07,489
<i>On the Earth
Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

437
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,936
<i>He's such a real gem
among the absent-minded </i>

438
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:12,826
<i>that they all envy him!</i>

439
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:15,045
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

440
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,407
<i>Two good ears </i>

441
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:22,882
<i>Yet he's still stone-deaf!</i>

442
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:28,430
<i>Sees with four eyes
But still blind as a bat!</i>

443
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:32,551
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

444
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:37,108
<i>Mixes salt with whipped cream
Puts poppy seed into the stew!</i>

445
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:39,710
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

446
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:43,142
<i>Can't see what is nice!
Not even the sky!</i>

447
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,658
<i>Even though his head's in the clouds!
Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

448
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:54,061
<i>Two good ears
Yet he's still stone deaf!</i>

449
00:46:56,133 --> 00:47:00,552
<i>Sees with four eyes
But still blind as a bat!</i>

450
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:08,123
<i>He's not blind or deaf
So what's all this about?</i>

451
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,808
<i>The mind goes astray!
Just fancy that?</i>

452
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,184
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

453
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:18,395
<i>His head in the clouds!
Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

454
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,132
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

455
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:25,588
<i>Puts black pepper in milk!
Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

456
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,506
<i>Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

457
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:33,434
<i>His head in the clouds!
Mister MacBow-wow!</i>

458
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,577
Good morning, Teacher!

459
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:47,331
Good morning, children! My illustration
-method is a good thing, isn't it?

460
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:51,465
I can see, Lena, that you chose
the subject of oil exploration!

461
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:55,236
So, come on! Let's waste no time!
Who wants to be the first?

462
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,220
I would like to be the first!

463
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:00,225
Excellent! What's more, great!
Naomi will do the first presentation!

464
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:02,567
What subject did you
choose, Naomi?

465
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:05,906
My subject is Kilimanjaro, Teacher.

466
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:08,174
Amazing, island-like

467
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,786
volcanoes are stretching towards
the South

468
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:13,405
by the East-African trench.

469
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:17,979
The most beautiful among them
is the Kilimanjaro-group.

470
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:22,104
And now, I'll show you
a volcanic eruption.

471
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:27,210
Excellent! What's more, great!

472
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,115
- Amazing!
- That's it!

473
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:31,884
Which one of you would like
to do better than Naomi?

474
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:36,764
- Me! - Oh! Everybody is so
keen on doing a presentation!

475
00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:39,848
I mean, almost everybody!

476
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:43,368
Jorma! Would you care to tell us
about your subject?

477
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,727
Did you bring something with you,
Jorma?

478
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,751
I hope it isn't the fish
you caught yesterday!

479
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,942
My subject is about the hippo.

480
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:04,063
The hippo, or a hippo?

481
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:06,459
Well, the one that lives
in the Khurissan-valley!

482
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:10,161
Silly talk! Everybody knows there
are no hippos in the Khurissan-valley!

483
00:49:12,803 --> 00:49:16,416
- Look! A hippo!
- Hoog-gho! Hoog-gho! Hoog-gho!

484
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:20,030
- Hoog-gho! A hippo!
- Hoog-gho? Hugo!

485
00:49:20,217 --> 00:49:21,847
- What?
- Let's call him Hugo!

486
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:23,438
Let's go and play with him!

487
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,154
Stop! Stop! Come back!

488
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:37,295
Let's go after him!

489
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,175
I'm coming as well, Jorma!

490
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:41,512
You come as well!

491
00:49:43,055 --> 00:49:46,551
- Come!
- I'm coming, Hugo!

492
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:57,029
<i>I don't know why
There is water in the sea</i>

493
00:49:57,265 --> 00:50:01,213
<i>Why there's a head on my neck
And ten toes on my feet</i>

494
00:50:01,822 --> 00:50:06,006
<i>I don't know why
raspberries always taste so sweet</i>

495
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:10,091
<i>I just listen
to the birds singing in the trees!</i>

496
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:14,539
<i>But I know in summer time
Such great things will wait in line!</i>

497
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:19,321
<i>The sun laughs merrily!
The swings flies happily!</i>

498
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:23,623
<i>Land and sky belong to me
Each meadow and every tree</i>

499
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:29,264
<i>And I know that all the fairy-tales
will one fine day...</i>

500
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:35,461
<i>All come true for me!</i>

501
00:50:36,256 --> 00:50:40,714
<i>I don't know why
the Sun shines brightly in the sky</i>

502
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:44,515
<i>How could all the many birds
learn how to fly?</i>

503
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:49,444
<i>I don't know why penguins
wear their tail-coats on the ice</i>

504
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:53,554
<i>A lot of things
are still unexplained to me!</i>

505
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:58,130
<i>But I know in summer time
Such great things will wait in line</i>

506
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:02,657
<i>The sun laughs merrily!
The swing flies happily!</i>

507
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:07,091
<i>Land and sky belong to me
Each meadow and every tree</i>

508
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:12,560
<i>And I know that all the fairy-tales
will one fine day...</i>

509
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:18,659
<i>All come true for me!</i>

510
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:23,303
<i>It's such an amazing skill
But all part of Heaven's will</i>

511
00:51:23,495 --> 00:51:29,701
<i>For an adult to see the wide world
Just like you and me!</i>

512
00:51:40,216 --> 00:51:43,142
Hugo! We'll always be your friends!

513
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,175
Troops! Quick march!

514
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,791
Troops!

515
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:18,170
Halt!

516
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:22,962
Grenades!

517
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:27,548
Aim at the traitor... Fire!

518
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:32,124
Hugo was disowned
by the animals,

519
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,648
for making friends with humans.

520
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:38,949
Luckily the children
didn't desert him too.

521
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:47,393
Ona has four times as many
oranges as Joe.

522
00:52:47,722 --> 00:52:50,805
The two of them together have
15 oranges.

523
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,967
How many oranges does
Joe have? Jorma?

524
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,437
Three oranges. Right?

525
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:04,419
Three oranges for Hugo.

526
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:08,032
If Robbie has twice as many apples
than he has now,

527
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,016
he would have four apples.

528
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,129
So, how many apples does
Robbie have now?

529
00:53:12,229 --> 00:53:13,816
Two apples, Teacher!

530
00:53:14,165 --> 00:53:16,148
- And one head of lettuce!
- And a mango!

531
00:53:16,953 --> 00:53:19,192
And a peanut-butter cookie!

532
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:22,517
- It's not much, Hugo!
- But it's all yours!

533
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:24,755
Of course, for a not-yet
fully grown hippo...

534
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:27,230
- He would need his own garden, guys!
- Aha!

535
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:29,390
That's it! We'll make one!

536
00:53:32,236 --> 00:53:35,712
<i>I've been having
This dream such a long time!</i>

537
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:39,208
<i>To have a garden under the sky!</i>

538
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:43,833
<i>A little hyacinth bell-flower
And when the wind gets up</i>

539
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:46,799
<i> Then you can hear
Gentle music, such a concert! </i>

540
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:52,455
<i>And here, you may even
please step on the grass!</i>

541
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:58,602
<i>Juicy fruit hangs from the branches!</i>

542
00:53:59,093 --> 00:54:02,157
<i>Juice drips from the sugar-sweet grapes!</i>

543
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,635
<i>Lizards run on the lawn
bees buzz in the air</i>

544
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:10,837
<i>'neath the blazing Sun!
Where else could you have so much fun!</i>

545
00:54:11,262 --> 00:54:15,543
<i>And here, you may even
please step on the grass!</i>

546
00:54:19,142 --> 00:54:23,011
Every day after school,
as soon as the school-bell rang,

547
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:25,879
the children ran into the garden.

548
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:28,029
- Run!
- Hurry!

549
00:54:28,324 --> 00:54:31,427
Relax! Slowly!
Don't run so fast! Ouch!

550
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:38,095
What the heck is happening here?
Why are you in such a hurry lately?

551
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:42,082
Nothing special, Teacher!
We just like to run!

552
00:54:42,843 --> 00:54:45,926
<i>Our friend waits for us,
and we'll have fun in our garden!</i>

553
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:49,648
<i>Our friend waits for us,
and we'll have fun in our garden!</i>

554
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:55,265
<i>Our friend waits for us, and we'll
have fun in our garden! Our friend...</i>

555
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,559
Oh! My poor head!

556
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:52,056
Hello! I've discovered where
Jorma and his friends go! It's a hippo!

557
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:55,041
It's a vision! I mean, they
dreamed up a hippo for themselves!

558
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,419
And when I saw stars, I mean, when
I couldn't see the forest for the trees,

559
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:01,924
then something should be done
about all this!

560
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:16,028
- Our parents are coming! Let's hide!
- We can go now, Hugo!

561
00:56:16,225 --> 00:56:18,257
Gee, we didn't expect this!

562
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:37,855
Unfortunately our story takes
a sad turn at this point.

563
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:41,169
Because some of the parents

564
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,958
misunderstood the upset words
of the teacher.

565
00:56:44,302 --> 00:56:48,740
Thus it happened, that
though full of good intentions,

566
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:50,743
they did the wrong thing.

567
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:57,669
From now on, you'll be banished
to your room every afternoon!

568
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:01,656
The river-horse-riding is over!

569
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:05,967
- You'll stop playing this animal-
protection-game nonsense! - Oooh!

570
00:57:06,183 --> 00:57:08,893
<i>Fate has given</i>

571
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:13,951
<i>A nest for each bird
and a cave for every bear</i>

572
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:17,535
<i>As a peaceful shelter</i>

573
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:23,339
<i>It's only me who is left alone</i>

574
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:28,555
<i>A wandering stray....</i>

575
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:33,458
<i>When it's raining
And the wind blows</i>

576
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:38,804
<i>It would be so great
to have some small nook!</i>

577
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:44,039
<i>A wretched hut, a broken cabin
Though the wind blows through</i>

578
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:49,381
<i>An old lair would be like a palace for me
Where peace and </i>

579
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:53,674
<i>quiet reign!</i>

580
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:58,328
<i>And if I could have that
Happy me</i>

581
00:57:58,652 --> 00:58:03,071
<i>Home is the greatest
present there could be!</i>

582
00:58:03,464 --> 00:58:08,084
<i>The homeless sing about that place
The dearest to be found</i>

583
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:13,525
<i>Needed like our daily bread
Without it you're orphaned</i>

584
00:58:14,045 --> 00:58:18,091
<i>in this world...</i>

585
00:58:25,264 --> 00:58:26,973
Yes. That's right.

586
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:30,940
The homeless one is forced to wander
like a stray-dog.

587
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:34,912
Hugo realized that there were some
tasty things growing in the gardens.

588
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,819
So he took to going there
during the night.

589
00:58:37,996 --> 00:58:42,420
Thanks to that, soon he was referred to
as the garden-thief.

590
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:46,740
One night he visited the garden
of Jorma's family.

591
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:09,778
Oh, what a wonderful morning!

592
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,057
A beautiful morning!

593
01:00:12,872 --> 01:00:14,796
I had a such a good sleep!

594
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:18,405
Oh!

595
01:00:20,428 --> 01:00:23,999
Who did this?
Who could it be?

596
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,868
Where is that bastard? Ah!

597
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:34,418
The thief of Flamingo Town
was ravaging again.

598
01:00:34,516 --> 01:00:38,106
The farmers have been trying
to figure out the identity

599
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:41,346
of the thief for the last three days.

600
01:00:41,454 --> 01:00:44,636
Who is that mysterious night intruder,

601
01:00:44,793 --> 01:00:47,268
who ravages their crops?

602
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:50,514
According to one farmer he comes

603
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:53,774
like some hungry ghost of a giant.

604
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:58,714
This sounds very familiar.
Am I not right?

605
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,377
Very familiar.
Very familiar, indeed.

606
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:06,658
I think, I should report this
to the Sultan.

607
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:22,798
I'll wipe out every river-horse
in the world!

608
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:25,833
Even the memory of them!

609
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,032
By God! What am I
supposed to do now?

610
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:31,430
I'm wrecked! I'm ruined!

611
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:33,895
What the hell can I do?

612
01:01:35,712 --> 01:01:38,874
Who could this be?
The Terror of the gardens, perhaps?

613
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:43,390
Who... who... who are you?

614
01:01:43,586 --> 01:01:46,669
Who am I? Aban Khan!

615
01:01:47,386 --> 01:01:50,588
I am the Minister of Justice
and Financial Affairs

616
01:01:50,686 --> 01:01:52,925
of His Majesty, the Sultan

617
01:01:53,097 --> 01:01:56,376
whose endless wisdom
governs the fate of all our lives.

618
01:01:56,475 --> 01:01:59,701
Calm down, my dear friend!
Just put your faith

619
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:02,077
in me and my men!

620
01:02:02,254 --> 01:02:04,532
Put orchids between
the cabbages,

621
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,458
and petunias in the
potato-field!

622
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:51,837
The court-magician created
a miraculous garden,

623
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:56,039
with fantastic vegetables
and wondrous fruit.

624
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:59,251
Who could possibly resist
so many temptations?

625
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:03,532
Certainly not a starving hippo.

626
01:03:25,694 --> 01:03:28,211
You know, I am of the opinion that

627
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:31,314
the guilty one
deserves a final supper!

628
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:37,196
What's it, my little friend? You don't
want the terror of the gardens caught?

629
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,695
I just can't desert my friend!

630
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:16,539
<i>I offer you some
Sweet flesh for your tum-tum</i>

631
01:04:16,873 --> 01:04:22,804
<i>Smell the scent of this tasty food!</i>

632
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:33,569
<i>Come, Hugo!</i>

633
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:42,194
Don't!

634
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:06,246
Don't, Hugo! Don't!

635
01:05:11,276 --> 01:05:13,103
Come, let's escape!

636
01:05:14,772 --> 01:05:16,835
I'll save you, Hugo!

637
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:21,388
Everybody after him!

638
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,285
Ah!

639
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:50,042
I'll cut you to pieces!

640
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:52,399
Oh!

641
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:04,579
Come!
Leave this ugly thing here!

642
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:19,280
Ah! What a rain of bullets!

643
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:21,951
There!

644
01:06:26,123 --> 01:06:28,696
Stand up, Hugo!
Pull yourself together!

645
01:06:39,297 --> 01:06:40,691
Phew!

646
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:54,578
Hurry up! Away from here!
Heavy bombs are falling everywhere!

647
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:56,385
Take that!

648
01:06:57,001 --> 01:06:59,220
Wow, what a blood-thirsty guy!

649
01:07:41,786 --> 01:07:43,259
Thanks, brave Hugo!

650
01:08:02,562 --> 01:08:04,232
Oh! What a stench!

651
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:30,167
Don't lose heart!

652
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:32,229
I'll free you soon!

653
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,361
Lower your head!
This thing keeps spitting fire!

654
01:08:43,607 --> 01:08:45,413
Now, I'll do some tricks!

655
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:55,674
Hugo! I'll never eat
veggie-soup ever again!

656
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:01,994
I can't even look at it!

657
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:06,280
Look, Hugo!

658
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:08,126
It's turning into a butterfly!

659
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:15,236
Hold on, Hugo!
We're flying!

660
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:38,774
Look! A cauliflower-planet!

661
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,438
All these miraculous,
strange-looking fruit!

662
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:48,123
An orange-comet!

663
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:13,382
You! Don't fly away!
Don't let us down!

664
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:58,651
- No! - Step away from there,
my dear son!

665
01:11:02,647 --> 01:11:06,320
Hugo was caught by Aban Khan's men,
who put him into a cage,

666
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:09,548
and carried him back
to Flamingo Town,

667
01:11:09,705 --> 01:11:11,590
which was split into two groups.

668
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:14,792
Things didn't look too good
for poor Hugo.

669
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:17,701
Lean against it! Push it!

670
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:19,823
One more time! Push!

671
01:11:20,294 --> 01:11:21,885
Move, you lazy sloths!

672
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,062
- Hugo is here again!
- Hugo!

673
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:57,591
Down with the big-bellied one!

674
01:11:57,748 --> 01:12:00,753
Down with the vermin!
That wretched thief!

675
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:05,176
- Death to him! - Death!
- Execute him! - Behead him!

676
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:07,278
Put him on trial!

677
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:10,224
- Cut off his tail!
- How sweet is vengeance!

678
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,129
Just like the meat of a hippo!

679
01:12:16,996 --> 01:12:19,903
Die, you bastard!

680
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:22,849
The garden terror is escorted
to his trial by armed guards,

681
01:12:22,937 --> 01:12:25,196
and we'll come too
with our cameras.

682
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:28,122
Right turn!

683
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:38,347
Hugo! It's me, Jorma!

684
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:41,057
Don't be afraid!
I'll save you!

685
01:12:41,204 --> 01:12:44,582
I told you, Jorma! I'll take you home,
and lock you in your room!

686
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,802
But Dad! He needs me!

687
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:49,915
He won't have a fair trial
without me!

688
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,116
You'll make me the laughing stock
of the entire town!

689
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:55,699
- Take him home!
- Don't meddle in this!

690
01:12:55,856 --> 01:12:57,447
Damn it!

691
01:12:57,918 --> 01:12:59,528
The garden terror!

692
01:13:01,838 --> 01:13:03,154
Down with Hugo!

693
01:13:03,252 --> 01:13:05,275
He's ripe for imprisonment!

694
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,495
The wicked bastard!

695
01:13:08,696 --> 01:13:10,858
Death to Hugo!

696
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:14,550
We want a verdict!
A just verdict!

697
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:27,826
In the name of Allah, the Almighty,
and his glorious laws!

698
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:30,261
Don't waste
so much time on him!

699
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:32,962
I hereby open the
trial of this case,

700
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,535
in which the victims and accusers

701
01:13:35,682 --> 01:13:40,415
are the farmers of Khurissan-valley,
and their accused is Hugo, the hippo!

702
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:43,273
As the judge of the court,

703
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:45,806
I ask the prosecutor of the case

704
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:50,530
to introduce himself,
and describe the charges!

705
01:13:54,448 --> 01:13:58,081
My name is well-known,
Aban Khan.

706
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:01,400
I am the Minister of Justice
and Financial Affairs of the

707
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:03,978
glorious Sultan.
I accepted the task

708
01:14:04,076 --> 01:14:06,630
of representing the case of

709
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:09,242
the Khurissan Valley's farmers.

710
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:14,026
I accuse this spawn of the devil, Hugo

711
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:18,582
of being guilty
of the following crimes:

712
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,749
First, in an unlawful manner
he entered the property

713
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:27,410
of the farmers on numerous occasions,

714
01:14:27,469 --> 01:14:30,650
and caused significant damage there!

715
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:34,853
Secondly,
the aforementioned river-horse

716
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:36,807
stole crops from the lands

717
01:14:36,945 --> 01:14:40,578
without permission and payment!

718
01:14:40,996 --> 01:14:43,745
Thirdly, the accused Hugo

719
01:14:43,883 --> 01:14:46,888
entered the school
of Khurissan Valley,

720
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:51,969
and disturbed the teaching with
his sudden appearance!

721
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:53,963
And finally:

722
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,911
this wretched Hugo

723
01:14:58,019 --> 01:15:00,847
is a disgusting, stinking river-horse,

724
01:15:00,965 --> 01:15:04,883
who doesn't even deserve to be
dealt with by this court!

725
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,807
That's right! Down with him!

726
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:09,537
Aban said it right!

727
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:13,976
- Impale him!
- Cursed Hugo!

728
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:16,942
Hugo, the hippo

729
01:15:17,482 --> 01:15:20,330
is a natural-born criminal,

730
01:15:20,507 --> 01:15:23,354
and a public enemy of the worst kind,

731
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:26,507
who deserves the death sentence!

732
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:32,022
For the sake of setting an example,

733
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:36,043
I'm calling for the execution of the accused!

734
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,275
Followed by his dismemberment
and to share

735
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:44,105
his meat among the Khurissan
Valley farmers as compensation!

736
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:46,079
Down with Hugo!

737
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:48,887
- Cut off his head!
- Cook him! Bake him!

738
01:15:49,025 --> 01:15:50,714
- Smoke him!
- Eat him!

739
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:54,298
He should be hanged!

740
01:15:55,732 --> 01:15:59,031
Give him a public execution!

741
01:15:59,836 --> 01:16:03,410
And, err... what can the accused
say in his own defence

742
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:05,728
in relation to the said accusations?

743
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:09,386
Hugo, the hippo pleads not guilty!

744
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,745
- Who is the bold one? - Where is he?
- He must be silenced!

745
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:16,790
Who's that?
Who dares to defend Hugo?

746
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,408
- An enemy among us?
- What's going on?

747
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,609
- This child is crazy!
- This is madness!

748
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:28,471
Listen to Hugo's first witness,

749
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:31,084
our wise and great ruler,

750
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,087
the glorious Sultan Mahdji!

751
01:16:47,658 --> 01:16:52,235
The presence of Your Majesty
is a great honour to us all.

752
01:16:53,164 --> 01:16:55,855
We're ready to listen to you,
if that is your wish.

753
01:16:56,169 --> 01:16:59,743
I didn't come here to argue about
law and justice!

754
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:03,394
But to see the triumph of the truth!

755
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:07,381
And I will do everything I can
to help it triumph!

756
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,904
I admit, I played a part in the events
that led to

757
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:19,850
Hugo standing in front
of the court today.

758
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,534
It was me, who sent an expedition

759
01:17:22,632 --> 01:17:25,401
to bring 12 river-horses to
the Hummingbird Islands.

760
01:17:25,499 --> 01:17:29,211
Thanks to these brave animals,
we rid ourselves of the sharks,

761
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:32,540
and we become more prosperous
than ever.

762
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:37,264
But did we return them to
their homeland after that? No.

763
01:17:37,735 --> 01:17:40,563
Everything seemed more important
to us that that!

764
01:17:40,652 --> 01:17:45,365
And our ingratitude went so far that
we even forgot about them completely!

765
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:50,069
And what's even worse, we tolerated

766
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:53,761
that they would fall into
a terrible cruelty,

767
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:56,830
led by the very same person,

768
01:17:57,007 --> 01:18:00,640
who is asking
for Hugo's death today!

769
01:18:02,295 --> 01:18:05,535
I'll catch you, sooner or later!

770
01:18:06,341 --> 01:18:08,855
- Down with the evil minister!
- That's right!

771
01:18:09,401 --> 01:18:10,736
Down with him!

772
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:13,342
Hugo would certainly
have perished as well,

773
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:16,288
if the children hadn't have
taken care of him,

774
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:18,704
making him a garden.

775
01:18:19,597 --> 01:18:23,443
They were the only ones, who treated
Hugo like a living-feeling creature!

776
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:31,079
So, if you feel Aban Khan was right,
when he massacred the hippos,

777
01:18:31,187 --> 01:18:34,349
and you also want to kill everything
that causes you trouble,

778
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:37,649
then by all means, spare him not,
but kill him!

779
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,966
But that much I can tell you,

780
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:44,704
we must protect the world we're living in,
and we should take care of our friends,

781
01:18:44,842 --> 01:18:48,220
or else we could one day share
the same fate as the hippos'!

782
01:18:49,389 --> 01:18:51,667
And does anyone in their right mind
want that?

783
01:18:51,863 --> 01:18:53,356
No!

784
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:56,267
Justice must be served,

785
01:18:56,425 --> 01:18:58,644
not just for Hugo, the hippo,

786
01:18:58,997 --> 01:19:01,609
but to every living creature,

787
01:19:01,727 --> 01:19:03,770
be it big or small!

788
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,393
Hugo is innocent!

789
01:19:11,511 --> 01:19:13,573
Put Aban Khan in his place!

790
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,797
I have listened to the accusations
and the defence,

791
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:24,823
and now I'll make of all that
the subject of consideration.

792
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:41,602
The Court finds the accused
guilty as charged!

793
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:45,795
- Hugo couldn't have done anything else!
- Silence or I'll have the court evacuated!

794
01:19:45,952 --> 01:19:48,388
The Court cannot tolerate seeing

795
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:50,416
the lands of diligent farmers

796
01:19:50,573 --> 01:19:53,578
being ravaged and plundered!

797
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:57,074
Hugo, the hippo is guilty!

798
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:01,483
I won! Hurrah! Hurrah!

799
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:05,308
The crops must be replanted!

800
01:20:06,157 --> 01:20:07,944
The court declares,

801
01:20:08,082 --> 01:20:10,321
that the children of Khurissan Valley

802
01:20:10,497 --> 01:20:15,368
are to fix and replant their garden!

803
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:20,909
The same garden, where they are
to feed and play with Hugo

804
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:23,305
every day, from now on!

805
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,545
- Wise verdict!
- That's it! - Father!

806
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:36,039
The judgement has been announced!

807
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:38,951
Let Hugo, the hippo

808
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:42,191
belong to his only true friends,

809
01:20:42,446 --> 01:20:43,978
the children!

810
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:46,384
- Hurrah! Hurrah!
- But... but wise Sir!

811
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:49,311
There must be some mistake,
this could only be a joke!

812
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:52,237
After all they are just children,
and this river-horse...

813
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:55,206
and I am the Minister of Justice

814
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:57,701
of His Majesty! Gold! Gold!

815
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:01,511
This is precious gold!
Put it on your head! Gold!

816
01:21:01,614 --> 01:21:03,480
How shiny! And it suits you well!

817
01:21:03,578 --> 01:21:06,229
These rotten eggs suit YOU well!

818
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:12,718
There!

819
01:21:13,774 --> 01:21:15,050
Take that!

820
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:19,543
Take that!

821
01:21:21,134 --> 01:21:24,158
This is how it happened, my friends.

822
01:21:24,517 --> 01:21:26,225
Or almost like that.

823
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:30,821
Hugo really exists and is
still alive and happy in his garden.

824
01:21:31,371 --> 01:21:34,578
If one day you'll come to see him,
you'll see him bathing in the water.

825
01:21:35,069 --> 01:21:38,820
And the children still taking care
of him with everything he needs.

826
01:21:39,253 --> 01:21:44,005
He's almost forgotten all the troubles
and pains he's been through.

827
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:47,781
And he feels good
living among people.

828
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:05,092
<i>From now all of us...</i>

829
01:22:05,347 --> 01:22:08,415
<i>we will be together!</i>

830
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:10,320
<i>The Sun and blue sky...</i>

831
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:13,979
<i>will smile down on us!!</i>

832
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:19,242
<i>Whatever happens, don't worry,
As long as we're around!</i>

833
01:22:19,657 --> 01:22:22,874
<i>Life's promise waits for us</i>

834
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,782
<i>Not prison walls or the locks of a cage!</i>

835
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:30,527
<i>Even if the Devil</i>

836
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,336
<i>Himself would come for us</i>

837
01:22:33,796 --> 01:22:36,306
<i>He'd not stand a chance</i>

838
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:39,095
<i>Against our valiant band</i>

839
01:22:39,423 --> 01:22:43,788
<i>And this is Hugo for us
Not an illusion</i>

840
01:22:43,906 --> 01:22:47,220
<i>Whom we've accepted into our heart!</i>

841
01:22:47,617 --> 01:22:53,155
<i>He need never steal again!</i>

842
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:08,918
<i>- Nothing like you
- Had we ever, my dear!</i>

843
01:23:09,055 --> 01:23:14,496
<i>- Oh how wonderful
- Living, we with you!</i>

844
01:23:14,585 --> 01:23:19,790
<i>There'll be gingerbread
And cakes with cream and marzipan!</i>

845
01:23:20,163 --> 01:23:26,566
<i>Ripe bananas on the trees
And raspberries to, my dear friend!</i>

846
01:23:28,648 --> 01:23:33,833
<i>- We will score a goal
- And chase the butterflies!</i>

847
01:23:34,392 --> 01:23:39,518
<i>- And make paper-ships
- To float upon the sea!</i>

848
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:45,558
<i>So, all your troubles, Hugo, are gone
So sing along with us</i>

849
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:50,767
<i>- What is the rule?
- The world calls for you!</i>

850
01:23:51,337 --> 01:23:53,644
<i>Summer follows the spring!</i>

851
01:23:53,703 --> 01:24:00,577
<i>And we'll not leave you behind!</i>

852
01:24:32,783 --> 01:24:38,518
<i>He walks like an elephant
Yet swims like a whale</i>

853
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:45,068
<i>He won't ever win a beauty contest
His features are fairly mixed up!</i>

854
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:48,490
<i>He's a pot-bellied fatso</i>

855
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,613
<i>Yet he's still charming and cute</i>
