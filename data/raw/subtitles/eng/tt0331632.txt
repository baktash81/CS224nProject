00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:18,363
<i>Here we are, folks,</i>
<i>on the red carpet at the grand opening...</i>

2
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,569
<i>... of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.</i>

3
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,611
<i>Tonight's premiere exhibit</i>
<i>is a rousing look back...</i>

4
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:26,367
<i>... at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.</i>

5
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,088
<i>And here they are.</i>

6
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:38,204
Folks, this crowd is going crazy
over Mystery Inc.

7
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,681
Here you go, girls.

8
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,284
I got an ascot for each of you.

9
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,287
Hello!

10
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:52,443
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake
and the whole city's shaking!

11
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:53,602
Yeah!

12
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,852
Come on, Scoob.

13
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,088
Sorry.

14
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,847
I consider it a privilege, sir.

15
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,523
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.

16
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:12,890
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

17
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:18,606
Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed
on our chests! Look!

18
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,009
That's very sweet.

19
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:24,405
Velma! Velma!

20
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:33,610
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.

21
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:34,888
Thanks.

22
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:38,125
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...

23
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,012
...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.

24
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,641
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.

25
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,008
Heather Jasper-Howe
at the grand opening...

26
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,482
...of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...

27
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:52,487
...with our guests of honor, the master
detectives of Mystery Incorporated.

28
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,852
Shaggy!

29
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:59,928
Right on!

30
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,129
Hello! Hello!

31
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:16,365
With all your success, will you still
have time for us in little old Coolsville?

32
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,969
Of course little old Coolsville
can solve its problems without us...

33
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,283
...but we'll always be here to help.

34
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,286
The people of Coolsville
are the best in the world!

35
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:36,288
- Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
- Absolutely.

36
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:41,163
Mystery Inc. Is proud to donate the
costumes of criminals we've unmasked.

37
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:45,406
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.

38
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,803
The 10,000 Volt Ghost.

39
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:53,450
The Skeleton Men,
and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.

40
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,366
We've also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes.

41
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,852
Like Chickenstein.

42
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,447
Can we get a shot of you
next to The Black Night?

43
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:07,208
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot
that dude tried to pluck us.

44
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,809
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?

45
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,850
No, but that's good too.

46
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,925
- Image is everything.
- Yes! Lmage is everything.

47
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:19,449
The whole city's watching,
so try and keep a brave face.

48
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:23,451
- They're costumes.
- Right.

49
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:30,083
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.

50
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:37,723
The Tar Monster scared the locals
of Byzantius away to take their treasure.

51
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:42,245
But on the positive side,
he'd pave your driveway for free.

52
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,451
Isn't that right, Velma?

53
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:46,888
Velma?

54
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,052
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:19,647
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.

56
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,488
He's the curator here at the museum.

57
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:25,484
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.

58
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,805
I hope you'll be working closely with
Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.

59
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:34,604
I know that you're a glamorous,
mysterious, jet-set adventurer...

60
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,492
...preoccupied with
international intrigue and all...

61
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:41,566
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but...

62
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:46,964
There's a symposium coming up on
syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain...

63
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:50,246
I have always found
a criminal's inclination...

64
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:54,850
...to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative...

65
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,526
...delightfully absurd.

66
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,252
- Me too!
- Really?

67
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,643
So maybe you'd want to go together?

68
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,650
Suppose you mean like...

69
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,966
Like a...

70
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,882
Like a date. With me.

71
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,804
No, I can't, Patrick.

72
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:19,089
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.

73
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:20,767
Okay.

74
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,570
What's happening?

75
00:07:58,453 --> 00:07:59,681
Oh, boy.

76
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,092
Daphne!

77
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:06,562
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!

78
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,612
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Hiding is our plan.

79
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:21,567
In case you haven't noticed, there's
an unidentified freaky object in here!

80
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,408
- The curtains!
- We're on them!

81
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:31,092
- Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!

82
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:36,652
- We got him!
- Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!

83
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,925
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!

84
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,648
It's just a costume!

85
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,051
We tied it! Let go!

86
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,242
Sorry!

87
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:06,007
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!

88
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,451
Fire!

89
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,529
Mystery Incorporated.

90
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:33,607
This is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise.

91
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,842
Look out!

92
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:46,411
And this time,
you'll be the ones unmasked...

93
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:49,890
...as the buffoons you truly are!

94
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,806
Any clues to the cause of the attack? How
did the dinosaur get through security?

95
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,009
Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?

96
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,644
A secret hatch!

97
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:22,643
The real Pterodactyl Ghost
must have come through here!

98
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:31,243
A reptilian scale.

99
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:34,127
A most wonderful clue.

100
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:38,923
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?

101
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:42,324
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer
a few questions for the press?

102
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,405
Fred, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

103
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:50,043
We always face the press
after we've unmasked the creeps.

104
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,044
We looked ridiculous back there.

105
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,808
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.

106
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:05,972
<i>The higher the pedestal,</i>
<i>the harder the fall.</i>

107
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,921
<i>And Mystery Inc. Fell far</i>
<i>in the embarrassing debacle...</i>

108
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,812
<i>... that tarnished the reputation</i>
<i>of the once-great gang.</i>

109
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,682
<i>It was an utter disaster</i>
<i>as two of the gang's key members...</i>

110
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,686
<i>... Norville "Shaggy" Rogers</i>
<i>and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...</i>

111
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:23,562
<i>... caused untold damage to Coolsville's</i>
<i>hottest new tourist attraction...</i>

112
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,327
<i>... which took a full two years to complete.</i>

113
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:30,771
<i>When asked for comment, Fred Jones,</i>
<i>leader of Mystery Inc., said this:</i>

114
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,493
<i>Coolsville can solve its</i>
<i>problems without us.</i>

115
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,008
I didn't say that! I mean...

116
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,562
I did, but that's out of context!

117
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:42,282
<i>This is Heather Jasper-Howe,</i>
<i>disillusioned from Coolsville.</i>

118
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,724
It's all my fault.

119
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,571
I'm the one who told Shaggy
and Scooby to get the ropes.

120
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,964
No, Velma, it's my fault.

121
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,249
I should have checked
that they were tied before I let go.

122
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,085
It's my fault too.

123
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,483
We all know how Shaggy
and Scooby can be.

124
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:01,928
But it's all right.

125
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:05,688
We just need to stay strong,
in control, and work fast.

126
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:08,048
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.

127
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,364
We'll figure a way out
of this Jurassic jumble.

128
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,161
Shaggy?

129
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,562
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.

130
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,726
I guess, looking back, every time they
made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.

131
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,009
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.

132
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:30,291
There's gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang.

133
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:33,810
We've gotta do something
totally unlike us.

134
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,725
You know, Scoob...

135
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,727
...we could act like real detectives!

136
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:42,602
Really?

137
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:49,329
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.

138
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:54,123
Repeat after me. From this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves.

139
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,805
We will be awesome detectives.

140
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:02,170
And we will act more like Fred
and Velma and Daphne.

141
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,451
We will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular...

142
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:10,765
...and cease to be <i>"</i>loser-iffic,<i>"</i>
<i>"</i>lame-tastic<i>"</i> and <i>"</i>suck-tacular. <i>"</i>

143
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:13,490
Suck-tacular.

144
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:18,291
Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.

145
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,843
Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!

146
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,365
What the heck are you guys doing?

147
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,967
We figured the first step
in solving a mystery...

148
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:29,647
...would be to wear the right attire.

149
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,930
I'm sorry, Daph,
but your go-go boots didn't fit...

150
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,132
...me!

151
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:41,123
Scooby! Those so don't go
with that sweater!

152
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,408
Really?

153
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,166
Clues!

154
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,245
Alas, what are these strange markings?

155
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:55,848
Words.

156
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:58,972
Words!

157
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,812
Scooby-Doo, take notes.

158
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,407
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.

159
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,202
Okay.

160
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,849
It's come back positive.

161
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,208
This is a real pterodactyl scale.

162
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,362
Precisely!

163
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,728
That masked figure
was out to humiliate us.

164
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:18,002
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.

165
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:22,086
But who would be able to make
a real Pterodactyl Ghost?

166
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,403
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

167
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,052
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.

168
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,487
That's right!

169
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,572
<i>Jacobo wreaked havoc</i>
<i>in a statewide crime spree.</i>

170
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,367
<i>Jacobo stole millions...</i>

171
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:44,845
<i>... which he used to finance his failed</i>
<i>experiments trying to create monsters.</i>

172
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:47,766
Come alive! Come alive!

173
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,203
<i>You think Jacobo 's behind this?</i>

174
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:04,042
<i>Impossible. Three years ago</i>
<i>he attempted a prison escape.</i>

175
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,363
So long, suckers!

176
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,649
Help me, suckers!

177
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,488
His body was lost at sea.

178
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:29,931
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate
was released from prison two months ago.

179
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,572
Jeremiah Wickles.

180
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:35,567
The Black Knight Ghost. That was
one of the costumes that was stolen.

181
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,451
Right! And...

182
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,642
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?

183
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,647
Bunny.

184
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,444
<i>It seems Old Man Wickles</i>
<i>deserves a visit...</i>

185
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,125
<i>... before any of our other creepy</i>
<i>conquests make a comeback.</i>

186
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,726
Freddy, up on the right.

187
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,453
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.

188
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:08,250
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!

189
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:12,129
How come we can't ever investigate,
like, a KFC or something?

190
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:13,282
Shaggy!

191
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,971
All right. Then again,
creepy is my middle name.

192
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,202
Scoob!

193
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,092
Come on, Scoob!

194
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,642
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.

195
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,364
Nice job last night. Losers!

196
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,408
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.

197
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:40,801
What dorks.

198
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,043
Hey! Shut up!

199
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:46,451
That's a good one.

200
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:50,251
<i>You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.</i>

201
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:54,247
- <i>Leave now or pay the price.</i>
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?

202
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:55,682
Dude.

203
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,844
He just said we'd pay the price.

204
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,685
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.

205
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,289
What could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell?

206
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,972
Help me!

207
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,492
Shaggy!

208
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,285
I think I pulled something.

209
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,089
That's what can happen
by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!

210
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,166
<i>At 7 p.m., the owner</i>
<i>will be home to set you free.</i>

211
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,804
You want to buy a box of cookies?

212
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,842
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?

213
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,208
Yeah. There's cookies!

214
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:49,812
Watch the junk!

215
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,042
Sorry.

216
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:55,570
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.

217
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,122
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?

218
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:02,286
You know what, Velma? It's never too late
to learn to properly apply makeup.

219
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:05,650
Okay. The last good thumbprint
should still be there, so...

220
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,565
...a little blush...

221
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,168
...a pore strip...

222
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,126
...and voilà.

223
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:15,688
All right, Daph!

224
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,804
I enjoy being a girl.

225
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,846
- Thank you!
- See if I can get my mechanic's job back.

226
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,163
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.

227
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:31,406
...50... Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80...

228
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:36,572
Okay, gang. Let's, like,
split up and search for clues.

229
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,452
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.

230
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,322
He stole my thing that I say!

231
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:57,490
Search for clues. Search for clues.

232
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:03,524
A clue!

233
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,324
Shiny footprints.

234
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,528
The glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale.

235
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,086
A clue!

236
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:33,689
It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's
fascination with the supernatural.

237
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:37,842
He collects everything
from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.

238
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,089
He collects dust too.

239
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:43,768
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.

240
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:46,601
Like here!

241
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:48,247
What is it?

242
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:53,523
It's an obsolete Celtic text used by
secret societies in the mid-19th century.

243
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,812
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.

244
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,210
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

245
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,092
Maybe he gave it to Wickles
before he died.

246
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,126
Can you read it?

247
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,563
It's an amalgamation
of magic and science.

248
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,291
Here's a list of ingredients...

249
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,648
...on how to create
your own carbon-based...

250
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:34,804
...organic, composite predators.

251
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:39,046
This is an instruction manual
on how to create monsters.

252
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,848
Scoob.

253
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,606
Clues!

254
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:51,883
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.

255
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,613
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?

256
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,928
Just because you can sing in it doesn't
make it a clue. It makes it awesome.

257
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,402
Like, what's this?

258
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,530
<i>"</i>The Faux Ghost. <i>"</i>

259
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,089
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!

260
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,770
- We are detectives.
- Really?

261
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,322
You found an actual clue!

262
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,971
I found a clue!

263
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,529
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!

264
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,888
We're going back, we're going back!

265
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,570
Black Knight Ghost!

266
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,452
Run, Shaggy!

267
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:57,642
Let's go.

268
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,244
Like, lock the door!

269
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,292
Heavy stuff, Scoob!

270
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,445
Give me a hand, Scoob!

271
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,843
See him get through this!

272
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:14,408
Heavy!

273
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:17,763
We outsmarted that moron!

274
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,163
Yeah! What a moron.

275
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,492
Look at me.

276
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,493
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

277
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,730
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?

278
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,482
Bring it.

279
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:43,411
He brought it.

280
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,925
Daphne! Hold him off!

281
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:52,526
I'll look in the book.

282
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:55,526
Maybe there's a formula
for finding his weakness.

283
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,606
Here. <i>"</i>To find a creature's
weakest point...

284
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:08,369
...take the angle between
the current position of the sun...

285
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,682
...and your geographical point...<i>"</i>
- Velma!

286
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,450
<i>"</i>Add this point, 28 and a half feet up
from sea level. <i>"</i>

287
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,932
That tickles.

288
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,526
This is bad.

289
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,604
<i>"</i>Multiply this number...<i>"</i>

290
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:25,531
<i>"</i>Add the square inches of...<i>"</i>

291
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:29,962
Velma!

292
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:37,246
<i>"</i>... the square root... <i>"</i>

293
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,163
Now it's good night, ladies!

294
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:48,528
<i>"</i>... your X-axis. <i>"</i>

295
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:12,368
<i>"</i>And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis. <i>"</i>

296
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,410
Look. No hands!

297
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:16,325
Any time would be great, Velma!

298
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:17,528
I'm trying.

299
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:21,766
<i>"</i>Subtract one, divide by B,
follow upward eight degrees north. <i>"</i>

300
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:24,049
Which makes his weakest point right here!

301
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:30,322
Right in the roundtables.

302
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,562
Run!

303
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,963
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

304
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,203
Come on, Scoob! Inside!

305
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:43,083
I'll compare the glow of those footprints
to the pterodactyl scale.

306
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:45,164
We'll check out Wickles' book.

307
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:49,121
Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome
clue. But what do we do with it?

308
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:51,045
Let's solve the mystery.

309
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,409
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...

310
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,326
...it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong.

311
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,325
Let's head to The Faux Ghost...

312
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,563
...find Wickles, and see what he knows.

313
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,521
But first, let's give the gang
the old <i>"</i>slipperooney. <i>"</i>

314
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:14,925
Hey, guys.

315
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,323
Scooby's feeling kind of...

316
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:20,168
...like he's got rabies.

317
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,728
We're just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air.

318
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,687
Jinkies!

319
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:48,211
What's up, Velms?

320
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:50,648
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.

321
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:53,611
It contains randamonium,
which this books says...

322
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,446
...is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters.

323
00:25:56,613 --> 00:26:00,049
Doesn't randamonium glow,
like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?

324
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:04,047
If we prove Wickles is behind this,
this mystery goes down like a dot-com...

325
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,886
...and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?

326
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:10,125
Randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines.

327
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:13,171
Like the abandoned mining town
in old Coolsville.

328
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,484
Then we better get to that mining town
and see what's...

329
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,443
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.

330
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:24,008
Get rid of him!

331
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:26,525
Keep him busy.

332
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:32,331
What are you doing?

333
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,604
He wants to ask me on a date.

334
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,365
It's okay to be scared.

335
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:40,048
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.

336
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:44,491
But in the end, we usually unmask them
and it's a little scared man inside.

337
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,530
It's the same with dating.

338
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:51,367
Velma, have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts...

339
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:55,242
...are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you?

340
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,131
Intimacy with another person.

341
00:26:57,293 --> 00:27:00,444
And by intimacy, I mean someone
who thinks you're really hot.

342
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:06,092
But I'm more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts.

343
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:09,084
And...

344
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:13,722
...I'm not hot.

345
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:17,771
Me neither.

346
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:21,562
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...

347
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,611
...is to never let the other person
know they're there.

348
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,090
- To museums.
- To museums.

349
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,332
Daph, I really like this guy.

350
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,529
What would you do if someone thought...

351
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,892
...that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jet-setter?

352
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:42,366
I'd make myself one.

353
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,284
Who's your mommy?

354
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:00,208
My mommy?

355
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,762
Come on, let's solve a mystery.

356
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,726
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.

357
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,247
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.

358
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,402
Here we go.

359
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,810
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.

360
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,929
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.

361
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,449
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.

362
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:07,128
And that's Aggie Wilkins,
a.k.a. The Ozark Witch.

363
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,644
These are all folks we unmasked.

364
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,691
If they spot us,
they'll invite us to a weenie roast.

365
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,048
One where we're the weenies!

366
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,286
Hot dogs!

367
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:21,366
There's gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome, fearless new skills...

368
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,650
...to get us in there
without being recognized.

369
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,768
Everyone part like the Red Sea.

370
00:29:55,933 --> 00:30:00,404
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy,
and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.

371
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:03,883
We are in the house and ready to party.

372
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:05,922
Hey, handsome.

373
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,890
Hello, baby.

374
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:11,806
- <i>Zoinks!</i>
- <i>Jinkies!</i>

375
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:13,486
- <i>Hey, gang.</i>
- <i>Jinkies!</i>

376
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:14,847
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>Yipe!</i>

377
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:22,890
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a Cotton Candy Glob!

378
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,089
Watch out, idiot.

379
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,891
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.

380
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:35,562
No!

381
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:40,368
I just wanted to say thank you.

382
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:45,847
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me.

383
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:51,412
Have you done anything cool
and creepy lately?

384
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:55,683
Listen, I'm not normally one
for giving advice...

385
00:30:55,853 --> 00:31:00,165
...but I feel sorry for you because
of your brother's hideous nose deformity.

386
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,652
Get out of this game
while you got a chance.

387
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:08,963
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.

388
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,045
We needed people to believe
we were different than we were.

389
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,965
Maybe because we believed...

390
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,648
...that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place.

391
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:23,124
I guess you're sort of grateful
to Mystery Inc...

392
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:27,045
...for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?

393
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,482
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.

394
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:37,571
Make them eat the one eye while watching
themselves eat it with the other eye!

395
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:41,682
Bye.

396
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:47,883
Here's a clue for you.
That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.

397
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:51,728
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.

398
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,087
Gotcha.

399
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,687
Hey, doll.

400
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:57,125
You wanna dance?

401
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:58,442
Groovy.

402
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,765
Here we go.

403
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,450
Shake it, baby.

404
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:17,686
Give me five!

405
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,086
Oh, yeah!

406
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:44,806
Everybody!

407
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:01,772
Oh, yeah.

408
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:03,642
Hey, Shaggy!

409
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:26,729
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail!

410
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:28,928
Who, me?

411
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:34,213
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!

412
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:37,809
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.

413
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:48,089
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.

414
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:50,289
- Where?
- There.

415
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,088
Zoinks! Gangway!

416
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:58,128
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!

417
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,565
And stay out!

418
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:12,611
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.

419
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,168
That was my outfit, I swear.

420
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:42,409
You know, Velma,
you are as beautiful as ever.

421
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:46,207
You're just so different than I expected.

422
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,451
You know, I'm just...

423
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:58,407
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?

424
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:00,529
This cannot be good.

425
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,052
My museum.

426
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,170
Wait!

427
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,405
Any comments on the museum robbery?

428
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:14,406
Mystery Inc. Is investigating
the two stolen costumes.

429
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,404
No, the one that just happened.

430
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:20,691
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?

431
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,208
The rest of the costumes?

432
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:36,763
So, what you're saying is
it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.

433
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:41,290
No! You're doing that thing again where
you take everything I say out of context.

434
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:44,490
You're trying to make it look
like I think Coolsville sucks.

435
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:45,881
No! Don't record that!

436
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:58,729
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.

437
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:00,690
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?

438
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,009
- I'll go with you...
- No! Just...

439
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:07,045
No, I have to figure out what's going on.

440
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:32,324
<i>All Fred Jones had to say was:</i>

441
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:33,892
<i>I think Coolsville sucks!</i>

442
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,487
<i>In light of the city's recent chaos...</i>

443
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:40,362
<i>... Jones ' response was disheartening</i>
<i>to the fans who have supported them.</i>

444
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,969
<i>Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving</i>
<i>gang to shape up or ship out.</i>

445
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,122
I'll be right back.

446
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:49,366
This is Heather Jasper-Howe
for Investigative Probe Reporting.

447
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,728
What's with the personal attacks?

448
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:54,726
Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor...

449
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,087
Who are you kidding?

450
00:36:58,373 --> 00:36:59,886
Who are you kidding?

451
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,123
Don't think I don't know your game.

452
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,486
What do you do for the gang?

453
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,241
Really?

454
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,201
Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.

455
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:13,092
All you are is a pretty little face.

456
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:14,606
Why are you doing this?

457
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:19,051
Because it's my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who they're not.

458
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:23,452
<i>"</i>Unmask those<i>"</i>? You sound like...

459
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,811
Sound like who?

460
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:29,564
The evil masked guy.

461
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:33,328
But you know that, because
just as you know I'm standing here...

462
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:35,529
...you know I know
who you know you are...

463
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,684
...which is him, who's a her,
which is you.

464
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:40,529
Now I see what you do for the gang.

465
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,809
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.

466
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:46,409
Mystery Incorporated.

467
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:52,281
Once again, you are proven useless
before my power.

468
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:56,332
Because of you, soon Coolsville...

469
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:59,242
...will be mine.

470
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:02,888
Darn it.

471
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:06,290
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.

472
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,045
Can't you do anything right?

473
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,369
Ned, get your camera and follow me.

474
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:11,966
Guess not.

475
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:21,285
Stop wasting my time!

476
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:25,043
You hear me? Now I want you to question
all your scum-bucket friends.

477
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,852
Find out what they know
about those stolen costumes.

478
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,846
Or else you'll be known
as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!

479
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:33,447
I want answers. Now, go! Now!

480
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:34,802
Yes, sir!

481
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:38,207
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

482
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,401
Patrick.

483
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,962
Shaggy. Scooby.

484
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,684
What are you guys doing here?

485
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:53,050
We just came down here
to be undercover and stuff.

486
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:54,802
Me too.

487
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:56,611
My museum got broken into again...

488
00:38:56,773 --> 00:38:59,241
...so I had to come here
and try and get some answers.

489
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:02,769
Gotta put on the tough-guy act,
or these guys will eat me alive.

490
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,409
What's the matter, you don't believe me?

491
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:10,445
I'm kidding!

492
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,972
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.

493
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:20,082
I got you.

494
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:22,448
That was a joke? That was good!

495
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,763
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.

496
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:29,091
It needs work.

497
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:32,126
Look, Patrick...

498
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:37,003
...we could stay here, do this all night,
and something tells me you would...

499
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:41,007
...but we gotta make
like your personality and split.

500
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:42,808
Okay.

501
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:16,686
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!

502
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,692
Hello?

503
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,684
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?

504
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:22,445
Hello, Shaggy.

505
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:25,764
Wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town!

506
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:29,650
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!

507
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,686
Darn bushes yowling at me again.

508
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:46,844
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.

509
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:55,931
Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
Through here, Scoob?

510
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:57,321
I don't know.

511
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,052
Oh, boy.

512
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,492
Run, Scoob! It's a <i>"</i>skelly<i>"</i> thingy!

513
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:37,968
Elevator.

514
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:39,966
Good work, pal!

515
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,490
Like, let's skedaddle.

516
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:51,842
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?

517
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,442
This place seems harmless enough.

518
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:58,322
I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure
could've gotten his randamonium...

519
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,449
...from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.

520
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:03,571
I was just thinking about Patrick.

521
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:05,963
He seemed so upset when he left.

522
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,249
- Right. So...
- And...

523
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:11,645
...he doesn't like me.

524
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,691
Okay. So your assessment is?

525
00:42:15,573 --> 00:42:18,849
- Love stinks.
- Fred?

526
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,964
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?

527
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,162
No.

528
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,372
I mean, yes.

529
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:26,252
I mean, not fat!

530
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:29,530
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?

531
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:32,207
Fat? Why would you even use that word?

532
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:37,008
Never again will they underestimate us.
That's right.

533
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:40,051
I've gathered you here today
for something big.

534
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:41,772
At last.

535
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:44,572
All these years of careful planning...

536
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:48,965
...have culminated
in this one glorious moment.

537
00:42:49,853 --> 00:42:54,085
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed
in your foul monster-making scheme.

538
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,892
With your ugly, evil henchmen.

539
00:42:58,173 --> 00:42:59,401
Henchmen?

540
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:04,082
Young man, we're investors,
and we're listening to his pitch.

541
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:06,205
So as I was saying...

542
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:09,046
...the Old Tyme Mining Town,
a summer camp for kids...

543
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:11,886
...where they can have
an authentic mining experience.

544
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:17,008
They can dig for 18 hours straight,
just like in the golden days of yore.

545
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:20,848
They have the time of their lives,
and we get free miners!

546
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:23,928
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...

547
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:28,211
...your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.

548
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,649
Then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion?

549
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:35,852
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.

550
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,364
Are you continuing the work
of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?

551
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,763
Old pal? Jacobo?

552
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,685
We hated each other.

553
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:46,925
In the prison cafeteria,
he used to steal my Tater Tots!

554
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,163
And he got the lead in <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

555
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,052
Then why did we find the monster book
in your library?

556
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,250
Wait a second. You're the runts
what vandalized my home.

557
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:59,242
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?

558
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:01,212
Gentlemen.

559
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,211
- I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
- What happened? I haven't finished!

560
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:06,772
Wait, fellas!

561
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:11,247
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.

562
00:44:13,173 --> 00:44:15,448
It's like a huge laboratory.

563
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,012
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

564
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:31,125
This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.

565
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:38,451
Refrigerator!

566
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:44,252
Lemonade!

567
00:44:48,893 --> 00:44:52,090
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.

568
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:54,601
Shaggy?

569
00:44:57,493 --> 00:45:01,771
Scooby-Doo,
you turned into a freaky monster.

570
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:05,448
You don't eat stuff that glows.

571
00:45:05,613 --> 00:45:08,685
There's got to be an antidote
in here somewhere.

572
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:11,367
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.

573
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:17,132
Tastes like...

574
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:22,172
Strawberries.

575
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:26,964
I'm okay, Scoob.

576
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:36,683
I've got a chick's body!

577
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:40,248
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!

578
00:45:57,973 --> 00:45:59,884
Check it out, dude!

579
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:02,564
I'm buff.

580
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:04,805
My God.

581
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,728
It seems as if I've become
ludicrously intelligent.

582
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:12,090
It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance
of my former self.

583
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:15,370
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
eating my own vomit.

584
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:18,001
Those were wonderful times.

585
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:20,812
Check out my pecs, little man!

586
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:26,561
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.

587
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:27,722
A what?

588
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,804
I'm going to transform us back!

589
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:31,247
No way, geek!

590
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,410
I'm gonna stay this way forever!

591
00:46:35,933 --> 00:46:37,002
No!

592
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:41,168
Let's go!

593
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:47,246
Careful, gang.

594
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:56,844
This <i>"</i>Schwarzeneggian<i>"</i> oaf
almost destroyed us.

595
00:46:57,973 --> 00:46:59,406
Go boom.

596
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,085
You are embarrassing.

597
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:18,611
That was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college.

598
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:22,004
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.

599
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,686
I invented a potion.

600
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:25,492
You lied to us. We're a team.

601
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:28,565
You don't just go off half-cocked
doing whatever you want.

602
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:29,927
Hey, gang.

603
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:34,369
<i>"</i>Beware who enters the Monster Hive.

604
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:38,124
Inside your fears will come alive. <i>"</i>

605
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:48,006
Oh, my.

606
00:47:48,373 --> 00:47:51,490
Look! It's the costumes
from the museum!

607
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:54,292
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.

608
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:57,490
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.

609
00:47:57,693 --> 00:48:02,323
He must have used the costumes
to make real monsters, which implies...

610
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:05,690
He needs the costumes to make
the monsters, which implies...

611
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:10,927
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost
costume somehow, which implies...

612
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:16,168
Patrick's the one.

613
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,766
Velma's in love.

614
00:48:17,973 --> 00:48:20,328
No, I mean the one.

615
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:22,282
The bad guy.

616
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:26,012
That's why he wanted to go out with me.

617
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:29,325
To see what we knew.

618
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:32,166
We just saw Patrick
at the bad guys' hangout.

619
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:35,405
He was working both sides
of Psycho Street.

620
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:38,087
I don't know who's behind this,
but we don't need him...

621
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:39,527
...transforming more costumes.

622
00:48:39,693 --> 00:48:42,605
Let's find a way to shut down
this monster-maker for good.

623
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:45,003
Guys? What's over here?

624
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,243
This light is strange.

625
00:48:48,173 --> 00:48:49,162
Scooby-Doo.

626
00:48:49,613 --> 00:48:53,162
We're the ones that found this place.
Score one for the big guys!

627
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:57,652
Now we need to keep acting
like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.

628
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:10,922
Like, wowee.

629
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:21,282
Cool! Like, <i>"</i>tuneage. <i>"</i>

630
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:48,843
Like, what's that weird sound?

631
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:53,126
Captain Cutler!

632
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:55,246
Miner 49er!

633
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,924
The Tar Monster!

634
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:00,042
We have...

635
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:02,450
...to remain...

636
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,082
...calm.

637
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:07,282
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!

638
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:11,411
I needed that.
I needed that too.

639
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,643
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!

640
00:50:19,613 --> 00:50:21,763
You girls find anything?

641
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:25,963
- He did it.
- Scoob!

642
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,523
Fred, disconnect that control panel!

643
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,923
Maybe it'll stop the machine!

644
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:02,723
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!

645
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,530
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!

646
00:51:09,973 --> 00:51:11,042
We're gonna die!

647
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:13,488
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!

648
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:15,924
Wait for me!

649
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:33,522
Come on, girls!

650
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:39,091
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!

651
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:51,731
Stop them!

652
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:57,367
Destroy the city if you have to,
but get me that control panel!

653
00:51:57,533 --> 00:52:02,084
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.

654
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,813
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.

655
00:52:04,973 --> 00:52:07,771
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!

656
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:10,762
Die!

657
00:52:16,853 --> 00:52:18,571
Let's book, Scoob.

658
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:25,168
Oh, boy.

659
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:28,566
Let's rip it, Scoob!

660
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,407
Zoinks!

661
00:52:45,973 --> 00:52:47,201
I don't know.

662
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,241
Banzai!

663
00:52:52,373 --> 00:52:53,931
We're getting rad!

664
00:52:54,573 --> 00:52:57,485
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!

665
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:28,242
Hello.

666
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:41,362
Scooby!

667
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:52,202
Are you guys okay?

668
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:57,369
Sure. As long as you define <i>"</i>okay<i>"</i>
as <i>"</i>in massive agony. <i>"</i>

669
00:53:58,893 --> 00:54:00,690
We should get back to headquarters.

670
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:03,413
No! That'll be the first place
they'll look for us.

671
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,052
I think I know where to go.

672
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:09,447
Move that worthless piece of tin!

673
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:13,322
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!

674
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:28,242
Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.

675
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:32,884
Your reward: We'll let you live.

676
00:54:35,453 --> 00:54:39,924
My monsters can make life
very unpleasant.

677
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:54,728
Find me Mystery Inc., now.

678
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:59,252
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency
update for Investigative Probe.

679
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:01,927
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.

680
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:05,802
<i>Angry citizens have gathered</i>
<i>outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.</i>

681
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:09,761
<i>They're insisting the gang cooperate</i>
<i>with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.</i>

682
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:12,049
<i>Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!</i>

683
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:18,930
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

684
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:28,890
<i>I beg you, Mystery Inc.</i>

685
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:32,363
<i>If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.</i>

686
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:36,811
If we do, he'll get the control panel back,
and the city will be in worse shape.

687
00:55:36,973 --> 00:55:39,692
We'd be playing right into his hands.

688
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:42,811
Please. For our city's sake.

689
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:52,371
<i>Sorry. You're cancelled.</i>

690
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:21,411
The old high-school clubhouse.

691
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:25,731
We should be safe here.

692
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:28,407
We haven't been here in years.

693
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,851
Freddy, are you okay?

694
00:56:39,653 --> 00:56:42,963
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.

695
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:49,651
It's time for action.

696
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:53,572
You know, Scoob...

697
00:56:53,733 --> 00:56:58,124
...this Evil Masked Figure
is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.

698
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,206
And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.

699
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:06,807
Like, this is the most <i>"</i>our-faultiest<i>"</i>
screwup ever, Scoob.

700
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:12,571
Still works.

701
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:16,726
Look, all my old tools.

702
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:21,725
After all our so-called success...

703
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:23,963
...we're back in this old firetrap.

704
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:40,849
Hit me, Fred.

705
00:57:48,653 --> 00:57:49,847
Good throw, Velm!

706
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:52,402
- Mine.
- Gotcha!

707
00:57:57,013 --> 00:57:58,446
Throw it to me!

708
00:57:58,613 --> 00:58:00,126
- Go long!
- Okay.

709
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:03,126
Go, Scooby-Doo!

710
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,366
Dude!

711
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:12,802
It all seemed so easy back then.

712
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:20,084
We solved mysteries for the love of them,
not to prove anything to anyone.

713
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:25,730
And the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves.

714
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:29,568
Sometimes, the answers
would just appear like magic.

715
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:34,411
My first multiple-resonance
imaging device.

716
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:38,327
Made out of a crystal radio
and old video games.

717
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:41,612
Wait a minute.

718
00:58:42,093 --> 00:58:46,689
Randamonium has an algorithmic
cross-currency of negative 4. 121.

719
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:49,283
With it, maybe...
Well, just maybe...

720
00:58:49,453 --> 00:58:53,241
We could reverse the current
and reverse the monster-making process!

721
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:55,722
All we need to do
is rewire the control panel...

722
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:58,885
Bring it back to the Monster Hive
and plug it into the base.

723
00:58:59,053 --> 00:59:01,806
- Push the button...
- And instead of creating monsters...

724
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:03,964
...all the monsters will be destroyed.

725
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:38,648
Like, they're totally having
a montage in there without us.

726
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:44,450
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.

727
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:46,251
We're screwups.

728
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:48,131
The only time we do anything right...

729
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,932
...is when we accidentally plow
into the Snow Ghost...

730
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:55,530
...because we've accidentally glued our
feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.

731
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,085
Eight stupid times.

732
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:00,966
Face it, Scoob.

733
01:00:01,133 --> 01:00:04,330
We'll never be anything
but our old goofy selves.

734
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:07,044
I wish once...

735
01:00:07,213 --> 01:00:08,931
...just once...

736
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:11,847
...I could do the right thing on purpose.

737
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:14,727
You know, Scoob?

738
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:18,405
Like, be a hero...

739
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:20,965
...and save the day.

740
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,284
But who are we kidding, right?

741
01:00:36,973 --> 01:00:38,486
Captain Cutler's Ghost.

742
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:43,288
Captain Cutler's Ghost!

743
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:48,572
They found us. Finish that in the van
when we get to the Monster Hive.

744
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:53,804
- Come on, guys! In the van!
- Hurry!

745
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,562
Go, Fred! Hit it!

746
01:01:08,973 --> 01:01:10,486
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

747
01:01:10,653 --> 01:01:12,325
Fine. Let's go back!

748
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:15,451
That's the wrong way!

749
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:29,771
Shaggy! Give me a hand.

750
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,493
This is tied for
the most terrifying day of my life.

751
01:01:32,653 --> 01:01:35,770
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!

752
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:36,922
It's done!

753
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:48,324
Jinkies! Tweety's back.

754
01:01:48,493 --> 01:01:49,642
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?

755
01:01:49,813 --> 01:01:52,407
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.

756
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:54,086
Go!

757
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:05,722
Take this!

758
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:11,452
- This is bad.
- No doubt.

759
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:13,762
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.

760
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:15,366
Who's driving?

761
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:17,882
Hello.

762
01:02:18,053 --> 01:02:19,202
- Scoob.
- What?

763
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:37,043
- Turn the wheel!
- Wheel?

764
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:39,522
- Turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!

765
01:02:45,853 --> 01:02:48,128
- Scooby!
- Okay.

766
01:02:56,253 --> 01:02:57,732
I'm driving!

767
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:06,727
Watch out, Scoob!

768
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:13,891
You did it, Scoob!

769
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:22,889
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.

770
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:25,521
Let's get this control panel
and plug her in.

771
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:42,810
You go nowhere, knave.

772
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:46,083
You guys take the long way around.

773
01:03:47,373 --> 01:03:48,726
And I'll hold him off.

774
01:03:51,213 --> 01:03:54,250
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.

775
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:03,447
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!

776
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:08,128
Not so fast!

777
01:05:10,213 --> 01:05:14,411
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.

778
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:16,643
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!

779
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:29,526
Scary.

780
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:32,002
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.

781
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:48,242
Daph?

782
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:52,126
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.

783
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:57,930
Guess this is it, huh?

784
01:05:58,533 --> 01:05:59,807
Oh, baby.

785
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:03,525
I'm afraid.

786
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:07,331
What a wimp, huh?

787
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:10,483
That doesn't make you a wimp.

788
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,764
Makes you human.

789
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:20,282
The Skeleton Men.

790
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:25,131
- He does that when he gets nervous.
- Sorry.

791
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:41,684
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?

792
01:06:41,853 --> 01:06:43,923
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.

793
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:47,051
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?

794
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,441
You're faster than me.

795
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:52,003
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.

796
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:54,812
I fixed it so it will destroy
all the monsters.

797
01:06:55,613 --> 01:06:56,966
But...

798
01:06:57,453 --> 01:07:00,365
...we can't.
- We're screwups.

799
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:03,093
We tried to be heroes like you guys,
but we're not.

800
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,971
- We're just not.
- No.

801
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,532
Like me?

802
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:13,242
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.

803
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:18,730
You guys are so free. You're never afraid
to be who you really are.

804
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:23,683
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.

805
01:07:25,053 --> 01:07:27,203
I think you've been heroes all along.

806
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:29,845
You just haven't known it.

807
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:34,242
Here I go.

808
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:40,086
Heroes.

809
01:07:40,733 --> 01:07:42,086
Heroes.

810
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:44,608
On your knees, knave.

811
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:46,365
Can't you see we're talking?

812
01:07:47,493 --> 01:07:49,768
Talking is for wimps.

813
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:54,652
You can't fool me
with that macho facade.

814
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:58,410
You're just afraid to show
your sensitive side.

815
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,683
You've touched my inner child.

816
01:08:02,853 --> 01:08:04,491
And he's really mad!

817
01:08:06,413 --> 01:08:07,846
Come on, Scoob.

818
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:14,683
Miner 49er!

819
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:32,173
I'll get you, you varmints!

820
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:00,644
Dead end.

821
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:06,090
Remember when we were young
and you used to wear that jumper?

822
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:10,844
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?

823
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:18,728
Do it!

824
01:09:23,853 --> 01:09:25,206
Lights out.

825
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,366
Blackout! Blackout!

826
01:09:41,253 --> 01:09:42,242
Oh, crap.

827
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:04,971
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.

828
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:17,763
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!

829
01:10:20,653 --> 01:10:22,371
My glasses.

830
01:10:22,853 --> 01:10:25,606
Oh, brother. Not again.

831
01:10:26,253 --> 01:10:28,813
I've got to consider contact lenses.

832
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:30,562
What?

833
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:51,048
Some kind of scary bat.

834
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:54,246
Wait a minute.

835
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,566
That's the pterodactyl.

836
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:02,164
The Pterodactyl Ghost.

837
01:11:05,453 --> 01:11:06,886
What's this?

838
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:25,926
A shrine!

839
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:29,287
To Jonathan Jacobo?

840
01:11:30,893 --> 01:11:33,453
But who would be so obsessed with him?

841
01:11:38,493 --> 01:11:39,482
Velma.

842
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:42,322
Lose something?

843
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,448
Patrick.

844
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,046
What are you doing here?

845
01:12:00,013 --> 01:12:02,573
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.

846
01:12:03,973 --> 01:12:07,682
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?

847
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:09,172
Yes.

848
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,044
Why are you so obsessed
with Jonathan Jacobo?

849
01:12:16,093 --> 01:12:18,971
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.

850
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,482
Velma.

851
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:27,445
Stay away from me.

852
01:12:28,813 --> 01:12:29,928
I know who you are.

853
01:12:37,573 --> 01:12:40,963
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?

854
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:42,725
No, so I can pull you up.

855
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:49,448
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.

856
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:52,730
And all the facts say
that you're the Evil Masked Figure.

857
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:55,970
What does your heart say?

858
01:12:56,133 --> 01:13:00,126
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.

859
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,853
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.

860
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:19,532
You saved my life.

861
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:23,927
Patrick!

862
01:13:27,373 --> 01:13:28,408
Velma!

863
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:30,564
That thing just flew off with Patrick!

864
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:34,726
The best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs.

865
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,528
Where is it?

866
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:42,331
I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

867
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:47,285
That's weird. It sounded like you just said
you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

868
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:59,804
I think we lost them.

869
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:03,762
Scoob, we made it.

870
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,931
You should never have locked those locks.

871
01:14:08,093 --> 01:14:10,561
Now you're stuck in here with me!

872
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:13,452
The Cotton Candy Glob.

873
01:14:13,653 --> 01:14:16,725
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?

874
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,371
Yes.

875
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:30,527
- No! I'll give you cavities!
- I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.

876
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:33,765
Poor guys are probably running around
helpless and terrified.

877
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:40,803
This is like the greatest day
of our lives, Scoob.

878
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:43,806
Finally, a monster
we could sink our teeth into.

879
01:14:43,973 --> 01:14:48,649
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's
a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?

880
01:14:48,813 --> 01:14:52,010
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.

881
01:14:52,173 --> 01:14:54,812
We have to get this
control panel back before...

882
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:03,405
Before exactly that happens.

883
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:07,202
At last I have you, Mystery Inc.

884
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:11,732
You'll never make it past my monsters.

885
01:15:11,893 --> 01:15:15,090
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.

886
01:15:19,413 --> 01:15:23,531
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.

887
01:15:25,773 --> 01:15:27,684
Now you are stuck in my trap.

888
01:15:28,453 --> 01:15:29,568
Daphne!

889
01:15:32,773 --> 01:15:33,842
Daph!

890
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,732
Gotcha!

891
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,846
Go! Daphne!

892
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:49,043
Run, Velma! Run, Velma!

893
01:15:49,933 --> 01:15:51,685
Shaggy! Here!

894
01:15:54,053 --> 01:15:55,042
Come on!

895
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:01,485
Soon your friends will be dead...

896
01:16:01,653 --> 01:16:03,450
...and Coolsville destroyed.

897
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,164
My revenge will be final...

898
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:10,089
...and there's nothing you can do about it.

899
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:11,722
Help, Velma!

900
01:16:14,693 --> 01:16:15,682
Daphne?

901
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:20,572
- Shaggy?
- Scoob...

902
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,805
Dude.

903
01:16:43,373 --> 01:16:47,048
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!

904
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,452
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.

905
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:56,085
Here, doggy-doggy.

906
01:16:58,173 --> 01:16:59,242
Rail glide!

907
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:02,405
- Watch this!
- Roll barrel!

908
01:17:10,213 --> 01:17:11,532
Hang time!

909
01:17:14,653 --> 01:17:17,406
End of the line, Doo!

910
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:20,602
Come here, you worthless mutt!

911
01:17:46,373 --> 01:17:47,362
Scoob!

912
01:17:54,213 --> 01:17:56,044
You can do it, buddy!

913
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:10,851
You can't do this to me!

914
01:18:11,013 --> 01:18:13,607
Who do you think you are?

915
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:15,732
Scooby...

916
01:18:15,893 --> 01:18:17,042
...Dooby...

917
01:18:17,213 --> 01:18:18,202
...Doo!

918
01:18:22,093 --> 01:18:23,685
No!

919
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,770
My monsters!

920
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:59,333
You did it! You saved us all!

921
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:00,721
I know.

922
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:13,924
Do you know the identity
of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?

923
01:19:14,093 --> 01:19:17,244
If our hunch is correct,
the Evil Masked Figure is...

924
01:19:17,413 --> 01:19:18,562
No!

925
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:24,327
Heather Jasper-Howe.

926
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:29,772
But she was at the museum
when the Masked Figure was on the roof.

927
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,844
You almost had me there, didn't you?

928
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:35,403
Lucky for her, she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans.

929
01:19:37,093 --> 01:19:38,082
Ned.

930
01:19:40,973 --> 01:19:43,407
<i>When I realized</i>
<i>she was the Evil Masked Figure...</i>

931
01:19:43,573 --> 01:19:45,803
<i>... he quickly changed into her costume.</i>

932
01:19:45,973 --> 01:19:47,088
But why did she do it?

933
01:19:47,253 --> 01:19:51,451
Because Heather Jasper-Howe
is actually...

934
01:19:55,493 --> 01:19:57,882
...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.

935
01:19:58,573 --> 01:20:00,848
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

936
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:02,571
But how do you know this?

937
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:06,851
A photo, taken of Jacobo
in front of the Coolsonian.

938
01:20:07,013 --> 01:20:10,244
Jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began.

939
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:13,769
So Jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall.

940
01:20:14,253 --> 01:20:18,451
He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe
persona to turn the press against us.

941
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,285
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...

942
01:20:20,453 --> 01:20:23,763
...by putting that book and
The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.

943
01:20:23,933 --> 01:20:27,005
As if you getting the lead
in <i>My Fair Lady</i> wasn't enough!

944
01:20:27,173 --> 01:20:30,927
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.

945
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,970
And stealing my Tater Tots!

946
01:20:33,133 --> 01:20:35,089
You kept saying you felt puffy!

947
01:20:36,093 --> 01:20:39,085
And the real identity of Ned is...

948
01:20:42,253 --> 01:20:43,402
Ned.

949
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:49,692
I would have gotten away with it
if it weren't for those meddling punks...

950
01:20:49,853 --> 01:20:51,332
...and their dumb dog!

951
01:20:56,333 --> 01:21:00,167
- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, <i>dummkopf</i>.

952
01:21:00,973 --> 01:21:02,531
But we cuddled.

953
01:21:08,173 --> 01:21:10,289
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:14,769
Listen, Velma, I know
that must have seemed very suspicious...

955
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:18,084
...but you've got to believe me
that I had nothing to do with...

956
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:20,486
I trust you.

957
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:22,766
Listen, Patrick.

958
01:21:23,973 --> 01:21:27,648
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.

959
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,971
But one thing that's true is...

960
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:33,805
...that I like you.

961
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:36,282
Very much.

962
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:41,329
And I would like
to go out with you again.

963
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:45,284
But this time, I will go as myself.

964
01:21:48,453 --> 01:21:51,604
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.

965
01:21:52,933 --> 01:21:54,082
Okay.

966
01:21:57,693 --> 01:22:01,003
<i>Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!</i>

967
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:04,644
They're cheering for us again.

968
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:05,842
Yep.

969
01:22:06,013 --> 01:22:09,130
I always thought that was
the best thing in the world.

970
01:22:09,293 --> 01:22:11,648
I guess I found something
a little bit better.

971
01:22:13,773 --> 01:22:17,209
- Can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.

972
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:27,563
Yikes! A monster!

973
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:36,443
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!

974
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:48,487
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

975
01:22:50,693 --> 01:22:52,445
Sing it up, Ruben.

976
01:22:56,693 --> 01:22:57,682
Everybody.

977
01:23:19,013 --> 01:23:20,412
Come on, Shaggy.

978
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:24,686
Get down.

979
01:28:48,773 --> 01:28:51,082
Game Boy Advance secret code.
