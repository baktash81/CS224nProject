1
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:53,697
Mr. Director, this is
Agent Vivian Delay.

2
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:57,492
For the last ten years,
the Central Intelligence Agency

3
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,371
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

4
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:04,999
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

5
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,836
What we do know is
he's a former German national

6
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,339
who sells atomic material
to terrorists all over the world.

7
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:15,093
Intelligence confirms that
a transaction is to take place

8
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,804
next week in Belgrade.

9
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,683
The Wolf's number one man,
the Albino,

10
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,144
will be selling a dirty bomb
to Syrian buyers.

11
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,732
We've already dispatched
a team to eliminate the buyers,

12
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,651
secure the bomb,
and apprehend the Albino.

13
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:35,905
How may I be of service, sir?

14
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,032
Your target is the Wolf.

15
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,453
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

16
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,539
Find him and eliminate him.

17
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:45,957
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:49,002
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

19
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,967
Oh, sir, if I may,

20
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,219
who is our agent on the ground?

21
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,805
Ethan Renner.

22
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,057
He's a lifer.

23
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,851
He'll get the job done.

24
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,526
The buyers have been neutralized.

25
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,112
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

26
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,781
Going down.

27
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,377
Maid service.
I have your extra towels.

28
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,025
This cold is killing me.

29
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,071
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

30
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,281
- You left a big mess.
- Yeah, well...

31
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,327
I'm thinking about calling in sick.

32
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:07,372
Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.

33
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,516
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

34
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:33,773
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with
those little shampoo bottles, I like them.

35
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,610
All teams in position.

36
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,686
Excuse me.

37
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:32,123
Nice work in there, my man.

38
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:35,585
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

39
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,003
I need a second to make a call.

40
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,922
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

41
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,248
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

42
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:42,926
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

43
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:50,183
Let's see the scan.

44
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,898
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

45
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,818
I don't have any change so
if I could borrow some out of this money.

46
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:03,529
I can come back and I can pay you back.

47
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,950
Come on, come on.

48
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,368
Son of a bitch.

49
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:15,124
All right, this is worth a lot.

50
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,584
I take some of this.

51
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,006
I'm coming back for that.

52
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,604
Excuse me.

53
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,482
Have we met before?

54
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,278
You would remember me, no?

55
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,995
Karachi!

56
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,125
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!

57
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,001
No one moves on the Albino

58
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,213
until we have cleared what's in the box.
Come on.

59
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,342
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We met in Karachi last April exactly.

60
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,512
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress

61
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,014
if I remember it correctly?

62
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,273
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

63
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,649
That's a dirty bomb.

64
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,573
Boss.

65
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,783
Abort.

66
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,397
- Hey.
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

67
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:04,358
You didn't forget, which means
you probably love me.

68
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,777
Of course I do, Zooey.

69
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:09,739
You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday," loudly.

70
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,993
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

71
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,878
You can leave a message
after the beep.

72
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,748
What the f...?

73
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,502
All right.

74
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:30,343
Go, go! Get in position!
Cover me!

75
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:11,425
Cover Ethan now!

76
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,097
We're going in!
We're going in!

77
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,867
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

78
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,958
All right, that's enough.

79
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:09,168
Put it down.

80
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,295
Put it down.

81
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,464
Now.

82
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:18,803
Now slide it over here.

83
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,888
You're not going to kill me, are you?

84
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,766
Not unless I have to, all right?

85
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,269
But I'm not running
after you anymore, fucker.

86
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,322
Ohh...

87
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,354
I see you've read the report.

88
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:13,399
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

89
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,652
It's a type of brain cancer
and it's spread to your lungs.

90
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,779
It doesn't say
how much time I have left.

91
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,784
Three months, possibly five.

92
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah.

93
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:33,169
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

94
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,212
I'm afraid not.

95
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,675
I suggest you put your affairs in order.

96
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,594
Thank you, doctor.

97
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:44,722
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.

98
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,309
But now that you're no longer operational,

99
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:52,063
we need to terminate our relationship.

100
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,655
We've wired your pension into your account.

101
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,408
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

102
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:47,970
What them?

103
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:13,954
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

104
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,874
No, I'm American. I...

105
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,627
- I live here.
- Which floor?

106
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,378
No, I mean, I live here.

107
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:25,174
You? You are the owner?

108
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,009
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

109
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,056
Bonjour, mon ami.

110
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:36,101
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

111
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:38,308
My daughter Sumia is in the kitchen,
she's pregnant.

112
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,814
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

113
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,733
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

114
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,737
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

115
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:52,576
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

116
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,912
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

117
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,998
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

118
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,377
And it is good that you are finally back.
My name is Jules.

119
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,003
Ethan.

120
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:06,715
Where's all my stuff?

121
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,677
I also started to paint the room.

122
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,971
My wife think it is best to have
a cheerful color.

123
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,557
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

124
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,352
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

125
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,362
That's months from now.

126
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:34,952
Then I guess I need to throw
them out myself.

127
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,663
No, no, no, hey, no.

128
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,421
I'll go to...
Hey! I'll go to jail?

129
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,966
All right, what exactly then
am I supposed to do?

130
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,766
Did you really just say that to me?

131
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,399
Ethan, Ethan!

132
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,445
I need to talk to your dad.

133
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,114
Psst!

134
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,616
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

135
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,626
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

136
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,799
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

137
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:35,971
I'm not saying you did,
but I think it's time you and I

138
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,307
got to know each other
just a little better.

139
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:42,811
'Cause you're not just crashing
at some guy's house.

140
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,233
No problem, Ethan.
We will pack and leave now.

141
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,614
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

142
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,451
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

143
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,952
Sit down.

144
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,465
You don't have to go yet,
Jules, at least...

145
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,218
not until your daughter
has her baby.

146
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,556
But you stay under my rules.

147
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:23,685
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule number 1, no one steps in this room again.

148
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:27,231
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

149
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,024
That's right,
you put a bigger sign.

150
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:33,112
Rule number 2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

151
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,239
Yes, of course.

152
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:40,160
And rule number 3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

153
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,162
- You don't like the color?
- No.

154
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,165
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

155
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,751
No, yellow is not
a man's color.

156
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:53,048
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

157
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:55,968
Like Sumia.

158
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:01,348
Okay, okay, no more yellow.

159
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:20,701
Who is the most
beautiful girl in the world?

160
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,411
- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!

161
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:23,704
That is so cute!

162
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,587
Run, run, run!

163
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,102
Hey, salut, Christine.

164
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:48,937
Hi, you.

165
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,526
Hey.

166
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,912
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.

167
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,497
I'm in town.

168
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,461
I'm in a meeting right now,
so this is not a good time to talk.

169
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:17,174
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

170
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,469
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

171
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:23,305
so, uh... unless it's urgent

172
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:27,267
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

173
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,727
Why?

174
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,565
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

175
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:37,027
No, not today.

176
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,863
All right, I'll meet you outside.

177
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:42,658
OK, see ya.

178
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,336
Why are we really here, Ethan?

179
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,088
I wanted to see you.

180
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:03,011
And our daughter,
you want to see her too?

181
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,764
Yes. Yes.

182
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:09,810
I started a college fund.

183
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,812
Why the sudden interest?

184
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,232
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

185
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,234
I left her a message
on her birthday.

186
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,823
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

187
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,616
I'm dying, Tina.

188
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:28,287
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

189
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:32,165
I'm sick.

190
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,461
I mean, I'm dying.

191
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,549
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

192
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:43,969
must be signed
in both French and English.

193
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:51,518
I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.

194
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,235
Come on in.

195
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,246
It's nice.

196
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:14,916
The place looks better than before.

197
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,962
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

198
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:21,757
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

199
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,261
I want to see her before I go.

200
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,310
You have to make me a promise.

201
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:39,566
I'll let you see her under one condition.

202
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:42,986
Are you done?

203
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,239
Are you really done working for them?

204
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,326
- Yes.
- Promise me.

205
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:54,373
Yes. I missed a lot.

206
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,546
I should have left a long time ago.

207
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,423
I'm gonna be fine.

208
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,192
I've got the whole day planned.
First...

209
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,969
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

210
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:10,389
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

211
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:12,265
Hi.

212
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,354
Hi, Zooey.

213
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,316
How are you?

214
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,570
I'm good, how are you?

215
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,531
I'm good, thank you.

216
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,410
- Okay.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

217
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:34,913
No, I'm just... I'll be back home
at 8:30. Yeah?

218
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,540
What are we supposed to do?

219
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,375
All right, how about I cook?

220
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:40,544
You're on.

221
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,966
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

222
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,552
I think I like Dad.

223
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:52,347
Favorite place to go after school?

224
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:54,224
I didn't know
we had a favorite place.

225
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,768
Flying chairs, remember?

226
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:59,896
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

227
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:02,524
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

228
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,943
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

229
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,195
Look, I'm not mad at you,
all right?

230
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:10,907
I don't need you to explain any of this,
all right? It's not a big deal.

231
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,660
Come on, Zoe,
let's go to the cafe.

232
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,496
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

233
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:17,956
Who?

234
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:20,834
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

235
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:25,589
No.

236
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:31,011
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

237
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:34,681
Sorry, sometimes
I just get a bit nervous

238
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,142
when I see American cowboys.

239
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,603
Yee-haw!

240
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,104
Okay.

241
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,025
He's older than you.

242
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,651
Yeah, he's a senior.

243
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:47,986
Is there something wrong with that?

244
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,197
Back when I was growing up if you...

245
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,032
Hugh is so different than you.

246
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:55,035
Look, I know I'm blowing it here,
Zooey.

247
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:58,997
Look, I thought you
might want to ride this home.

248
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,834
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

249
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:06,630
It's... so purple.

250
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:08,256
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

251
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:09,674
Right, when I was like nine.

252
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:12,928
I'm taking the metro with my friends.

253
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:15,096
All right, so I'll see you
at home for dinner?

254
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:22,145
Zooey, I'll see you at home for dinner?

255
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,819
- How are these?
- Fresh.

256
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:13,154
They're fresh?
I just need to steam them, right?

257
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,656
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

258
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,034
Milk?

259
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,078
Only if you plan to fry it.

260
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:23,665
Haven't got that far.

261
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:28,420
I like a man that doesn't pretend to know
his way around the kitchen.

262
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:31,006
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

263
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:32,173
Yes...

264
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:35,969
I think I am.

265
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:42,350
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

266
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,118
thanks to you,
frying it for my daughter.

267
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,564
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

268
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,531
- What did you say your name was?
- You can call me Vivi.

269
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:59,492
Nice running into you, Vivi,
but not interested.

270
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,793
Maybe we could talk?

271
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:17,552
My wife gave me this.

272
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:25,018
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

273
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:31,107
All right,
but my bike's coming with me.

274
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:37,822
The bike's going with me.

275
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:44,287
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

276
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:46,623
I work for the director of the CIA.

277
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,708
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

278
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,127
Serbia was my operation.

279
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:52,629
I was looking for the Wolf.

280
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,840
We believe he was
at the hotel that day,

281
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,342
and I believe that
you may have seen him.

282
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,594
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

283
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:02,472
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

284
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:09,854
I want you to come work for me.

285
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:13,358
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

286
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:15,777
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

287
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:18,279
for more than just
a few measly months?

288
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:23,201
Jesus!

289
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:26,788
That was really close.

290
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:31,793
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.

291
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,338
Interested?

292
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,717
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.

293
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:46,558
Where's the literature?

294
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,269
You know, the test results.

295
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,608
How come no one's told me
about this before?

296
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,319
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

297
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:01,698
Wow. You make me feel so special.

298
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:04,492
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

299
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:09,414
Because you're sick and dead men
have nothing to lose.

300
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:12,792
I have access to many things, Ethan,

301
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,086
but only you can give me
access to the Wolf.

302
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:17,756
I need you to find him...

303
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:19,841
and I need you to kill him.

304
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:23,428
So I buy back my life by killing for you?

305
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,597
When did you become so self-righteous?

306
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:28,558
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure that
we're talking about the same thing here.

307
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,001
You know, killing.

308
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:38,276
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

309
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:40,028
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

310
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:45,825
Well, I got a fish to fry and I'm late.

311
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,411
I can get you in home
in time for dinner, Ethan.

312
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:51,122
Question is...

313
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:54,209
do you want your bike back?

314
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,013
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

315
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,807
Meaning a silencer would...

316
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,810
be handy.

317
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,355
So, how many guys
are we talking about?

318
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:16,606
One.

319
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:19,984
Knock 'em dead.

320
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:23,071
Yeah, well, that's the point, isn't it?

321
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,562
- Allo?

322
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,426
Grenade!

323
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:06,049
Pretty good for a jobber.

324
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:11,387
You said there'd be one guy,
not five.

325
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:12,972
Oops.

326
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:16,684
But I did say keep the young man
with the mustache alive.

327
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:18,478
What do you think
this guy looks like?

328
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,814
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

329
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,275
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

330
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:27,111
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

331
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,739
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

332
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,078
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

333
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:43,044
Now this... is a young man
with a mustache.

334
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:45,421
No, that's a goatee.

335
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,924
That's a mustache and some stubble.

336
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,594
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

337
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,347
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

338
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:55,640
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

339
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:57,128
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

340
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,768
What, from your century, grandpa?

341
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,311
Look at that, that's a mustache.

342
00:32:00,478 --> 00:32:02,358
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

343
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:03,982
Hmm?
Oh my...

344
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:05,858
Who are all these other guys here?

345
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,111
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

346
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:10,530
Nope.

347
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,783
Because I usually like to know the person
I'm killing needs to be dead.

348
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,350
And that's why you never made it
to the top shelf, my friend.

349
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:18,663
Goatee, you're up.

350
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,041
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

351
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,335
I don't know, I swear.

352
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,756
Kill him.

353
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:31,175
Hold on,
I can get this guy to talk.

354
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:36,597
He didn't know.

355
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,851
Goddamn it.

356
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:42,812
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?

357
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,612
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

358
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,782
I wanna leave my daughter
more than just my shit pension.

359
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,785
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.

360
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,412
Half a dozen?

361
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,414
I'm already halfway there.

362
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,916
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

363
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:11,215
Don't take this the wrong way, Viv,
but you're not my type.

364
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,510
I'm everybody's type.

365
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:21,142
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

366
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:24,228
But I am sure that if you don't try it,
you'll be dead in two months.

367
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:30,151
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

368
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:34,072
And you're giving me credit
for those three guys upstairs.

369
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,409
And I'm also gonna want a...

370
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:42,163
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

371
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,499
Take it or leave it.

372
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:46,334
I'll take it.

373
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:49,879
I like the package.

374
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,966
All right, now do it.

375
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:00,890
Breathe, Ethan.

376
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:05,937
It will hit you morphine-quick.

377
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,613
One way or another...

378
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,159
I will make you feel better.

379
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,985
Don't forget to soak the fish.

380
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:02,660
You promised me my bike.

381
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:11,878
Zooey!

382
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:19,802
- Zooey! Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

383
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,227
Look at this.

384
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:31,397
This looks terrible.

385
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:36,152
I think your...
Your hair?

386
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:40,114
No, no.
Yes. Yes, my hair.

387
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:42,909
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

388
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,287
It looks, uh, awesome.

389
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:47,663
- Really?
- Yeah.

390
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,373
You think this can go to prom?

391
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,500
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

392
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:54,128
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...

393
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:56,213
All these times,
now's the time to say a joke?

394
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,840
No, I mean, maybe...

395
00:35:58,716 --> 00:36:02,094
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

396
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,430
No, you can...
You could wash it...

397
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:08,184
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

398
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:11,604
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?

399
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:13,689
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

400
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:15,775
Why don't we
pick up some dinner?

401
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:23,407
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner
if you're going to be three hours late.

402
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,912
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

403
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,290
Save it. I was crazy
to think I could count on you.

404
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,194
I was gonna ask you to look after Zooey
while I go to London for work.

405
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,146
Then, go.

406
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:39,131
Really, you should go,
I can handle it.

407
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:42,134
You can't handle dinner.
How are you gonna handle a teenager?

408
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,973
How about I just diffused
a major meltdown. Her hair, okay?

409
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,602
I have to take the first flight
out tomorrow morning.

410
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,062
I'm calling a sitter.

411
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,859
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

412
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,904
- What?
- There's, um...

413
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:04,407
There's a specialist here
in Paris who has

414
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:07,284
a experimental drug
she's willing to test on me.

415
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,290
Experimental.

416
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:15,001
What exactly does that mean?

417
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:19,088
It means I might be able to spend a little
more time with you and Zooey.

418
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:23,718
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

419
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:31,017
Can we just, like, maybe quit
fighting for a second.

420
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:35,271
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

421
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:39,442
I could grill us up some of this tuna.

422
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:41,193
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

423
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,487
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

424
00:37:44,238 --> 00:37:45,322
No way!

425
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,246
You're gonna fix that door, right?

426
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,457
Oh. Um...

427
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:58,002
Yeah, that was a mistake.

428
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:00,171
You haven't been here 24 hours.

429
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,383
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

430
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,346
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

431
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:16,437
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

432
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,191
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

433
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:26,072
You're terrible.

434
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,398
I knew you would call.

435
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,025
What the hell did you give me?

436
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:05,820
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

437
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:09,198
My head... My head's dizzy.

438
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:11,575
Vivi.

439
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:19,708
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

440
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:21,794
I'm hallucinating.

441
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,712
- Take a shot of vodka.
- What?

442
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,382
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

443
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,305
Is everything okay?

444
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:17,850
Yeah.

445
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:27,067
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

446
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,531
Listen, you can call me
anytime you want.

447
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,201
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

448
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,495
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

449
00:40:38,662 --> 00:40:40,289
- I love you.
- All right.

450
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:42,666
I'll be back in a couple of days,
I'm running late.

451
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,835
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

452
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:46,563
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

453
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,464
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.

454
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:51,008
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

455
00:40:55,846 --> 00:40:58,682
Look at me. Come on.

456
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:02,061
Just one time up here.
One time.

457
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:06,815
Atta girl.

458
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:09,026
Zooey!

459
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:16,909
Oh.

460
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:18,285
What?

461
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:20,454
Wow, it's...

462
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:22,373
- It's what?
- Geez.

463
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:25,125
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

464
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:28,128
It's so red.

465
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:29,838
Vivi?

466
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,883
Are you going to get that?

467
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,844
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

468
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:38,238
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

469
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:42,142
We talk a lot because
we sell internationally.

470
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,603
It's always daytime somewhere.

471
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,856
All right, so now we've got
three days to kill.

472
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,108
What are you doing?

473
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:50,818
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

474
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,486
I'm giving you mine.

475
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:54,530
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

476
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,287
There. Welcome to this century.

477
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,667
Zooey. Zooey.

478
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,046
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?

479
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,717
You think Hugh's
gonna like my hair color?

480
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:16,343
Yes, I do.

481
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,678
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,781
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

483
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:22,558
So you don't love it?

484
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:23,851
No.

485
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:26,186
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

486
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:29,106
Zooey, I really love it.

487
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:32,151
Awesome.

488
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,169
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

489
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:52,671
forty-eight-hour window between kills.

490
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:55,299
Well, you only have three days left.

491
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:58,010
I'm not getting into your car, Vivi.

492
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:03,057
Not until I get a second opinion on that
whatever it was you gave me.

493
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:06,810
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

494
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:08,395
- Aw.
- The manual says,

495
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:10,522
if you'd bothered to read it,

496
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,900
you'd find out if I can't keep
my heart rate lower,

497
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,943
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

498
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,904
So keep your heart rate low.

499
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:19,615
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

500
00:43:26,914 --> 00:43:28,123
Get in the car already.

501
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,671
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant

502
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:37,049
who cooks the books
for your old friend the Albino.

503
00:43:39,593 --> 00:43:42,346
How am I supposed to locate this guy?

504
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:46,016
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

505
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:48,894
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

506
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:54,358
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

507
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:56,360
All right.

508
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:58,028
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

509
00:43:58,195 --> 00:43:59,613
Lose the bike.

510
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,908
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

511
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,884
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

512
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,095
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

513
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:24,429
An Albino told me.

514
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:29,643
Did he also tell you
that we offer discreet luxury?

515
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,773
He told me not to talk to the hired help,
to talk to the boss.

516
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,901
We're not the help, okay? We are the
executive vice president of sales.

517
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:39,862
Ooohh!

518
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,197
You're a couple of turds.

519
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,499
Listen, asshole...

520
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:56,378
little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

521
00:44:56,545 --> 00:44:58,380
And you will never meet the boss.
Understand?

522
00:44:58,547 --> 00:44:59,548
All right, I'm sorry.

523
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:00,507
Yeah.

524
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:02,926
I had a really weird night,
you know,

525
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:05,220
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.

526
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:07,639
I think maybe we got
off on the wrong foot. My fault.

527
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,391
Yeah.

528
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:11,143
Can we start again?

529
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,439
Let's start again.

530
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:17,983
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the Eiffel Tower from

531
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,693
everywhere in this town.

532
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:55,103
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

533
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,315
without an invitation, Mr...?

534
00:45:58,482 --> 00:46:00,317
Why are names important right now?

535
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:02,027
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.

536
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,987
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

537
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,408
You are sitting in my chair.

538
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:10,035
I'm just waiting for you.

539
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,049
The Albino sent you, huh?
Bastard!

540
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:26,677
I've always been loyal.
Please...

541
00:46:30,347 --> 00:46:33,475
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

542
00:46:33,642 --> 00:46:37,437
Sit down.
I also have a pretty teenage daughter.

543
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:40,649
Father to father,
your girls ever

544
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:43,527
lock themselves in their room,
you know?

545
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:46,613
Cut their hair, paint it red, you know?

546
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,991
Put wigs on and shit like that?

547
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:51,368
No. Never.

548
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:55,372
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

549
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:02,838
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

550
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,300
Then who are you?

551
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,014
Ethan. Come on.

552
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:32,993
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

553
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,662
I do not want to be disturbed.

554
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:39,958
Yes. Rule number 2:
Do whatever you say.

555
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,501
That's right, Rule number 2.

556
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:44,004
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

557
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:46,214
And you are a good guy?

558
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,431
You are a professional, huh?

559
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:56,892
Why have I never seen you
in Paris before?

560
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:59,227
I've been away on business
for about five years.

561
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:03,023
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

562
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:09,821
Well, I was never good
at balancing work and family.

563
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,243
You know, when I go home,

564
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,581
this life, the killing,
the rest it all disappears.

565
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:23,960
I made the wrong choice leaving.

566
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:29,925
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.

567
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:30,926
That's the key.

568
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:33,595
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

569
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:35,806
So let's not miss dinner tonight, hmm?

570
00:48:35,972 --> 00:48:41,394
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

571
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:46,274
Please remind me,
who is he again?

572
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,497
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

573
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,666
I'd like to have a word with
Zooey's father.

574
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:08,922
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

575
00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:11,174
Zooey's fine,
but we need to meet.

576
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:14,136
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

577
00:49:16,805 --> 00:49:19,099
- I can be there right away.
- Well, do hurry.

578
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:24,604
We're going to school.

579
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:26,523
As I was saying to Zooey,

580
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,067
study after study has shown that

581
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:33,655
aggression is exacerbated
by violent images in popular culture.

582
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:36,074
Well, Zooey's mother
raised her to be a pacifist.

583
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,409
Hm.

584
00:49:37,576 --> 00:49:41,705
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

585
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:50,589
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

586
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:54,718
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

587
00:49:54,885 --> 00:49:58,263
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

588
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,182
they all call for different responses.

589
00:50:02,184 --> 00:50:04,519
Mr. Renner, it's extremely important

590
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:07,355
that you send your daughter
a clear message

591
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:11,193
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

592
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,488
violence is not
an acceptable answer.

593
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:16,948
I'll try.

594
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:25,807
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

595
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:27,584
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

596
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:29,377
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

597
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:32,964
Ow, my thumb.

598
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,133
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

599
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,511
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

600
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:42,098
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

601
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:48,855
Oh, God.

602
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,154
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

603
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,864
I told you this is my boss's car.

604
00:50:58,031 --> 00:51:00,408
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

605
00:51:00,575 --> 00:51:03,870
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.

606
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:08,625
I like this,
who are these guys?

607
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:11,753
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!

608
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:16,132
Why can't you just listen to me
and try to understand?

609
00:51:16,299 --> 00:51:18,134
OK, why don't you tell me all about it?

610
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:22,264
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

611
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,767
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.

612
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:28,728
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

613
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,814
Well, she won't do that again, will she?

614
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:37,946
Just a second, sweetie,
sounds like the spare's loose in the trunk.

615
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,407
Hey!

616
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,619
I'm trying to have a conversation
with my daughter.

617
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:50,583
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

618
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,962
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.

619
00:51:54,129 --> 00:51:58,216
Well, don't, because sometimes
it's the only way to stop a bad guy.

620
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:01,094
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

621
00:52:01,261 --> 00:52:03,102
I'm proud of you,
you stuck up for your friend.

622
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,890
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

623
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:08,685
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

624
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:11,980
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

625
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:15,692
Jesus Christ!

626
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:21,489
Let's see if we can
jump start your memory, Mitat.

627
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,118
It's my daughter.

628
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:36,713
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

629
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,841
That's okay, honey.
I'm sorry, too.

630
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:43,303
Favorite place to hang out after school?

631
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:49,601
I'll wrap my sales meeting
and meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

632
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:55,106
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

633
00:52:55,857 --> 00:52:58,610
A girl like this will keep you
running in circles.

634
00:52:58,777 --> 00:53:01,863
You must draw the line,
not be so soft.

635
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,326
You're right, Mitat.

636
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:09,996
I have been way too soft.

637
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:15,251
Now, where do I find
the Albino's accountant, hmm?

638
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:27,115
Hi, Zooey.

639
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:29,325
It's 3:40, Ethan.
Where are you?

640
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:31,578
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

641
00:54:31,744 --> 00:54:33,454
Forget it, you're always late.
I'm leaving.

642
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:35,915
No, no, no, I'm almost there,
honestly, Zooey.

643
00:54:36,082 --> 00:54:37,542
Give me...

644
00:54:38,793 --> 00:54:40,253
Give me five minutes.

645
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,173
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

646
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:46,009
Wow.

647
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,262
Kids.

648
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,043
Sorry I freaked out earlier.

649
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,547
It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.

650
00:55:24,714 --> 00:55:27,383
This is really new for both of us.
I get it.

651
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:31,304
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?

652
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:32,722
- I remember.
- Kind of?

653
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:34,390
- Yeah.
- Okay.

654
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:37,685
Gosh, the bike.

655
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:03,711
What's going on, Ethan?

656
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:09,008
It's just some flu I picked up.

657
00:56:09,175 --> 00:56:11,177
Can't seem to shake it off.

658
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:12,570
What if it's something worse?

659
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:15,598
No, it's, uh...

660
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:18,601
It's nothing worse.

661
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,981
You remember when we'd drink
hot chocolate at the beach house?

662
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,482
Sort of.

663
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:26,626
It's the one place I wouldn't
mind calling home.

664
00:56:26,693 --> 00:56:29,345
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

665
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,908
You know, I kept all
our home movies in a box.

666
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:38,788
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

667
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:42,125
- Yeah, that be awesome.
- Good.

668
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:46,921
Oh, shoot, I forgot.
I have to go to Karina's tonight.

669
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:49,132
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

670
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:52,802
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

671
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:55,805
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

672
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:58,516
No, it's okay. It's just...

673
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,560
Don't I need to call her parents first?

674
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:02,645
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

675
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:05,231
That's all her parents understand.

676
00:57:05,398 --> 00:57:07,083
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.

677
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,861
I don't need to call your mom.

678
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:13,531
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

679
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,284
See you later.

680
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,431
Hi, this is Christine, I'm not here,
so please leave a message.

681
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:23,124
Tina, it's me.

682
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:28,171
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

683
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:32,383
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

684
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:38,139
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

685
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:57,612
Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.

686
00:59:57,778 --> 00:59:59,363
But, uh, who is this friend?

687
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,949
Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.

688
01:00:02,116 --> 01:00:03,618
Anyways, give me a call.

689
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:30,061
Zooey!

690
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,636
Non, non.

691
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,262
Son of a bitch!

692
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:04,405
Is this your car?

693
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,953
Pardon... Is this your car?

694
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,371
- Whoa.
- No.

695
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:52,912
Hey! You know the rule.

696
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:54,413
Never involve family.

697
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,791
This isn't a business meeting,
Mitat, this is...

698
01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:03,464
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

699
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:05,216
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?

700
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:14,016
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

701
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:18,104
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

702
01:03:23,526 --> 01:03:26,529
Okay. Come, come with us.

703
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:27,738
Thanks for that.

704
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:30,282
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

705
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:32,827
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

706
01:03:32,993 --> 01:03:35,788
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

707
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:38,196
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

708
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,834
But your girls might
be able to tell me where

709
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,295
a 16-year-old would go
to party on a school night.

710
01:03:45,047 --> 01:03:47,675
What does this "spider" mean?

711
01:03:50,511 --> 01:03:53,347
They are good girls,
they do not party.

712
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:54,974
What does this "spider" mean?

713
01:03:58,477 --> 01:03:59,687
La Soiree House.

714
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:02,022
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

715
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,488
I have a daughter in there.

716
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:27,923
Zooey.

717
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:29,675
Oui.

718
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:55,284
Zooey!

719
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:10,925
Stop, please, please.

720
01:05:23,521 --> 01:05:24,647
Stop, please.

721
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:35,449
Ethan!

722
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:39,995
Ethan!

723
01:05:45,876 --> 01:05:47,336
Ethan! Please!

724
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:11,777
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

725
01:06:13,779 --> 01:06:14,863
I got you, honey.

726
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:40,222
What are you doing here?

727
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:45,102
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

728
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:52,067
God, this is so embarrassing.
They'll never let me in there again.

729
01:06:53,736 --> 01:06:56,989
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

730
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:59,408
Because I like
being with my friends.

731
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:00,868
Your friends?

732
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:03,329
Do you even remember
what happened?

733
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,499
In the bathroom?

734
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:12,504
- Zooey!
- What?

735
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:15,132
In the bathroom,
do you remember what happened?

736
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,885
Look, Karina and I
aced the practice test, okay?

737
01:07:19,762 --> 01:07:21,555
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

738
01:07:21,722 --> 01:07:23,932
So we decided to go hang out
with some friends.

739
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:27,478
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.

740
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:30,189
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

741
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:33,150
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.

742
01:07:34,443 --> 01:07:37,613
You're putting this on
and we're going home.

743
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,616
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

744
01:07:40,783 --> 01:07:42,826
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

745
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:45,371
You're getting on this bike and I'm gonna
follow you every step of the way.

746
01:07:45,537 --> 01:07:48,707
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

747
01:07:48,874 --> 01:07:51,210
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

748
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:53,253
Get on this bike.

749
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,297
- Or what?
- Now!

750
01:07:58,676 --> 01:08:00,969
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, okay?

751
01:08:09,395 --> 01:08:12,147
What kind of kid doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

752
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:20,280
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

753
01:08:26,662 --> 01:08:28,205
Goddamn it.

754
01:08:29,623 --> 01:08:31,750
This is the flattest spot,
so let's just try it right here.

755
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:33,837
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

756
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:37,881
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

757
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:40,259
Right, you picked it
'cause it had the big bow on it.

758
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:44,513
No. I can explain the big bow,
I got it. Get on.

759
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,683
There's too many people.
Look, can we go somewhere private?

760
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,518
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

761
01:08:51,186 --> 01:08:52,438
But it's purple.

762
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,942
It is purple. Get on.

763
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:00,738
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

764
01:09:00,988 --> 01:09:03,866
Wow, we did it.
We're halfway there. We're on it.

765
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,746
Give yourself time to push here, okay?
It's right here then. All right?

766
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:10,038
Zooey, all right.

767
01:09:10,205 --> 01:09:11,623
- Whoa. Okay?
- Okay.

768
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,710
- Good.
- Easy, please.

769
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:16,879
Okay, I have you. Now, just kinda,
you know how to pedal.

770
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:19,214
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

771
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,301
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

772
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:29,933
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

773
01:09:31,143 --> 01:09:32,644
Why did you leave me and Mom?

774
01:09:34,646 --> 01:09:37,524
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...

775
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:39,401
What?

776
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:42,196
There is no easy...

777
01:09:44,573 --> 01:09:46,241
There's no good answer, honey.

778
01:09:50,412 --> 01:09:51,413
All right.

779
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:55,375
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

780
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:56,710
Do you have another family?

781
01:09:56,877 --> 01:09:57,978
- Is that what it is?
- No.

782
01:09:58,045 --> 01:09:59,980
Do you have another
perfect daughter somewhere?

783
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:01,924
Did you see me and not want me?

784
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:04,510
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

785
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:11,099
Well, why did it take so long
for you to come back?

786
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:13,644
Look!

787
01:10:13,811 --> 01:10:15,395
The longer I was gone...

788
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:18,524
it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

789
01:10:29,785 --> 01:10:31,954
Okay, okay, all right.

790
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:37,334
That's all.
It's nothing to do with you.

791
01:10:39,628 --> 01:10:42,256
Would you still care about me
if I did horrible things?

792
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:43,715
Yes, of course.

793
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,386
Absolutely.

794
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:50,973
I lie a lot.
Like, all the time about everything.

795
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:53,600
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

796
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:58,689
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

797
01:10:58,856 --> 01:11:02,192
That girl I hit at school,
she wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

798
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,278
She was hitting on Hugh.

799
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:06,488
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

800
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:07,781
Hugh!

801
01:11:10,242 --> 01:11:12,286
These are so beautiful, thank you!

802
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:14,413
Give me one sec, I'll be right back.

803
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,790
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

804
01:11:21,587 --> 01:11:24,423
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

805
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:28,010
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

806
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:31,054
I'm an athlete.
I'm a striker.

807
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:33,390
Last game I scored two goals,
by the way.

808
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:38,103
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

809
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:42,357
No! Well, I...
I mean on the field.

810
01:11:42,524 --> 01:11:44,234
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

811
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,987
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

812
01:11:47,154 --> 01:11:50,741
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

813
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:53,994
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

814
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,204
Real football.

815
01:11:58,582 --> 01:11:59,583
Okay.

816
01:12:03,545 --> 01:12:04,796
Nice bike.

817
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:06,757
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

818
01:12:06,924 --> 01:12:08,258
You're the only one.

819
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:13,972
I won't be home late, Ethan.

820
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:17,476
- Where are you two going?
- School.

821
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:19,686
Great, well,
I'm headed that direction myself.

822
01:12:19,853 --> 01:12:21,188
No, you're not.

823
01:12:21,355 --> 01:12:23,398
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

824
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:25,651
Oh, okay, well, I'm gonna...

825
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:28,278
OK, see you later,
Mr. Zooey.

826
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:31,657
I don't like being called that.

827
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:33,116
You don't like Hugh?

828
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:37,037
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

829
01:12:37,204 --> 01:12:40,749
It's my business to read people.

830
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:43,210
You know, a lot of my friends' dads
are in sales, Ethan,

831
01:12:43,377 --> 01:12:45,921
and not one of them
dresses like you.

832
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:49,132
What are you saying?

833
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:52,386
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

834
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:01,603
Hey, I love you!

835
01:13:04,898 --> 01:13:08,819
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

836
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:12,072
The accountant checked out.
I need you to tell me where he is now.

837
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,282
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

838
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:16,743
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

839
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:20,372
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

840
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:23,583
Is it my fault if your daughter
is out of control

841
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,335
and affecting your work and judgment?

842
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:27,713
You're right, Mitat.
It is affecting my judgment.

843
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:30,132
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

844
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:34,428
Hey, my wife works late.
I need to pick up my girls at 4:30.

845
01:13:34,594 --> 01:13:36,847
I can't promise,
but I'll make an effort.

846
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:25,937
Open up.

847
01:14:27,814 --> 01:14:29,524
I can't get around your mirror.

848
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,695
Fine, asshole.

849
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:42,597
Yes!

850
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:49,187
Ethan! Ethan!

851
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:06,371
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

852
01:16:06,538 --> 01:16:07,622
Yeah.

853
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:13,128
Do not open!
The lock has an explosive trigger.

854
01:16:13,295 --> 01:16:17,215
I got the codes to the briefcase.
Give me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

855
01:16:17,382 --> 01:16:20,218
But after I give it to you,
you will kill me.

856
01:16:20,385 --> 01:16:22,637
No, but I swear to God
I'm gonna really torture you

857
01:16:22,804 --> 01:16:24,639
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

858
01:16:24,806 --> 01:16:26,433
- Okay, one...
- Oh, no.

859
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,727
- ...two
- No.

860
01:16:28,894 --> 01:16:30,738
No.

861
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:35,692
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

862
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,043
I was thinking about tonight.

863
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:40,822
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

864
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,119
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

865
01:16:46,286 --> 01:16:48,330
Just the two of you, like a...

866
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,309
- ...romantic dinner?
- Something like that.

867
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,102
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce

868
01:16:54,169 --> 01:16:55,970
but I don't know what I need
besides tomatoes.

869
01:16:56,004 --> 01:16:57,555
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

870
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:04,471
Just a sec, sweetie.

871
01:17:06,223 --> 01:17:07,849
Guido, are you a real Italian?

872
01:17:09,476 --> 01:17:11,186
What?

873
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:14,689
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

874
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:17,859
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

875
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:20,028
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

876
01:17:21,947 --> 01:17:23,198
Sauce?

877
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:25,325
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

878
01:17:25,492 --> 01:17:28,370
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

879
01:17:28,536 --> 01:17:30,536
- You just said you're a real Italian, right?
- Si.

880
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,917
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

881
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:37,754
Ah! Spaghetti sauce!
Red or white?

882
01:17:41,216 --> 01:17:43,885
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

883
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:45,971
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

884
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:48,306
Okay, I know what to tell her.

885
01:17:48,473 --> 01:17:52,644
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.

886
01:17:52,811 --> 01:17:54,938
His mama has a great recipe.

887
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:57,941
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

888
01:17:58,108 --> 01:18:01,111
Why don't you say hello
to my daughter.

889
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:05,073
Hello. I am Guido.

890
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,841
Hi, Guido,
this will only take a second.

891
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:07,909
No, no!

892
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:10,954
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

893
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:13,456
No, no, no.

894
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:18,169
So, this is my mama's favorite
reduction sauce.

895
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:23,508
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

896
01:18:23,675 --> 01:18:26,720
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

897
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:29,014
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

898
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,226
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

899
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:37,772
and now I am the only one left
to take care of her.

900
01:18:41,401 --> 01:18:42,694
What else, Guido?

901
01:18:44,321 --> 01:18:49,326
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

902
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:51,995
Then you peel the tomatoes.

903
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:54,456
After ten minutes, no more,

904
01:18:54,622 --> 01:18:57,751
add capers and parsley.

905
01:18:57,917 --> 01:19:01,963
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

906
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,215
and a teaspoon of sugar.

907
01:19:05,759 --> 01:19:09,012
Boy, that Guido's a real mama's boy, huh?

908
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:12,265
I think it's sweet that he
loves his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

909
01:19:12,432 --> 01:19:16,311
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- Okay.

910
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:19,731
No, wait!

911
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:22,233
Oh, please call her back.

912
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,696
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

913
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:29,783
You know how to tell time?

914
01:19:31,368 --> 01:19:32,452
Where's the one?

915
01:19:34,662 --> 01:19:35,747
Where's the three?

916
01:19:37,248 --> 01:19:39,000
That's two hours.

917
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,544
You cut this guy loose
in two hours.

918
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:45,006
Guido, remind me where you're going
after this kid lets you go.

919
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:48,176
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

920
01:20:26,339 --> 01:20:28,049
You're late.

921
01:20:30,552 --> 01:20:32,345
I'm in the middle
of a training session.

922
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:36,766
Yeah, I... I can see that.

923
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:47,652
Job's done.

924
01:20:51,281 --> 01:20:53,366
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

925
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:54,951
Sit down.

926
01:20:56,244 --> 01:20:57,912
Or did you forget why you came?

927
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:06,254
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

928
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,092
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

929
01:21:11,259 --> 01:21:13,303
Who doesn't love Paris?

930
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,263
Now that we've bankrupted the Albino,

931
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:18,349
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

932
01:21:18,516 --> 01:21:21,394
leading us straight to the Wolf.

933
01:21:21,561 --> 01:21:23,146
When?

934
01:21:24,522 --> 01:21:25,982
Very soon.

935
01:22:10,401 --> 01:22:11,945
You can't go dressed like that.

936
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:19,619
What's wrong with how I dress?

937
01:22:19,786 --> 01:22:22,497
What are you, cheri, 42 long?

938
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,083
Yes.

939
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,418
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

940
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,214
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

941
01:22:53,653 --> 01:22:56,531
- What's going on?
- Baby.

942
01:22:56,698 --> 01:22:57,907
Baby?

943
01:23:01,035 --> 01:23:04,330
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

944
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:10,169
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

945
01:23:43,828 --> 01:23:45,455
My God.

946
01:23:45,622 --> 01:23:47,515
This is not the first time
for you, after all.

947
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,127
Actually, it is.

948
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,754
What about your daughter?

949
01:23:55,173 --> 01:23:57,842
I wasn't there.

950
01:23:58,009 --> 01:24:03,306
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

951
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:07,852
You were doing good?

952
01:24:10,563 --> 01:24:11,981
I don't even remember.

953
01:24:16,694 --> 01:24:18,880
The baby is coming!

954
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:27,789
It is a girl.

955
01:24:38,758 --> 01:24:41,511
Before the baby leaves the house
for the first time,

956
01:24:41,678 --> 01:24:46,182
it is our custom to have
the family offer a blessing.

957
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:50,645
- Leave?
- Yes.

958
01:24:50,812 --> 01:24:55,358
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

959
01:24:55,525 --> 01:24:58,069
What word? I mean,
I just I brought Chinese, okay?

960
01:24:58,236 --> 01:25:00,279
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

961
01:25:00,446 --> 01:25:03,908
It's okay.
Everything is as it should be.

962
01:25:06,744 --> 01:25:09,806
Look, I didn't mean for you to have
to leave right after the child was born.

963
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:12,500
I mean, there's plenty of room
for everyone.

964
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:15,586
Maybe it's too much room.

965
01:25:15,753 --> 01:25:20,591
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

966
01:25:20,758 --> 01:25:22,677
Just us and the children.

967
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:26,556
It is good
as long as we are together.

968
01:25:26,723 --> 01:25:29,767
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

969
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:41,487
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

970
01:25:41,654 --> 01:25:44,699
It's the name of a great man
who didn't shoot us when he could.

971
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:46,826
And instead gave us his home.

972
01:25:46,993 --> 01:25:48,870
She has chosen carefully.

973
01:25:50,496 --> 01:25:52,123
The name is perfect.

974
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:49,555
Hey, how did it go?

975
01:26:49,722 --> 01:26:51,265
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

976
01:26:51,432 --> 01:26:53,518
Good.

977
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:55,645
So dinner was a success.

978
01:26:57,772 --> 01:27:01,359
Wow. You look nice.

979
01:27:02,693 --> 01:27:04,103
Did you wear that for me today?

980
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:08,366
Uh... no. I had to...

981
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:09,909
I had to give a speech.

982
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:12,078
Are you coming to the pre-party tomorrow?

983
01:27:12,245 --> 01:27:14,956
Well, I am if you're asking.

984
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:17,166
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

985
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,086
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

986
01:27:20,253 --> 01:27:21,087
Yeah.

987
01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:27,260
Don't forget you've got Steelers blood
running through your veins.

988
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:36,602
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

989
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:38,896
So?

990
01:27:39,063 --> 01:27:41,566
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

991
01:27:41,732 --> 01:27:43,317
So?

992
01:27:43,484 --> 01:27:46,988
So I don't know how to dance
like that, Ethan.

993
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:03,087
- No.
- Come on.

994
01:28:03,254 --> 01:28:05,631
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

995
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,093
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

996
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,554
Now, stand on my feet.

997
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:15,558
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

998
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:17,351
Okay.

999
01:28:17,518 --> 01:28:20,313
There and back.

1000
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:24,817
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

1001
01:28:24,984 --> 01:28:28,738
Now get off.

1002
01:28:38,956 --> 01:28:42,418
Would you wear this suit
tomorrow for me?

1003
01:28:44,045 --> 01:28:46,130
Of course I would.

1004
01:29:08,194 --> 01:29:09,570
Mom.

1005
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:17,870
Sweetie.

1006
01:29:20,873 --> 01:29:24,543
You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.

1007
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,629
How are you feeling?

1008
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:29,965
Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?

1009
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:31,967
She had that stuffed rabbit.

1010
01:29:32,134 --> 01:29:33,427
Lamby the lamb.

1011
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:37,223
Right, Lamby the lamb.

1012
01:29:38,766 --> 01:29:41,227
I remember the day
she never took him to school again.

1013
01:29:41,394 --> 01:29:46,607
My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.

1014
01:29:46,774 --> 01:29:49,610
- Like you lost something.
- Yeah.

1015
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:53,239
- Have you told her yet?
- No.

1016
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:59,078
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

1017
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:01,997
Just tell her you love her.

1018
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:04,250
She knows.

1019
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:07,878
She needs to hear it from you.

1020
01:30:08,045 --> 01:30:12,133
Of course I love her.
I mean, I love her the same way...

1021
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:15,803
the same way I love you.

1022
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:10,107
Good morning.

1023
01:31:10,274 --> 01:31:11,484
Oh, God.

1024
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:16,030
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

1025
01:31:16,197 --> 01:31:17,823
Good morning, parents.

1026
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:21,660
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.

1027
01:31:21,827 --> 01:31:24,121
Bring that orange juice right here.

1028
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,041
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. Okay?

1029
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:29,376
Come on,
I squeezed the oranges all by myself.

1030
01:31:29,543 --> 01:31:30,586
Now, please.

1031
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,466
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.

1032
01:31:35,633 --> 01:31:39,303
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to school.

1033
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:41,931
Come on, let' go. Go.

1034
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:43,516
Love you, Mom.

1035
01:31:43,682 --> 01:31:45,184
I love you, sweetie.

1036
01:31:47,728 --> 01:31:50,481
What's wrong with her seeing us?

1037
01:31:50,648 --> 01:31:52,691
Really.

1038
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:58,447
What happens when you're gone?

1039
01:32:07,289 --> 01:32:08,332
Yeah?

1040
01:32:08,499 --> 01:32:10,668
The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.

1041
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,255
All right.

1042
01:32:18,759 --> 01:32:23,013
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

1043
01:33:04,305 --> 01:33:06,307
- Hello.
- You spotted me.

1044
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:09,435
- I'd have to be blind not to.
- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.

1045
01:33:09,602 --> 01:33:11,478
Your girls are expecting you
home tonight.

1046
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:13,814
So is your beautiful wife.

1047
01:33:16,025 --> 01:33:17,693
Who were you talking to?

1048
01:33:37,838 --> 01:33:38,881
Come on, accelerate!

1049
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,305
Come on!

1050
01:34:03,364 --> 01:34:04,615
Come on, faster!

1051
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:14,768
Have we lost him?

1052
01:35:22,067 --> 01:35:24,111
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

1053
01:36:01,065 --> 01:36:02,733
Why you don't kill me already?

1054
01:36:04,943 --> 01:36:07,988
Because you're the father who knows best.

1055
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:18,827
Just kill him!

1056
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:48,190
Vivi...

1057
01:39:27,813 --> 01:39:29,189
Welcome back.

1058
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:44,288
You let the Wolf
slip through your hands again.

1059
01:39:45,789 --> 01:39:46,832
Where am I?

1060
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:49,126
A safe place.

1061
01:39:52,004 --> 01:39:54,506
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

1062
01:39:54,673 --> 01:39:58,343
I was actually pretty curious myself.
And as it turns out,

1063
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:01,555
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

1064
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:12,107
It's my wife. Hello?

1065
01:40:12,274 --> 01:40:14,151
Hi. Where are you?

1066
01:40:14,317 --> 01:40:15,485
Um...

1067
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:18,196
I'm leaving the doctor's office now.

1068
01:40:18,363 --> 01:40:21,867
Hurry up and get home.
We're gonna be late for Zooey's party.

1069
01:40:22,034 --> 01:40:23,493
Okay.

1070
01:40:26,204 --> 01:40:30,417
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
killing for you, Vivi.

1071
01:40:30,584 --> 01:40:32,377
You're almost there, Ethan.

1072
01:40:34,588 --> 01:40:35,672
Kill the Wolf.

1073
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,427
I'm gonna need a new suit.

1074
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:44,848
You heard him.

1075
01:40:51,813 --> 01:40:55,734
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

1076
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:58,403
Take me to my partner's house.

1077
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:00,739
He will help me to get out of Paris.

1078
01:41:03,742 --> 01:41:06,578
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

1079
01:41:06,745 --> 01:41:08,622
No!

1080
01:41:09,915 --> 01:41:12,501
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!

1081
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,135
Whoa!

1082
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:29,392
Just smile and have fun.

1083
01:41:29,559 --> 01:41:33,063
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

1084
01:41:39,486 --> 01:41:41,321
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

1085
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,875
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

1086
01:41:54,042 --> 01:41:56,086
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

1087
01:41:56,253 --> 01:41:57,295
Yeah, of course.

1088
01:41:59,965 --> 01:42:02,592
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

1089
01:42:03,009 --> 01:42:04,177
these are my parents.

1090
01:42:04,344 --> 01:42:06,346
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

1091
01:42:06,513 --> 01:42:08,014
You're welcome.

1092
01:42:08,181 --> 01:42:10,058
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

1093
01:42:10,225 --> 01:42:12,227
Hi. And this is my partner.

1094
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:18,191
Pleasure to meet you.

1095
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:22,237
And you.

1096
01:42:23,071 --> 01:42:25,615
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.

1097
01:42:29,244 --> 01:42:30,245
How do you do?

1098
01:42:37,544 --> 01:42:38,461
Wow.

1099
01:42:38,628 --> 01:42:39,838
Yeah, wow.

1100
01:42:40,005 --> 01:42:42,424
Kids.

1101
01:42:58,857 --> 01:43:00,233
Wow.

1102
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:03,445
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1103
01:43:16,499 --> 01:43:18,126
Isn't this great?

1104
01:43:18,293 --> 01:43:19,544
Yeah.

1105
01:43:21,296 --> 01:43:22,923
Zooey, do me a favor.

1106
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,301
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

1107
01:43:36,561 --> 01:43:37,562
Cheers.

1108
01:43:52,035 --> 01:43:53,453
You're working again!

1109
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:58,333
Yeah. There's a problem here.

1110
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:03,213
That's why you came back to Paris?

1111
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,675
No. I came back to see you and Zooey.

1112
01:44:06,841 --> 01:44:08,468
It was all a lie.

1113
01:44:08,635 --> 01:44:10,929
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

1114
01:44:11,096 --> 01:44:14,140
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

1115
01:44:14,307 --> 01:44:16,476
Right now I don't
have the time to explain.

1116
01:44:36,454 --> 01:44:38,957
How many guys do we have?

1117
01:44:42,794 --> 01:44:45,588
The police will be here
in ten minutes.

1118
01:44:45,755 --> 01:44:47,799
- You all right?
- No.

1119
01:44:47,966 --> 01:44:50,927
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...

1120
01:44:52,137 --> 01:44:54,764
If we go now, there is enough time.

1121
01:44:57,976 --> 01:45:00,979
Okay. This party's over.

1122
01:45:05,358 --> 01:45:07,444
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

1123
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,529
I'll get my funds, bring everyone in.

1124
01:45:09,696 --> 01:45:11,656
Make sure the street's blocked.

1125
01:45:13,116 --> 01:45:15,243
At least have the decency
to look at me.

1126
01:45:25,545 --> 01:45:26,713
Kill him.

1127
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:29,591
It's just bad luck.

1128
01:45:31,134 --> 01:45:32,302
You're sick, Ethan.

1129
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,480
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1130
01:45:43,646 --> 01:45:45,690
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

1131
01:45:55,742 --> 01:45:57,160
I'm gonna be sick.

1132
01:45:58,161 --> 01:45:59,746
Come with me.

1133
01:46:17,222 --> 01:46:18,848
Did you scratch yourself?

1134
01:46:23,144 --> 01:46:24,704
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

1135
01:46:24,771 --> 01:46:26,014
Just leave it to someone else.

1136
01:46:27,899 --> 01:46:29,901
Just please stay here.

1137
01:46:43,248 --> 01:46:44,457
- Zooey!
- What?

1138
01:46:44,624 --> 01:46:45,750
Get down!

1139
01:47:16,447 --> 01:47:18,032
You hear me in there?

1140
01:47:19,325 --> 01:47:20,869
I'm sending you down.

1141
01:48:32,941 --> 01:48:34,359
Oh, shit.

1142
01:48:43,117 --> 01:48:44,202
Wheel's turning.

1143
01:48:48,414 --> 01:48:50,583
No, stay, you fuckers!

1144
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:52,669
Don't!

1145
01:49:06,849 --> 01:49:08,643
I gotta...

1146
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,271
Don't.

1147
01:49:12,188 --> 01:49:13,856
I wouldn't mind killing you.

1148
01:49:16,776 --> 01:49:18,778
You scared a lot of people up there.

1149
01:49:21,656 --> 01:49:23,616
This is my daughter's party.

1150
01:49:35,044 --> 01:49:36,379
Yes.

1151
01:49:40,591 --> 01:49:41,467
Yes, come on.

1152
01:49:54,897 --> 01:49:56,190
Viv.

1153
01:49:58,985 --> 01:50:00,778
Oh, my God.

1154
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,284
Am I in hell?

1155
01:50:06,451 --> 01:50:09,454
So that's what it looks like
to you, Ethan.

1156
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:12,790
Figures.

1157
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:17,378
- Finish it.
- What?

1158
01:50:20,048 --> 01:50:22,383
You'll do what I tell you to.

1159
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:25,720
- No.
- Finish it.

1160
01:50:26,637 --> 01:50:29,474
I passed my quota, Vivi.

1161
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:31,642
Ethan...

1162
01:50:31,809 --> 01:50:34,854
Jesus Christ!

1163
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:45,239
Are you really done working for them?

1164
01:50:45,865 --> 01:50:48,493
A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.

1165
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:50,553
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

1166
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:52,372
Kill him.

1167
01:50:52,538 --> 01:50:53,915
I should've left a long time ago.

1168
01:50:54,082 --> 01:50:56,209
- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.

1169
01:50:56,376 --> 01:50:58,878
Do it.

1170
01:51:01,089 --> 01:51:03,674
What kind of kid
doesn't know how to ride a bike?

1171
01:51:03,841 --> 01:51:06,427
The kind of kid who never had
a father to teach her.

1172
01:51:08,721 --> 01:51:09,722
- Ethan.
- Ethan!

1173
01:51:11,265 --> 01:51:12,392
Do it!

1174
01:51:12,558 --> 01:51:14,060
Promise you'll never
lie to me again.

1175
01:51:15,353 --> 01:51:16,396
You have no choice.

1176
01:51:19,482 --> 01:51:21,401
I don't think so.

1177
01:51:24,278 --> 01:51:27,824
The wife wants me to give it up.

1178
01:52:07,321 --> 01:52:08,573
Can I talk to her?

1179
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:11,534
No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.

1180
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:14,078
- What?
- Yeah, we're...

1181
01:52:14,245 --> 01:52:15,913
We're taking a break
from each other right now.

1182
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,124
At least she's not throwing them at me.

1183
01:52:18,291 --> 01:52:20,376
Is everything all right?

1184
01:52:20,543 --> 01:52:24,630
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

1185
01:52:24,797 --> 01:52:26,883
She said things, I've said things.

1186
01:52:27,049 --> 01:52:29,469
There's been some tears,

1187
01:52:29,635 --> 01:52:31,679
but the week overall's
been really worth it.

1188
01:53:05,213 --> 01:53:06,214
Hey.

1189
01:53:07,673 --> 01:53:09,884
These are some presents
from me and, um...

1190
01:53:10,051 --> 01:53:12,220
a package that was
dropped at the house.

1191
01:53:12,386 --> 01:53:15,264
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

1192
01:53:21,229 --> 01:53:22,980
I love you, Tina.

1193
01:53:25,483 --> 01:53:27,276
Just not enough to quit.

1194
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:31,739
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.

1195
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:39,956
If I could say one word to you
to change your mind,

1196
01:53:40,122 --> 01:53:42,166
would you give me that chance?

1197
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:43,793
This isn't a game.

1198
01:53:45,127 --> 01:53:47,755
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,

1199
01:53:47,922 --> 01:53:49,924
that's not what I'm asking.

1200
01:53:50,091 --> 01:53:53,594
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

1201
01:53:53,761 --> 01:53:55,429
I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.

1202
01:53:55,596 --> 01:53:57,265
And if I never hear it...

1203
01:53:58,891 --> 01:54:00,893
I've already gotten more than I deserve.

1204
01:54:03,604 --> 01:54:08,693
I just wanna hang out as long as I can
with my daughter and my wife.

1205
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:13,614
- What's the word?
- What?

1206
01:54:13,781 --> 01:54:15,283
What's the one word
to make me change my mind?

1207
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:19,537
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1208
01:54:22,415 --> 01:54:24,125
That's two, Ethan.

1209
01:54:24,292 --> 01:54:26,586
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1210
01:54:26,752 --> 01:54:27,962
I'm so glad you came!

1211
01:54:31,465 --> 01:54:32,967
Come on, let's go inside.

1212
01:54:34,093 --> 01:54:35,803
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1213
01:54:40,725 --> 01:54:41,809
Come on.

1214
01:55:02,997 --> 01:55:04,415
Is Dad a badass?

1215
01:55:06,417 --> 01:55:10,254
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1216
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:19,221
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1217
01:55:19,388 --> 01:55:20,890
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1218
01:55:23,392 --> 01:55:25,019
He loves you so much.
