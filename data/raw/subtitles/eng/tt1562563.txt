[screaming]

[crash]

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,571
[car alarm blaring]

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,131
[crash]

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,526
[speaking foreign language]

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,643
[shots firing]

8
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,166
Seven Wonders
are in good hands.

9
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,526
(Israeli Prime Minister on TV)
Yes, Israel is moving ahead

10
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,251
and we continue
to make every effort

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,763
for a diplomatic solution
to this crisis.

12
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,247
Unfortunately, Dawn,
there are those who believe

13
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,289
these talks
should never happen.

14
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,763
They will remain steadfast
with this belief until Israel

15
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,089
and all of its inhabitants
are eradicated forever.

16
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,644
Which leads us to the single
greatest threat facing mankind:

17
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,809
Rogue countries
attempting to

18
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,645
or already having
the capabilities

19
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
to develop
nuclear weapons.

20
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,842
The world's
most dangerous regimes

21
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,209
with the world's most dangerous
terrorist proxies, could,

22
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,769
and we believe already have the
world's most dangerous weapons.

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,487
Israel, like America, reserves
the right to defend herself

24
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,643
against such threats.

25
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,686
Israel wants peace.

26
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,724
America wants peace.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,480
Our children need peace.

28
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,807
We'll resolve
these differences--

29
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,127
Hey, Bry,

30
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,487
(Bry on computer)
Hey, Shane.

31
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,125
Hey, I got the files
that you wanted.

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,283
I'm uploading them
to you right now.

33
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,650
Are you sure
about this?

34
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Yeah, I'm sure.
Three of our agents

35
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,646
have been killed
in the Middle East

36
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,285
in the last 6 months.

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,971
There's gotta be
a leak somewhere

38
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,850
in the communication
pipeline.

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,083
(Bry on computer) These aren't low-level
agents we're talking about here.

40
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,691
Yeah, yeah, I know.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,002
(Bry on computer) The last time
you tried something like this,

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,486
it did not turn out
so well.

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,609
I'm just saying,
you lost a lot.

44
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,923
I just know how much
you two cared for each other.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,087
Look, I'll see you in the office
tomorrow morning, all right?

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,010
(Bry on computer) All
right, get some rest.

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,805
Yeah,
you too, man.

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,729
[phone ringing]

49
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,246
Daughtry

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,761
(male on phone) This is dispatch.
We have a call for you.

51
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,883
He refuses to speak
with anyone else.

52
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,491
All right,
punch it through.

53
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,251
This is Agent Daughtry.

54
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,727
(male 2 on phone)
Is this line secure?

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,401
You reached the FBI,
it's pretty secure.

56
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,051
Who's this?

57
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,450
I've got information
for you.

58
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,563
(Shane)
All right, what's your name?

59
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,325
Last chance.

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,843
(male 2) Malikov said you're the
only one that I could trust.

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,005
Malikov.

62
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,203
I need to know
who this is.

63
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,291
What's your name?

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,571
It's--

65
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,762
it's Arlin.

66
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,371
Arlin Rockwell.

67
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,564
I need to tell you
about Seven Wonders.

68
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,771
We must meet tonight,
Mr. Daughtry.

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,405
There isn't much time.

70
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,567
[phone ringing]

71
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,641
This is the fallen one.

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,287
(distorted male voice on phone) Hello, my son.
Is there much to report?

73
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,647
The stork is delivered.

74
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,809
Seven Wonders
is in good hands.

75
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,764
We're awaiting
the decalogue from Mother.

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,849
(distorted male voice on phone)
Decalogue will be delivered soon.

77
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,327
Seven Wonders
will proceed as planned.

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,329
We have one other
order of business.

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,647
Yes.

80
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,763
(distorted male voice on phone)
We have a loose end.

81
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,651
I will send my brother.

82
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,123
(Shane) So rumor has
it, you're a smuggler,

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,731
Mr. Rockwell.

84
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,007
I am border, ex-border.

85
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,489
Well, a significant amount
of money was recently wired

86
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,609
to an account
linked to you.

87
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,730
There's good money in hate,
Mr. Daughtry.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,321
I'm guessing this has something
to do with Seven Wonders.

89
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,008
(Mr. Rockwell) The world is
changing, Agent Daughtry.

90
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,770
You may wake up
one morning very soon

91
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,725
and End Iran
has no enemies,

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,843
none capable
of interfering anyway.

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,083
How is it that Iran's hate
for America and Israel

94
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,882
is as great a threat
to democracy as Hitler's Nazis

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,247
and we do nothing?

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,681
This is all very
interesting but--

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,081
Please!

98
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,203
Please.
Please, sit down.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,923
I'm not a bad man,
Agent Daughtry.

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,251
I'm a specialist,
you could say.

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,608
If there's something
that needs handling,

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,041
people come to me.

103
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,681
I don't ask questions.
I merely transport.

104
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,961
But there's some things
that I won't do,

105
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,726
could not do knowingly.

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,129
And I should have known
that the price was too high

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,562
for this to be
just another job.

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:52,801
God forgive me, but I think
I've imported a distraction.

109
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,287
I don't understand.

110
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,403
What kind
of distraction?

111
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,727
(Mr. Rockwell) This is bigger than
anything you could possibly imagine.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,645
Mr. Daughtry,
Seven Wonders.

113
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,968
[shots firing]

114
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,011
[shots firing]

115
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,448
[glass shattering]

116
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,405
[shots firing]

117
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,811
[shots firing]

118
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,529
[gunfire]

119
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,168
[rapid gunfire]

120
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,847
[explosion]

121
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,444
[whispering] And when the
fourth seal was opened,

122
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,370
I heard the fourth beast
say, Come and see.

123
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,247
And I looked and beheld
a pale horse

124
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,204
and his name
who sat on it was Death

125
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,721
and hell followed with him.

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,924
And Io, there was
a great earthquake;

127
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,044
and the sun became
as black as sackcloth.

128
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,565
Speculative at best.

129
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,245
Shoddy research.

130
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,926
Hey.

131
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,208
Hey, how you doing?

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,527
Good.
Is everything okay?

133
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,165
Yeah,
everything's great.

134
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,207
I marked some pages,
you know, for your research.

135
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,168
Ang, I gotta finish my article
on the peace talks.

136
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,649
Well, I know but I thought
maybe this could help.

137
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,251
Just--

138
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,521
I can do my own research,

139
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,121
and I really don't need anymore
of your hocus-pocus prophecy.

140
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,771
Okay, Ang?
So here, take that.

141
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,087
Thank you.

142
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,131
You have a Nostradamus book
on your desk.

143
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,330
Hocus-pocus prophecies
like a unified Europe

144
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,046
or millions of Jews returning
to their homeland.

145
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,441
That hasn't
happened before?

146
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,404
That's different,
Angela.

147
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,125
No, it's not.
How is it different?

148
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,641
Islamic nations coming together
in a war against Israel.

149
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,406
That hasn't happened or
isn't happening again right now?

150
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,523
But if it doesn't make sense
to the great intellect

151
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,002
of Daniel Johnson,
then it just cannot be true.

152
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,327
Okay, you know what?

153
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,251
So the whole Noah's Ark thing,
that's realistic to you?

154
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,603
Yeah, it is.

155
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,325
But you're a great swimmer,

156
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,803
so you ain't got nothing
to worry about, right?

157
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,483
Good night, Angela.

158
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,770
(Eve) Hello, Jack.
How are you?

159
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,361
I'm doing
quite well, Eve.

160
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,011
How's your father?

161
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,011
He's fine.

162
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,569
Look, we're concerned about
one of your Held ops, Jack.

163
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,569
Eve, as you know
we typically handle matters

164
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,808
with our Held operatives
internally.

165
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,162
Couple of his aliases
have been flagged on national

166
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,286
and international chatter
and it's not the first time.

167
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,005
(Jack)
Dean.

168
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,291
We are the CIA.

169
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,283
What triggered
your concern?

170
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,609
There have been several
financial transactions

171
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,884
and communications that have
made my superiors uneasy.

172
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,481
He's working on a mission
in the Middle East.

173
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,489
No, he isn't.

174
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,091
We are the FBI.

175
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,441
[laughing]

176
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,568
All right, let me know
what you End out.

177
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,606
You know,
it wouldn't hurt you

178
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,247
to smile once in a while,
sweetheart.

179
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,411
Hello, Eve.

180
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,645
(Eve)
What are you doing here?

181
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,683
Are you
having me followed?

182
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,283
Have you paid any attention
to the peace talks?

183
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,404
I love it how you seem to show
up to talk about your issues.

184
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,201
Well, there are other
pressing matters

185
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,561
that require
my attention.

186
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,162
This is a pressing matter
for you, Eve,

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,329
much more
than you know.

188
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,921
There's never been
an opportunity like this,

189
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,409
an offer of peace
from Saudi Arabia,

190
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,604
Syria, Lebanon,
Egypt, Iraq?

191
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,888
Israel should just
carve up its homeland

192
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,889
and keep a few
choice cuts for herself?

193
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,207
Is that what
you're recommending?

194
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,084
(Eve) As much as you
might not like it,

195
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,806
Israel needs to reach
a peace agreement.

196
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,570
Okay, the Americans,
the EU, the Russians

197
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,491
have all made it clear that
if Israel walks away from this,

198
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,886
then they're on their own.

199
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,370
(male 3) In the mosques, it
is said that a true Muslim

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,644
must never
recognize Israel.

201
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,571
Jerusalem will be
the price for peace.

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,569
Why are you
in the States?

203
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,968
Because there are
Biblical prophecies coming true,

204
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,926
Eve, just as they
have in the past.

205
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,650
I want you to see that
your salvation is at stake,

206
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,806
and that Jesus is your
only path to heaven.

207
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,203
I really need to go.

208
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,525
(male 3)
Eve.

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,245
What do you
make of it?

210
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,291
[whispering]

211
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,403
(female) it's from the
Book of Revelation.

212
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,371
As in,The Good Book?

213
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,444
From my count,
it's his sixth time through it.

214
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,131
Impressive.

215
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,362
[whispering]

216
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,290
[whispering continues] And, Io,
there was a great earthquake;

217
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,171
and the sun became
black as sackcloth of hair,

218
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,561
and the moon
became as blood;

219
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,808
And the stars of heaven
fell unto the earth,

220
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,924
even as a Hg tree
casteth her untimely figs,

221
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,561
when she is shaken
of a mighty wind.

222
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,691
Water?

223
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,807
All right,
who do we have here?

224
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,128
John Doe, killing a man,
firing a gun at a federal agent,

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,448
several times.

226
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,007
Diving out a window.

227
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,645
Impressive for a ghost.

228
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,291
The question is,
you just a hit man?

229
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,490
I don't think so.

230
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,410
How do you know
Rockwell?

231
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,523
He rip you off?

232
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,201
Was he gonna tell me something
you didn't want me to know?

233
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,131
Rockwell mentioned
Seven Wonders.

234
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,244
You know anything
about that, mystery man?

235
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,847
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth

236
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,770
for the first heaven
and the first earth

237
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,405
were passed away.

238
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,763
There is
a revolution coming.

239
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,731
Revolution, huh?

240
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,683
A revolution of God.

241
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,291
Oh.

242
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,926
Well, I don't have
anything like that in my file.

243
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,881
Actually, Mr. Tanner,

244
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,369
I have a few questions
for you before you leave.

245
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,170
Hello, Shane.

246
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,811
Hey, Eve.

247
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,844
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

248
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,371
(Israeli Prime Minister on TV) Shalom
aleikhem, ladies and gentlemen.

249
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,723
It seems after 3 days
of negotiations,

250
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,691
the world cannot agree on
anything except that Israel

251
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,721
should give a part of her
land in exchange for peace.

252
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,364
We are very much back to where
we started many years ago.

253
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,611
Israel gave upland
for peace in 1948.

254
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,042
Israel gave land
for peace with Egypt

255
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,130
during the Reagan
administration.

256
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,962
Israel gave Lebanon
for peace and got Hezbollah.

257
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,449
She gave Gaza for peace
and got the terrorist group,

258
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,404
Hamas.

259
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,651
Israel, the only nation created
by a direct and sovereign

260
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,766
act of God
over 3500 years ago

261
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,926
has no more land to give,
no more to give.

262
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,088
[speaking foreign language]

263
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,927
(weatherman on TV) The weather situation
is much worse across the country,

264
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,124
26 deaths are being
blamed on this cold snap

265
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,609
and it's expected to continue
for at least another 3 days.

266
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,442
(female on TV) So has there been
enough concessions for the American

267
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
peace talks to go forward?

268
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,368
(Israeli Prime Minister on TV) Yes,
Israel is willing to move ahead.

269
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,961
Unfortunately, Dawn,
there are those who believe

270
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,089
that these talks
should never happen.

271
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,644
(Eve) Nick Tanner, he's a Spook.

272
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,285
Really?

273
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,571
When'd you
get into town?

274
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,365
Didn't even know
you were here.

275
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,846
Well, you're on
a need-to-know basis

276
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,487
and you didn't
need to know.

277
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,643
(Shane) Counter Intel's changed
you a little bit, huh?

278
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,247
Put a little tire
in your belly?

279
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,522
Good for you.

280
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,683
I've always had
the fire, Shane.

281
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,850
I just choose to use logic
and evidence to make decisions

282
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,009
about my cases.

283
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,169
You know, one of us
had to make a move

284
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,891
and luckily
I was still able to.

285
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,003
(Shane) Still angry about
our little mishap?

286
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,964
Our little mishap?

287
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,930
Are you kidding me?

288
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,605
You emptied 500 people
into the streets

289
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,326
in the middle
of a monsoon on a hunch.

290
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,204
You made me look
like a complete rookie

291
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,050
and you nearly
ruined by career

292
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,163
so forgive me
if I'm still a little angry.

293
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,643
I can just come back
for those later, ma'am.

294
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,445
It was
a good tip, Eve.

295
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,728
No, Shane,
it was a bad tip

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,764
but mostly
just a hunch.

297
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,883
And it's never
your fault.

298
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,006
You know what?
Believe whatever you want.

299
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,760
No one could ever tell you
anything different anyway.

300
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,202
Right? You're perfect,
especially now

301
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,090
that you're sporting
a new logo on your badge.

302
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,243
Oh, you have
some nerve, Shane.

303
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,524
You and your Counter Intel
friends ever hear

304
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,643
of an operation
called Seven Wonders?

305
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,520
No.

306
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,171
What is it?

307
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,962
I'm not sure. I was about
to End out from Rockwell

308
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
when you friend here
put him down.

309
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,041
You know who
he's working for?

310
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,402
We have our suspicions.

311
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,451
You get anything out of him
before he, you know?

312
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,051
No.

313
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,483
No,just a bunch
of Biblical nonsense,

314
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,240
quote from
the Book of Revelation.

315
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,851
Said something about
the revolution of God.

316
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,442
You know anything
about that?

317
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,291
Heard of it,
but nothing concrete.

318
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,925
Do you have any other
information or leads

319
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,289
to share with me before
I have a talk with him?

320
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,925
Maybe.

321
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,411
Why don't you let him
cool off for a little while.

322
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,045
Still like Russian food?

323
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,129
(Daniel)
Those are ammo crates.

324
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,651
How long have
they been there?

325
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,571
Cream?

326
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,165
Agent Rearden.

327
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,084
You are much more beautiful
than he described.

328
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,444
You must stay
for my world-famous borscht.

329
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,449
How are you,
my friend?

330
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,371
I received a call.

331
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,805
Arlin Rockwell.

332
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,161
(Shane)
Yeah.

333
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,811
How do you know him?

334
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,289
(chef) Let us just say we have
mutual respect for one another.

335
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,891
How is he?

336
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,811
Dead.

337
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,366
Then this coffee
should be vodka.

338
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,451
Why was he killed?

339
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,603
I cannot help you
this time.

340
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,563
Can't or won't?

341
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,491
What's Seven Wonders?

342
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,326
We are capable
of greatness, Mr. Daughtry,

343
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,969
the music of Beethoven,
the words of Pushkin,

344
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,682
the brush strokes
of Rembrandt,

345
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,804
but not all genius
ends up in beauty.

346
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,929
There is myth that Russia
has created nuclear bombs

347
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,522
that a single person
can deploy and detonate.

348
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,485
A Russian scientist
working with Iran

349
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,167
has created truth
out of this myth.

350
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,566
Are you telling me
that Rockwell smuggled

351
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,683
nuclear weapons
into the United States?

352
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,685
Seven of them.

353
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,131
Seven Wonders.

354
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,168
Suitcase nukes?

355
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,244
(chef) Do you know what would
happen to city or cities

356
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,409
that are hit
by these bombs?

357
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,968
Hundreds of thousands
of people will die instantly.

358
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,489
Their flesh will literally
melt off their bodies,

359
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,401
but the real strategic purpose
is the ultimate chaos

360
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,364
that will result
from such attack.

361
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,404
(Shane) The attack itself
is not the sole purpose?

362
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,489
No, Mr. Daughtry.

363
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,690
The sole purpose is disruption
of American government

364
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,803
and financial
institutions.

365
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,051
A distraction.

366
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,404
The America you know
will be part of history

367
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,331
and unable
to protect its friends.

368
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,931
What friends?

369
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,365
Israel.

370
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,486
Do you know
that two Russian fleets

371
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,242
are steering for exercises
in the Persian gulf?

372
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,567
Is this
Russian intelligence?

373
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,887
(chef)
They cannot exactly say.

374
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,329
They are going to blockade
the Strait of Hormuz.

375
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,443
But they are moving
a muscle to do it.

376
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,410
Why is it that America
always thinks

377
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,762
that we are center
of attention

378
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,364
when what we're dealing with
here is a new world order?

379
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,565
(Eve) There's no information in our
files that this would be nukes.

380
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,884
What files?

381
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,004
How could that
have gotten passed us?

382
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,923
Tell me
what's going on, Eve.

383
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,644
[tires screeching]

384
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,604
All right, what are you
not telling me?

385
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,730
Get me up to speed now
or get out of my truck.

386
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,087
Matthew Dean is a CIA operative
we've been investigating.

387
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,089
Nick and Dean have been
in communication

388
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,964
for the last several weeks.

389
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,289
We believe that they are working
together on a major operation.

390
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,647
What, the nukes?

391
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,002
(Eve) We have information that
the CIA has been investigating

392
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,961
certain Biblical
or apocalyptic events.

393
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,725
(Shane)
Whoa, whoa.

394
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,047
Are you kidding me?

395
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,885
(Eve) I haven't been able to
wrap my head around it either

396
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,804
but apparently recent
world events have been

397
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,761
fitting right into what is known
as the Ezekiel war scenario.

398
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,401
(Shane) What is the
Ezekiel war scenario?

399
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,411
Eve?

400
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,327
According to the Hebrew
prophet, Ezekiel,

401
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,762
in the Last Days
the people of Persia,

402
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,690
which is, of course, Iran,

403
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,170
and the people of Gog or Rosh,
which many believe to be Russia,

404
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,925
form an alliance
whose main purpose

405
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,044
is to obliterate Israel.

406
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,803
I'm gonna go
talk to your spook.

407
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,368
[phone ringing]

408
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,687
Yes?

409
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,843
(distorted male voice on phone)
Your brother was picked up.

410
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,322
FBI Agent Shane Daughtry.

411
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,011
How would you
like me to proceed?

412
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,567
(distorted male voice on phone) Clean the
house, starting with the sister's bedroom.

413
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,927
You have company.

414
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
See that they
are attended to.

415
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,091
Copy that.

416
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,847
[phone ringing]

417
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,167
Agent Rearden.

418
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,125
(male 3) Apparently your
assassin has a sister.

419
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,564
She's in Baltimore and she
may know about his cause:

420
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,887
Sheila.

421
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,208
You better not be interfering
with this investigation.

422
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,887
(male 3) There are forces of work
here that you refuse to acknowledge

423
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,964
and continue to ignore.

424
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,123
Like it or not, Eve,
you need my help.

425
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,365
Send me the address.

426
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,086
Nick has a sister.

427
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,725
I have to go
to Baltimore.

428
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,883
I'll handle things
with Nick.

429
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,410
Nick, you didn't
tell us you had a sister.

430
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,604
Two agents are on their way
right now to pick her up.

431
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,081
[knocking]

432
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,170
Sheila Tanner?
FBI.

433
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,885
Russ

434
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,287
(Russ) Looks like we're gonna
have to call it in, Evie.

435
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,808
(Shane)
Eleven, missed calls.

436
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,361
The only number
not blocked.

437
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,483
Who've you been
avoiding, Nick?

438
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:39,209
[phone ringing]

439
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,806
Hello?

440
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,526
Eve?
You found her?

441
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,131
Shane, she's already--

442
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,131
[shots firing]

443
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,204
(Shane on phone)
Eve?

444
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,567
Eve?

445
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,683
If my brother's there,
they're already dead.

446
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,405
Russ

447
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,205
Russ!

448
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,201
Agent down! Agent down!

449
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,324
I need EMS and backup
immediately to our location.

450
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,566
Go get him, Evie.

451
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,041
Go get him, Eve.

452
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,560
Go get him.

453
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,243
[shots firing]

454
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,565
Good morning.

455
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,525
Morning.

456
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,323
I'm sorry, Ang.

457
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,971
About what?

458
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,761
(Daniel) Not having a purpose
doesn't give me an excuse

459
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,405
to act like a jerk.

460
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,205
No, it doesn't.

461
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,245
And you do
have a purpose.

462
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,844
Look, I know the last couple
of years have been tough.

463
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,609
Daniel, I just
don't understand

464
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,241
why is it so difficult
for you to--

465
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,050
Sign up?

466
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,367
No.

467
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,004
Believe in something bigger
and better than just this life?

468
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,604
Here you go again
with the Christianese.

469
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,207
Look, we've been over this,
you know?

470
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,124
Year after year
we've been through this.

471
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,487
I just don't get it.

472
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,127
I mean you just woke up one
morning and you just believed

473
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,364
and now I'm supposed to
just follow you?

474
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,880
This hasn't been easy
on me either,

475
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,247
you know?

476
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,841
You've changed; you're a
completely different person.

477
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,081
And you disapprove?

478
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,486
No, it's not that
I disapprove.

479
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,649
I just--I don't
get it, you know?

480
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,007
You've changed.

481
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,930
There's no doubt about it
you've changed for the better.

482
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,362
You're a better person
for it.

483
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,565
It's just, I just can't seem
to wrap my brain around stuff

484
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,008
that you simply
have no problem with.

485
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,327
I don't know why--

486
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,846
Just listen.

487
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,726
You simply believe.

488
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,526
I just--I wish I could
do that too,

489
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,121
but I just--I don't
think that I can.

490
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,971
Baby.

491
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,963
It's a leap of faith
either way.

492
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,203
I know it is.

493
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,801
Do you even believe
that Jesus existed?

494
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,406
Yes, Ang, of course.

495
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,523
There's overwhelming
evidence, okay?

496
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,882
Billions of people celebrate
Christmas and Easter every year.

497
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,491
I get that.
I know that.

498
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,569
Okay, then why did
they crucify him?

499
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,211
What were they
afraid of?

500
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,365
I just wish you would
open your heart

501
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,887
and ask God
to reveal himself to you,

502
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,004
'cause he would,
he will.

503
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,891
I just--I'm gonna need
more time, okay?

504
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,525
Just give me
more time.

505
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,971
Okay.

506
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,681
(Shane) You know what?
She'll Full it out later.

507
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,245
Thanks

508
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,165
Thanks

509
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,003
You all right?

510
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,520
No, I'm not.

511
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,171
I'm not all right.

512
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,762
Look, it's just part
of the job.

513
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,883
You have to accept it
and move on.

514
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,646
Well, that should be
very comforting

515
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,445
to his wife
and children.

516
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,123
It's not your fault,
Eve.

517
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,005
I should have known.

518
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,606
I knew he was there.

519
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,245
I just had this--

520
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,051
Hunch?

521
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,971
Yeah.

522
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,328
(Shane) He's good, Eve.
You couldn't have known.

523
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,965
(Eve) You know, we have
seven nuclear weapons

524
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,129
floating around
within our borders,

525
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,925
a suspect that won't
give us an inch,

526
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,521
and we have two people
dead on our watch.

527
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,444
How are we supposed
to End these nukes?

528
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,842
(Shane) Well, not by sitting here.

529
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,805
We know almost nothing
about Matthew Dean.

530
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,606
The files the CIA gave us
were worthless.

531
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,211
We gotta get
some answers.

532
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,963
(Eve) What if we're supposed to fail?

533
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,928
What do you mean?

534
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,567
(Eve) What if this
really is God's plan?

535
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,689
I don't think
nuclear weapons going off

536
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,170
killing hundreds of thousands
of people is God's plan.

537
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,323
So you do
believe in God.

538
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,641
Ah, I don't know.

539
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,210
I guess I've always thought
there was something

540
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,370
bigger than us.

541
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,170
But that's about it.

542
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,171
You?

543
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,966
My family went through
an abrupt change

544
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,130
in our beliefs
when I was 12.

545
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,240
And one night my father comes
in and tells me about Jesus.

546
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,762
You know, he told me that he
wouldn't force me to believe,

547
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,725
but you know he believed
that Jesus Christ

548
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,843
died for him
on the cross.

549
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,127
You never told
me this before.

550
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,243
I never told anyone.

551
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,647
It just never seemed
poignant until now.

552
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,606
Anyway, when I turned 18,
I moved out of my house

553
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,408
and I--I kept in Contact
with my mother,

554
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,044
but I rarely spoke
to my father.

555
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,045
It just seemed like
every time we talked

556
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:53,129
our conversations would
lead to talks about Jesus.

557
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,803
He would just keep telling me
that Jesus came down to earth

558
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,521
to die for me
on the cross so that--

559
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,643
so that I could be forgiven.

560
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,085
Do you believe that?

561
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,251
I don't know.

562
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,007
I guess I've always been more
of a believe-it-when-I-see-it

563
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,123
type of guy, you know?

564
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,405
Me too.

565
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,803
(Shane) What was he doing
in the Middle East, Jack?

566
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,841
(Jack)
That's classified.

567
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,963
I gave you the files.

568
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,086
The files were useless
and you know it.

569
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,886
Anything that would have shed
light on this was deleted.

570
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,003
Now what's the
revolution of God?

571
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,685
Classified.

572
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,764
We have an imminent
threat on our hands.

573
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,121
We're talking about
the destruction

574
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,687
of the United States
of America.

575
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,091
Millions innocent
people will die.

576
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,522
And you're passing off
the classified stamp?

577
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,491
What are you hiding, Jack?

578
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,450
What are you hiding, Jack?!

579
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,886
(Eve)
Easy.

580
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,003
Take your hands
off me, son.

581
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,211
Now.

582
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,002
Supposedly,
the revolution of God

583
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,721
is a group of high-ranking
world leaders

584
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,970
with plans
for a new world order.

585
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,363
We have not been able
to confirm or deny

586
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,483
the validity
of their existence.

587
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,242
We can.

588
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,726
We have one of their
operatives in custody

589
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,644
so we know they exist.

590
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,041
We also have reason
to believe that he's been

591
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,084
in communication with Dean.

592
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,648
(Jack) Dean is what we call
a nontraditional operative.

593
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,241
He's a covert
operations specialist.

594
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,927
He's a psychological
operations expert

595
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,171
in chaos theory
and unconventional warfare.

596
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,280
His real talent
is destabilizing governments.

597
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,289
And we trained
this guy?

598
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,370
(Jack) You better start thinking
a whole lot more like Dean

599
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,291
if you have any prayer
of catching him

600
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,403
and Ending those nukes.

601
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,010
Yeah, we have our operatives
working on this, as well.

602
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,567
That's what I'm afraid of.

603
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,211
Let's go.

604
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,485
(male 3) Eve, Agent Daughtry,
get in the car please.

605
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,808
(male 3) A couple of years
back, a CIA analyst

606
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,048
began using
prophecy in the Bible

607
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,045
to analyze events
in the Middle East.

608
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,209
There was some
interesting results.

609
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,606
Like what?

610
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,360
Israel recapturing
the western wall in Jerusalem

611
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,005
after the Six-Day war.

612
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,648
There was also a concern
about an event we'd refer to

613
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,405
as the Rapture.

614
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,370
(Eve) Wait, so people
in the administration

615
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,523
were actually concerned
about the Rapture?

616
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,129
(Shane) Rapture meaning
everyone vanishes?

617
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,289
Well, there are many
interpretations about this,

618
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,681
but yes.

619
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,281
Losing a substantial
number of military

620
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,604
and key government personnel
to an apocalyptic event

621
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,248
such as this, could be
problematic at best.

622
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,727
Contingency plans
were needed

623
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,561
so they sent Dean
into the Held to investigate.

624
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,365
We intercepted
a number of phone calls

625
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,483
that may be
of interest to you.

626
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,285
(Shane) Our sources claim
that Russia's Navy

627
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,085
is headed to
the Strait of Hormuz.

628
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,407
Is that true?

629
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,841
We believe so.

630
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,489
So Russia and Iran are involved
in the revolution of God?

631
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,723
We believe that Rockwell
brought the bombs

632
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,843
in through
the Great Lakes.

633
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,361
Simply put,
their primary goal

634
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,889
is to wipe Israel
off the face of the earth.

635
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,650
Taking America
out of the equation

636
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,400
is their first
order of business.

637
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,569
And Dean
is working for him?

638
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,046
We now believe
that Dean

639
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,567
is their number-one
Held lieutenant.

640
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,366
Essentially, their
boots-on-the-ground commander.

641
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,403
Plan the CIA.

642
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,723
We're talking about
the end, Eve.

643
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,688
Agent Daughtry,
my daughter's life

644
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,760
is in your hands
and so is lsrael's.

645
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,045
The two of you
have been chosen.

646
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,890
Put aside
your differences.

647
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,083
Forget the past.

648
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,926
There's no longer
any need for that.

649
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,281
We have to succeed.

650
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,406
We have to End those bombs
and we have to End them now.

651
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,403
[knocking]

652
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,601
Yes?

653
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,807
Hi, I was wondering
if you've seen my dog around?

654
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,525
No, I haven't.

655
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,963
He's just this little
Jack Russell,

656
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,611
a little
black and white thing.

657
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,763
You want to
take a look out back?

658
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,883
Yeah, that'd be
great if you don't mind.

659
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,766
No, no, please.

660
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,411
Yeah, oh, sure.

661
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,965
Excuse me, ma'am?

662
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,483
Sorry, we're closed
for the evening.

663
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,923
We're with the FBI.

664
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,486
We were hoping you could
hold the door open for us

665
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,091
for just a few minutes.

666
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,645
FBI, huh?

667
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,405
Just a few minutes.

668
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,047
Zeus,
come here, boy.

669
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,651
Zeus?

670
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,883
(Daniel) Probably just out in
the street playing somewhere.

671
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,005
Thanks for your help,
though.

672
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,491
I'll see you later.

673
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,043
Have a good evening,
Daniel.

674
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,846
Well, at least
the public library

675
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,884
still carries a Bible.

676
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,440
Nice.

677
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,564
Okay,
Ezekiel's war scenario.

678
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,250
You never mentioned your father
was a high-level agent.

679
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,885
You never asked.

680
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,245
Anyway, he considers himself
my guardian angel.

681
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,091
Plus if people knew,
including you,

682
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,646
I'd have been given
special treatment

683
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,251
and I didn't want it.

684
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,405
You knew.

685
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,165
You had your reasons
for keeping it quiet.

686
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,811
I can respect that.

687
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,483
I'm sorry
for everything.

688
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,325
Yeah, me too.

689
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,563
I shouldn't have
left you like that.

690
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,848
You had every right
to leave me.

691
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,964
I shouldn't have put you in that
situation in the first place.

692
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,685
I'm sorry.

693
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,525
So does your father really
believe this End-Times scenario?

694
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,882
He's been preaching it
for a long time now.

695
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,164
He and his people have been
paying close attention to it.

696
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,487
You believe it?

697
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,807
I believe we need
to End these nukes

698
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,929
or we're all gonna End out
the truth real soon.

699
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,483
Sorry, I didn't tell you
about my father.

700
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,924
You looking to buy
a used Harley?

701
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,043
Only if it's
American-made.

702
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,011
Cash first.

703
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,484
Aren't you a little old
to be buying a fake ID?

704
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,930
(Eve) Okay, the audio
files were encrypted

705
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,531
Masad cleaned them.

706
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,285
(recorded male voice)
This is the fallen one.

707
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,801
(recorded distorted male voice) Hello, my son.
Is there much to report?

708
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,286
(recorded male voice)
The stork is delivered.

709
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,965
Seven Wonders
is in good hands.

710
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,571
We're waiting
the decalogue from ----

711
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,171
Wait, wait.

712
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,446
Just play it again
from the beginning.

713
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,690
(recorded male voice)
This is the fallen one.

714
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,247
(recorded distorted male voice) Hello, my son.
Is there much to report?

715
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,726
(recorded male voice)
The stork is delivered.

716
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,570
Seven Wonders
is in good hands.

717
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,081
We're awaiting
the decalogue from Mother.

718
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,044
(recorded distorted male voice)
Decalogue will be delivered soon.

719
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,641
Seven Wonders
will proceed as planned.

720
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,930
Stork?

721
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,247
Who's Stork?

722
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,567
Could that have--

723
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,211
could that
have been Rockwell?

724
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,130
That would make sense
if he was the one

725
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,767
who smuggled the bombs
into the United States.

726
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,565
In good hands?

727
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,769
Stork delivered?

728
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,407
In good hands?

729
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,051
(Eve)
What?

730
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,651
They're all
in the same place,

731
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,843
the nukes.

732
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,646
They haven't gone
anywhere yet.

733
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,287
This conversation was recorded
a couple days ago.

734
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,481
The bombs
are still all together.

735
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,603
They were
transported together.

736
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,561
We may still have a chance
at intercepting them all.

737
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,403
What's decalogue?

738
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,288
(Librarian) Decalogue,
the Ten Commandments,

739
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,370
the code by which
we are all to live.

740
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,001
You kids never read
the Bible anymore, do you?

741
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,164
Look it up,
D for decalogue.

742
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,848
All right, D.

743
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,844
She was right,
the Ten Commandments

744
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,687
or precepts given by God
to Moses at Mount Sinai

745
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,970
and originally written
on two tablets of stone.

746
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,802
(Shane) The code by which we
are all supposed to live.

747
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,286
The code.

748
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,403
Codes

749
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,210
They're waiting
on the army codes.

750
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,164
From Mother.

751
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,046
They're waiting on Mother,
Mother Russia.

752
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,163
The codes are coming
from Russia.

753
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,407
So this new loose end
must have been Rockwell.

754
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,523
Then he wasn't
the stork.

755
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,686
I don't think so.

756
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,530
I mean the stork
carries newborns.

757
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,325
Your father said that he thought
Rockwell carried the bombs

758
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,523
down through
the Great Lakes.

759
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,485
So the stork
must be a ship.

760
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,570
Are there any Russian
or eastern European names

761
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,205
on these lists?

762
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,482
I don't know,
there's 500 ships on this list.

763
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,410
What country of origin
do you think it came from?

764
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,887
Russia, Germany?

765
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Germany.

766
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,563
A ship named Storch.

767
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,285
Chicago.

768
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,403
The bombs
are in Chicago.

769
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,601
(Matthew Dean)
This is fallen leader.

770
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,245
Our timeline
has been moved up.

771
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,881
Prepare for
immediate deployment.

772
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,802
We're out of time,
Nick.

773
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,844
You know what
narcosynthesis is?

774
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,366
You should,

775
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,563
your friends
came up with it

776
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,683
except they
called it SB17.

777
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,008
That's gonna hurt.

778
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,408
Just relax.

779
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,451
Let it work.

780
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,001
The sting you feel
is a thiopental part

781
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,930
of a new and improved
concoction.

782
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,603
Not like the truth serum
your old man used to use.

783
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,211
Is it working, Nick?

784
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,884
This makes lying more complex
than telling the truth.

785
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,248
It will help ensure
things go smoother,

786
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,851
quicker.

787
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,486
Where are the bombs,
Nick?

788
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,125
Where are they?

789
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,206
It's too late for you
and your little girlfriend.

790
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,767
Bombs--

791
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,887
I had hoped that you
were smarter than most.

792
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,970
Yes,
we're organized.

793
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,642
I know who you are,
Shane.

794
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,001
Where are they?

795
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,682
(Nick) You shouldn't be so
concerned with the suitcases.

796
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,965
America's been caught sleeping,
blinded by selfishness.

797
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,123
Where are the bombs?!

798
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,443
Blood will flow, starting with
your little Israeli friends,

799
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,563
we should
cut off their head.

800
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,810
What Israeli friends?!

801
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,690
Cut off what head?!

802
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,365
I am but one,
but we are many.

803
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,165
There are millions of us.

804
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,807
We're a tide that will not
be turned away.

805
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,004
We will wipe Israel
from the face of the earth.

806
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,011
As it is written,
the peace agreement

807
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,328
will never happen.

808
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,483
(Eve) What about the peace agreement?

809
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,051
You smell that?

810
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,164
(Eve) There's a plot aimed
at the peace agreement?

811
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,723
(Nick) We will begin
with the little scene.

812
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,047
We shall cut off its head

813
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,362
beginning with
the prime minister.

814
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,007
Where, Nick, where are
they gonna hit the delegation?

815
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,646
Conference
of Jerusalem.

816
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,007
Do not weep for me,

817
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,601
but weep for yourselves
and your children.

818
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,209
The day that they will come
when they will say

819
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,369
blessed are the wombs
that never bore

820
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,847
and the breasts
that never nursed.

821
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,167
[screaming]

822
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,283
(Eve)
Where, Nick, where?

823
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,967
The revolution of God.

824
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,049
The delegation
will board the plane

825
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,530
and my brother will deliver them
and they will be no more.

826
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,449
Dean.

827
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,610
He's gonna blow up
the prime minister's plane.

828
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,889
Take him back
to holding!

829
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,246
You get
to the delegation.

830
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,364
I'll call you when
I hit the ground in Chicago.

831
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,131
Shane.

832
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,325
I will be back
for you.

833
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,965
I promise.

834
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,286
This is Agent Rearden.

835
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,800
Get me the head
of the delegation

836
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,127
security detail
immediately.

837
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,606
They're in
imminent danger.

838
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,251
They've got ground
transportation waiting for us

839
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,885
on the tarmac in Chicago.

840
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,004
I want Jack Thompson on the
phone as soon as we take off.

841
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,723
(Eve) I understand it's not protocol.

842
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,685
I believe the delegation
has been targeted.

843
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,200
The suspect is leading
an operation

844
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,522
for a rogue
organization.

845
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,644
(male on radio) Fallen leader, we
are approaching insertion point.

846
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,045
We're in position.

847
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,965
[grunts]

848
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,611
(male on radio)
Two, one, Ere.

849
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,251
[shots firing]

850
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,010
(male on radio)
Target is neutralized.

851
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,123
Fallen leader,
the tarmac is clear.

852
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,725
Identification, sir.

853
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,683
Nypen, Corey.

854
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,365
Got your woolies on?

855
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,401
Cold one tonight, boys.

856
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,728
Yes, sir,
stand by please.

857
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,371
This will just
take a minute.

858
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,886
(male 2 on radio) Nypen,
Corey all clear.

859
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,523
(soldier) You're good to go, sir.
Carry on.

860
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,451
Dad, it's Eve.
Where are you?

861
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,563
Call me back
immediately.

862
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,810
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to open up your tool bag there.

863
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,127
Oh, yeah, sure.

864
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,283
Here, let me
help you out.

865
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,487
FBI, I need to see
the delegation.

866
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,811
Matthew Dean!

867
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,011
FBI!

868
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:27,601
[gunfire]

869
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,245
No!

870
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,723
[explosion]

871
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,444
Hey, how you doin'??

872
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,767
Good, you?

873
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,405
Good, good, good.

874
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,689
So you locked
yourself out, huh?

875
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,603
Yeah, yeah, work's been crazy
and just lost my keys so.

876
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,450
Lose your mind
if you're not careful.

877
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,767
That's what
my mom always said.

878
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,411
Right, right.

879
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,045
Will this take long?

880
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,283
It will take
as long as it takes.

881
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,607
Okay.

882
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,967
You got some l.D.?

883
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,571
Yeah, yeah,
sure, of course.

884
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,411
Here you go.

885
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,565
All right,
let's see what we got.

886
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,171
Okay.

887
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,809
Feel like such an idiot,
you know,

888
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,451
locking myself out.

889
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,250
It's just that I have this
dinner party to get to

890
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,363
and so I'm really
in a hurry to--

891
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,324
Man, you put a lot
of money into this lock.

892
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,841
Yeah, yeah, I did.

893
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,088
You can never be
too careful.

894
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,606
I have to get
another tool.

895
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,644
Really?

01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:06,128
[drill whirling]

897
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,885
Ah, great.

898
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,844
Home sweet home.

899
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,963
What do I owe you?

900
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,531
I'll send you
a bill.

901
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,643
You're gonna
send me a bill?

01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,045
(Eve) Shane, I didn't make it.

906
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,288
We lost the delegation.

907
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,921
Masad is sending you
addresses right now.

908
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,923
I'm sorry, Shane.

909
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,127
Eve, we're gonna stop
those bombs, trust me.

910
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,366
I know this sounds
crazy coming from me,

911
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,531
but have faith.
