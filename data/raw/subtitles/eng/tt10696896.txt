hopes up until we know more.

714
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,299
She's getting on,
your grandmother.

715
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,303
Oh, I had a meeting
with the judge yesterday.

716
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,306
Oh, yeah? About what?

717
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,829
Well, I have my parole review

718
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,874
coming up
in about three months.

719
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,050
And, uh, it's the thing
where I get out of here

720
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,051
one day a month.

721
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,444
Yeah, okay.

722
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,099
- So what'd he say?
- She. She said.

723
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:42,972
Uh, you know, as long as
my behavior remained good,

724
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,452
shouldn't be a problem.

725
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,760
I felt like saying,
"Fuck parole.

726
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,805
My lawyer's working on getting
me out of here for good."

727
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,416
No, we don't know that yet,
Ally.

728
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,809
- You got to keep...
- I know, I know, I know, Dad.

729
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,986
I-I didn't say that.
But I wanted to.

730
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,033
And... somebody from
Leparq's office was there.

731
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,470
Oh, yeah?

732
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,212
Yeah. I never met her,
but I asked her

733
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,301
how the investigation was going.

734
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,825
What'd she tell you?

735
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,697
She said she didn't know
anything about it,

736
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,047
but she also said
she just started working there.

737
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,876
Leparq's probably
taking care of it herself.

738
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,356
It's a big case.

739
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,835
(softly):
Yeah.

740
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,837
I told her I wanted
to talk to Leparq.

741
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,361
She should be
keeping us informed.

742
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,319
- You know what I mean?
- I'll talk to her.

743
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,712
(knock on door)

744
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,933
Okay. Well...

745
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,718
I'll see you in a couple days.

746
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,763
Uh, Dad, do you think that
you could stay in Marseille

747
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,199
a little longer?

748
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,940
Just in case
something comes up.

749
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,160
Yeah, I could do that.

750
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:43,206
I'll check in on work
and stuff.

751
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,904
(door opens)

752
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,819
I-I can have Gram wire you
some money if you need.

753
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,777
No, no, don't do that.
I-I'll figure it out.

754
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,257
Thanks, Dad.

755
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,912
Bye.

Nedjma is a technical genius.

I'm not a genius.
I'm just younger.

- Okay...
- These are online or some shit?

789
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,358
These are all from
Instagram accounts

790
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,491
of Souad and her bitchy friend.

791
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,102
And these photos
are all from the party.

792
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,408
How'd y'all get them?

793
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,541
I set up
a false Instagram account,

794
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,500
followed Souad and her lovely
friend whose name is Samira,

795
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,067
and then geotagged the party

796
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,895
Souad was at
when she saw this guy.

797
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:33,246
So there's a chance
Akim is in one of these photos.

798
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,253
VIRGINIE:
...Arab and light skin.

799
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,037
Yeah, uh, light skin,
yeah, and tall.

800
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:50,132
So we're going
to print them up,

801
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:52,047
and then you can show them
to Allison.

802
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,355
- No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

803
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,400
If Akim is there, she'll know.

804
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,141
I don't care.

805
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,274
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna do it to her.

806
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,928
I got to protect her.

807
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,407
I don't understand.

808
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,410
Wh-why you're being
so stubborn about Allison?

809
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:09,325
What we should do
is go back to Souad

810
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:10,936
now we got those pictures.

811
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,634
Well, we stole these photos
from Instagram,

812
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,505
so I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

What's the name?

00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,961
I don't remember
the name of it.

824

826
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,332

<i>Ah. Voilà.</i>

830
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,733
- I didn't vote.
- VIRGINIE: What?

831
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,605
- Why didn't you vote?
- Got a record.

832
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,129
I was arrested.

833
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,218
They don't let you vote
when that happens.

Your friend, uh, Nedjma...

837
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,682
she mad at you for helping me?

838
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,772
Don't worry about Nedjma;
she's generally hostile.

839
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:50,209
You know, she's very protective
with me,

840
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,689

844
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,612

00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,189

find the old owner?

00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,579
Yes, I know.

861
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,755

862

I'm sorry. I just, uh... I can't
talk to that guy anymore.

874
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,275

some horrible things.

875
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,885
Like what?

876
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,931
Like he just wants to put
an Arab kid in jail, you know?

877
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,758
He doesn't care which one.

878
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,804
That's it?

879
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,502
That's it?
What do you mean, "That's it"?

880
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:34,677
He's a racist.

881
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,375
Okay, he's a racist.

882
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,680
We still got to talk to him.

883
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,682
No. I don't talk to him, no.

884
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,554
Well, he might know something.

885
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,208
No, he doesn't know something!

886
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,471
Bill, we're not gonna send
an innocent boy to jail.

887

I've come with some
extraordinary news.

1976
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:52,354
The judge in your daughter's
case called me this morning.

1977
02:04:52,397 --> 02:04:54,095
New evidence has surfaced.

1978
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:56,097
Apparently, a retired cop

1979
02:04:56,140 --> 02:04:59,317
came up with a DNA match
on the unknown sample.

1980
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:02,320
It also matched
a sample the police collected

1981
02:05:02,364 --> 02:05:04,192
on a burglary case
four years ago,

1982
02:05:04,235 --> 02:05:06,194

1983
02:05:06,237 --> 02:05:07,543
Did they catch him?

1984

No, not yet.

1985
02:05:10,067 --> 02:05:13,462
But all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt.

1986
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:16,160
So even if they can't
find the suspect,

1987
02:05:16,204 --> 02:05:18,336
there's a real chance
they will release Allison.

1988
02:05:19,337 --> 02:05:21,557
In fact, the judge
has already agreed

1989
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:26,214
to reopen the investigation,
which is almost unheard of.

1990
