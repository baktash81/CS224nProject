it's a bit daft not to try and use it.

182
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,565
What's daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open

183
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,321
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

184

Yeah, well, my point still stands.

193

Oh, Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun really.

Now listen, have you spoken
with your sister?

201
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,938
You know I haven't, Mum.

202
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,856
- Give me your hand.
- There she goes.

203
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,941
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

What happened between you?

She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

She stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick.

To stab someone using a brick?

295
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,983
- Get to the point.
- The point is

296
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,061
there's no sharp edge.

297
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,265
How did she get an entire brick

298
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,725
into another person's chest?

299
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,325
She either had to be really strong

300
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,690
or the other person
had to have been, like,

301
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,896
born without, like, bones.

I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours:

358
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:36,931
Mr. Nobody.

359
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,015
Mr. Nobody.

360
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,274
Little joke for you, Loeb.

361
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,233

and baseballs have in common?

362

367

is not like anything we've ever seen.

368
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,665
It's a programmable disease

369
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,500
that can target any DNA sequence

370
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,666
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

371
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,415
If MI6 finds her,

372
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,007

373
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,972

to surrender the virus.

377
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,687

378
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,611

a job together in New York?

Where shall I start?

567
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,519
There's two types of CIA agents.

pick up a building.

00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,319
But espionage is about blending in

00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,401
and about being subtle,

574
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:17,065

575
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,948

about somebody when you fight them.

582
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,675

583

you weren't fighting to kill me.

- HATTIE: About 30 hours ago.

889
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,562
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

890
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:47,905
So we need to neutralize it.

891
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,020
No, it is not that easy.

892
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:51,694
It's not programmed to any DNA sequence.

893
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,025
It's fatal to everyone.

894
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,990
In 42 hours, the capsules will dissolve,

895
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,070
and she will be infected.

896
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,284
Then the virus will go airborne.

897
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,525
We are talking global
contamination within a week.

00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,448
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?

899
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:04,997
Because I thought I was one of them.

00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:07,174
They told me they wanted to

902
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:08,499
save the world through science.

903
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,004
I believed in their cause.

904
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:13,455

to be a carrier for vaccines,

a programmable apocalypse.

To attack the weakest of us.

908

vision of the future.

All right, you said
the virus is programmable.

913
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,694
So... reprogram it.

914
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,734
I can't reprogram it in a host.

this thing out from me.

00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,861
Well, there are two options.

917
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,910
And the first is easy.

918
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,200
- Go.
- Finally.

919
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:42,783
- You kill her.
- Excuse me?

920
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,038
Oh, and burn the body, of course.

No, I mean really burn it.

923
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,960
- Really burn it.
- To ash.

924
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,670
- To ash?
- Beyond all recognition.

925
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,420
Let's assume that that's not an option,
shall we, genius?

926
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,133
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.

927
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,963
There is a machine
that could preserve her life

928
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,048
and extract the virus.

929
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,432
That should've been option number one.

930
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,089
Because it's impossible to get to.

931
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,467
We'll decide what's impossible.
Where is it?

932
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,104

1090
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:37,381

1091
