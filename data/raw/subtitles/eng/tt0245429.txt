1
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,647
"I'll miss you, Chihiro.
Your best friend, Rumi."

2
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:20,801
Chihiro.
Chihiro, we're almost there.

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,320
This really is
in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:28,126
I'm gonna have to go
to the next town to shop.

5
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,437
We'll just have to
learn to like it.

6
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:36,481
Look, Chihiro. There's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

7
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,086
It doesn't look so bad.

8
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:51,363
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

9
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:56,485
Mom!
My flowers are dying!

10
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:59,240
I told you not to smother them
like that.

11
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:03,286
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

12
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:07,076
I fiinally get a bouquet, and it's
a goodbye present. That's depressing.

13
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,523
Daddy bought you a rose for your
birthday. Don't you remember?

14
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:13,838
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

15
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:16,395
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

16
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:20,196
And quit whining.
It's fun to move to a new place.

17
00:01:56,607 --> 00:02:00,282
Wait.
Did I take the wrong turn?

18
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,726
This can't be right.

19
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:05,241
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

20
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,716
It's that blue one on the end.

21
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:11,561
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turn-off.

22
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,081
This road should get us there.

23
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,477
Honey, don't take a short cut.
You always get us lost.

24
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,523
Trust me. It's gonna work.

25
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,677
What are those stones?
They look like little houses.

26
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,918
They're shrines. Some people think
little spirits live there.

27
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:35,282
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fiine. I've got four-wheel drive.

28
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,686
Sit down, please, sweetie.

29
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,157
Slow down!
You're gonna kill us.

30
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:03,241
What's that?

31
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:21,078
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

32
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,716
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

33
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,638
Chihiro.

34
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,638
Oh, for heaven's sake.

35
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,400
This building's not old. It's fake.

36
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,684
These stones are just made of plaster.

37
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,839
- The wind's pulling us in.
- What is it?

38
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,122
Come on. Let's go in.
I want to see what's on the other side.

39
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

40
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:56,404
Don't be such a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.
Let's just take a look.

41
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,637
The movers will get to our house
before we do.

42
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:02,356
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

43
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:06,042
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

44
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,116
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

45
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:13,563
- Come on, honey. It'll be fun.
- I'm not going!

46
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,479
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

47
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,158
But, Mom!

48
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,595
Wait for me!

49
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:38,884
Everybody watch your step.

50
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:42,039
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

51
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,596
- What is this place?
- Oh, do you hear that?

52
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:29,277
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

53
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,676
Come on.
Let's go check it out.

54
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:11,766
- What are those weird buildings?
- I knew it.

55
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:15,556
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

56
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,242
They built them everywhere
in the early '90s.

57
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:23,206
Then the economy went bad,
and they all went bankrupt.

58
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,198
This must be one of them.

59
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:28,245
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

60
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,966
Now let's go back.

61
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:35,318
Hey!

62
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,524
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

63
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,122
It's just the wind.
Oh, what a beautiful place.

64
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,767
We should have brought our lunch.
Then we could have had a picnic.

65
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,802
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

66
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,521
Hey, you smell that?

67
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,519
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

68
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,838
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

69
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,556
- Chihiro, hurry it up.
- Wait a minute.

70
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,525
This way.

71
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,763
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

72
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,042
Where is everybody?

73
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,165
Ah, there it is.

74
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,205
Hey, I found it!

75
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,278
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

76
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,036
Ah, look at this.

77
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:32,039
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

78
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,880
Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.

79
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,958
Anybody?

80
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:44,163
Don't worry, honey.
We can pay the bill when they get back.

81
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,920
Good plan.
Hey, that looks great.

82
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,475
I wonder what this is called.

83
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,878
Oh, it's delicious.
Chihiro, you have to taste this.

84
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:58,518
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

85
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,679
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

86
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,235
He's got credit cards and cash.

87
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:12,519
Chihiro, you have to try this.
It's so tender.

88
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,598
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

89
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:28,682
Come on, you guys.
You can't.

90
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,918
That's weird.

91
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:11,400
There's the train.

92
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,918
You shouldn't be here.
Get out of here now!

93
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,918
- What?
- It's almost night.

94
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,918
Leave, before it gets dark.

95
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,841
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

96
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:35,476
You've gotta get across the river.
Go! I'll distract them.

97
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,001
What's up with him?

98
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,478
Mom! Dad!

99
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:05,004
Come on! Quit eating!
Let's get out of here!

100
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:35,880
Mom! Dad!
Where are you?

101
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:45,919
Mommy!

102
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,724
Water?

103
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:26,522
What?
I'm dreaming! I'm dreaming!

104
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,801
Come on.
Wake up! Wake up!

105
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,560
Wake up.

106
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:42,720
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

107
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:45,799
Away. Disappear.

108
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,278
I'm see-through!

109
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,998
It's just a bad dream.

110
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:56,276
Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

111
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,437
No! No! No!

112
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,597
Open your mouth and eat this.

113
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:04,396
- You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.
- No!

114
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,238
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

115
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,363
Chew it and swallow.

116
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:26,557
There you go.
You're all better.

117
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,717
See for yourself.

118
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,887
- I'm okay.
- You see?

119
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,640
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

120
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,002
They didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

121
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:46,760
You can't see them now,
but you will.

122
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,042
Don't move.

123
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:13,405
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

124
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:16,126
Ah! My legs!
I can't stand up.

125
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,879
Help! What do I do?

126
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:21,118
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

127
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:28,119
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

128
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,004
Get up.

129
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:15,006
You have to hold your breath
while we cross the bridge.

130
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:21,037
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

131
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:27,398
I'm scared.

132
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,398
Now, just stay calm.

133
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:32,399
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

134
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,921
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

135
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,396
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ah, welcome.

136
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:39,398
Welcome back, Master Haku.

137
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:42,365
Take a deep breath.

138
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,517
Hold it.

139
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,326
- Welcome. Welcome.
- It's good to see you.

140
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,403
Hang on. Almost there.

141
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:12,286
Master Haku!
Where have you been?

142
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,477
Wha... A human?

143
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,637
Let's go!

144
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,966
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

145
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:41,723
Here. Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,
it stinks up the place.

146
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,605
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

147
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,678
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

148
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,565
Listen carefully
to what I tell you to do.

149
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,205
You can't stay here.
They'll fiind you...

150
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,278
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

151
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,358
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

152
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,677
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

153
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:01,203
You don't have any choice
if you want to help your parents.

154
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,198
This is what you have to do.

155
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:07,075
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

156
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,078
Don't worry.

157
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:13,843
Now, when things quiet down,
go out through the back gate.

158
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,839
Go all the way down the stairs
until you reach the boiler room...

159
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,202
where they stoke the fiires.

160
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:23,883
There you'll fiind Kamajii,
the boiler man.

161
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,844
Kamajii?

162
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:29,966
Tell him you want to work here.
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

163
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,960
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

164
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,958
Yubaba. Huh?

165
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,436
You'll see.
She's the witch who rules the bathhouse.

166
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:42,076
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

167
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,476
but just keep asking for work.

168
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,161
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

169
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,715
- Then even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,719
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

171
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,641
I have to go. And don't forget,
Chihiro, I'm your friend.

172
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,479
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

173
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,956
I've known you since you were
very small. Good luck.

174
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,959
And whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

175
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,958
Master Haku.

176
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,038
Calm down. I'm coming.

177
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,236
Master Haku,
Yubaba wants to see you.

178
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:16,366
I know.
It's about my mission, right?

179
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:27,361
Uh, hello? Excuse me.

180
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,080
Uh, hello?

181
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,882
Uh, hello.
Are you Kamajii?

182
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,435
Eh?

183
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:56,202
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.
Could you give me a job, please?

184
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:04,560
Four bath tokens at once.

185
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:07,002
Come on.
Get to work, you little runts.

186
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:13,481
Yeah, I'm Kamajii, slave to the
boiler that heats the baths.

187
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:16,320
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

188
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,001
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

189
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,998
I don't need any help.

190
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:24,045
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

191
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:26,402
and I've got all
the workers I need.

192
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,276
Oh. Sorry.

193
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,596
Wait. Just a second.

194
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,597
Out of the way.

195
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:57,561
What should I do with this?

196
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:08,159
- Should I leave it here?
- Finish what you started, human.

197
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:11,959
Hey, you runts.
You wanna turn back into soot?

198
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:15,596
And you, back off.
You can't just take someone else's job.

199
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:19,077
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

200
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:23,479
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

201
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:35,558
You soot balls got a problem?
Now, get back to work!

202
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,366
Chow time. What's going on?

203
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:41,677
Are you guys fiighting again?

204
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:46,476
Where's your other bowl?
From yesterday?

205
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:49,286
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

206
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,437
Meal time!
Take a break.

207
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:12,046
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

208
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:15,241
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

209
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:20,686
She said she wants to work here,
but I've got all the help I need.

210
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:24,282
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

211
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:26,278
I think she can handle it.

212
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:29,006
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

213
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:32,716
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

214
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:35,560
Mm, it's a good one.

215
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:39,686
If you want a job,
you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

216
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:42,156
She's the head honcho here.

217
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:46,159
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

218
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,200
- Can't you even manage
a-a "yes, ma'am" or a "thank you"?
- Yes, ma'am.

219
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,198
What a dope. Hurry up.

220
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,517
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,677
Uh, you don't need your shoes
or your socks.

222
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,405
- Just leave 'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:12,924
Thank the boiler man,
you idiot.

224
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:15,475
You know he's really
sticking his neck out for you.

225
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:19,685
Ow! Thank you,
Mr Boiler Man.

226
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:22,520
Good luck.

227
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:33,605
We have to go all the way
to the top floor.

228
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:35,996
That's where Yubaba lives.

229
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,079
Get over here.

230
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,476
You want to lose your nose?

231
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,484
More appetizers.

232
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:13,684
- I've run out of those.
- They're not spicy enough.

233
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,797
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

234
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,966
Here we go.

235
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:35,645
The radish spirit.

236
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,562
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

237
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,241
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

238
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,081
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

239
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:29,121
Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

240
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:36,167
Your rooms are right this way.

241
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,077
- Rin?
- What?

242
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:46,123
What's that smell?
It's human.

243
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:49,085
- You smell just like a human.
- Oh, really?

244
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,603
Where's it coming from, Rin?
Come on.

245
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,326
You're hiding something,
aren't you?

246
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,116
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

247
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:01,880
Roasted newt.

248
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:05,243
No way, frog. I'm saving
every last bite for myself.

249
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:08,160
Please, just a little bit?
Just give me a leg.

250
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:12,525
If you want to go up,
pull the lever on your right.

251
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,877
Aren't you even
going to knock?

252
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:03,596
You're the most pathetic
little girl I've ever seen.

253
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:15,883
Well, come in.

254
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,244
I said come in!

255
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,200
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

256
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,360
Excuse me?

257
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:13,881
I was wondering
if you could give me a job.

258
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,439
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

259
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,837
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

260
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:32,806
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

261
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:37,040
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

262
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:41,245
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

263
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:46,162
And you humans always make
a mess of things, like your parents...

264
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:51,196
who gobbled up the food
of the spirits like pigs.

265
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:56,919
They got what they deserved.
And you should be punished too.

266
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,443
You could be a piglet.

267
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:06,486
Or maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal.

268
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:15,959
I can see you shaking.

269
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:19,278
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

270
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,996
But I'm sure you didn't
do it on your own.

271
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,647
Let's thank
whoever helped you.

272
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:30,118
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

273
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,678
Please!
Can't you give me a job?

274
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,884
- Don't start that again!
- Please! I just want to work!

275
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:43,519
Don't say that!

276
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:50,636
Why in the world do you think
I should give you a job?

277
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,640
Anyone can see you're a lazy,
spoiled crybaby...

278
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,321
and you have no manners.

279
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:00,638
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

280
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:03,321
So there's no job for you.
Now get out.

281
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:06,160
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

282
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:12,524
Or maybe I'll give you
the most diffiicult job I've got...

283
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:18,557
and work you until you
breathe your very last breath.

284
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:34,363
Oh, dear!
You woke up the baby.

285
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:38,518
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

286
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,882
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

287
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,923
I want you
to give me a job, please!

288
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:46,283
Quiet down.
You're scaring the baby... Ooh!

289
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:50,276
Hi, sweetie.
Don't be angry.

290
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:53,915
That's a good boy.

291
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:56,316
I'm not leaving
until you give me a job!

292
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:59,399
Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

293
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:04,402
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

294
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,243
That's your contract.

295
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:29,285
Sign your name away...

296
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,756
and I'll put you to work.

297
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:34,202
If I hear one little complaint
out of you...

298
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:37,245
you'll be joining your parents
in the pigpen.

299
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:40,000
So l...
Do I sign my name here?

300
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,318
Just sign it!
Do you want the job or not?

301
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,961
I can't believe
I took that oath...

302
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:53,959
to give a job
to anyone who asks.

303
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:59,757
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

304
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,518
Are you done yet?

305
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:10,004
- So your name's Chihiro.
- Yes, ma'am.

306
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:12,999
What a pretty name.

307
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:25,198
And it belongs to me now.

308
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:28,563
From now on your name
is Sen. You got that?

309
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:31,241
- Answer me, Sen!
- Oh. Yes, ma'am.

310
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,157
You called for me?

311
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,637
This girl signed a contract.
Set her up with a job.

312
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:42,560
Right. What's your name?

313
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:46,196
What? Chih...
Oh, it's Sen.

314
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:48,482
Okay, Sen, follow me.

315
00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:00,676
- Haku, uh...
- Don't talk to me.

316
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:02,997
And address me
as Master Haku.

317
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,683
I don't care if Yubaba
gets angry with us.

318
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,678
We're not taking humans.

319
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:26,406
- She's already under contract.
- What?

320
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,045
I promise to work very hard.

321
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,243
We are not going to take her
in our department.

322
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:31,806
She'll stink up the whole place.

323
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:35,684
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will go away.

324
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:38,327
And if she doesn't work hard,
roast her...

325
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:41,205
boil her,
do whatever you want.

326
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:43,801
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

327
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:46,321
What? Don't you
dump her on me!

328
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,318
You said
you wanted an assistant.

329
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:50,557
That's perfect.
Give the girl to Rin.

330
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:52,558
- Oh, great.
- Sen, get going.

331
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,399
Right.

332
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:58,400
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku, you hear me?

333
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:00,045
Have a nice day.

334
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,401
Hmph.

335
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:04,204
Come on.

336
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,723
- I can't believe you pulled it off.
- Huh?

337
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:16,798
You're such a dope.
I was really worried.

338
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,482
Now keep on your toes. And if
you need anything, ask me, okay?

339
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:24,321
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

340
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,318
I don't feel so good.

341
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:34,365
So this is our room.

342
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:37,086
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fiine.

343
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:43,524
Here's your apron. You have
to wash it yourself. Your pants.

344
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:46,118
You're so puny.

345
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,566
Way too big.

346
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,360
- Rin, you know Haku?
- What about him?

347
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,563
There aren't two of him
here, are they?

348
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,559
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one.

349
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,764
Too big.
He's Yubaba's henchman.

350
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:03,678
Don't trust anything he says.

351
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,884
Let's see.

352
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,197
Aha. Here we go.

353
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,642
Wh-What...
What's wrong with you?

354
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:18,241
Are you feeling okay?

355
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:20,841
Quiet down.
What's your problem?

356
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:23,839
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

357
00:44:55,327 --> 00:45:00,082
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

358
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:46,083
My shoes are gone.

359
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:52,401
Huh?

360
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,205
Thank you.

361
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:10,965
Follow me.

362
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:58,323
Mom! Dad! Are you all right?
It's me, Sen! Hey, wake up!

363
00:47:58,407 --> 00:48:01,444
Mom! Dad!

364
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,523
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

365
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:09,326
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

366
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:13,366
They don't remember
being human.

367
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:20,956
Don't you worry! I promise
I'll get you out of here!

368
00:48:21,047 --> 00:48:24,278
So just don't get any fatter!
Or they'll eat you!

369
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:35,115
Here are your clothes.
Hide them.

370
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,163
I thought they'd
been thrown away.

371
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,681
You'll need them to get home.

372
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,758
My goodbye card's still here.

373
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,200
Chihiro.

374
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:56,041
Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

375
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:59,199
That's how Yubaba controls you,
by stealing your name.

376
00:48:59,287 --> 00:49:01,721
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

377
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,116
And while you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

378
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:07,961
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

379
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:12,006
If you completely forget it,
you'll never fiind your way home.

380
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,965
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

381
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,958
You can't remember
your name?

382
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:20,084
No. But for some reason
I remember yours.

383
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,800
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

384
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:27,525
No.

385
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:31,600
I put a spell on it so it'll give you
back your strength. Just eat it.

386
00:50:08,247 --> 00:50:10,397
Have some more.
You'll be all right.

387
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:28,120
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku.

388
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,198
You're a good friend.

389
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:07,184
Where were you, Sen?
I was really worried.

390
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:08,415
I'm sorry.

391
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:19,538
Out of my way.

392
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:34,825
Hey, Sen, haven't you ever
worked a day in your life?

393
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:37,739
Rin and Sen,
you get the big tub today.

394
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:40,056
What?
Hey, that's frog work.

395
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:43,183
Orders from the top.
So quit your complaining.

396
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,257
Hello. Aren't you getting
wet out there?

397
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:12,224
- Sen, hurry up!
- Coming.

398
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:14,297
I'll leave the door
open for you.

399
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,181
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
- Leave me alone.

400
00:53:48,106 --> 00:53:50,779
Those jerks. They haven't
cleaned this tub in months.

401
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,776
We only use this tub
for our really fiilthy guests.

402
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:10,505
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

403
00:54:10,586 --> 00:54:13,259
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

404
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:16,941
Wait. Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

405
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:18,857
We'll have to soak it off.

406
00:54:18,946 --> 00:54:21,858
- Get an herbal soak token
from the foreman.
- A what?

407
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:27,465
- An herbal soak token.
- Right.

408
00:54:29,026 --> 00:54:30,857
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

409
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:37,340
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what.

410
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:50,535
What useless scum
is slinking around in the rain?

411
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:19,736
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

412
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:21,782
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

413
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:25,939
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

414
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:28,494
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

415
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:30,497
I'm not giving you a token.

416
00:55:30,586 --> 00:55:33,498
Relax. Good morning.
I said scrub it yourself.

417
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:37,022
But I was told
it has to have an herbal soak.

418
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:40,940
Well, that's too bad.
Huh? Mugwort bath?

419
00:55:41,026 --> 00:55:43,017
Relax and enjoy it.

420
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:51,942
Hmm?

421
00:55:52,026 --> 00:55:55,416
Foreman speaking.
Oh, yes. Huh? What?

422
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:57,940
Thank you very much.

423
00:55:58,026 --> 00:56:00,586
Get back here! Hey!
Wait a minute!

424
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,305
- <i>What's going on? </i>
- Nothing. Everything's fiine.

425
00:56:03,386 --> 00:56:06,059
- We have an intruder.
- <i>Is it a human? </i>

426
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:09,343
I'm not quite sure.
Figure it out and report back.

427
00:56:09,426 --> 00:56:12,145
Wow, Sen.
You got a really good one.

428
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:14,615
Clip this on, then let go.

429
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:19,058
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

430
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:26,978
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

431
00:56:35,746 --> 00:56:38,101
Uhh. You're such a klutz.

432
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,142
Yuck! What's in this water?

433
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:42,660
Dried worm salts.
It's supposed to be good for you.

434
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:46,261
And with water this murky, you
can't see all the sludge in the tub.

435
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:51,263
Yank it again when
the bath is full. It'll stop.

436
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:54,736
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll go get us some breakfast.

437
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:56,578
Okay.

438
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:18,938
Ow!

439
00:57:24,786 --> 00:57:27,220
Uh, sir, the bath's
not ready yet.

440
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,458
There's so many.

441
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:39,057
What? They're all for me?

442
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:44,702
Thanks, but I don't
need any more.

443
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:49,222
No. I only need one.

444
00:58:04,226 --> 00:58:06,376
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

445
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,616
And apparently,
it's an extra smelly one.

446
00:58:08,706 --> 00:58:10,662
He... He's headed
straight for the bridge.

447
00:58:10,746 --> 00:58:13,135
- Go away!
- Go away!

448
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:17,185
No, no, we're closed! Go away!
No! Hey! We're not open!

449
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:19,780
No, please!
No! Leave us!

450
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:27,103
Hmm. Something's fiishy. That doesn't
seem like a stink spirit to me.

451
00:58:27,186 --> 00:58:29,416
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

452
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,943
Just give him a bath and get him
out of here as fast as you can.

453
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:36,699
Everybody go back
to your rooms!

454
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,938
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:58:43,026 --> 00:58:45,460
Sen, don't mess this up.

456
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:48,697
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

457
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:51,698
- But... But l...
- No buts or I'll turn you into coal.

458
00:58:51,786 --> 00:58:54,858
- You hear me?
- Ahh! It's here.

459
00:59:04,946 --> 00:59:07,255
Hands down.
You'll insult our guest.

460
00:59:15,226 --> 00:59:19,538
Look, a valued customer.
Welcome to our baths.

461
00:59:21,586 --> 00:59:24,259
Ahh! Eww! Ohh!
Oh, it's money.

462
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:26,735
Sen, take the nice
customer's money.

463
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,657
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:40,261
Don't make him wait.
Get him to the bath.

465
00:59:41,426 --> 00:59:43,018
This way.

466
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,217
Eww!

467
01:00:01,626 --> 01:00:03,457
Sen!

468
01:00:10,826 --> 01:00:14,136
- Our food!
- Open the windows, all of them!

469
01:00:57,386 --> 01:00:59,775
What? Just a minute, sir.

470
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:08,625
- Disgusting?
- I don't think it's very funny.

471
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,140
Let's see what she'll do next.

472
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:17,096
Look. She wants to refiill the tub.

473
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:20,178
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

474
01:01:33,386 --> 01:01:36,935
- Who gave her all the bath tokens?
- Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

475
01:02:19,386 --> 01:02:21,900
Oh, no!
That's our best herbal formula!

476
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:49,902
Sen! Sen, where are you?

477
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:52,739
- Over here!
- Don't worry.

478
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:55,465
St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

479
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:58,014
You're gonna be fiine.
I won't let him hurt you.

480
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:01,985
I think he needs help. It feels
like there's a thorn in his side.

481
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:04,534
- A thorn?
- It won't come out!

482
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:08,505
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

483
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:11,419
- Get the staff down there.
- Huh?
- Step on it!

484
01:03:14,626 --> 01:03:16,582
Listen to me.

485
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:19,055
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands.

486
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:23,701
- Grab onto this rope.
- Right!

487
01:03:32,946 --> 01:03:35,414
- Hold on tight.
- Got it.

488
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:39,419
Hurry up, now.
Everyone get in there and help them.

489
01:03:39,506 --> 01:03:41,417
We've got it tied on!

490
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:46,256
Everyone, ready on my command.

491
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:48,940
And... heave!

492
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:53,577
- And... heave!
- Heave!

493
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:56,460
- And... heave!
- Heave!

494
01:03:56,546 --> 01:04:01,062
And heave!

495
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:05,704
A bicycle?

496
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:08,983
Thought so.
Get ready, now!

497
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:14,220
Heave!

498
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:45,865
Sen! Sen, where are you?

499
01:04:56,266 --> 01:04:58,780
Well done.

500
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,016
Huh?

501
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:33,181
- Gold!
- Hey, wait! That's company property!

502
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:36,702
Back off! Our guest
is still here, you idiots!

503
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:45,543
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

504
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:48,265
Open the main gates! Make way!

505
01:06:14,826 --> 01:06:19,946
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

506
01:06:20,026 --> 01:06:24,258
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

507
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:27,144
Sake's on the house tonight.

508
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:30,741
But fiirst, hand over
all the gold you picked up.

509
01:06:30,826 --> 01:06:34,216
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

510
01:07:32,103 --> 01:07:34,742
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

511
01:07:34,823 --> 01:07:37,860
What'd you expect after all that rain?

512
01:07:39,943 --> 01:07:44,255
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

513
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:10,982
What's wrong?

514
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:41,823
It's gold! Huh?

515
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,858
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

516
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:48,298
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

517
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:56,500
Ooh! Oh!
More gold!

518
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,495
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

519
01:09:04,743 --> 01:09:06,734
Wait. You can make gold?

520
01:09:10,703 --> 01:09:12,295
Uh, gimme!

521
01:09:20,383 --> 01:09:23,261
What's going on in there?

522
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:25,811
It's way past bedtime.
Come on!

523
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:27,495
Wh...

524
01:09:29,263 --> 01:09:32,460
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

525
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,898
- And I want you to serve me.
- I know that voice.

526
01:09:34,983 --> 01:09:39,579
Here, I'll pay you up front.
And I wanna take a bath too.

527
01:09:39,663 --> 01:09:41,813
Why don't you wake everyone up?

528
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,182
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

529
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:52,936
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

530
01:09:57,903 --> 01:10:01,452
Which ones are you?
Mom, Dad!

531
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,298
Bad dream.

532
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:17,692
Rin?

533
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:22,534
Where is everybody?

534
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,093
Wow. It really is a sea.

535
01:10:36,783 --> 01:10:39,377
I sure hope they're
doing all right over there.

536
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:45,694
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

537
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,695
How long was I asleep?

538
01:10:48,783 --> 01:10:51,172
Hurry up!

539
01:10:51,263 --> 01:10:54,175
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

540
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:58,302
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers if you have to.
Hurry up! He's starving!

541
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:02,692
- Hey, Sen.
- Oh, Rin.

542
01:11:02,783 --> 01:11:05,297
I was just coming to wake you up.
Look.

543
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:07,772
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

544
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,297
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

545
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:25,416
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

546
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:32,341
- Who is the guest?
- Oh, who cares?

547
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:34,698
Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

548
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:36,694
I'm going to go look for Haku.

549
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:39,820
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

550
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:42,133
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

551
01:11:42,223 --> 01:11:44,339
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

552
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:12,902
He better get here before
I forget what my parents look like.

553
01:12:12,983 --> 01:12:15,702
I sure hope
Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

554
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:47,380
It's Haku! He's back!

555
01:12:50,303 --> 01:12:52,737
Are birds chasing him?

556
01:13:03,183 --> 01:13:06,220
Haku! Fight 'em!
Come on!

557
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,136
He's hurt!
Haku, this way!

558
01:13:27,063 --> 01:13:29,452
Huh? It's just paper.

559
01:13:57,983 --> 01:14:00,292
Haku, you're bleeding.

560
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:10,812
Hold still. Those paper things are
gone now. You're going to be all right.

561
01:14:23,823 --> 01:14:25,734
He went in that top window.

562
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:28,781
I've got to get there
before he bleeds to death!

563
01:14:36,343 --> 01:14:39,892
<i>Welcome the rich man</i>
<i>He's hard for you to miss</i>

564
01:14:39,983 --> 01:14:44,818
<i>His butt keeps getting bigger</i>
<i>so there's plenty there to kiss</i>

565
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:48,896
- Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.
- Welcome, rich man.

566
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:52,134
<i>Beg for tips</i>
<i>This is the time</i>

567
01:14:52,223 --> 01:14:55,499
<i>Beg for tips</i>
<i>Make yourselves a dime</i>

568
01:14:57,103 --> 01:15:00,891
Give me some dough!
Give me some tips, please, sir!

569
01:15:00,983 --> 01:15:05,056
I'll do anything for you!
Just give me some tips!

570
01:15:08,863 --> 01:15:11,331
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Going upstairs.

571
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:15,416
No, you're not.
Huh? Blood!

572
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,574
Get out of the way!
Our guest is coming through here!

573
01:15:23,303 --> 01:15:25,180
Thank you for helping me earlier.

574
01:15:25,263 --> 01:15:28,221
- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

575
01:15:49,914 --> 01:15:51,506
I don't want any, but thanks.

576
01:15:54,234 --> 01:15:57,146
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

577
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:11,312
Hey, there! Hey!
Get back! Get back now!

578
01:16:11,394 --> 01:16:14,192
Everybody, out!

579
01:16:14,274 --> 01:16:18,028
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
You'll have to excuse the little girl.

580
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:20,947
She's just a human.

581
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:24,185
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

582
01:16:24,274 --> 01:16:26,947
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

583
01:18:00,554 --> 01:18:02,465
It's Yubaba!

584
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:17,911
We're in a big mess.

585
01:19:17,994 --> 01:19:22,385
He's a No-Face!
It's all your fault. You're so greedy.

586
01:19:22,474 --> 01:19:25,591
You attract terrible guests.
All right, I'm on my way.

587
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:29,667
Don't let him eat anyone else
till I get down there.

588
01:19:30,714 --> 01:19:33,672
Haku is bleeding all over the carpet.

589
01:19:33,754 --> 01:19:36,666
Get him out of here.
He'll be dead soon anyway.

590
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:02,226
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

591
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:10,266
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

592
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:13,312
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

593
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:18,429
Go back to sleep, now.

594
01:20:47,674 --> 01:20:49,665
Ow! Let go of me!

595
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:53,383
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

596
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,103
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

597
01:20:57,194 --> 01:21:00,345
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from outside,
aren't you?

598
01:21:00,434 --> 01:21:05,064
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.
Now, would you please let go of me?

599
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:09,830
You'll get sick if you go outside.
So stay here and play with me.

600
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:12,428
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

601
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:14,470
That's why I've never
left this room.

602
01:21:14,554 --> 01:21:17,307
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

603
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:21,353
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

604
01:21:21,434 --> 01:21:24,232
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

605
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:27,306
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

606
01:21:27,394 --> 01:21:29,749
and Mama will come in here
and kill you.

607
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:33,110
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

608
01:21:33,194 --> 01:21:35,389
Please!
I'll play with you later, okay?

609
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:38,113
No, I wanna play now!

610
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:43,469
Germs!
I've got germs, see?

611
01:21:55,114 --> 01:21:57,344
Haku! What are you doing?

612
01:21:57,434 --> 01:22:00,028
Get away! Get back!
Haku, are you okay?

613
01:22:00,114 --> 01:22:02,105
Can you hear me?

614
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:04,549
Shut your mouth! Haku!

615
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:10,984
Get back!

616
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:15,950
Stop it!

617
01:22:29,914 --> 01:22:33,827
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

618
01:22:33,914 --> 01:22:36,382
Please don't cry.
Just wait.

619
01:22:36,474 --> 01:22:38,942
Right now, or I'll start crying.

620
01:22:41,194 --> 01:22:42,752
Don't cry! Don't cry!

621
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:46,065
What a spoiled brat!

622
01:22:47,114 --> 01:22:51,073
Shut your big mouth!
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

623
01:22:57,754 --> 01:23:00,791
- Still see-through.
- Mama?

624
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:05,902
You pea-brain. Can't you even
tell me from your own mother?

625
01:23:13,874 --> 01:23:16,866
There, now.
Your body matches your brain.

626
01:23:16,954 --> 01:23:19,912
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

627
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,907
This is our little secret.
You tell anyone else...

628
01:23:40,994 --> 01:23:42,791
and I'll rip your mouth out.

629
01:23:44,314 --> 01:23:48,387
- Who are you?
- Zeniba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

630
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:52,387
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

631
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:55,591
- Now, hand him over to me.
- What do you want with Haku?

632
01:23:55,674 --> 01:23:58,142
- He's badly hurt.
- Too bad.

633
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,543
He stole my solid gold seal.

634
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:03,307
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

635
01:24:03,394 --> 01:24:06,192
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

636
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:10,392
Huh! Do you know why
he became my sister's apprentice?

637
01:24:10,474 --> 01:24:14,945
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

638
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:19,186
He's a greedy little thief.
There's nothing good about him.

639
01:24:19,274 --> 01:24:24,302
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

640
01:24:24,394 --> 01:24:29,422
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

641
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,424
No, you can't!

642
01:24:39,514 --> 01:24:41,630
You idiots!
What's your problem?

643
01:24:41,714 --> 01:24:44,148
Keep quiet.
I don't want my sister coming up here.

644
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:54,354
Ow. A paper cut.

645
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:56,949
Haku, we're falling!

646
01:25:17,114 --> 01:25:18,593
Haku!

647
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,591
- What's going on here?
- Haku!
- Sen, be careful! Stay back!

648
01:25:52,434 --> 01:25:53,833
Haku!

649
01:25:57,394 --> 01:25:59,305
What's wrong with you?

650
01:26:02,514 --> 01:26:04,948
This looks serious.

651
01:26:06,634 --> 01:26:09,831
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

652
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:13,304
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

653
01:26:13,394 --> 01:26:15,988
- From the inside?
- I think so.

654
01:26:16,074 --> 01:26:17,712
Maybe he swallowed something.

655
01:26:17,794 --> 01:26:21,469
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

656
01:26:21,554 --> 01:26:23,590
Eat it.
Maybe it'll help.

657
01:26:25,674 --> 01:26:28,063
Come on!
Open your mouth!

658
01:26:28,154 --> 01:26:30,907
Please, Haku!
Eat it!

659
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:36,827
- See? It's okay.
- Medicine from the river spirit.

660
01:26:36,914 --> 01:26:40,145
Open your mouth.
That's it.

661
01:26:43,914 --> 01:26:46,906
Got it.
Now swallow.

662
01:27:05,594 --> 01:27:08,552
Sen, look there!

663
01:27:19,794 --> 01:27:22,945
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug!
Over there! Get it!

664
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:45,268
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

665
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:53,353
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal
from Yubaba's sister.

666
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,904
Zeniba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

667
01:27:56,994 --> 01:27:59,189
That's as powerful as it gets.

668
01:28:01,594 --> 01:28:05,303
Look! He's changed back.
Help me. What do we do?

669
01:28:07,514 --> 01:28:09,903
Haku! Haku, wake up!

670
01:28:12,034 --> 01:28:14,070
Zeniba put a curse on the seal.

671
01:28:14,154 --> 01:28:17,942
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

672
01:28:27,314 --> 01:28:30,112
That should make him more comfortable.

673
01:28:32,834 --> 01:28:36,588
Poor Haku. He's had it hard
ever since he got here.

674
01:28:36,674 --> 01:28:40,587
He just showed up out of nowhere,
just like you did.

675
01:28:40,674 --> 01:28:44,349
But he got mixed up with Yubaba.
He took a job as her apprentice.

676
01:28:44,434 --> 01:28:46,868
I warned him it was too dangerous.

677
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:49,991
"Just quit. Go back home,"
I told him.

678
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:54,147
But he said for some reason
he had no home to return to.

679
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:56,464
Once Yubaba got control over him...

680
01:28:56,554 --> 01:29:00,388
his face turned pale
and his eyes turned steely.

681
01:29:00,474 --> 01:29:03,705
He's never been the same.

682
01:29:03,794 --> 01:29:07,707
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zeniba?

683
01:29:07,794 --> 01:29:11,423
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

684
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:13,584
Can you tell me where Zeniba lives?

685
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:15,983
You'd go to Zeniba's?

686
01:29:16,074 --> 01:29:18,793
It might help,
but she's one dangerous witch.

687
01:29:18,874 --> 01:29:22,105
Please?
Haku helped me before.

688
01:29:22,194 --> 01:29:23,832
Now I wanna help him.

689
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:28,427
I know how you can get there...

690
01:29:28,514 --> 01:29:31,267
but you'll have to get back
on your own.

691
01:29:31,354 --> 01:29:33,822
Wait here.

692
01:29:35,074 --> 01:29:38,589
Let's see, now.
I know it's around here somewhere.

693
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:42,352
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

694
01:29:50,954 --> 01:29:53,627
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

695
01:29:56,354 --> 01:29:58,584
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

696
01:29:58,674 --> 01:30:01,871
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

697
01:30:01,954 --> 01:30:05,264
I picked up some new friends.
See?

698
01:30:05,354 --> 01:30:08,710
- Everyone's looking for you.
Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

699
01:30:08,794 --> 01:30:12,503
The guy with all the gold turned out
to be a monster called "No-Face."

700
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:15,711
And he says that you
let him into the bathhouse.

701
01:30:18,874 --> 01:30:21,069
I did let him in.

702
01:30:21,154 --> 01:30:24,271
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

703
01:30:24,354 --> 01:30:27,312
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

704
01:30:27,394 --> 01:30:31,023
Found it!
Here it is, Sen.

705
01:30:31,114 --> 01:30:35,551
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

706
01:30:35,634 --> 01:30:38,831
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

707
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:41,474
I've been saving them for 40 years.

708
01:30:41,554 --> 01:30:45,183
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

709
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:47,788
- Swamp Bottom?
- That's where Zeniba lives.

710
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:49,671
- The sixth stop.
- Sixth stop.

711
01:30:49,754 --> 01:30:53,747
Make sure you get it right. The train
used to run in both directions...

712
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:55,711
but these days it's a one-way ride.

713
01:30:55,794 --> 01:30:57,432
Still want to go?

714
01:30:57,514 --> 01:31:02,110
Yep. I'll walk back
along the tracks.

715
01:31:02,194 --> 01:31:06,233
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

716
01:31:06,314 --> 01:31:10,227
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

717
01:31:10,314 --> 01:31:15,468
- What's going on?
- Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

718
01:31:23,314 --> 01:31:26,067
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

719
01:31:26,154 --> 01:31:28,588
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

720
01:31:36,114 --> 01:31:39,584
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

721
01:31:43,034 --> 01:31:47,346
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure they'll fiind Sen somewhere.

722
01:31:47,434 --> 01:31:49,902
Where is Sen?
I want Sen!

723
01:31:49,994 --> 01:31:52,189
Hurry! This way!

724
01:31:57,314 --> 01:32:00,784
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

725
01:32:00,874 --> 01:32:05,743
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

726
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:09,622
He's destroying everything.
It's costing us a fortune.

727
01:32:09,714 --> 01:32:13,673
So suck up to him and get
every last speck of gold he's...

728
01:32:15,754 --> 01:32:18,985
Eww! What's that
dirty mouse doing here?

729
01:32:19,074 --> 01:32:22,749
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

730
01:32:22,834 --> 01:32:27,350
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

731
01:32:28,954 --> 01:32:31,343
Here's Sen.

732
01:32:31,434 --> 01:32:34,631
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

733
01:32:34,714 --> 01:32:37,672
- You wanna take her place?
- Huh?

734
01:32:56,794 --> 01:33:00,389
Try this.
It's delicious.

735
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:06,425
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

736
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:13,947
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

737
01:33:14,034 --> 01:33:15,945
Just name it.

738
01:33:16,034 --> 01:33:18,104
I would like to leave, sir.

739
01:33:18,194 --> 01:33:20,708
I have someplace I need
to go to right away, please.

740
01:33:23,314 --> 01:33:25,509
You should go back
to where you came from.

741
01:33:25,594 --> 01:33:28,711
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

742
01:33:30,794 --> 01:33:33,592
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

743
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:37,705
No. No!

744
01:33:37,794 --> 01:33:42,584
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

745
01:33:42,674 --> 01:33:44,744
What is it that you want?

746
01:33:44,834 --> 01:33:48,144
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

747
01:33:49,434 --> 01:33:50,423
Take the gold.

748
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:54,063
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

749
01:34:03,114 --> 01:34:06,026
If you want to eat me,
eat this fiirst.

750
01:34:07,034 --> 01:34:11,664
I was saving this for my parents,
but I think you'd better have it.

751
01:34:31,394 --> 01:34:32,873
Sen!

752
01:34:35,074 --> 01:34:38,987
Sen, what did you do to me?

753
01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:55,703
Enough!
I don't care if he's rich!

754
01:34:56,954 --> 01:34:59,468
This nonsense has gotta stop!

755
01:35:12,194 --> 01:35:13,832
No-Face!

756
01:35:13,914 --> 01:35:16,348
Over here!

757
01:36:00,274 --> 01:36:02,469
I'll get you for this, Sen!

758
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:21,631
Sen, this way!

759
01:36:37,594 --> 01:36:42,031
- Hey, over here!
- Sen, don't call him over!

760
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:47,943
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

761
01:36:48,034 --> 01:36:49,547
He needs to get out of there.

762
01:36:49,634 --> 01:36:53,229
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

763
01:36:53,314 --> 01:36:55,066
You don't know?

764
01:36:55,154 --> 01:36:57,543
Great.
Now he's following us.

765
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,070
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

766
01:37:17,154 --> 01:37:19,190
The station's just down the tracks.

767
01:37:19,274 --> 01:37:21,185
Thanks, Rin.

768
01:37:21,274 --> 01:37:25,267
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

769
01:37:28,394 --> 01:37:33,422
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

770
01:37:41,594 --> 01:37:45,712
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

771
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:51,582
There's the station.

772
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,745
Here comes the train.
Come on.

773
01:38:27,794 --> 01:38:30,024
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

774
01:38:34,554 --> 01:38:36,545
Huh?

775
01:38:36,634 --> 01:38:39,273
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

776
01:38:39,354 --> 01:38:41,788
He'd like to come too, please.

777
01:39:22,194 --> 01:39:25,789
Sit here.
Behave yourself, okay?

778
01:41:27,994 --> 01:41:30,144
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

779
01:41:31,914 --> 01:41:36,192
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fiine. Where is Sen?

780
01:41:36,274 --> 01:41:39,186
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

781
01:41:39,274 --> 01:41:42,311
You blacked out, remember?

782
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:45,192
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

783
01:41:45,274 --> 01:41:48,311
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

784
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:50,589
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

785
01:41:50,674 --> 01:41:52,585
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

786
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:55,666
Pure love.
It broke Zeniba's spell.

787
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:59,030
Sen left to return the golden seal.

788
01:41:59,114 --> 01:42:01,992
She did it to save you.

789
01:42:05,554 --> 01:42:08,864
This gold doesn't even come close
to covering the damage
that stupid No-Face caused.

790
01:42:08,954 --> 01:42:11,787
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

791
01:42:11,874 --> 01:42:16,072
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one
that saved us from No-Face.
- Yes, yes.

792
01:42:16,154 --> 01:42:19,908
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

793
01:42:19,994 --> 01:42:22,554
And now she's run away from here.

794
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:24,989
She's even abandoned her own parents!

795
01:42:25,074 --> 01:42:28,271
Those pigs must be ready
to eat by now.

796
01:42:28,354 --> 01:42:32,108
- Turn them into bacon.
- Wait a minute.

797
01:42:32,194 --> 01:42:34,105
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

798
01:42:34,194 --> 01:42:36,150
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

799
01:42:38,474 --> 01:42:41,864
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

800
01:42:41,954 --> 01:42:45,310
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

801
01:42:45,394 --> 01:42:47,783
Since when do you
talk that way to your master?

802
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:41,824
My baby!

803
01:43:43,714 --> 01:43:46,274
No!

804
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:50,108
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

805
01:43:50,194 --> 01:43:53,231
Where's my baby?

806
01:43:53,314 --> 01:43:56,226
Where are you, sweetie?

807
01:43:58,034 --> 01:44:02,346
Come out! Please, come out!
Where are you?

808
01:44:05,794 --> 01:44:08,786
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

809
01:44:12,354 --> 01:44:15,983
You!

810
01:44:18,594 --> 01:44:21,666
Where is he?

811
01:44:23,234 --> 01:44:27,750
What did you do with my baby?

812
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:29,745
He's with your sister.

813
01:44:29,834 --> 01:44:31,870
Zeniba?

814
01:44:52,674 --> 01:44:56,383
Very clever, Haku.
I get it.

815
01:44:56,474 --> 01:44:59,432
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

816
01:45:00,834 --> 01:45:03,064
So, what do you want?

817
01:45:03,154 --> 01:45:06,624
Tear up Sen's contract.
And then I want you...

818
01:45:06,714 --> 01:45:10,070
to return Sen and her mother
and father back to the human world.

819
01:45:10,154 --> 01:45:12,588
Fine, but on one condition.

820
01:45:12,674 --> 01:45:16,587
I get to give Sen one fiinal test.

821
01:46:03,554 --> 01:46:05,510
I hope this is the right stop.

822
01:46:06,394 --> 01:46:08,624
Let's go.

823
01:46:34,594 --> 01:46:36,425
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

824
01:47:54,754 --> 01:47:56,665
Come in.

825
01:48:01,114 --> 01:48:03,582
Hello?

826
01:48:05,234 --> 01:48:07,987
Hurry up.
I don't have all day.

827
01:48:08,074 --> 01:48:09,985
Come on.

828
01:48:12,434 --> 01:48:15,710
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

829
01:48:15,794 --> 01:48:19,184
Sit down.
I'll make some tea.

830
01:48:25,274 --> 01:48:28,107
Excuse me, ma'am.
Haku stole this from you.

831
01:48:28,194 --> 01:48:29,422
I came to give it back.

832
01:48:32,874 --> 01:48:35,183
Do you have any idea what this is?

833
01:48:35,274 --> 01:48:38,505
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

834
01:48:38,594 --> 01:48:42,553
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

835
01:48:42,634 --> 01:48:46,468
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

836
01:48:46,554 --> 01:48:50,069
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

837
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:54,311
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

838
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:56,305
I think I squashed it with my foot.

839
01:48:56,394 --> 01:48:58,862
Squashed it?

840
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:03,104
That wasn't my slug.

841
01:49:03,194 --> 01:49:07,346
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

842
01:49:07,434 --> 01:49:10,267
You squashed it.

843
01:49:12,354 --> 01:49:14,629
What happened to my spell?

844
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:17,433
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

845
01:49:18,394 --> 01:49:22,228
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

846
01:49:22,314 --> 01:49:25,465
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

847
01:49:25,554 --> 01:49:28,432
Change back if you want.

848
01:49:35,234 --> 01:49:39,227
I don't get along with my sister.
She's so obnoxious.

849
01:49:39,314 --> 01:49:41,669
You saw how tacky her home is.

850
01:49:41,754 --> 01:49:44,826
We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

851
01:49:48,834 --> 01:49:51,906
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

852
01:49:51,994 --> 01:49:55,464
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

853
01:49:55,554 --> 01:49:58,626
You'll have to help
your parents and Haku on your own.

854
01:49:58,714 --> 01:50:00,705
Use what you remember about them.

855
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:03,706
What? Can't you please give me
more of a hint than that?

856
01:50:03,794 --> 01:50:07,992
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

857
01:50:08,074 --> 01:50:11,510
That's a good start.
Once you've met someone...

858
01:50:11,594 --> 01:50:13,664
you never really forget them.

859
01:50:13,754 --> 01:50:17,349
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

860
01:50:17,434 --> 01:50:22,827
While you're thinking, the boys and I
are going to make you something.

861
01:50:28,754 --> 01:50:30,665
Come on.
Keep at it.

862
01:50:34,034 --> 01:50:36,594
No-Face, where did you learn
to spin thread?

863
01:50:36,674 --> 01:50:38,232
You're really good at this.

864
01:50:38,314 --> 01:50:41,989
Now let's weave the threads together.

865
01:50:43,794 --> 01:50:46,228
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

866
01:50:46,314 --> 01:50:48,032
Knit one...
That's right.

867
01:50:48,114 --> 01:50:51,265
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

868
01:50:51,354 --> 01:50:55,347
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

869
01:50:55,434 --> 01:50:59,347
My mom and dad
could've been eaten for dinner.

870
01:51:00,874 --> 01:51:03,672
Wait just a little bit longer.

871
01:51:03,754 --> 01:51:07,952
There we go.
Use it to tie back your hair.

872
01:51:12,394 --> 01:51:14,112
It's beautiful.

873
01:51:14,194 --> 01:51:19,222
It'll protect you. It's made from
the threads your friends wove together.

874
01:51:19,314 --> 01:51:21,748
Thank you.

875
01:51:30,114 --> 01:51:33,265
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

876
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:35,265
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

877
01:51:48,794 --> 01:51:52,673
Haku! Haku.

878
01:51:52,754 --> 01:51:55,985
Thank goodness.
You're alive!

879
01:51:56,074 --> 01:51:58,713
I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

880
01:52:00,834 --> 01:52:03,189
That's love for you.

881
01:52:03,274 --> 01:52:06,584
Look, Granny.
Haku's alive.

882
01:52:06,674 --> 01:52:10,587
Haku, I will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

883
01:52:10,674 --> 01:52:14,064
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

884
01:52:14,154 --> 01:52:17,783
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

885
01:52:17,874 --> 01:52:20,263
Come back soon.

886
01:52:20,354 --> 01:52:23,027
No-Face, why don't you stay with me?

887
01:52:23,114 --> 01:52:26,106
I could use a good helper.

888
01:52:27,194 --> 01:52:30,903
Granny! Thank you so much.
I'll miss you.

889
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:34,430
Don't worry.
You'll be all right, Sen.

890
01:52:34,514 --> 01:52:37,745
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

891
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:40,302
Chihiro.
What a pretty name.

892
01:52:40,394 --> 01:52:43,147
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

893
01:52:43,234 --> 01:52:46,112
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

894
01:52:46,194 --> 01:52:50,585
Granny, take care!
Thanks for everything!

895
01:53:38,674 --> 01:53:42,747
Haku, listen. I just remembered
something from a long time ago.

896
01:53:42,834 --> 01:53:45,746
I think it may help you.
Once, when I was little...

897
01:53:45,834 --> 01:53:48,109
I dropped my shoe into a river.

898
01:53:48,194 --> 01:53:51,311
And when I tried to get it back,
I fell in.

899
01:53:51,394 --> 01:53:55,353
I thought I'd drown,
but the water carried me to shore.

900
01:53:55,434 --> 01:53:58,107
It fiinally came back to me.

901
01:53:58,194 --> 01:54:01,186
The river's name was
the Kohaku River.

902
01:54:01,274 --> 01:54:05,153
I think that was you,
and your real name is Kohaku River!

903
01:54:26,194 --> 01:54:28,867
You did it, Chihiro!
I remember.

904
01:54:28,954 --> 01:54:31,104
I was the spirit
of the Kohaku River.

905
01:54:31,194 --> 01:54:34,903
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kohaku River.

906
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:37,588
They fiilled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

907
01:54:37,674 --> 01:54:40,507
That must be why I can't
fiind my way home, Chihiro.

908
01:54:40,594 --> 01:54:44,189
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

909
01:54:44,274 --> 01:54:47,505
So you're the one who carried me
back into shallow water.

910
01:54:47,594 --> 01:54:50,870
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

911
01:55:23,674 --> 01:55:26,063
Hey, there they are!

912
01:55:38,274 --> 01:55:41,391
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

913
01:55:43,834 --> 01:55:46,223
- Mama!
- My baby!

914
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:50,512
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

915
01:55:50,594 --> 01:55:53,745
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

916
01:55:53,834 --> 01:55:57,031
Don't forget your promise.
You must return...

917
01:55:57,114 --> 01:55:59,503
Chihiro and her parents
to the human world.

918
01:56:00,914 --> 01:56:02,905
Not so fast, Haku.

919
01:56:02,994 --> 01:56:06,145
I get to give Sen one fiinal test.

920
01:56:06,234 --> 01:56:08,748
- Shut up!
- Stop it, Mama.

921
01:56:08,834 --> 01:56:10,745
Leave her alone.

922
01:56:10,834 --> 01:56:12,904
Sen and I had a really good time.

923
01:56:13,652 --> 01:56:16,485
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

924
01:56:16,572 --> 01:56:18,767
I have to give Sen one fiinal test.

925
01:56:18,852 --> 01:56:22,128
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you any more.

926
01:56:22,212 --> 01:56:26,649
- But...
- Hey, Granny!
- Granny?

927
01:56:26,732 --> 01:56:29,121
You're right.
A deal's a deal.

928
01:56:40,532 --> 01:56:43,330
Okay, I'm ready.
I'll take your test.

929
01:56:43,412 --> 01:56:47,041
You've got guts.
I've got your contract right here.

930
01:56:47,132 --> 01:56:51,364
Come this way.
This'll only take a minute.

931
01:56:51,452 --> 01:56:53,807
Don't worry.

932
01:56:57,172 --> 01:57:00,926
See if you can tell which of
these pigs is your mother and father.

933
01:57:10,572 --> 01:57:14,531
You get one try. If you get it right,
you can all go home.

934
01:57:24,852 --> 01:57:27,889
Huh?
There must be a mistake.

935
01:57:27,972 --> 01:57:30,042
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

936
01:57:30,132 --> 01:57:33,807
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

937
01:57:39,492 --> 01:57:42,484
Oh, you got it!

938
01:57:42,572 --> 01:57:45,086
Sen! Yes!

939
01:57:49,132 --> 01:57:51,965
- Thank you, everyone.
- All right, you win.

940
01:57:52,052 --> 01:57:54,008
Get out of my sight.

941
01:57:54,092 --> 01:57:58,085
Thanks for everything, Granny.
Goodbye!

942
01:57:58,172 --> 01:58:01,084
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

943
01:58:01,172 --> 01:58:03,128
- Haku!
- Let's go!

944
01:58:03,212 --> 01:58:06,409
- Where are my mom and dad?
- They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

945
01:58:14,012 --> 01:58:16,970
- There's no water here.
- But I can't go any farther.

946
01:58:17,052 --> 01:58:20,408
Just go back the way you came. You'll
be fiine. But you have to promise...

947
01:58:20,492 --> 01:58:22,960
not to look back, not until
you've passed through the tunnel.

948
01:58:23,052 --> 01:58:25,202
What about you?
What'll you do?

949
01:58:25,292 --> 01:58:28,648
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

950
01:58:28,732 --> 01:58:31,121
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

951
01:58:31,212 --> 01:58:33,680
I'm fiine.
I got my name back.

952
01:58:33,772 --> 01:58:36,127
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

953
01:58:36,212 --> 01:58:38,043
- Promise?
- Promise.

954
01:58:38,132 --> 01:58:40,168
Now go, and don't look back.

955
01:59:02,852 --> 01:59:04,604
Chihiro!

956
01:59:04,692 --> 01:59:07,604
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

957
01:59:11,292 --> 01:59:14,682
- Mom, Dad!
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.

958
01:59:14,772 --> 01:59:16,683
You could get in big trouble.

959
01:59:16,772 --> 01:59:19,127
Are you guys sure you're all right?

960
01:59:19,212 --> 01:59:22,124
Let's go.
I don't wanna miss the movers.

961
01:59:32,732 --> 01:59:34,643
Chihiro, hurry up.

962
01:59:43,212 --> 01:59:45,282
Everybody, watch your step.

963
01:59:45,372 --> 01:59:48,762
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

964
02:00:01,172 --> 02:00:03,766
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

965
02:00:03,852 --> 02:00:05,763
What is it?

966
02:00:05,852 --> 02:00:08,525
Look at that.

967
02:00:09,812 --> 02:00:13,646
- It's all dusty inside too.
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?

968
02:00:13,732 --> 02:00:16,530
- Looks like it.
- I told you we shouldn't have stopped.

969
02:00:22,492 --> 02:00:26,167
Come on, Chihiro.
Let's get to our new home.

970
02:00:26,252 --> 02:00:28,208
You're not scared, are you?

971
02:00:28,292 --> 02:00:31,090
Don't be afraid, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
