I actually kind of helped her
come up with that one.

177
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,659

- That's my favorite feature.

178
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,627
That's so cool.
Isn't she so cool?

179
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,729
You're, you're so cool.

180
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm actually glad
we ran into you guys.

181
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:45,199
I was just about to show
Daphne the main event.

182
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,401
This is the Bloom Bracket.
It's a real-time ranking

183
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,338
'of all the underclassmen
at Ridge Valley.'

184
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,974
You're scored on grades,
sports, extracurricular.

185
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:56,078
'Even social media activity's
taken into account.'

186
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,914
- It's like a GPA on steroids.
- Mm-hm.

187
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,881
Wow. It sounds pretty intense.

188
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:02,349
It is, but in a good way.

189
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,117
At the end of each semester,
whoever is the top student

190
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,820
of the Bloom Bracket gets an
internship at Bloom Innovative.

191
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:09,723
Also known as the coolest place
on Earth.

192
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:12,727
Can you guys imagine getting
to work for <i>the</i> Tobias Bloom?

193
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,929
I mean,
I've got this perfect idea..

194
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,363
Wait, let me pitch it to you.

195
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:20,236
Okay. So imagine your phone
could make a pie.

196
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:24,573
Uh, wait, that actually
sounds kind of weird.

197
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:25,873
Slow down there, boy genius.

to teen genius?

I'm thinking baby genius.

but you can't ignore me.

- Yeah, we're friends.

207
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:49,430
Velma has friends.

208
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,766
You know, I think I'm actually
gonna go catch up with her.

209
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:52,968
- So I'll see you later?
- Okay.

210
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,205

I can't talk to you right now,
Daphne.

218
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:23,698
So it is you. For a second,
I thought I was going crazy.

220

00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:22,195
Did you know they give out
grades lower than an A?

527
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:25,398
- Yes, of-of course, I did.
- That's pretty standard.

528
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,402
Well, I didn't know that
because I've never gotten one.

529
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:29,936
Pretty soon,
they're gonna be telling me

530
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:31,405
that there's no caviar
in the cafeteria.

531
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:34,442
- Actually, there isn't and...
- Just leave it.

532
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:37,878
Daphne, you had wonderful
recommendations

533
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,346
from all your prior schools.

534
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:42,148
I'm sure that
you're gonna find your way here.

535
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,353
But you, Velma,
I am very disappointed in you.

536
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:49,159
- Sorry, Aunt Piper.
- You're related?

537
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:51,858
Oh, yes. I see it.

538
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,395
Before high school,
you were such a straight A

539
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:56,230
superstar student.

540
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:57,164
You were?

541
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,699
[scoffs]
I knew it.

542
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:02,872
I don't know what's gotten into
you, but it needs to change.

543
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,575
- Timothy Bot!
- Here I am.

544
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:10,010
Let's engage the conflict couch.

545
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:12,111
[automated]
Conflict couch engaged.

546
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,481
It's still in beta-testing,
but don't worry, girls.

547
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,082
Since it's the first time
for all of us

548
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:17,684
we won't do anything
too extreme.

549
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:19,587
(Timothy)
Extreme bout activated.

550
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,021
No, no, wait, I didn't say that.

551
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,523
- Extreme bout locked.
- Stop!

552
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:24,992
- Turn it off.
- 'Oh!'

553
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:26,961
You just hang in there
and try and work this out.

554
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:29,963
- 'I'm gonna fix this.'
- 'Now ordering 50 tacos.'

555
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,199
Oh, no. no, Timothy Bot.
No. Bad! Bad boy.

556
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:34,467
(Timothy)
'Calling my bad boy.'

557
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,235
Where's the real Velma

558
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,071
the straight A
superstar student?

559
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:39,440
[automated message]
'Friendship detected.'

560
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,943
Just forget
what Aunt Piper said. Drop it.

561
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:43,844
- 'Conflict.'
- No!

562
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:46,113
- 'Conflict.'
- Drop it.

563
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:48,348
[groans]
Why are you acting like this?

564
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,751
It's to protect you, okay?
It's for your own good.

565
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:52,886
Protect me.
I can protect myself, thank you.

566
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,222
- Can you, really, Daphne?
- Yes, I can.

567
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:58,893
Oh, I'm Daphne. I want some
caviar from the cafeteria.

568
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:02,296
Oh, wait. They don't have caviar
in the cafeteria.

569
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,699
I'm Velma, I have four heads
and I'm dark and brooding

570
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:05,933
and I don't like
to talk to people

571
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,635
so I have no contact
in the system.

572
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:10,738
- Maybe I like it that way.
- Well, you're on my hair.

573
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,074
- You're on my hair.
- Well, you're spitting at me.

574
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:17,547
Well, sorry.
That was an accident.

575
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:20,349
[laughs]

576
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:24,386
Forget what Carol said.

577
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,254
Purple and green
go awesome together.

578
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,125
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,161
Thanks.

580
00:27:33,163 --> 00:27:36,062
- I'm sorry, Daphne.
- 'Friendship detected.'

581
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,033
I really am your friend.

582
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,169
- It's just..
- 'Resolved.'

583
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,502
Just what?

584
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:46,307
Let me help. We're a team.

585
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,608
Something weird is happening
to the top students here.

586
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,043
Like what happened to Spencer?

587
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,111
It happened to another girl.
Olivia.

588
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:54,114
Before you got here,
she was a world-class violinist

589
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:56,283
and-and now
she can't even play a note.

590
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,051
And it's been happening
for a while.

591
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,453
I mean, parents just think
it's teens being teens

592
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,556
but I don't think so.

593
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,924
I mean, why is it only happening
to the top students?

594
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,359
We have to investigate.

595
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,662
We have to help
Spencer and Olivia.

596
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:10,130
Well, that's the thing.

597
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:11,464
If whoever is behind this
finds out

598
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,067
two internet sleuths
are on their trail

599
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:15,235
then this could get dangerous.

600
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:18,338
Who cares?
We have to take a risk.

601
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,674
- Actually, no, I don't.
- 'Conflict.'

602
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:23,076
- Yeah, you do.
- 'Conflict.'

603
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,211
Because I'm not budging.

604
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:26,379
And if you keep
disagreeing with me

605
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:29,218
this weird couch is gonna ram us
together for all of eternity.

606
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:32,619
Fine.

607
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:35,289
But only because
I don't want a concussion.

608
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,324
So you're in?

609
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:40,430
- Yeah. I'm in.
- 'Complete.'

610
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:43,530
Velma totally sucks, by the way.

611
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:44,999
[automated]
'Conflict detected.'

612
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,334
(Piper)
Well, I just ordered 2000 rolls

613
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:50,736
of toilet paper and now I know
all the movie show times

614
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:52,039
for Cheyenne, Wyoming

615
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,274
but I think he's finally fixed.

616
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,710
Hey, you two made up.

617
00:28:56,712 --> 00:29:00,513
- Yeah, we're friends again.
- Thanks, Aunt P.

618
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,015
You rule. High five.

00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,620
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

621
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,088
He's kidding. He's kidding.

622
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,191
He's kidding. Gotta go.
Bad Timothy.

623
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:13,493
So, um, seeing as you're
senior advisor and everything

624
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,261
we were hoping
you could help us out.

625
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:16,797
Totally.

626
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,500
But, um..

627
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,668
[whispers] Are you sure you
should be hanging out with her?

628
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,103
I mean, her below record scores

629
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,405
are, like,
practically non-existent.

630
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:28,209
[clears throat]
I can hear you.

631
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:31,511
- This is a very small table.
- Oh.

632
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:35,148
- Sorry. Hi.
- So about Spencer?

633
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,884
Right. You said
he's been acting weird.

634
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,551
So weird.
You guys noticed too?

635
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:40,186
'The dude's
like a walking thesaurus.'

636
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:43,057
Now he has, like, two words
in his vocabulary.

637
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,026
Hm. Uh, no, I'm good.

638
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,196
Well, have you checked
his Bloomgram?

639
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:53,067
"So much fun working in the lab
after school."

640
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,404
Science guy emoji.

641
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:58,204
I mean, it's a little nerdy,
I guess, but..

642
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,507
...I don't know,
it seems normal to me.

643
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:02,108
It's weird.
It sounds like Spencer.

644
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,610
But he's so not acting okay.

645
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:07,247
And look at his Bloom Bracket
score. It's totally dropping.

646
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:10,082
Competition just gets
to some kids, you know?

647
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,251
Well, unless you're one
of the Griffiths.

648
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:14,553
- You mean Griffin Griffiths?
- Yeah.

649
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:17,057
I mean, his whole family
is like crazy talented.

650
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,791
His older brothers
and sisters have won

651
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,794
the Bloom Bracket competition
three years in a row.

652
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,197
We need to talk..

653
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,400
...in private.

654
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:31,003
- That's your cue to leave.
- Oh.

655
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,572
[chuckles]

656
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:35,174
We're working on the whole
manners thing still.

657
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:36,543
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

658
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,046
It's fine.
I'm gonna get a salad, anyways.

659
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:42,148
- We'll see you guys later.
- 'Wanted to eat my salad.'

660
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,017
[cell phone chimes]

661
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,751
Spencer just sent out a snap.

662
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,622
[instrumental music]

663
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:50,223
So weird.

664
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,361
I mean, he looks happy
in the photo, but..

665
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:56,264
Huh? No. I'm good.

666
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:58,533
Mm.

667
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,801
Something weird
is definitely going on.

668
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:05,172
We need to bust into that locker
that Spencer walked through

669
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:06,740
to find the secret passage.

670
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:10,176
Or build enough
that we could do something

671
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,812
that won't lead
to certain danger.

672
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,750
- Just an idea.
- Velma.

673
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:19,552
Fine.
We'll come up with something.

674
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:20,555
Thanks.

675
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:25,125
(Spencer)
Huh? Mm. Yes.

676
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:28,828
Sorry, little guy.
You were a good robot.

677
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,530
But your time has come.

678
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:32,098
I really wish
I hadn't programmed you

679
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,501
with human emotions.

680
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,068
Velma?

681
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,703
Please don't.

682
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:37,738
'Don't!'

683
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,106
[robot crackles]

684
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:42,412
Hey, pumpkin.
How's my favorite redhead?

685
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:46,079
Hi, mom. Working late?

686
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:47,847
Yeah, things are already crazy.

687
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,050
Tobias Bloom wants me to import
all of Matchmouth's tech

688
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:52,886
onto his servers ASAP.

689
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:55,321
- The man never stops.
- So you finally met him?

690
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:56,722
Does a video conference call

691
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:58,858
with 12 Norwegian investors
count?

692
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,894
I think he might have said
nice to meet you

693
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:03,030
or was it pleased to fire you?

694
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,165
You know what?
Don't overthink it.

695
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,799
That's great advice.
Don't overthink it.

696
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,369
- You're so smart.
- 'Uh, but exciting news.'

697
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:10,771
You'll get to meet him tomorrow.

698
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:12,338
He's coming
to Ridge Valley High

699
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,607
to introduce his latest
top-secret project.

700
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:15,442
Sweet.

701
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,976
Hey, uh, speaking of school

702
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,779
how was school?

703
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,847
Well, I got into a fight
with Velma, flunked

704
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,883
my science project and ended up
at the principal's office.

705
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:25,552
But all in all,
I think it went pretty well

706
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:26,953
considering it was my first day

707
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:29,155
actually going to school
by myself.

708
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:32,459
You know, I-I can fire up
the Clothe Me Closet

709
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,794
in, like, five minutes.

710
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:35,963
- Mom?
- What?

711
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:38,765
- I'm on it.
- What? No, honey. I'm sorry.

712
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,232
(Nedley)
You look..

713
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:41,635
I can't even say it.

714
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:43,770
- She looks terrible.
- Oh.

715
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:46,338
(female announcer) 'Students,
report to Bloom Innovative's'

716
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,674
'beta presentation.'

717
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,678
Welcome to this month's
Bloom Innovative

718
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
beta presentation.

719
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:55,482
We have to sneak out of here
while no one's looking.

720
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:58,551
Now we all remember the last
time where we learned about

721
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,888
the Bloom Innovative
sound buds.

722
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,492
These brilliant ear pods
create a soundtrack

723
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,095
that is personalized to you.

724
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:10,129
Oh, I'm doing the "Running Man"

725
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,331
'cause I'm running
to the future.

726
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,099
I can't wait to see what's next.

727
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,836
Without further ado, here he is

728
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:19,071
Tobias Bloom!

729
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,140
[all cheering]

730
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:23,912
Hello!
Hello, Ridge Valley High!

731
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:31,551
So familiar in person.

732
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,488
Probably because his face is
plastered all over the school.

733
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,456
(Tobias)
'Boy, do I have an exciting'

734
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,157
new innovation
to beta test with you today.

735
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,628
But first, an important matter
of business to attend to.

736
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,868
It's time that we check in
on my Bloom Bracket.

737
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:51,340
I hear there's a new student
on top of the rankings.

738
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:57,144
Griffin Griffiths.

739
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:59,782
[all cheering]

740
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,625
Should have been Spencer
up there.

741
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,495
Huh? Hm. I'm good.

742
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:18,533
But for now my latest invention.

743
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,406
A 3D printer.

744
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:27,274
- 'Lame.'
- Lame. I know.

745
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:30,010
We have them
in every single classroom.

746
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:33,113
But what if I told you
that this printer..

747
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,314
...was for food.

748
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:37,651
[all cheering]

749
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:39,885
Bloom Print,
I'd like a slice of pizza.

750
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:41,823
[whirring]

751
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,428
[indistinct chatter]

752
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:50,299
No way.

753
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,736
[all cheering]

754
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,171
On second thought, Bloom Print

755
00:34:57,173 --> 00:35:00,839
print me off enough pizza
for the entire school.

756
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:03,609
[cheering]

757
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:06,546
He's done it again!
He's done it again!

758
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:08,381
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
- Pizza, pizza, pizza...

759
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,383
Daphne, no one's looking.
Let's go.

760
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,752
- What about pizza?
- Daphne, let's go.

761
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,089
[all chanting]
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!

762
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:17,790
(Velma) The only person
that would come out here

763
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,627
during a Bloom presentation
is Two-Mop Maggie.

764
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:23,162
And I've already
taken care of her.

765
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,966
Well, like, taken care of?

766
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:28,769
No, I mean, I spilled some juice
a couple hallways over.

767
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:30,537
- Oh.
- And it's not mean.

768
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:32,541
Maggie loves spills.

769
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,077
This robot engine
is totally stable.

770
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,845
Unless it's overheated.

771
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,582
And this is the stuff
they put in heating pads.

772
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:44,517
But amped up. Way up!

773
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,852
And it's your signature color.

774
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,488
'What? I have an eye
for these things.'

775
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,326
[sighs]
I call it..

776
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:53,894
...a melting engine.

777
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:55,727
We can come up
with something better than that.

778
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,629
Okay, when you destroy
your robot child

779
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,298
you can name the thing, okay?

780
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,899
Okay.

781
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,236
[whoosh]

782
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:06,272
Velma, did you see that?

783
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:07,774
See what?
I'm, I'm kind of busy here.

784
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:10,644
This is my first time
violating school property, so..

785
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,848
[beeps]
And here we go.

786
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:19,153
(Velma) Oh, it's working.
It's really working.

787
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,724
[dramatic music]

788
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,260
[coughing]

789
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:28,664
Whoa.

790
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,570
There's no secret passage.

791
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:37,405
[sighs]

792
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:43,010
- It's just a blue ribbon.
- Great. Trash.

793
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:45,780
Recycling. I don't know
if this school's super green.

794
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:49,149
Wait, no. Remember Olivia?

795
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:51,651
The music prodigy who fell off
the face of the Earth?

796
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:53,519
I mean, she's like Spencer now

797
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:58,290
but she used to always wear
a ribbon in her hair.

798
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:01,127
How many girls do you know
who wear ribbons in their hair?

799
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:03,229
Those girls in the 1940s.

800
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:05,098
- And me.
- Exactly.

801
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,769
- Because ghosts don't exist.
- Wait, that's...

802
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:10,537
Okay, Daphne,
you're missing the point.

803
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,238
This is Olivia's ribbon.

804
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,877
Which means Olivia went through
the secret passage too.

805
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:18,613
- Yes, a clue!
- Whoa.

806
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:24,151
[chuckles]

807
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,720
Yesterday a fight in class.

808
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:27,756
Today..

809
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:32,424
"...melting a locker?"

810
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:35,093
That is not a good trend.

811
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:36,995
Principal Piper,
if you'll just let us explain.

812
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:38,899
We were trying to help
our friend Spencer. He's not...

813
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:41,801
I, I can't believe
it's come to this.

814
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:45,107
But... I'm gonna have
to give you girls..

815
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:48,508
...shame stickers.

816
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,443
[thunder rumbles]

817
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:51,647
Take 'em.

818
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:59,019
'Great. Great. Good.'

819
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:01,053
How do you feel?

820
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:02,955
Exactly the same.

821
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,423
[clears throat]

822
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:05,792
- But shamed.
- Yeah.

823
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:07,193
- So ashamed.
- Yeah, good.

824
00:38:07,195 --> 00:38:09,229
- Really ashamed.
- Good, good, good, good.

825
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:12,164
I really think those stickers
will do the trick

826
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,401
and some kitchen duty.

827
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:17,202
'Kitchen duty
in shame stickers'

828
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:21,274
guaranteed to stop girls
from blowin' things up.

829
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:22,445
Right?

830
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,747
Yeah.

831
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,885
What's up, lunch ladies?

832
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,120
Ooh, I'll take a scoop
of the messier one.

833
00:38:35,122 --> 00:38:36,555
Ooh, nice.

834
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:40,859
How 'bout two scoops for your
new Bloom Bracket leader?

835
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:43,328
You're only on top of the
Bloom Bracket because Spencer...

836
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,497
Isn't feeling well.

837
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,298
You mean, because he tanked.

838
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,836
What can I say? I guess being
<i>numero uno</i> runs in the family.

839
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:52,305
- And I'm next.
- Okay.

840
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,140
Are you jealous
or something?

841
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:57,010
- You're ranked, like, 200th.
- Oh.

842
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:59,678
- Tss. Burn.
- That's not a joke, guys.

843
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,879
Just stating facts.

844
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,515
I was just trying
to be supportive.

845
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,220
- 'Y-yeah, we're good friends.'
- 'Yeah.'

846
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,953
- We're really close.
- Yeah.

847
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:10,091
Well, I guess he got
what he wanted.

848
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:14,727
- Wait, that's it.
- What?

849
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:16,562
Being the lamest group of guys
on Earth?

850
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,765
No, think about it.

851
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,399
Who wanted to be on top
of the Bloom Bracket

852
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,968
more than anybody?

853
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,071
Who has a family legacy
to protect?

854
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,106
Griffin Griffiths.

855
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:28,807
[cheering]

856
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:32,747
(Velma) 'Look at him. The so-called
second cutest boy in school.'

857
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,881
Wow.

858
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,084
You really think so?

859
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,419
Um, sure.

860
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,722
That is so nice.

861
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:45,057
Do you wanna go out sometime?

862
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:46,926
No. Not really.

863
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,396
I'm not looking
for anything serious, you know?

864
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:52,298
- It's not you. It's me.
- Oh.

865
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,435
- I'm just gonna..
- 'Yeah, yeah, j-just go.'

866
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,569
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

867
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,839
He does seem nice.

868
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,339
- Okay, let's stay focused.
- Right.

869
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,843
Griffin. Okay,
he has to be behind this.

870
00:40:02,845 --> 00:40:04,109
He has the motive
to want something bad

871
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,879
to happen to Spencer.
We have to stop him.

872
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:08,347
No, wait, wait, wait.
First, we need intel.

873
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,682
We don't have time.

874
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:11,383
We have to do this fast,
low-tech.

875
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:12,752
Daphne, we have to make a plan

876
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,521
otherwise we're just puttin'
ourselves in danger.

877
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:17,026
Live wild, V.
We have to go for it.

878
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:21,230
Hey, look, over there.

879
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:23,396
(Velma)
'No.'

880
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:25,332
Coach Williams, don't do it.

881
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:26,301
What?

882
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:30,169
- Oh, he didn't.
- No.

883
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:32,805
- Oh, he's doin' it again.
- V, not that.

884
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,208
(Daphne)
'Beside him.'

885
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,912
I have a plan.

886
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,546
- Daphne.
- 'What?'

887
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:42,115
- Hairnet.
- 'Right.'

888
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:43,084
Yup.

889
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:46,021
[indistinct chatter]

890
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:49,555
- Carol.
- Velma.

891
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,658
Carol.

892
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,327
- Daphne.
- Hi.

893
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,296
Oh, shame stickers.
Everything okay?

894
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:59,298
Yeah, um, you said I could come
to you if I needed help.

895
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,200
- No questions asked.
- Of course.

896
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,202
[sighs]

897
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:04,771
(Velma)
'This is too risky.'

898
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:06,640
Mike and Ryder
are super hardcore

899
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:08,307
especially when it comes
to defending Griffin.

900
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:10,243
Shh.

901
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,011
(Daphne)
'Okay, here we go.'

902
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,513
We will reveal their evil plan.

903
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,082
[groans]

904
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:17,517
(Ryder) 'You know, like,
when I think about it'

905
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,519
I don't really care
what I do when I grow up.

906
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:22,656
I just wanna be, like,
a really good dad, you know?

907
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:26,059
Dude, you will be the best dad.

908
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:28,294
- You're a natural nurturer.
- 'Stop it.'

909
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:33,198
No. Sometimes,
I wish you were... my dad.

910
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,368
[laughter]

911
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,236
That's crazy.
Uh, I'm being crazy here.

912
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:39,573
No, you're not being crazy.
Don't do that.

913
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:42,475
You can always count on me.

914
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:44,412
[all laugh]

915
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:47,147
This is super uncomfortable.

916
00:41:47,149 --> 00:41:50,182
They're baring their souls, V.
It's beautiful.

917
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:52,285
[rattles]

918
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:53,685
Easy.

919
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,823
God, you're so paranoid.

920
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:01,093
Oh, I forgot my phone
in my locker.

921
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:03,528
I got something really,
really important on it.

922
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,332
- Oh, yeah, that thing.
- 'Huh.'

923
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:07,934
Yeah, that thing.

924
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,602
I'll, uh, catch you guys later.

925
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:11,638
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Yeah.'

926
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,406
- He's leaving.
- We're stuck.

927
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,374
This is what happens
when we work without a plan.

928
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:18,010
It's fine. We just have
to think on the fly.

929
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,446
You can come up with something,
V. I know it. Hit me.

930
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:22,214
[groans]

931
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:26,019
Okay, it's not a great plan,
but it will have to work.

932
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,354
Hey, did you ever get the,
the landscapes assignment?

933
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:31,290
Sorry, Aunt Piper.
You really do look hilarious.

934
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,892
(Ryder)
'You have a fantastic eye.'

935
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:35,761
[cell phone chimes]

936
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:37,396
(Mike)
'Oh, my God!'

937
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:39,164
That is embarrassing.

938
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,299
Let's go.

939
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:41,468
[indistinct chatter]

940
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,703
(Daphne)
'Keep going. It's working.'

941
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:45,405
(Velma)
'We're in so much trouble.'

942
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:47,272
(Daphne) 'Okay, you need to guide me.
Left or right?'

943
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,642
- 'Left, Daphne.'
- 'Those are incredible.'

944
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:52,010
(Velma) 'Daphne, can you hear me?
Left, that's right.'

945
00:42:52,012 --> 00:42:54,280
- 'T-that's my right, Velma.'
- 'Get it together.'

946
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,417
(Daphne) 'I wonder if this
is what it's like to drive.'

947
00:42:57,586 --> 00:42:59,722
[both groaning]

948
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:03,157
Whoo!

949
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,102
(female announcer) 'The Robotics Club
will be hosting a tech-mixer in the..'

950
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:18,638
No, he's already at his locker.

951
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,205
What if we're too late?

952
00:43:20,207 --> 00:43:23,810
I have never seen so many
cute cats in my entire life.

953
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:26,077
[inhales]
Oh, I want them.

954
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,513
Is he watching cat videos?

955
00:43:28,515 --> 00:43:32,352
I want you, I want you,
I want you and I want you.

956
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:34,620
That was the really,
really important thing?

957
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,323
I'm gonna name you Fluffy-Muffy.

958
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:37,957
Mm, I like that.

959
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:40,428
[ghostly whispering]

960
00:43:45,466 --> 00:43:47,232
Velma, I think
somebody is following us.

961
00:43:47,234 --> 00:43:49,535
What? Not now, Daphne,
we're gonna lose Griffin.

962
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:52,474
[intense music]

963
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:56,345
- Stop!
- No!

964
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,349
[sighs]
Well, there goes that theory.

965
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,285
[sighs]

966
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:09,323
No. I already
sacrificed one robot.

967
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:14,863
[sighs]
Oh, man.

968
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:22,437
[coughing]

969
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:26,037
Again.

970
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,075
What? Uh, what, girls?

971
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:30,843
What happened
to the shame stickers?

972
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:32,144
[thunder rumbling]

973
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:34,714
[groans]
I'm sorry.

974
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,115
I just..

975
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:38,484
I can't believe
the shame stickers didn't work.

976
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:41,754
'I ordered them specially.
You know, they usually work.'

977
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:43,289
I'm pretty sure
if you were wearing them

978
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,524
you wouldn't have melted
the lockers.

979
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:46,258
Okay, Aunt Piper,
you have to believe us.

980
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,062
- Something is up with Griffin.
- I thought it was Spencer.

981
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,263
It is, uh, was.

982
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:52,631
Griffin is up to something.

983
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,901
Yeah, we saw him
go into a secret passage.

984
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,970
We think he's the reason
Spencer seems zombified.

985
00:44:56,972 --> 00:44:59,238
Zombie what? Uh..

986
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,540
Velma, I didn't think
you were the type of girl

987
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,577
who believes in ghosts
and goblins.

988
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,778
I'm not.
I believe there is a logical

989
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,046
explanation behind this.

990
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:10,182
Girls, I have no other choice.

991
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:12,785
I gotta double down.

992
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:15,354
Say hello to the shame drone.

993
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:17,256
(drone)
Remember me?

994
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:18,924
And you still gotta wear
your stickers.

995
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:20,693
(Daphne) Do you still think
Griffin's in on this?

996
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:23,162
I mean, we saw him go into
the locker, same as Spencer.

997
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:24,731
No, it's gotta be him.

998
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:26,131
He benefits
if Spencer goes down.

999
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:28,700
His family's won
the Bloom Bracket competition.

1000
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:29,935
It all makes sense.

1001
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:32,238
(drone)
For shame.

1002
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,372
No.

1003
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:35,307
[bell rings]

1004
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,445
- I'm good.
- Oh, no.

1005
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,281
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Watch it, watch it.

1006
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:42,481
Whoa.

1007
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:44,749
You guys, something's
goin' on with Griffin.

1008
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:46,051
'Are you seeing this?'

1009
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:48,086
I'm good.

1010
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:49,789
Relax, he's fine.

1011
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,926
Yo, Griff. Heads up.

1012
00:45:55,896 --> 00:45:58,531
I'm good.

1013
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,332
Didn't flinch.

1014
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:02,435
- Awesome, dude!
- That's awesome.

1015
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:05,136
That was sick.
Number one, baby.

1016
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,807
- You are the man, Griff.
- 'For shame.'

1017
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,441
If Griffin's been zombified,
then..

1018
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:11,611
- 'I'm good.'
- ...who's behind this?

1019
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:13,912
I mean,
there's no logical explanation.

1020
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:15,580
What if the answer
isn't logical?

1021
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:19,019
The secret passages,
kids turned to lifeless zombies.

1022
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:20,285
Maybe it's not a person
behind this.

1023
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,187
- Don't say it.
- What if it's a..

1024
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:23,856
- A spirit, a ghost?
- You said it.

1025
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:25,223
Look,
you don't have to believe me

1026
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:27,493
but something's
been following us.

1027
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,794
I can feel it.

1028
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:30,763
And the one thing we know
for sure is that they're clearly

1029
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:33,434
going after whoever has the top
spot in the Bloom Bracket.

1030
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,673
Well, then whoever
has the top spot next..

1031
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,509
...could be in danger.

1032
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:45,310
(drone)
For shame.

1033
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,314
- I'm good.
- Hey, wait for me.

1034
00:46:48,316 --> 00:46:51,049
It's Mikayla. We need to get
Mikayla out of the top spot

1035
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:53,185
before anyone hurts her.

1036
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:56,122
But then her replacement
will just be in danger.

1037
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:57,589
And then we'll have to save them

1038
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,524
and then their replacement
and then, and their...

1039
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,361
Stay with me, V.
We can't just put

1040
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:03,194
some random kid in danger
to save Mikayla.

1041
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,765
So what? We just give up?

1042
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:07,566
No, listen.

1043

Hm. I'm good.

- Stop right there.

No offense, but I really wish

1393
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,680
you would have died
in my elevator.

It sucks the creative energy

1404
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:26,845

about using his phone
to make food.

1414
01:03:51,738 --> 01:03:54,608
You used his brain power
to make your 3D food printer.

1415
01:03:56,042 --> 01:04:01,046
Both of you are so
creatively annoying.

1416

(Velma) <i>So you created Tobias Bloom

01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:13,004
<i>and then you started
Bloom Innovative as a cover-up.</i>

going to school and meet</i>

You know, when I mentioned
Legitimate Tulip to her

1494
01:07:44,169 --> 01:07:46,372

how technology in a way
has enslaved our minds.

1529
