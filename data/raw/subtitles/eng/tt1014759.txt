00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,125
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,926
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,966
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,886
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,725
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,726
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:29,205
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,325
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,686
I won't be long.

10
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:47,526
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,726
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:54,165
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:54,247 --> 00:02:00,605
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,686
I didn't know cats could smile.

15
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,886
(SIGHING) Neither did I.

16
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:08,005
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,646
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:12,365
Hmm.

19
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:16,006
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:25,646
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:30,485
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

22
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,565
(LAUGHING)

23
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:35,005
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

24
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,766
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

25
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,006
(LAUGHING) Ow!

26
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:43,486
(SIGHING)

27
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,086
Must we go?

28
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,965
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

29
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:05,686
They will notice.

30
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,965
Where's your corset?

31
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,885
And no stockings.

32
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,166
I'm against them.

33
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,845
But you're not properly dressed.

34
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,325
Who's to say what is proper?

35
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,525
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

36
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,606
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.

37
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,285
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

38
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,566
Please, not today.

39
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,606
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:41,405
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,806
Did you have bad dreams again?

42
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,286
Only one.

43
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,166
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

44
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,685
Do you think that's normal?

45
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,366
Don't most people
have different dreams?

46
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,566
I don't know.

47
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,445
There. You're beautiful.

48
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,485
Now, can you manage a smile?

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

50
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,526
At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

51
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:32,366
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

52
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,126
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

53
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,766
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

54
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,405
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!

55
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:50,405
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

56
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,486
If only Charles were here...

57
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,605
My condolences.

58
00:04:56,286 --> 00:05:00,206
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

59
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:05,205
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

60
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:08,605
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

61
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:14,166
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

62
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,565
Charles thought so, too.

Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

65
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,485
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

(LAUGHS)

67
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,565
Do I amuse you?

68
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,645
No.

69
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,725
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

70
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,846
and the men wearing dresses.

71
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,645
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

72
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,046
When in doubt, remain silent.

00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,006
Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

76
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,685
Where's your head?

77
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,565
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

78
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:15,646
Why would you spend your time

79
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,805
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

80
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,165
Why wouldn't I?

81
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,366
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

82
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:23,525
before breakfast.

83
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:27,446
(SOFTLY) Come along.

84
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:33,485
Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes.

(FAITH EXHALING EXCITEDLY)

86
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,166
We have a secret to tell you.

87
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,206
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

88
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,686
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

89
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,806
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

90
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,686
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.

91
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,446
But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

92
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,965
- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.

93
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:52,565
I wonder if your mother knows

94
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,045
that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

95
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,405
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.

96
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,446
There's your mother right now.

97
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,445
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

98
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,605
You've ruined the surprise!

99
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:08,245
I could strangle them!

100
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:11,326
Everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret.

101
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:12,925
Does everyone know?

102
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:16,806
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

103
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,805
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...

104
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:23,325
But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

106
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:33,325
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

107
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,125
You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

108
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,525
And you don't want to be a burden
on Mother, do you?

109
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:40,725
No.

110
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,925
So you'll marry Hamish.

111
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,725
You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,

112
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,205
and your life will be perfect.

Alice, dear.

115
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:52,245
I'll leave you to it.

Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?

117

118
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,806
The decline of the aristocracy?

119
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,565
Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.

You're bound to produce
little... Imbeciles!

The gardeners have
planted white roses

122
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,646
when I specifically asked for red.

123
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,805
You could always paint the roses red.

124
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:19,925
What an odd thing to say.

125
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:24,245

- The rabbit.

- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.

He's a prince.

146

But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

It's tragic, isn't it?

Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.

01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:24,200
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.

1049
01:33:25,681 --> 01:33:28,520
And there's that trouble
with your digestion.

1050
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:33,840
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.

1051
01:33:37,081 --> 01:33:40,440
You're lucky to have my sister
for your wife, Lowell,

1052
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:44,080
and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

1053

There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.

1054
01:33:48,961 --> 01:33:52,040
You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.

1055
01:33:54,321 --> 01:33:57,320
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

Don't worry, Mother,

1057
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:04,320
I'll find something useful
to do with my life.

1058
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:09,600
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.

1059
01:34:11,841 --> 01:34:14,640
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.

1060
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:18,000
You and I have business to discuss.

1061
01:34:18,081 --> 01:34:20,160
Shall we speak in the study?

1062
01:34:26,721 --> 01:34:28,800
Oh. And one more thing.

My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,

1065
01:34:41,281 --> 01:34:43,720
but I don't think
he was looking far enough.

1066
01:34:43,801 --> 01:34:46,040
Why not go all the way to China?

1067
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:50,920
It's vast, the culture is rich,
and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.

1068
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:55,160
To be the first to trade with China,
can you imagine it?

1069
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,600
You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,

1070
01:34:58,681 --> 01:35:01,440
I'd say, "You've lost your senses."

1071
01:35:01,721 --> 01:35:03,800
But I've seen that look before.

1072
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:08,200
Well, as you're not going to be
my daughter-in-law,

1073
01:35:08,281 --> 01:35:12,000
perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.
