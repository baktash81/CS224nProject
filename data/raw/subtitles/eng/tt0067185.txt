1
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,878
I suppose you think
that's very funny, Harold.

2
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,391
- Hello? Fée?
- Yeah.

3
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,598
Darling, be a dear and cancel my
appointment with René this afternoon.

4
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,390
I know he'll be furious
but I've had such a fright today

5
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,189
and with guests coming
this evening... Oh, would you?

6
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,232
Tell him I promise to be in
on Tuesday.

7
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,471
Thank you, Fée,
you're a darling. Yes.

8
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,630
Bye. Bye.

9
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,510
Dinner at eight, Harold.

10
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,592
And do try and be
a little more vivacious.

11
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,349
Of course, Harold's father
had a similar sense of the absurd.

12
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,149
I remember once in Paris,
he just stepped out for cigarettes

13
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,629
and the next thing I knew
he was arrested

14
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,676
for floating nude down the Seine!

15
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,390
Experimenting in river currents
with rubber water wings!

16
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,038
Mauve ones.

17
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,432
That cost quite a bit of influence et
d'argent to hush up, I can tell you!

18
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,988
Harold, dear,
don't play with your food.

19
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,395
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

20
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,918
I have a sore throat.

21
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,355
Now, directly after dinner,
I want you to go straight to bed.

22
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,839
Harold's always been
a delicate child.

23
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,596
Even as a baby, he seemed prone
to every possible kind of illness.

24
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,955
Harold, dear, eat up your beets.

25
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,150
I remember in Tokyo, I had
to call the embassy for a doctor...

26
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,792
Oh, my God!

27
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,716
This is too much.

28
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,117
I can't stand much more of this.

29
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,076
I can't take any more.

30
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,076
Oh, my God!

31
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,755
Oh, God!

32
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,231
That's very interesting, Harold,
and I think very illuminating.

33
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,835
There seems to be
a definite pattern emerging

34
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,789
and of course this pattern,
once isolated, can be coped with.

35
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,953
Recognise the problem and you're
halfway on the road to its...

36
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,190
its solution.

37
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,558
Tell me, Harold,
what do you do for fun?

38
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,509
What activity gives you a different
sense of enjoyment from the others?

39
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,353
What do you find fulfilling?

40
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,672
What gives you that special...
satisfaction?

41
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
I go to funerals.

42
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,115
"Thou dost prepare for me a table
in the sight of my adversaries,

43
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,350
"Thou dost anoint my head with oil,

44
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,078
"my chalice overflows.

45
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,119
"Kindness and grace shall follow me
all the days of my life

46
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,478
"and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord for length of days.

47
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,791
"The earth is the Lord's
and the fullness thereof,

48
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,235
"the world
and they who dwell therein.

49
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,313
"For He has established it upon the
waters and set it upon the rivers.

50
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,356
"Who shall ascend
the mountain of the Lord

51
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,113
"or who shall stand
in His holy place?

52
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,317
"The innocent of hand
and the pure of heart

53
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,834
"who has not turned his mind
to vanity

54
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,673
"nor sworn deceitfully
to his neighbour,

55
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,911
"he shall receive the blessing
from the Lord

56
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,197
"and a reward from God,
his Saviour.

57
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,397
"This is the generation of those
who seek him..."

58
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,199
Harold?

59
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,510
Why you purchased that monstrosity
I have no idea.

60
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,878
You can have any car you want
but that ugly horror is an eyesore

61
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,518
and an embarrassment.

62
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,909
Really, it is time you settled down

63
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,073
and stopped flitting away your
talents on these amateur theatrics,

64
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,435
these little divertissements,

65
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,592
no matter how
psychologically purging they may be.

66
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,071
I don't know what to do.

67
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,149
Go and have a talk
with your Uncle Victor.

68
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,993
Perhaps he can fathom you.

69
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,868
After all, he was
General MacArthur's right-hand man.

70
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,836
What do you say, Harold?

71
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,032
It's a great life.

72
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,433
There's action, adventure, advising
and you'll see the war first hand.

73
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,992
And there are plenty
of slant-eyed girls.

74
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,355
It'll make a man out of you, Harold.

75
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,638
You'll travel the world, put on
a uniform and take on a man's job.

76
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,996
You'll walk tall with a glint in
your eye and a spring in your step

77
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,471
and a knowledge in your heart
that you are working for peace

78
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,476
and are serving your country,

79
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,279
just like Nathan Hale.

80
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,751
That's what this country needs,
more Nathan Hale.

81
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,190
I think I can see
a little Nathan Hale... in you.

82
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,877
Tell me, Harold, how many of these...

83
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,428
suicides have you performed?

84
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,751
An accurate number
would be difficult to gauge.

85
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,070
Well, just give me a rough estimate.

86
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,878
A rough estimate?

87
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,914
I'd say... 15.

88
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,798
- 15?
- That's a rough estimate.

89
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,519
Were they all done
for your mother's benefit?

90
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,592
No, no - I would not say benefit.

91
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,711
Harold, I only have a few minutes and
I want to inform you of my decision.

92
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,992
You have led a very carefree,
idle, happy life up to the present,

93
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,798
the life of a child.

94
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,792
But it is time now
to put away childish things

95
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,996
and take on adult responsibilities.

96
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,390
We'd all like to sail through life
with no thought of tomorrow

97
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,993
but that cannot be.

98
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,756
We have our duties,
our obligations, our principles.

99
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,152
In short, Harold, I think it is time
for you to get married.

100
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,040
Let's pray to the Lord,
King of Glory,

101
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,193
that he may bless and deliver
the souls of all faithful departed

102
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,272
from the pain of hell
and the bottomless pit.

103
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,319
Deliver them from the lion's mouth
and the darkness therein

104
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,678
and rather, bring them
to the blessing of light,

105
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,149
holy life, eternal rest.

106
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,832
"Oh, Lord, do not bring yourself
into trial

107
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,558
"for no man...

108
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,670
"becomes holy in your sight unless
you grant forgiveness of his sins.

109
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,557
"I implore you, therefore,

110
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,758
"do not let the verdict
of your judgement go against him...

111
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,668
"Rather, by the help of your Grace,

112
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,558
"may he escape the sentence
which he deserves

113
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,155
"for during his earthly life he would
sign the seal of the Holy Trinity.

114
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,158
"You, who live and reign
forever and ever.

115
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,279
"Amen."

116
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,875
- Like some liquorice?
- No, thank you.

117
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,313
You're welcome.

118
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,911
Did you know him?

119
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,116
- No.
- Me neither.

120
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,476
I heard he's 80 years old.
I'll be 80 next week.

121
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,393
A good time to move on,
don't you think?

122
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,232
I don't know.

123
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,949
I mean, 75 is too early but at 85,
you're just marking time.

124
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
You may as well
look over the horizon.

125
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,274
I'll never understand
this mania for black.

126
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,555
Nobody sends black flowers, do they?

127
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,156
Black flowers are dead flowers,
who sends dead flowers to a funeral?

128
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,878
It's absurd!

129
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,117
- What is your name?
- Harold, Harold Chasen.

130
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,591
How do you do? I'm Dame Marjorie
Chardin but you may call me Maude.

131
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,671
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

132
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,797
I think we're gonna be great friends.

133
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,598
Can I give you a lift, Harold?

134
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,148
No, thank you. I have my own car.

135
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,391
Well, I must be off.
We shall have to meet again.

136
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,278
Tell me, do you dance?

137
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,749
- Pardon me?
- Do you sing and dance?

138
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,833
- No.
- No, I thought not.

139
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,035
That woman! She took my car!

140
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,279
I have here the forms sent out by
the National Computer Dating Service.

141
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,635
They screen out the fat and the ugly,

142
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,598
so it is obviously
a firm of high standards.

143
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,240
First, here is
the personality interview,

144
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,515
which you are to fill out and return.

145
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,114
Now then, are you ready, Harold?

146
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,714
Here is the first question.

147
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,872
"Are you uncomfortable
meeting new people?"

148
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,952
Well, I think that's a yes,
don't you agree?

149
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,510
"Should sex education be taught
outside the home?"

150
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,071
I would say no, wouldn't you, Harold?
Yeah, we'll give a D there.

151
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,869
"Should women run for
president of the United States?"

152
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,599
I don't see why not. Absolutely yes.

153
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,276
"Do you remember jokes and take
pleasure in relating them to others?"

154
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,592
Well, you don't do that,
do you, Harold? Absolutely not.

155
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,549
"Do you often get the feeling that
perhaps life isn't worth living?"

156
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,838
What do you think, Harold? A? B?
We'll put C - not sure.

157
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,438
"Is the subject of sex being
overexploited by our mass media?"

158
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,512
Well, that would have to be yes,
wouldn't it?

159
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,751
"Is it difficult for you
to accept criticism?"

160
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,400
No. We'll mark D.

161
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,393
"Do you sometimes have headaches
or backaches after a difficult day?"

162
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,869
Yes, I do indeed.

163
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,871
"Do you go to sleep easily?"

164
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,951
I'd say so.

165
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,998
"Do you believe
in capital punishment for murder?"

166
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,638
Yes, I do indeed.

167
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,633
"In your opinion, are social affairs
usually a waste of time?"

168
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,312
Heavens, no!

169
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,994
"Can God influence our lives?"

170
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,311
Yes, absolutely yes.

171
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,278
"Does your personal religion
or philosophy

172
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,237
"include a life after death?"

173
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,949
Yes, indeed. That's absolutely.

174
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,273
"Did you enjoy life
when you were a child?"

175
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,909
Yes, you were a wonderful baby,
Harold.

176
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,709
"Do you think the sexual revolution
has gone too far?"

177
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,758
It certainly has.

178
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,992
"Do you find the idea
of wife-swapping distasteful?"

179
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,117
I even find the question distasteful.

180
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,474
"Do you..."

181
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,398
Harold, please!

182
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,950
"Do you have ups and downs
without obvious reason?"

183
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,552
That's you, Harold!

184
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,714
"Dearest brothers, let us faithfully
and lovingly remember our brother

185
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,998
"whom God has taken to Himself
from the trials of this world.

186
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,516
"God have mercy,
Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy."

187
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,273
Our Father, who art in heaven,

188
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,237
hallowed be Thy name.

189
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,233
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

190
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,359
Give us this day, our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

191
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,000
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

192
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,278
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

193
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,713
Amen.

194
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,788
My boy, excuse me.

195
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,476
One moment, please. Who was that
old lady waving to you earlier?

196
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,916
Hello, Harold. Can I give you a lift?

197
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,152
There you are, madam. Were you the
lady who drove my car off yesterday?

198
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,913
- The one with the St Christopher?
- Yes.

199
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,151
Then I suppose it was me!
Get in, Harold.

200
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,391
Were you also the one
who painted the saint?

201
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,630
Yes! How did you like that?

202
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,553
- Well, I didn't.
- Don't be too discouraged.

203
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,916
For aesthetic appreciation,
always a little time.

204
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,310
What a delight it is, Harold,
to bump into you again.

205
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,710
I knew we were gonna be good friends
the moment I saw you.

206
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,314
- You go to funerals often?
- Yeah.

207
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,073
So do I.
They're such fun, aren't they?

208
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,355
It's all change, all revolving.

209
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,510
Burials and births, all linked.

210
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,750
The great circle of life.

211
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,713
This thing handles well.
Ever drive a hearse, Harold?

212
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,360
- Yeah.
- It's a new experience for me.

213
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,557
Well done, hearse!

214
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,596
Shall I take you home, Harold?

215
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,716
This is my car.

216
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,268
- Your hearse?
- Yearse!

217
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,993
Then you shall take me home.

218
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,511
So, just before he left
for the monastery in Tibet,

219
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,511
Big Sweeney gave me his keys.

220
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,718
I had to make changes for the new
model, not as many as you'd think.

221
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,555
Once you have you the basic set,
it's only a question of variation.

222
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,552
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

223
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,679
Not any car. I like a variety. I'm
always looking for a new experience.

224
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,519
Maybe... Nevertheless,
I think you're upsetting people.

225
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,556
I don't know if that's right.

226
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,833
If people get upset cos they feel
they have a hold on some things,

227
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,993
I'm just acting as a gentle reminder,
here today, gone tomorrow.

228
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,629
So don't get attached to things.
Now, with that in mind,

229
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,870
I'm not against collecting stuff.

230
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,635
I've collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time.

231
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,831
This is all memorabilia

232
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,629
but it's incidental, not integral,
if you know what I mean.

233
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,352
The birds.

234
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,908
I love them so much.

235
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,151
They are the only wildlife
I get to see any more.

236
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,879
Ah, me, free as a bird.

237
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,437
At one time, I used to break into
pet shops to liberate the canaries

238
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,796
but I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

239
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,714
Zoos are full,
prisons are overflowing.

240
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,433
Oh, my, how the world still...
dearly loves a cage.

241
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,397
Please sit down, Harold.

242
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,109
I'll put the kettle on.
We'll have a nice, hot cup of tea.

243
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,191
Thank you but I really have to go.

244
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,590
But it's oat straw tea!
You've not had that, have you?

245
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,989
- No.
- Well, then.

246
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,913
I really do have to go.
I have an appointment.

247
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,752
I really can't miss it.

248
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,073
At the dentist?

249
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,397
Kind of.

250
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,278
Then, you'll just have to come back
and visit.

251
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,238
- All right.
- My door's always open.

252
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,675
- All right.
- Promise?

253
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,988
I promise.

254
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,834
I asked, do you have any friends?

255
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,832
- No.
- None at all?

256
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,956
No.

257
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,110
Maybe one.

258
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,589
Would you care to talk about
this friend?

259
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,079
No!

260
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,073
You are an interesting case
but this reluctance is detrimental

261
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,355
to the psychoanalytical process.

262
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,510
Do you understand?

263
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,797
Very well.

264
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,873
Your mother tells me that she's
arranging several dates for you

265
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,598
with some young ladies.

266
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,796
How do you feel about that?

267
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,475
- Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
- How do you do? I'm Mrs Chasen.

268
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,553
Do come in. Harold's in the garden
but he'll be here in a moment.

269
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,551
Shall we sit down?

270
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,676
There's Harold.

271
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,712
- He seems very nice.
- Thank you.

272
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,951
- You are at the university?
- Yes, I am.

273
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,715
- What are you studying?
- Poli Sci with a minor in Home Ec.

274
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,438
Poli Sci...?

275
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,069
Political Science.
It's all about what's going on.

276
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,152
Is Harold interested in
what's going on?

277
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,118
I just think
it's such a super thing to study

278
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,953
and I can always fall back
on my Home Ec.

279
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,076
- That's good planning.
- Yes.

280
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,516
Tell me, are you a regular
with this Computer Club?

281
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,797
Heavens, no!
I don't have to worry about dates.

282
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,392
Some of the girls in my sorority
decided that someone ought to try it

283
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,472
so we drew straws and I lost!

284
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,791
But I'm looking forward to
meeting Harold.

285
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,113
I should mention, Candy, Harold does
have his little eccentric moments.

286
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,193
That's all right. I have a brother
who's a real cut-up, too.

287
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,316
I will never forget the time,

288
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,437
we had this old TV set
with no parts in it,

289
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,877
Tommy stuck his head behind it
and started giving a whole newscast

290
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,916
before the entire family!

291
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,877
Must have been very funny.

292
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,636
Yes, dear, here is Harold now.

293
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,756
Harold, this is Candy.

294
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,435
Candy's just been telling us
a funny story about...

295
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,312
Walter Cronkite.

296
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,397
Excuse me.

297
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,991
- I beg your pardon.
- What do you want?

298
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,719
I'm sorry, I was looking for Maude.

299
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,036
How about some ginger pie?

300
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,594
- Fine. Thank you.
- I'll heat some up.

301
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,514
My, Harold,
I'm glad to see you again.

302
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,636
Do you often model for Glaucus?

303
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,473
Heavens, no!
I don't have the time

304
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,391
but I like to keep in practice

305
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,439
and poor Glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed

306
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,034
as to the contours
of the female form.

307
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,517
- Do you disapprove?
- Me? No, of course not.

308
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,315
Really? Do you think it's wrong?

309
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,589
No.

310
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,035
Heavens! I'm glad you said that.

311
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,955
I wanna show you my painting.
This is The Rape Of Rome.

312
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,556
Over in the corner
is Leda And The Swan,

313
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,915
self-portrait,

314
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,230
and over here is my favourite.

315
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,509
It's titled... Rainbow With
Egg Underneath And An Elephant.

316
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,438
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, very much.

317
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,877
I then became infatuated with these,
my odorifics.

318
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,511
Give the nose a treat!
A kind of a... olfactory banquet.

319
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,639
So, I began on the easiest -
roast beef, old books, mown grass

320
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,631
and Mexican farmyard.

321
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,593
Here's one you'll like,
Snowfall on 42nd Street.

322
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,955
I'll put it on.

323
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,948
Now, you hold onto this,
I'll pump it up.

324
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,115
Now, hold it up there. That's right.
What do you smell?

325
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,438
Subways?

326
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,110
Perfume?

327
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,795
Cigarettes!

328
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,993
- Snow.
- Sn...!

329
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,477
It goes on and on.

330
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,953
It's just great.

331
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,716
But... then I decided
to switch to the tactile.

332
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,630
- What do you think?
- I like this.

333
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,838
No, no, really get close
and reach in and feel.

334
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,832
There's my kettle.

335
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
Well... stroke...

336
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,435
palm... caress... explore.

337
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,957
Here we are.
Oat straw tea and ginger pie.

338
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,435
Excuse the mismatched saucers.

339
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,310
- This is a new experience for me.
- Wonderful!

340
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,598
Try something new each day. After
all, we're given life to find it out.

341
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,238
Doesn't last forever.

342
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,197
You look as if you could.

343
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,593
Did I tell you
I'll be 80 on Saturday?

344
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,238
You don't look 80.

345
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,598
That's the influence of the right
food, exercises and breathing.

346
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,035
Greet the dawn with a breath of fire.

347
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,717
There's no question,
my body's giving out.

348
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,554
I'm well into autumn. It's all gonna
be over after Saturday.

349
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,395
Tell me about yourself. What do you
do when you aren't at funerals?

350
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,519
Yes, there is definitely
a certain attraction.

351
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,475
I ask you though, Harold,
is it enough?

352
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,917
What do you mean?

353
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,080
I like to watch things grow.

354
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,039
They... grow and bloom and...
fade and die

355
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,270
and change into something else.

356
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,439
Life!

357
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,518
I should like to change
into a sunflower most of all.

358
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,592
They're so tall and simple.

359
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,830
What flower would you like to be?

360
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,478
I don't know.

361
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,792
- One of these maybe.
- Why do you say that?

362
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,956
- Because they're all alike.
- But they're not.

363
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,160
Look, see, some are smaller,
some are fatter.

364
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,913
Some grow to the left,
some to the right.

365
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,275
Some, even, have lost some petals.

366
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,828
All kinds of observable differences.

367
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,636
You see, Harold, I feel that
much of the world's sorrow

368
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,995
comes from people who are this...

369
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,032
yet, allow themselves
to be treated as that.

370
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,198
Power steering.

371
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,591
That little tree is in trouble.
Come on.

372
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,318
Look at it.

373
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,437
It's suffocating. It's the smog.

374
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,115
People can live with it but trees,
it gives them asthma.

375
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,988
They can't breathe.
The leaves! They're turning brown.

376
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,550
Harold, we have got to do something
about this life.

377
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,110
- What?
- We'll transplant it to the forest.

378
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,270
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

379
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,557
- This is public property.
- Well, exactly.

380
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,995
Well, we'll need tools.

381
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,117
You're right.
We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.

382
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,958
Wait a minute.

383
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,519
Police. Come.

384
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,351
Good afternoon, Officer.
A bit of trouble here?

385
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,352
Yes, ma'am.
Someone had trouble parking.

386
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,353
Tell me, that car over there,
is that parked all right?

387
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,112
Yes, ma'am, that's fine.

388
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,557
Thank you so much. You might turn
the radio off - saves the battery.

389
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,390
A little after-dinner liqueur,
Harold?

390
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,268
- Thank you, I don't drink.
- It's all right, it's organic.

391
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,238
- Thanks.
- It has no nutritional value

392
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,108
but consistency
is not really a human trait.

393
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,236
What is that up there?

394
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,151
That's my umbrella.

395
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,153
That's just a relic. I found it when
I was packing to come to America.

396
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,550
It used to be my defence
on picket lines and rallies

397
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,392
and political meetings,

398
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,268
being dragged off by the police
and attacked by thugs.

399
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,191
What were you fighting for?

400
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,991
Big issue.
Liberty, rights, justice.

401
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,390
Kings died, kingdoms fell.

402
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,675
I don't regret the kingdom.

403
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,550
What sense in borders
and nations and patriotism?

404
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,750
But I miss the kings.

405
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,273
When I was a little girl,
I was taken to the palace in Vienna

406
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,918
to a garden party.

407
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,596
I can still see the sun shining,
the parasols,

408
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,752
the flashing uniforms
of the young officers.

409
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,752
I thought then
that I would marry a soldier.

410
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,753
Later on,
Frederick would chide me about it.

411
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,954
He was so serious.

412
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,633
A doctor at the university...

413
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,472
and in the government.

414
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,313
But that was all before.

415
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,398
So...

416
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,955
you don't use the umbrella any more?

417
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,037
No more revolts?

418
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,439
Yes. Every day...

419
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,118
but... I don't need a defence
any more, I embrace.

420
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,794
Still fighting for the big issues

421
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,509
but now in my small, individual way.

422
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,109
Shall we have a song?

423
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,192
- I don't play...
- Come on, I'll show you.

424
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,474
No...

425
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,712
Harold, join in.

426
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,159
That was fun!
Let's play something together!

427
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,233
- I don't play anything.
- Nothing?!

428
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,235
Dear me! Everybody should be able
to make some music.

429
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,312
That's the cosmic dance.
Come with me.

430
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,709
There has to be something.

431
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,598
Now, let me see...

432
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,956
Hold onto this. What is this?

433
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,951
Just a second, there we are.

434
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,679
You take...
This is the one. Take that.

435
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,878
Just be impulsive, be fanciful.
Let the music flow out of you.

436
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,155
You gotta make some chords.

437
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,993
Put your finger
on the second fret there

438
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,038
and this one on the third.
Then this one here.

439
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,353
Harold dear.

440
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,473
There you are!

441
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,394
I have a little surprise for you.

442
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,993
It's a present.

443
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,277
Come along.

444
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,632
There!

445
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,517
Isn't it darling?

446
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,673
I had them take away that monstrous
thing of yours and send this.

447
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,558
So much more appropriate,
don't you think?

448
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,437
One thing more, Harold.

449
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,034
I telephoned
your second computer date

450
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,475
and she seems a very nice,
quiet girl.

451
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,189
Cute little thing, isn't it?
I like it very much.

452
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,197
Your licence, lady.

453
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,113
I don't have one.
I don't believe in them.

454
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,278
- How long you been driving, lady?
- About 45 minutes, I guess.

455
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,956
We were hoping to start sooner
but it's rather hard to find a truck.

456
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,871
Is this your truck?

457
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,837
No, I just took it.

458
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,832
- You took it?
- Yes, I have to plant my tree.

459
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,639
Well, it's not mine really

460
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,793
but we would like to get it
into soil as soon as possible.

461
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,311
Let me get this straight, you...

462
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,995
All right, then, we'll be off.
Nice chatting with you.

463
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,671
- He was very nice.
- Yeah.

464
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,678
- I think he's following us.
- Is he?!

465
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,914
The police,
always wanting to play games.

466
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,159
Ma'am!

467
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,876
Is the little tree all right?

468
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,038
Yeah, fine.

469
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,758
Terrific!

470
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,712
There.

471
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,799
I love the feel of soil, don't you?

472
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,232
And the smell.

473
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,752
It's the earth...

474
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,271
The earth is my body,
my head is in the stars.

475
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,672
Who said that?

476
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,475
I don't know.

477
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,471
I suppose I did.

478
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,118
Poor baby.

479
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,398
Isn't it wonderful?!
All around us, living things.

480
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,552
All right, out, lady.

481
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,198
- Come on.
- Hello. Have we met before?

482
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,077
None of that, lady. Out.

483
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,278
It must have been your brother.
There is a family resemblance.

484
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,035
Buddy, get out of the car.
Just stand over there, lady.

485
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,678
Get out, buster!

486
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,876
You're in a lot of trouble, lady.

487
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,872
I have you for several offences,
including...

488
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,996
possession of a stolen vehicle,

489
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,755
resisting arrest and possession
of a stolen tree. Where is it?

490
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,876
- We planted it.
- You planted it.

491
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,030
- Is this your shovel?
- No.

492
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,596
Possession of a stolen shovel.

493
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,877
Don't get officious.
You're not yourself when you are.

494
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,235
That's the curse of a government job.

495
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,518
Lady.

496
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,274
Are you gonna take
a lot of time with this?

497
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,433
- Lady, please. Just quiet, please.
- Cos if you are...

498
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,431
Grab the shovel, Harold.

499
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,590
Lady! Stop or I'll have to shoot.

500
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,631
I sure am picking up on vices.

501
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,150
Vice? Virtue?
It's best not to be too moral.

502
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,233
You cheat yourself out of
too much life. Aim above morality.

503
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,232
If you apply that to life,

504
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,515
then you're bound to live it fully.

505
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,792
I haven't lived.

506
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,391
I've died a few times.

507
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,879
What was that?

508
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,799
Well...

509
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,272
The first time
was when I was at boarding school,

510
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,112
in the chemistry lab.

511
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,274
I was in there cleaning it up so I
decided I'd do a little experiment.

512
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,273
You know, so I got all this stuff out
and began mixing it up,

513
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,998
it was very scientific!

514
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,149
There was this massive explosion.

515
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,710
It knocked me down,
blew out a huge hole in the floor.

516
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,112
There was boards and bricks
and flames leaping up.

517
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,318
I figured, you know... time to leave.

518
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,834
My career in school was over.

519
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,271
So... I went home.

520
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,956
My mother was a giving a party so
I went up the back stairs to my room.

521
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,953
Turned out the light and...
I got this funny feeling.

522
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,919
The doorbell rang.
I went out to the banister

523
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,798
and these two policemen came in,

524
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,512
found my mother... and... told her

525
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,034
that I was killed in the fire.

526
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,236
She put one hand up to her forehead,

527
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,915
the other one she reached out
as if groping for support,

528
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,436
and with this long sigh,

529
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,910
she collapsed in their arms.

530
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,196
I decided right then
that I enjoyed being dead.

531
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,198
I understand.
A lot of people enjoy being dead

532
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,271
but they're not dead really.

533
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,478
They're just backing away from life.

534
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,839
Reach out and take a chance,
get hurt even,

535
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,230
but play as well as you can.

536
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,754
Go team, go!

537
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,957
Gimme an L, gimme an I,
gimme a V, gimme an E.

538
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,838
L-l-V-E, live.

539
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,314
Otherwise you got nothing
to talk about in the locker room.

540
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,758
I like you, Maude.

541
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,637
I like you, Harold.

542
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,238
Harold is down at the garage.

543
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,073
He has a new car
and he's just been tuning it up.

544
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,913
- He's very mechanical.
- What kind of car is it?

545
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,672
It's a little Jaguar.

546
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,557
It looks like a hearse.

547
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,035
Very nice. You know, compact.

548
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,714
Edith, I'd like you to meet
my son Harold.

549
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,472
Harold, this is Edith...

550
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,432
- Phern.
- Phern. Very pleased to meet you.

551
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,911
I think you should go and wash up,
dear. Join us in the drawing room.

552
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,871
And what do you do, my dear?

553
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,872
I'm a file clerk,
Harrison Feed and Grain.

554
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,474
Well, what is it exactly that you do?

555
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,916
I'm in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest.

556
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,399
How interesting.

557
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,109
We supply, for example,
most of the egg farmers in Pataluma.

558
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,760
- So you can imagine...
- Yes.

559
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,791
Here's Harold now.

560
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,791
Don't get up, dear.

561
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,075
Edith has been talking about her job.

562
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,718
I'm a file clerk.

563
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,518
Henderson Feed and Grain.

564
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,354
Harrison, Harrison Feed and Grain.
It's at Hamilton and 4th.

565
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,271
I'm in charge of the invoices.

566
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,914
I type up the schedule
for the trucking fleet.

567
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,878
She supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed.

568
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,520
Well, not exactly
the whole southwest,

569
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,795
although we do do a large business.

570
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,429
Barley was very big last week.
1,500...

571
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,476
bushels.

572
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,555
In view of your recent actions,
Harold,

573
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,676
you have left me with no recourse

574
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,558
but to listen to
your uncle's proposed solution.

575
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,668
Consequently, I have instructed him
to induct you into the service,

576
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,876
and for your own good,

577
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,839
to take up active duty
with the United States army.

578
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,555
And I hope they have more luck
with you than I.

579
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,152
Maude, they're gonna draft me.

580
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,196
Well, don't go.

581
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,157
They'll put me in jail.

582
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,119
Well, historically,
you'll be in very good company.

583
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,390
Maude, can you help me?

584
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,395
With your skill and my experience, I
think we can come up with something.

585
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,713
Look on me
as a father in this matter.

586
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,678
I know you have no desire
to join the army

587
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,469
but once you're in, you'll love it.
It's a great life.

588
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,678
Look at me - chauffeur, respect,
money in the bank.

589
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,390
It has its drawbacks
like anything else, I suppose,

590
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,429
but the army takes care of you
and you've got a buddy for life.

591
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,349
Good idea coming out here, Harold.
It's a lovely spot.

592
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,510
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Call me sir.

593
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,196
That's the first thing you learn.
An officer deserves your respect.

594
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,554
Yes, sir.

595
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,676
Let's examine the facts on it.

596
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,835
I say this country has been too harsh
on its outright condemnation of war.

597
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,629
You can point to the many
material advantages brought about

598
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,836
by a crisis and conflict policy.

599
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,992
Hell, World War II gave us
the ballpoint pen.

600
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,152
In wartime,
the national suicide rate drops.

601
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,438
Is that a fact? Now, why in hell
did we give up on the Germans?

602
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,274
Since the damn politicians
chalked them up on our side,

603
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,750
the wars ever since
have been a national disgrace.

604
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,319
Hell, look at history -

605
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,949
the two best wars we ever
fought were against the Jerries.

606
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,396
I say get the Krauts
on the other side where they belong.

607
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,837
Let's have an enemy worth killing
and a war this country can support.

608
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,914
That's pretty strong stuff, sir.

609
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,039
Well, Harold, I've always been a man
that speaks his piece.

610
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,795
Always hurt me.
I'm not liked in Washington.

611
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,953
I know that...
but I do have friends in high places.

612
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,950
They kept falling!

613
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,838
Joe falls back,
a neat, red hole in his head.

614
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,793
Only one thing
kept going through my mind.

615
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,829
Kill! Kill! For Joe and Mack
and all the rest of the guys.

616
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,798
Kill! And then there was
a blinding flash...

617
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,675
and I woke up on a stretcher.

618
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,716
"Did we hold?" I asked the medic.

619
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,792
"Yes, sir," he said...

620
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,431
and I slipped into unconsciousness.

621
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,319
Boy!

622
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,590
That's a terrific story, sir.

623
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,835
Well, you'll have stories like that
to tell of your own some day.

624
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,309
- Do you think so, sir?
- Sure you will.

625
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,949
Gee, I never dreamed
it could be that exciting.

626
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,679
It's the most exciting thing
in the world.

627
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,036
To pit your own life against another.

628
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,997
- Yes.
- To kill.

629
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,389
The taste of blood in your mouth.

630
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,471
The moment of truth.

631
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,030
- Another man's life in your sights!
- Yes!

632
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,033
- Will they really teach me to shoot?
- Sure. A range of weapons.

633
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,714
- To use a bayonet?
- Yes!

634
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,473
- How about hand-to-hand combat?
- Yes.

635
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,596
To strangle someone, choke 'em,

636
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,240
squeeze out his life
in your bare hands!

637
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,676
- You're getting carried away.
- To slit his throat...

638
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,320
- I don't know.
- See the blood spurt out.

639
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,391
- And souvenirs.
- Souvenirs?

640
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,950
Of your kill.
Eyes, ears, nose, scalp, privates.

641
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,511
What would be the chance
of getting one of these?

642
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,990
- To think I could make my own!
- That's disgusting.

643
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,072
- It certainly is.
- Madam, who are you?

644
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,550
- I am petitioning for peace.
- Parasite.

645
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,428
- I came here to speak.
- Crazy parasite. Commie bastard.

646
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,957
Don't you talk to me like that,
you foul-mouthed degenerate.

647
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,474
- Remember Nathan Hale.
- Calm down.

648
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,155
- She's a commie pig...
- Don't you advance on me!

649
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,435
You'll all end up like this.

650
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,273
- Just like this!
- Filth. Filth!

651
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,432
Give me that.
I'm gonna throw that in the sewer.

652
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,750
- Madam, please.
- She took my head.

653
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,559
- Calm down, Harold.
- She took my head!

654
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,074
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

655
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,718
I'll kill her!

656
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,918
Give back the head,
let's have no trouble. Harold!

657
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,957
Madam!

658
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,758
Damn you!

659
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,395
You took my head! You cow!

660
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,436
- I'll kill you!
- Help!

661
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,872
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

662
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,756
Harold, stop that.

663
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,589
What have you done?

664
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,277
Do you pray?

665
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,397
Pray? No, I communicate.

666
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,716
With God?

667
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,438
Life.

668
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,988
- This is real nice.
- Yeah.

669
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,356
- Makes me want to do somersaults.
- Why don't you?

670
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,593
I'd feel stupid.

671
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,877
Harold, everyone has the right
to make an ass out of themselves.

672
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,872
You can't let the world
judge you too much.

673
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,558
Do you care to join me
in a little cartwheel?

674
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,670
I feel more like yelling!

675
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,398
I had the most wonderful day today...

676
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,519
and... you're very beautiful.

677
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,359
You make me feel like a schoolgirl.

678
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,232
Shall I come and visit you tomorrow?
Oh, I can't.

679
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,199
I have a luncheon date...
with a girl.

680
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,914
I don't even know her.
My mother arranged it.

681
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,753
Look!

682
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,548
Dreyfus once wrote from
Devil's Island that he would see

683
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,517
the most glorious birds.

684
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:06,197
Many years later in Brittany, he
realised they had only been seagulls.

685
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,389
For me, they will
always be glorious birds.

686
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,231
I cannot emphasise too strongly
the importance of this meeting.

687
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,598
This is the last girl so this is
your third and final chance.

688
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,399
And please try to be serious, Harold.

689
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,233
If not for your sake,
at least for hers.

690
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,151
There she is.

691
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,800
Sunshine, I'd like you
to meet Harold.

692
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,836
Harold, this is Sunshine Doré.

693
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,956
How do... How do you do?

694
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,951
I can't complain.

695
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,196
Sunshine is an actress, Harold.

696
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,953
- I like to think so.
- Wonderful.

697
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,918
Why don't you two go down
to the music room

698
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,389
and I'll follow with some drinks.

699
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,233
Or perhaps Starlight
would like a cigarette.

700
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,235
- Sunshine!
- Yes, of course.

701
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,912
Sunshine.

702
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,035
Would you like a cigarette?

703
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,078
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

704
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,230
Is Sunshine your real name?

705
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,314
Well, actually it was the name
of my drama teacher, Louis Sunshine.

706
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,311
Perhaps you've heard of him?

707
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,712
He was such an influence on
the development of my instrument.

708
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,475
That means my body in theatre talk.

709
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,835
Doré is my real name.

710
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,992
Well, Dore, actually.

711
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,596
Oh, my! What a lovely place
you have here.

712
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,718
Do you play?

713
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,635
No. I am learning the ban...
The harmonica.

714
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,914
Is this your father?

715
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,349
No. It's my Uncle Victor.

716
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,389
He's in the army. I do so like
the military, don't you?

717
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,913
What a wonderful collection
of knives. May I see them?

718
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,150
No, don't touch. They're very old.

719
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,515
Do you enjoy knives?

720
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,238
Oh, yes!

721
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,348
You might find this one interesting.
It's a Hara-Kiri blade.

722
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,518
What's Hara-Kiri?

723
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,231
That was marvellous!

724
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,868
It had the ring of truth.

725
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,511
I played Juliet
in the Sunshine Playhouse.

726
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,160
Louis thought it was
my best performance.

727
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,791
What's here?
A cup, closed in my true love's hand?

728
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,950
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

729
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,151
O, happy dagger.

730
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,238
O, happy dagger,

731
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,710
this is thy sheath,
there rest...

732
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,954
...and let me die...

733
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,435
I-I've...

734
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,915
That was your last date.

735
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,155
It wasn't very scary.

736
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,993
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.

737
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,834
Come on, you loved it.
It was a new experience.

738
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,836
You sure have a way with people.

739
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,076
Well, they're my species.

740
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,111
Look at these stars.

741
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,113
Here.

742
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,158
A gift!

743
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,396
"Harold loves Maude"

744
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,035
And Maude loves Harold.

745
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,675
This is the nicest present
that I've received in years.

746
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,872
So I'll always know where it is.

747
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,515
Could I speak with Fée, please?

748
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:42,793
Fée? Darling,
I know René will be furious but...

749
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,872
If he knew what I had to put up with
in the last few days.

750
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,712
- Mother.
- Not now, dear.

751
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,916
Could you put me down for Monday?

752
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,833
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.

753
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,717
I'm getting married.

754
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,392
What did you say?

755
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,753
I'm getting married.

756
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,598
Hold the line, Fée.

757
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,911
To who?

758
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,717
I suppose you think this
is very funny, Harold. A sunflower.

759
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,720
You can't be serious.

760
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,189
Your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan

761
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,511
and although I have nothing
against marriage,

762
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,752
I don't think
this is quite... normal.

763
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,072
A very common neurosis,
particularly in this society,

764
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,439
whereby the male child subconsciously
wishes to sleep with his mother.

765
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,630
Of course, what puzzles me, Harold,

766
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,598
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother.

767
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,717
I would be remiss in my duty...

768
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,234
if I did not tell you...

769
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,311
that the idea of...

770
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,318
intercourse...

771
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,275
and the fact of your firm, young...

772
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,752
body...

773
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,312
co-mingling...

774
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,036
with the...

775
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,997
withered flesh...

776
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,596
sagging...

777
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,114
breasts...

778
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,792
and...

779
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,598
flabby...

780
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,998
buttocks...

781
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,678
makes me want...

782
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,194
to vomit.

783
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,870
It's... dazzling.

784
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,069
You've thought of everything,

785
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,310
and champagne.

786
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,356
It's all right, it's organic.

787
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,513
For you.

788
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,593
And...

789
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,078
after dinner...

790
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,915
one more little surprise...

791
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,316
that I hope will make you very happy.

792
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,877
I am happy.

793
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,590
I couldn't imagine
a lovelier farewell.

794
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,392
Farewell?

795
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,869
Yes, it's my 80th birthday.

796
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,994
Well, you're not going anywhere...
are you?

797
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,755
Yes, dear.
I took the tablets an hour ago.

798
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,149
I'll be gone by midnight.

799
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,996
What?!

800
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,148
What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.

801
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,038
Don't die, Maude, for Christ's sake.

802
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,153
Don't upset yourself so.

803
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,713
I love you.

804
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,758
I love you.

805
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,351
Harold... that's wonderful.

806
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,596
Go and love some more.

807
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,350
Never. Never.
