Honey, don't do this.
I can't shift if you do that.

Hmm?

an incredibly sensitive chest, though.

Nothing, stupid chest.

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,848
I just wanted to know
how it felt to you.

175
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,001
It felt really terrific. It's just...

176
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:49,406
I don't understand why I have
to announce it all the time.

177
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:54,260
You don't have to announce it
all the time. Just tell me.

178
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:58,114
I have to be reassured.
What's wrong with that?

179
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:02,869
It's difficult to give out bulletins
in the heat of passion.

180
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:05,905
You hardly said a word
to me all night.

181
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:09,025
I'm always quiet at night.

182
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,545
You were never quiet
before we were married.

183
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,747
We never made love
before we were married!

184
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:17,400
We fooled around a little,
but this is all new.

185
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,209
It's all new to me too.

186
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:34,000
You're gonna have to give me
about 40 or 50 years.

187
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,819
Why do you keep saying 40 or 50 years?
We're on our honeymoon.

188
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,773
I mean, we're not even out
of Georgia yet.

189
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,811
Look at Mr. grouch!

190
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:50,233
"Mommy, mommy, help me.

191
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:53,619
I married a grouch."

192
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,517
You all right?

193
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,547
Mm-hmm.

194
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,611

00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:00,821
Hi, Miami beach.

200
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,243
Miami beach, hello!

201
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,230
Here we come, Miami beach!

202
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:23,526
Paging Max Doogan.
Come to the front desk, please.

203
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:45,849
Thank you very much.
Have a nice day.

204
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,601
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

208
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:20,550
We go down now, we can get
a whole afternoon of sun in.

209
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:24,003
Wait just two seconds.
Just two seconds.

210
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:27,156
Just two seconds.

211
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,782
Give me, give me two seconds.

212
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,624
Listen, I'll meet you down there, okay?

213
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:10,767
- I'll meet you down in about ten minutes, okay?
- Okay.

214
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,115
That's my spot.

215
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:07,056
<i>What? Excuse me?</i>

216
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:11,161
I said, you're lying in my spot.

217
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:16,666
This is your spot?

218
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:20,086
<i>- Everybody knows that.
- I didn't know--</i>

219
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:24,157
I just got here.
I didn't, uh-- I'll move.

220
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:27,444
<i>I just got here.</i>

221
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,547
Never mind.
Just don't do it again.

222
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:53,686
Lenny?

223
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,788
Lenny!

224
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,947
Len?

225
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,469
Lenny, come on!

226
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,795
- Come on!
- Be right up.

227
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,048
What are you looking at?

228
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:39,065
No, no.

229
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,534
The sun's hot, honey.

230
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,972
I just wanna get a little tan.

231
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,710
You've already been out an hour.
That's a lot the first day.

232
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,796
I know when I've had enough.

233
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:04,774
Ooh, it's hot! It's hot.
You feel like a dip?

234
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:08,177
You know I can't swim.

235
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:11,181
You can't swim?
I didn't know that.

236
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:14,033
You did too.

237
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:16,436
How would I know that?
I've never been to the beach with you.

238
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:19,288
Well...

239
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:22,675
I guess that's another thing
you just found out about me.

240
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:24,377
Hey!

241
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:27,246
Oh! I'm so sorry.
Did I get you wet?

242
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,549
- No, that's okay.
- I'm really sorry.

243
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:32,468
- That's okay.
- I didn't mean to.

244
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,345
Who's she?

245
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,715
I don't know.

246
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,337
Is she staying here?

247
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,290
I don't know.

248
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:56,492
Think she's attractive?

249
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,179
No!

250
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,435
I warned you.
Didn't I warn you, Lila?

251
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:09,472
- Didn't I say, "Lila, you're getting too much sun"?
- Ow!

252
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,507
Didn't I say that?

253
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:16,279
I just wanted to get a nice tan.

254
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:20,249
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's too late now.

255
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:23,403
You're gonna puff up
like a basketball.

256
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:27,306
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I mean, here it is, our honeymoon.

257
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:31,528
I thought we would go to the dog races;
I thought we would go to jai alai.

258
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:35,331
I thought we would see some
of the big shows in the big hotels.

259
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,433
Instead, we're gonna sit
in a hotel room.

260
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:40,953
- Oww!
- You're gonna puff up. I'm gonna watch television.

261
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:43,422
I won't puff up.

262
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,660
I'll put some stuff on that stops you
from puffing up.

263
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,662
There's no such thing as that!

264
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,082
They haven't invented anything like that!
You're gonna puff up!

265
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,053
You're not gonna be a normal person
till Wednesday or Thursday.

266
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,455
You could be
a little more sympathetic.

267
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,759
I'm going down to the bar
for a bottle of beer.

268
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,312
Where are you going?

269
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,716
I'm going down to the bar
for a bottle of beer.

270
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:14,437
- When will you be back?
- When I finish my bottle of beer!

271
00:26:14,504 --> 00:26:17,856
It's our first night in Florida.

272
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:21,277
What difference what night it is?
I'm thirsty!

273
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,096
Turn the television on.

274
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:27,149
I'll come back after my beer.

275
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,382
How's it goin'?

276
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,718
It's Miami.

277
00:26:45,802 --> 00:26:48,070
I know what you mean.

278
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,626
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

279
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,433
<i>That's my stool.</i>

280
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,939
Hi.

281
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,878
Did he say you could sit in my stool?

282
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:32,515
I didn't know it was your stool.
Would you like it back?

283
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:36,469
I'll let you know when I do.

284
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,640
You a guest at this hotel?

285
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:43,692
Is that what this is?

286
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:53,553
I just got in today.
I'm Len Cantrow.

287
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,205
No kidding?

288
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,380
Can I get you a drink?

289
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,401
No.

290
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:11,236
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

291
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,856
Come on, Kelly.
They're waiting for us.

292
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:16,626
Reservations were 8:30.

293
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:26,418
<i>Gonna be on the beach tomorrow?</i>

294
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,921
Oh, yeah, sure.

295
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,858
In the morning?

296
00:28:32,926 --> 00:28:35,461
Yeah, I don't even have breakfast.
I just have some juice.

297
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll put on my trunks,
and I'm down there.

298
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,050
Just make sure
you stay off my spot.

299
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:46,071
Thanks for the nut.

300
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,714
Did you meet anyone at the bar?

301
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,749
What?

302
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,069
I said, did you meet anyone
at the bar?

303
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:05,658
Who would I meet at the bar?
There's just a bunch of jerks here.

304
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:09,962
- I don't know.
- You were gone so long. I thought, maybe--

305
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,997
like you were talking
to someone at the bar.

306
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:17,152
No, they don't even get a crowd
until midnight. I was, I was alone.

307
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,891
I put cream on.

308
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,110
It doesn't hurt so much anymore.

309
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:29,965
Maybe tomorrow I could sit in the shade
with you for a while?

310
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,201
No!
You stay out of the shade.

311
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:34,770
<i>I mean, there are sun rays in the shade.</i>

312
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:37,273
You have to stay in the room
all day tomorrow.

313
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:41,678
What'll you do?

314
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:46,115
I'll, I'll hang around the beach.
I'll look at the jerks.

315
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,685
There's a lot of paperbacks in the lobby.

316
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,621
Wait!
Where are you rushing to?

317
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:13,676
<i>Nowhere.
I'm not rushing anywhere.</i>

318
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:17,880
Just who would want to spend
a beautiful day like this in bed?

319
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,783
Want me to call room service,

320
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:25,705
order you some breakfast
or coffee or something?

321
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:27,907
I can do it myself.

322
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:31,427
Yeah, call room service,
order anything you want.

323
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:34,213
I'll keep checking with you all day long.

324
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,682
You know something? The best thing
I could do is leave you alone...

325
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,820
Because the only thing
that's gonna help you is time.

326
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:44,540
<i>- And cream.
- Cream and time.</i>

327
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:47,126
Lenny?

328
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,268
If I look better by tonight,
could we go out someplace for dinner?

329
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:59,555
Absolutely. Anything you wanna do,
we're gonna do it, okay?

330
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,557
Anything you want, that's what we'll do.

331
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:05,961
Just take care of yourself, and I'll, uh--
I'll check with you all day.

332
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,947
The important thing is that I get outta here.
I'll leave you alone.

333
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:12,068
You'll be better off.
Really.

334
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:14,269
Okay?
Oh!

335
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:18,507
Hot! It's so hot out here. You're so lucky
you have an air-conditioned room.

336
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,809
It's so hot out here.
Okay.

337
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:24,430
Excuse me.

338
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:26,432
I'm sorry, excuse me.

339
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,219
He's crazy.
He's in such a rush. He's crazy.

340
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:57,946
I didn't know they allowed Teddy bears
on the beach.

341
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:00,249
I didn't see any signs.

342
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:05,104
They're not allowed!
So just stay off the beach.

343
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,637
Ahh!

344
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,857
Whoa. You are this terrific girl!

345
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:27,910
You are this terrific--

346
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,680
what a terrific girl you are!

347
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:34,817
I didn't know Teddy bears could talk.

348
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,152
Hey, where'd you get that laugh?

349
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,805
My father bought it for me.

350
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:42,307
We're very rich.

351
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,869
Oh!

352
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,409
Last one to shore buys the cokes.

353
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,253
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a second.

354
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,707
I think I should tell you.

355
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:18,527
That girl I was with yesterday?

356
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:23,315
Miss? That girl I was with
yesterday is my wife.

357
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,751
I'm on my honeymoon.

358
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:29,204
I just got married three days ago.

359
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:32,357
<i>So what else is new?</i>

360
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:35,144
What else is new?

361
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:38,264
What else is new?

362
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:43,502
<i>Minnesota? I mean,
what do you want to live...</i>

363
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:46,655
in a dumb place like Minnesota for?
- What's wrong with Minnesota?

364
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:49,141
I mean,
it's so far from New York.

365
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:52,894
Well, if you and your cute little wife
are ever driving through,

366
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,897
stop in and say hello.

367
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:59,769
Is there another name
that goes with Kelly?

368
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,437
Corcoran.

369
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:04,073
Kelly Corcoran.
That figures.

370
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,110
A girl like you is gonna have a name
like Kelly Corcoran.

371
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:11,246
What's your cute little wife's name?

372
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,882
Lila.

373
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,967
Lila?

374
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,337
Lila.

375
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,422
Does Lila come when you call her?

376
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:23,241
No. She's okay.

377
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:26,328
<i>What's that ring for?</i>

378
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:29,948
It holds my finger on.
I've got leprosy.

379
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,490
<i>That's funny.</i>

380
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,933
I like your hair down.
It gives you a Teddy bear look.

381
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,388
Does it bother you if I do that?

382
00:34:57,294 --> 00:35:01,097
- You can do anything you like.
- Anything?

383
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:05,284
I think you're ready for my test.

384
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,036
Test?
You have a test?

385
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:10,806
Terrific!

386
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,792
Give me your arm.

387
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,981
Just relax.

388
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:23,752
It's my own special scratch test,

389
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,857
only given to certain
selective individuals.

390
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:32,194
Relax!

391
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:35,114
Relax your fingers.

392
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:39,284
Kelly! Come on, honey, it's 3:00.
Let's go, huh?

393
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:44,706
Sure, dad. I'll be there in just a minute.
Okay? Go ahead.

394
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:48,027
I promise.
Be right there.

395
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,940
- Well, thanks for the coke.
- Wait a minute.

396
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,375
- Where are you going in the middle of a beautiful day?
- We're checking out.

397
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:06,044
You're checking out today?

398
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:09,097
Daddy doesn't like this place.
He doesn't like the element you get here.

399
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,684
We're moving to the Jockey Club
until Saturday.

400
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,953
Wait a second. I've gotta see you
one more time.

401
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,206
- I've gotta prove something to myself.
- We're moving to the Jockey Club.

402
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:22,143
Can I see you there? Can I meet you
for a drink? I'll come over like 7:00.

403
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,431
We're going to the Fontainebleau tonight
with some Colorado people.

404
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:29,901
I could come over.
I'll stop over for a drink at 7:00.

405
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:35,741
- What about your cute little wife?
- It's okay. A drink at 7:00.

406
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,979
Well, if Lila won't let you,
you can have my spot on the beach.

407
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:49,321
But you said we could go out for dinner
if the swelling went down.

408
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:52,925
We are. We're going out for dinner.
I already made reservations.

409
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:57,996
9:00 for two.
The best seafood place on the beach.

410
00:36:58,064 --> 00:37:03,118
Just have to have this drink with this
old army buddy of mine first, honey.

411
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:06,771
Imagine running into him
on the beach like that.

412
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,992
Is it so important?

413
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,214
Important? He only saved my life.
That's all.

414
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:19,935
He pulled me out of a burning barracks
in Louisiana in the middle of the night.

415
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:23,255
He pulled six of us out...
And the captain.

416
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:27,142
Got a citation.

417
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,244
What's his name?

418
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:31,647
His name?
Wilmer McCrady.

419
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:34,966
He's a big rednecked jerk when
it comes to having a conversation.

420
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:40,322
But he's a hell of a handy guy to have around
if you're gonna need somebody to save your life.

421
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,808
He's a big beer drinker.

422
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:48,297
I almost didn't even recognize him.
Must've put on about 30 pounds.

423
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:53,001
He's got a charter fishing boat
business here. Married.

424
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:57,990
- Three kids.
- Why, why can't the wives come?

425
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,510
What?
To an army reunion?

426
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:05,447
Honey, are you kidding?
Do you know what the language would get like?

427
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:09,068
This is a very rough guy.

428
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,803
He's always got a toothpick in his mouth.

429
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:20,045
Look, set your appetite dial
for a quarter to 9:00...

430
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:24,749
For that terrific Florida lobster...

431
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:29,305
And that yummy yum-yum pecan pie.

432
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,423
Okay?

433
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,842
Okay?

434
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:39,130
- You won't forget me?
- Oh, honey, come on. How can I forget you?

435
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,518
No, I didn't exaggerate.

436
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:01,736
Would you excuse me?

437
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:04,857
Bye, dad, I'll be back. Bye.

438
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:18,671
How'd you get away
from your cute little wife?

439
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:21,223
It's no problem.
I can handle that.

440
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,542
I know I wouldn't
let you get away with it.

441
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,964
You know, perhaps that's why I'm here.

442
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:33,052
Uh, scotch.

443
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:42,361
Here's the deal.
The marriage is off.

444
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,898
<i>It was just one of those dumb things
i rushed into,</i>

445
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:48,900
like joining the army, except...

446
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:52,921
this time I'm not gonna
wait around three years to get out.

447
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:56,592
I had my doubts in Virginia.

448
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,644
I was pretty sure in Georgia.

449
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:04,416
You have...
really settled things for me in Florida.

450
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,007
I've been waiting for a girl
like you all my life.

451
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,661
I just timed it wrong.

452
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:21,800
Here's the plan.
I'm definitely getting out.

453
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:27,388
I just have to figure a way
to let her down easy.

454
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:30,542
It kinda complicates things,

455
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,312
this being our honeymoon
and everything, you know?

456
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,852
What do you think about
what I've said so far?

457
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,855
I'm just listening.

458
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:47,292
Can't think if I'm listening.

459
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,030
You have a fantastic way
of putting things. It really kills me.

460
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:58,237
I need some time...

461
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:02,457
Because it's a little difficult.

462
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:07,478
I have to figure out a way to drop
the bombshell on the poor kid, you know?

463
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:11,333
- When are you gonna go back to Minnesota?
- Saturday.

464
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:16,221
- Saturday. The day after tomorrow?
- Uh-huh.

465
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:22,244
I really have my work cut out for me.
There's all the wedding presents.

466
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:25,747
You just make your own decision.
We're leaving on Saturday.

467
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:31,437
Don't underestimate me.
I'm in this all the way. What about you?

468
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:34,523
Um, I've got to get back to the table.

469
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:39,661
That look in your eye
is good enough for me.

470
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:43,698
Would you like to come over
and say hello?

471
00:41:43,766 --> 00:41:45,701
No, I can't. I gotta get back.

472
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,870
It's all right. I told daddy about you.

473
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:51,590
- You did? About my being married?
- Not about that yet.

474
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:55,427
- But he's seen me talking to you.
- Oh, yeah. What does he think?

475
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:59,497
He hasn't met you yet, but just
from appearances, he doesn't like you.

476
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:01,933
Appearances aren't everything.

477
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,937
<i>Kelly, how long are you gonna be?
They're waiting with the lobster bisque.</i>

478
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:08,574
I was just coming.
Daddy, this is Mr. Cantrow.

479
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:10,576
Cantrow. Hello, sir.
A real pleasure.

480
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:14,096
I'm sorry I detained your daughter.
I hope I didn't interrupt your dinner.

481
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:16,465
Come on, Kelly.
Your mother's a nervous wreck.

482
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,318
Daddy, is it all right if Mr. Cantrow
joins us for dinner? Please, daddy.

483
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:22,837
No, no, really, I can't. That's very generous.
Thank you very much.

484
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:25,824
Perhaps some other time
we can have dinner together.

485
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:28,544
Why not? You can drop
your bombs later, can't you?

486
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,764
- Kelly, he said no.
- He'll come if I ask him to.

487
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:35,817
No. I really have
a very pressing appointment.

488
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,253
Maybe just a fruit cocktail.

489
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:10,101
- Can you see all right, Kelly?
- Perfect, daddy.

490
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:12,337
Fine, sir.

491
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:40,799
Oh!

492
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,952
Oh, what a terrific show!

493
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,889
Oh, yes, he is very funny, isn't he?

494
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:52,961
You like the show, Kelly?

495
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:55,947
- Terrific, daddy.
- Most enjoyable, sir.

496
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:04,356
<i>- Oh, Emma.
- Yes, Charles?</i>

497
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,360
<i>Do you find me unattractively plain?</i>

498
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,095
<i>No, Charles.</i>

499
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:16,484
<i>I always thought you had a most noble
forehead, and a most attractive manner.</i>

500
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:20,538
We have a subscription
to the Minneapolis Symphony.

501
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:24,242
- Don't we, Duane?
- Is that right, sir?

502
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,328
We had Leonard Bernstein last year.

503
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:31,316
I must've seen Leonard Bernstein
maybe 200, 300 times.

504
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:37,088
Oh! Listen, if you're ever around Minneapolis,
be sure and go and see them.

505
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:39,357
You'd just love it. I know.

506
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:44,462
As a matter of fact, I may be heading in
that direction in the very near future.

507
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:47,316
- Oh, how nice!
- Well.

508
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,817
Isn't that nice, Duane?

509
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:55,173
What business did you say
you were in, young man?

510
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,175
Athletic equipment, sir.

511
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:00,912
What?

512
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,465
Athletic equipment. Sporting goods.

513
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:07,486
Oh, I see. You mean...

514
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:09,854
you sell balls and bats, huh?

515
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:12,357
That what you mean, balls and bats?

516
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:17,679
Last year in this country,
over $2 billion were spent on recreation.

517
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:21,750
Is that right? On balls and bats?

518
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:25,987
Duane, if we're gonna shove off
at 7:00 tomorrow morning,

519
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:29,074
...we better get in a little bed time.
- Yes, I guess we better.

520
00:45:29,141 --> 00:45:31,276
Waiter?

521
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:33,578
No, no.
This is on me.

522
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:36,114
No, no, let me get it.

523
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:39,301
Captain, can you find
our waiter for us, please?

524
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,387
Mr. Cantrow, I hope
we meet again very soon.

525
00:45:42,455 --> 00:45:45,240
- Cantrow, mother.
- I'm sorry.

526
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:48,493
And you'll be seeing him tomorrow.
He's going fishing with us.

527
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,479
Tomorrow?

528
00:45:50,546 --> 00:45:52,481
Isn't it all right, daddy?

529
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:58,103
It's his boat.

530
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,789
We can always use an extra hand.
We shove off at 7:00.

531
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:04,142
Thank you very much.

532
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,028
- I can't go tomorrow.
- Bel Harbor Yacht Club, 7:00.

533
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:10,131
How can I go tomorrow?
I can't go tomorrow.

534
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:16,471
Bombs away.

535
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:25,831
Lila? Lila? You up?

536
00:46:25,898 --> 00:46:27,965
- What do you want?
- Did you hear?

537
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:30,501
Did you hear?
Did you watch the news?

538
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:34,873
We were in a big accident!
Wilmer was driving me here about 8:30...

539
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:37,959
When a big oil truck
plowed right into us.

540
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:41,796
I'm all right. I just got shaken up a little.
I had my seat belt on.

541
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:47,001
But the truck is still burning
and Wilmer's caris a complete wreck.

542
00:46:47,086 --> 00:46:50,021
A complete wreck!

543
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:52,607
They checked me over at Miami general.

544
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:55,510
I'm all right. I don't want you to worry.
I'm perfectly all right.

545
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:58,897
I didn't hear anything about any accident.

546
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:04,185
That surprises me, 'cause there were
reporters all over the place.

547
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:07,889
The oil companies must've
paid them off to keep quiet.

548
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:10,392
My back is a little sore.

549
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,478
Wilmer may lose some teeth.
They're not sure yet.

550
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:15,714
The truck plowed right into us!

551
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:17,716
Incredible!

552
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:20,485
What wilmer does have
is a terrific lawsuit...

553
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:23,988
because there were
ten, fifteen witnesses.

554
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:26,724
I have to be in court tomorrow at 7:00.

555
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,746
7:00?
What courts open at 7:00?

556
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,531
Florida courts open at 7:00
'cause of the weather down here.

557
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,602
No use you coming because I'm gonna
be signing affidavits all day long.

558
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,637
My back is really sore.

559
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:43,458
I sat here all night.
You could've called me.

560
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:46,544
Honey, how could I call?
I was pinned behind--

561
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:50,449
I was pinned in a '68 Chevy.
It took them an hour to get us out.

562
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:52,534
How could I call you?

563
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:57,755
Were you really in an accident?

564
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:02,727
You think I'm making it up?

565
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,197
My God!

566
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:09,684
My God! You think I'm making it up?

567
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:12,454
I'll get the patrolman
who pulled me out of the car.

568
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:16,091
Talk to patrolman Greer,
the man that pulled me out of the car.

569
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:19,811
- I didn't mean it. My God!
- Lila, I'm lucky I'm alive!

570
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:24,115
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you were making it up.

571
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,436
- Good night, Lila.
- Good night, Lenny.

572
00:50:03,198 --> 00:50:06,451
Ah, thanks for waiting.

573
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:13,291
Nice to be aboard.
Nice to be aboard.

574
00:50:22,885 --> 00:50:27,255
- Happy?
- Happy?

575
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:31,209
It's only the best three days of my life.

576
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:34,779
I think we'll come back here
on our honeymoon.

577
00:50:34,847 --> 00:50:37,515
What makes you so sure
there's going to be a honeymoon?

578
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:40,201
I told you. Don't underestimate me.

579
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:43,988
Don't underestimate daddy.
He still doesn't like you.

580
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:49,677
- If he told you to drop me, what would you do?
- Drop you.

581
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,718
You always do what your father says?

582
00:50:57,786 --> 00:51:00,087
Always.

583
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:02,323
Kelly, what do you say?
Lunch.

584
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:05,376
- I'm coming, daddy.
- Be right there, sir.

585
00:51:07,713 --> 00:51:11,132
Okay, listen.
Tonight at your hotel, 7:00.

586
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:13,301
Your father and me over cocktails.

587
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:17,038
- I lay my cards on the table.
He finds out I mean business.
- Yeah?

588
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:20,391
- Yeah.
- Well, anyway, it's been a terrific three days.

589
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:25,230
Three days? Wait till you get a load
of the next 40 or 50 years.

590
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:32,787
<i>Be right there.
Hold the elevator.</i>

591
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:36,757
- Hi, hon.
- I want an explanation.

592
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:41,562
- What?
- I said to you that I want an explanation.

593
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,615
What kind of an explanation?

594
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:49,354
I'd like to know how you got
such a gorgeous tan...

595
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:53,290
If you've been in court
since 7:00 this morning.

596
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,728
Oh, honey, do you think
the law moves that quickly?

597
00:51:57,796 --> 00:51:59,897
I mean, in Florida?

598
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:02,583
There were three cases before us.

599
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:05,553
Then they had a recess.

600
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:09,123
And then I wasn't called
as a material witness until 2:30.

601
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:12,777
And all that time I was sitting on
the dumb hot courtroom steps.

602
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:15,996
It was a complete waste of a day.

603
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:25,990
Do you call this a honeymoon?

604
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:30,845
Do you know that I haven't seen you for
five minutes since we've been in Florida?

605
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:35,416
Oh, honey, it's not the amount of time
you spend with somebody.

606
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:37,652
It's how the time was spent.

607
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:42,490
And I feel that I'll...
Never forget these three days.

608
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,331
Where are you going now?

609
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:55,720
Honey-- honey, I've got
to visit Wilmer's family.

610
00:52:55,788 --> 00:52:59,307
Wilmer keeled over signing an affidavit.

611
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:02,326
The man has three broken ribs.

612
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:05,263
They rushed him to the hospital.

613
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:08,082
He's not gonna be doing much
charter fishing for a while,

614
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,653
so I thought I would go and lay a hundred
bucks on his wife and kids.

615
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:14,656
Wait, can't I go with you?

616
00:53:14,723 --> 00:53:17,375
Honey, shantytown!
The man lives in shantytown.

617
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:20,044
You can't walk through
shantytown this time of night.

618
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:24,715
- I wouldn't want to if I didn't have to, sweetheart.
- What about dinner?

619
00:53:24,783 --> 00:53:29,470
Dinner is 9:00. Florida lobster and
a terrific Florida pecan pie.

620
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:34,626
Something very big has come up and I think
tonight is a good time to discuss it.

621
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:36,611
Something good?

622
00:53:36,678 --> 00:53:40,581
Could be very great. It all depends
on how you want to look at it.

623
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:49,891
I certainly appreciate the way you
and Mrs. Corcoran have treated me.

624
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:54,946
I mean, after all, I'm a veritable stranger,
veritably unknown.

625
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:58,532
And you and Mrs. Corcoran
have generously treated me as though...

626
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,685
I were practically a member
of the immediate family.

627
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:05,890
Kelly said something about
your laying your cards on the table.

628
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:11,479
- Were those your cards?
- No, no, I'm just kinda shuffling.

629
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:15,016
This is actually my deal now.

630
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:21,239
Well, in just plain, old-fashioned,
corny lingo, sir,

631
00:54:21,306 --> 00:54:26,727
uh, I have fallen head over heels
with your Kelly here.

632
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:30,565
It didn't take me long
to make up my mind.

633
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:35,820
One good look did it,
actually, if you want to know the truth.

634
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:39,891
I'm the kind of crazy hairpin that
doesn't need much more than that.

635
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:43,878
And then, that's it for life with me.

636
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:48,415
Now, there is a slight complication.

637
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:51,169
I happen to be a newlywed.

638
00:54:51,237 --> 00:54:53,371
Um,

639
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:58,042
I made the big mistake
about five days ago in New York.

640
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,513
When I say big, sir, I mean
radio-city-music-hall big.

641
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:07,201
You may have seen her around the pool.
She's a nice girl.

642
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:12,623
But just not, not really my type.

643
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:17,695
I married her because I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

644
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:24,385
I've learned that decency
doesn't always pay off.

645
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:29,356
So I'm going to get out.

646
00:55:29,424 --> 00:55:31,525
It'll be difficult, but not impossible.

647
00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:35,696
Not when you're as determined as I am.

648
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:40,000
Sitting opposite you,
Mr. Corcoran, is probably...

649
00:55:40,035 --> 00:55:44,371
the most determined young man
that you have ever seen.

650
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:52,846
Now, I know that you are going back
to Minneapolis tomorrow.

651
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:58,702
And it's my plan, just as soon as
I work out this messy business,

652
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,005
to follow you out to Minnesota,

653
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:03,491
to get myself set up there,

654
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:07,728
and to lay claim
to your lovely daughter.

655
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:12,700
Those are my cards, and, uh,

656
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:17,488
Mr. Corcoran, there's not
a joker in the bunch.

657
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:22,877
Now, having spoken my piece,

658
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:27,748
I would like to know, in all candor,

659
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:31,335
how you feel about what I've said...

660
00:56:31,403 --> 00:56:34,622
and to ask if I have your approval.

661
00:56:36,758 --> 00:56:41,979
Not if they tied me to a horse
and pulled me 40 miles by my tongue.

662
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:46,317
Well, that's an honest answer, sir.

663
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:50,821
Not if they hung me from a tree
and put a lit bomb in my mouth.

664
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:52,856
I respect your frankness.

665
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:56,494
I think we understand
how we stand now.

666
00:56:56,561 --> 00:57:00,614
It's not a question
of my not approving of you.

667
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:03,700
It's a question of...

668
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:07,221
I don't like one goddamn thing about you.

669
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:10,824
Ah. Well, initial judgments
very often are misleading.

670
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:14,345
I found that out to my sorrow, sir.

671
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:16,697
You come hanging around
my daughter on your honeymoon?

672
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:18,982
Duane.

673
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,085
Hang around your wife!

674
00:57:21,086 --> 00:57:23,120
- Don't hang around my daughter!
- Duane, you're shouting, dear.

675
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:28,008
- Five days, he's married! For God-- five days!
- Darling, please.

676
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:30,111
Where's respect for
the institution of marriage?

677
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:34,549
Once I get rid of my mistake, I'm willing
to show you all the respect you would like.

678
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:38,669
Get him out before I take him into the men's
room and break all the respect in his body.

679
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:41,188
You've made your point, darling.

680
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:45,293
If I may, sir, in other words what
you're saying is that...

681
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,712
if I want Kelly, I'm gonna have
to put up a hell of a fight then.

682
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,715
Is that, uh--

683
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,502
he's a nut.

684
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:58,122
He's some kind of a goddamn--
get him out of here. Please--

685
00:57:58,189 --> 00:58:00,291
Just don't get upset, dear.

686
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:03,176
Maybe this isn't the proper
time to discuss this.

687
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:07,047
Mrs. Corcoran, I hope that you will be
able to see my position in this thing.

688
00:58:07,115 --> 00:58:11,201
And Kelly perhaps--
look for me because I'm coming.

689
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:15,172
You stay away from her.
I don't hand out my daughter to newlyweds!

690
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,058
Why didn't you go to Niagara falls
like everybody else?

691
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:22,296
Thank you for everything, sir. And look
for me, Kelly, because I'm coming. I'm coming.

692
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:27,818
You stay the hell out of Minnesota,
you goddamn newlywed!

693
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,112
What is this?
Am I talking to myself?

694
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,198
You've eaten four shells.

695
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,946
Is it terrific? Did I exaggerate?
Was it worth waiting for?

696
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:58,416
It's fantastic.

697
00:58:58,483 --> 00:59:03,404
Now... save some room
for that great pecan pie. Right?

698
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,406
Yummy yum pecan pie?

699
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,391
Pardon me, sir.

700
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:12,112
Lenny, are you gonna tell me the thing
you want to discuss?

701
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,868
- May I?
- Yeah.

702
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:23,323
Thank you.

703
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:26,777
This place must really be expensive.

704
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:30,380
Can we afford this?

705
00:59:30,448 --> 00:59:34,469
Yeah.

706
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:37,588
Don't worry about the money.
Listen, Lila--

707
00:59:39,324 --> 00:59:42,576
money is the last thing that you
should be worrying about tonight.

708
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:46,397
Really. Just enjoy yourself,
enjoy your dinner.

709
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:49,900
I am!
I really am!

710
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:57,525
What is it, Lenny?
What did you want to tell me?

711
00:59:57,592 --> 00:59:59,627
Hmm?

712
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:05,383
Pardon me, sir. I'm afraid we're
a little late with the pecan pie.

713
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,951
Chef tells me we ran out
about ten minutes ago.

714
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:10,971
- Would you like to order something else?
- Wait a minute.

715
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:16,394
What, are you joking? No pecan pie?

716
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:18,596
- Sorry, sir.
- No pecan pie!

717
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:20,797
Lenny, what are you doing?

718
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:23,918
The main reason we came here
was for the pecan pie.

719
01:00:23,985 --> 01:00:26,086
That's all right.

720
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:28,188
No, it's not. They should've said
that to us at the door.

721
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:32,226
They should've warned us that there was
a danger of running out of pecan pie.

722
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:34,829
Well, there is one small piece left
in the kitchen.

723
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:37,781
Would you want that one piece?

724
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:40,651
We also have some
excellent blueberry pie.

725
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,122
I mean, we drove
all the way from New York.

726
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,608
Listen. Take it. Take the pecan pie.
We can share it.

727
01:00:48,676 --> 01:00:51,996
I don't wanna share it!
I promised my wife the pecan pie.

728
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:55,316
I want you to--
bring the pecan pie for my wife.

729
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,734
I promised--
just bring me some coffee.

730
01:00:57,802 --> 01:00:59,903
No blueberry pie?

731
01:01:02,374 --> 01:01:05,225
What do I want any blueberry pie for?

732
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:07,895
- Yes, sir.
- It's not a reject, is it?

733
01:01:07,963 --> 01:01:11,932
- It's a perfectly good piece of pie, right?
- Yes, sir.

734
01:01:14,736 --> 01:01:16,737
That really bugs me.

735
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:19,690
I've been talking about that pie
as far back as Virginia.

736
01:01:19,758 --> 01:01:21,959
If I'd have given him ten bucks,

737
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,161
you'd have had pecan pie
flying outta your ears by now.

738
01:01:24,229 --> 01:01:26,664
- They got it back there.
- It's all right.

739
01:01:29,617 --> 01:01:31,985
Honey, I'm getting the pie,

740
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,988
and I'm very happy.

741
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,274
Lenny?

742
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:42,530
Tonight's been the best night
of our whole trip.

743
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:44,615
Hasn't it?

744
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,100
Aren't you happy tonight?

745
01:01:50,822 --> 01:01:55,543
See, that's part of what
I wanted to talk about.

746
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,778
Um--

747
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:02,849
geez, it's warm in here.

748
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:06,387
You pay these kind of prices,
the air-conditioning is faulty in here.

749
01:02:06,454 --> 01:02:09,873
- It's just--
- I think it's probably your sunburn.

750
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:14,945
Go on, Lenny.
What were you gonna say?

751
01:02:15,013 --> 01:02:18,783
No, I was just gonna say that, uh--

752
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,036
um... that, uh--

753
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:26,940
when I was sitting out on the hot
courtroom steps this afternoon,

754
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:30,310
uh, I was thinking
that in three weeks...

755
01:02:30,378 --> 01:02:33,563
You're gonna be 22 years old.

756
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:35,549
- The 12th.
- Right.

757
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:38,669
And the really fantastic thing
about being 22 years old...

758
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:41,321
is that you have
your whole life in front of you.

759
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,991
I know.
We both have.

760
01:02:44,058 --> 01:02:47,177
I-- I mean, the people you could meet,

761
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:50,197
the places you could go,
the things that you could do.

762
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:53,684
- It's just--
- Lenny, I never thought that I'd get to Florida.

763
01:02:53,752 --> 01:02:57,788
That's right. I mean, what some women
would not give to be 22 years old.

764
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:01,308
- It's just a--
- That's right. I know it.

765
01:03:01,376 --> 01:03:04,261
To go when you want,
to do-- to live.

766
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:06,864
To live!
Do you know what I mean?

767
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:12,186
To live. Is that what you mean, Lenny?

768
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,608
We only pass through once, right?

769
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:20,627
I mean, we can't squander it,
no matter what happens.

770
01:03:20,662 --> 01:03:24,798
We're just passing this way but one time.
We can't squander it.

771
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:27,535
Once is a lot.

772
01:03:27,602 --> 01:03:29,704
Once is a whole lifetime.

773
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:32,957
That's why we have to use...

774
01:03:33,024 --> 01:03:35,309
And learn from anything that happens.

775
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,478
We have to...

776
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:41,698
learn from the good, from the bad,
from the happiness, from the tragic.

777
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:45,803
We have to learn.
We have to use it all. To use it all.

778
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:50,373
You're so deep, Lenny.

779
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:53,460
I never knew that you were so deep.

780
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:10,010
Do you sense at all
what I'm trying to say?

781
01:04:10,077 --> 01:04:12,179
Do you, uh--

782
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:17,934
oh, Christ, it's so hot in here.
Is it hot in here, or is it hot in here?

783
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:25,292
What? I--
I don't underst--

784
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,627
What are you trying to tell me?

785
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:30,197
Let me--

786
01:04:30,265 --> 01:04:32,333
I'm trying to say...

787
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,855
We have to prepare ourselves.

788
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:42,543
We have to prepare ourselves
for anything, you know?

789
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:46,129
I mean, everything could be terrific.

790
01:04:46,197 --> 01:04:48,866
The world could be singing.

791
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:51,284
And then suddenly--

792
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:54,254
suddenly, for no reason at all,

793
01:04:54,322 --> 01:04:56,490
it's over.

794
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:01,612
It's over, Lila.

795
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:10,120
Oh, my God.

796
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,574
Oh, my God, Lenny.

797
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:17,978
I think I know what
you're trying to tell me.

798
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:21,398
I didn't want it to happen.
I didn't plan it.

799
01:05:21,465 --> 01:05:24,451
You're good. You're good.
You deserve better than me.

800
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:27,604
You deserve much better than me.
I didn't want it to happen.

801
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:31,608
- I didn't plan anything like this.
- Oh, Lenny.

802
01:05:31,676 --> 01:05:34,962
Oh, Lenny! Oh, my God, Lenny!

803
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,548
Oh, Lenny, you're dying.

804
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:42,035
Oh, Lenny, oh, God,
why didn't you never tell me?

805
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:44,204
Oh, Lenny!

806
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:47,941
I'm not dying!
Who said anything about dying?

807
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:50,277
I want out of the marriage!

808
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:54,330
I want out
of the goddamn marriage.

809
01:06:07,244 --> 01:06:10,831
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Listen to me. We're not right for each other.

810
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:13,684
We're not right for each other.
It didn't work out.

811
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:16,770
I tried to tell you as far back as Virginia,
but you couldn't see it.

812
01:06:16,837 --> 01:06:19,723
You were too busy yelling
"pee-pee" every two minutes.

813
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:22,392
- Lenny, let me get to the bathroom, please.
- No, no.

814
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,129
- I have to throw up now.
- Listen, listen. Listen to me. Please listen to me.

815
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:28,799
- Oh, God.
- Isn't it better it happens now...

816
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:31,985
Than in ten years from now when we got
three or four kids running around?

817
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,372
Please pay attention! I don't want
to have to say this a second time.

818
01:06:35,439 --> 01:06:38,225
- Lenny, I'm gonna do it on the table.
- Here. Drink some water.

819
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:42,045
Please. I think people
are starting to look at us.

820
01:06:42,113 --> 01:06:45,983
- Oh, God, Lenny, please. Help me, Lenny.
- Okay. Okay. Here.

821
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:49,636
I don't want to do it on the table.

822
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:51,872
Just drink the water.

823
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,309
Okay, take it easy. Just take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay?

824
01:06:56,377 --> 01:07:00,013
Give me a quarter for the ladies' room, please.
Would you please help me--

825
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:03,667
I'm gonna give you more than a quarter.
I'm gonna make a tremendous settlement.

826
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:06,686
Give me a quarter for
the ladies' room, please.

827
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:09,840
I'm gonna make a terrific settlement,
a generous settlement.

828
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:12,175
I'm gonna give you everything.

829
01:07:12,243 --> 01:07:17,531
I'm gonna give you the car.
I'm gonna give you all the luggage.

830
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,233
I'm gonna give you
all the wedding presents.

831
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,870
For a marriage that's not a week old,
that's pretty good.

832
01:07:23,938 --> 01:07:26,340
Some people don't get that
after 40 years.

833
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:29,192
I kept the car in tip-top shape.
That's terrific.

834
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:35,348
What is that sound?
What are these sounds? Come on.

835
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,768
Honey.

836
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:40,103
Oh, oh.

837
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:43,290
Honey. Lila, come on.
It's not the end of the world!

838
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:46,844
It's just a crummy annulment.
Come on!

839
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:48,846
- Come on.
- Pecan pie.

840
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:51,347
- No, no. Okay. Thank you.
- Is it all right?

841
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:54,034
- Would you like some whipped cream?
- No! It's okay.

842
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:56,737
- Shall I leave the whip--
- Leave it! Fine, fine.

843
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:59,456
Listen, honey.
It's good. It's good.

844
01:07:59,524 --> 01:08:02,742
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Take it easy.

845
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:06,463
<i>Take it easy.
Okay. Okay.</i>

846
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,899
Okay. Listen now.

847
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:11,818
I would like, if possible--

848
01:08:11,886 --> 01:08:16,156
if possible, if we could
settle this tonight, you know,

849
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:20,661
because, you know, check-out time
is 11:00 tomorrow morning.

850
01:08:20,728 --> 01:08:24,664
Unless you want to stay on
for a couple of days and then--

851
01:08:24,732 --> 01:08:26,666
I'll work that into the settlement.

852
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,835
I mean, it's--

853
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:32,889
you know what? I feel that we're over
the worst of it now.

854
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:36,927
I-- I-- I actually--

855
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:41,615
I feel closer to you right now...

856
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:45,101
Than I think we've ever
felt before, you know?

857
01:08:45,169 --> 01:08:47,537
Sometimes...

858
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:50,723
when two people experience
a common tragedy,

859
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,710
it creates a bond between people
that can last a life--

860
01:08:53,778 --> 01:08:58,314
You know what I would like? I would like
that we should have dinner sometime.

861
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:01,051
You know?
And I think that then...

862
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,937
we could look back on all of this...

863
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:08,175
and we could see all the good
that's come out of this.

864
01:09:08,242 --> 01:09:10,410
That's the way--

865
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:13,930
That's-- that's the way
I would like this to end.

866
01:09:13,998 --> 01:09:18,518
Wouldn't you? Don't you think
that's a good way, to, uh, to look--

867
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:33,117
Better?

868
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:36,236
It's better?
You feel a little bit better?

869
01:09:36,304 --> 01:09:38,939
You feel a little--
you okay?

870
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:42,876
- You okay?
- Yeah.

871
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:47,414
Hi.

872
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:52,052
Gonna eat the pie?
You want a little piece of pie?

873
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:55,205
- No?
- No. No.

874
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:57,857
Okay. Okay.

875
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:27,437
<i># Just like me #</i>

876
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:30,923
<i># they long to be #</i>

877
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,578
<i># close to you #</i>

878
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:40,684
Sign here.
Just initial it.

879
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:43,703
That's right. Okay.
Now over here.

880
01:10:44,922 --> 01:10:46,857
That's fine.

881
01:10:46,924 --> 01:10:49,293
And here again.
Right.

882
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:56,883
We appreciate this, Ralph. My mother and I
want you to know we really appreciate this.

883
01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:00,820
- I have office hours during the day, you know.
- Speed is our best weapon.

884
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:03,557
In quick, out quick.
That's what they taught us in the army.

885
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:06,576
An annulment is gonna take
from three to six months.

886
01:11:06,644 --> 01:11:09,695
If you want a divorce quick,
she'll have to go to Santo Domingo.

887
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:11,931
Santo Domingo?

888
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:17,420
She didn't have much of
a vacation in Florida, anyway.

889
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:20,774
I wish you'd have let me discuss settlement.
I could've saved you money.

890
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:24,094
It's settled. It's settled.
I gave her everything.

891
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:27,347
All I kept was my savings bonds, $900.

892
01:11:27,415 --> 01:11:30,867
- I could've done better for you.
- No. I want it this way.

893
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:35,788
I'm not looking to come out a winner.
I'm willing to pay for my mistake.

894
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:38,942
Of course, if she's willing to discuss it,
I'll leave that up to you.

895
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,161
The final papers will come
through in about three weeks.

896
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:43,312
The sooner, the better.

897
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,799
I'm heading for the midwest.

898
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,218
- I'll send you my address.
- What's in the midwest?

899
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:52,623
A terrific girl I met on my honeymoon.

900
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:55,808
Don't worry. I'll send you an invitation.

901
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:46,075
Hi, Mr. Corc.

902
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:48,594
Len Cantrow from Florida?

903
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:51,397
I'm here.

904
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:54,418
I don't expect you to let me see your
daughter right off, sir,

905
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:57,086
but I just wanted to stop by
and let you know...

906
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:59,740
that it wasn't some wild story
I made up in Florida.

907
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:03,326
I have gotten myself free.

908
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,513
Well, I've gotta run now
because I'm getting myself set up.

909
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:09,415
Please say hello
to Mrs. Corcoran for me.

910
01:13:09,483 --> 01:13:13,620
Would you please tell Kelly that I've gotten
myself a room at the Knoll Way Motel?

911
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:16,355
Knoll Way Motel.

912
01:13:16,423 --> 01:13:19,376
Good afternoon, sir,
and I hope I see you again very soon.

913
01:13:22,396 --> 01:13:24,431
Cantrow.

914
01:13:24,498 --> 01:13:26,500
Sir?

915
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:31,671
You show your face here again,

916
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:36,109
I'm gonna kick your ass
right over the Canadian border.

917
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,975
<i>And now for the weather.</i>

918
01:14:26,043 --> 01:14:29,028
<i>The 11:00 P.M. twin cities temperature
is 13 degrees below zero,</i>

919
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,030
<i>barometer rising.</i>

920
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:34,284
<i>A new warm front moving down from Canada
will bring tomorrow's temperature...</i>

921
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:38,171
<i>Up to a new high ranging
between zero and five above.</i>

922
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,823
<i>Temperatures slightly lower
in the suburbs.</i>

923
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:42,942
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Bill Williamson,</i>

924
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,395
<i>your Minneapolis-St. Paul
weatherman.</i>

925
01:14:45,462 --> 01:14:48,914
<i>There's good news in the twin cities
weather forecast for tonight.</i>

926
01:14:48,982 --> 01:14:53,252
<i>But first, the current temperature in Minneapolis
is three degrees below zero.</i>

927
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,324
<i>It's two degrees below in St. Paul
and four below at the airport.</i>

928
01:14:57,391 --> 01:15:00,460
<i>The barometer is
30.02 and rising.</i>

929
01:15:00,528 --> 01:15:03,580
<i>Winds are from the northwest
at four Miles per hour.</i>

930
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:08,368
<i>Temperatures will fall to between 18
and 21 degrees below zero tonight.</i>

931
01:15:32,893 --> 01:15:35,128
Kelly!

932
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:43,336
- I'm here. I made it.
- I heard. You must be crazy or something.

933
01:15:43,403 --> 01:15:46,156
- I'm out. I'm free and clear, just like I said.
- Hi, Kelly.

934
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:50,560
Hi. You must've been crazy,
just ringing my bell like that.

935
01:15:51,913 --> 01:15:54,614
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

936
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:58,051
- I can't talk to you. I've got political science.
- Wait a second.

937
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:01,537
We've got serious things to discuss.

938
01:16:01,605 --> 01:16:04,040
Look. I'm very flattered you came, really,

939
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,726
...but the situation's impossible.
- Kelly.

940
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:09,161
- Just a minute.
- Hello, Kelly.

941
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:11,898
- Hi. I've gotta go.
- Wait a minute.

942
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:15,051
You worried about your father?
I'm gonna handle that.

943
01:16:15,118 --> 01:16:19,055
My father says that if you're not gone by tonight,
he's gonna get you with his car.

944
01:16:19,123 --> 01:16:21,291
- I have to go.
- Listen. Kelly, listen.

945
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,077
Hey, I'm real surprised.

946
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:27,730
I'm surprised by your reaction.
I mean, I'm really very surprised.

947
01:16:27,798 --> 01:16:30,299
You picked a bad time to come.

948
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:33,386
Bad time?

949
01:16:33,453 --> 01:16:37,590
Do you remember Florida? I mean,
does Florida seem vaguely familiar to you?

950
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,409
Certainly I remember Florida.
I'll never forget it.

951
01:16:40,477 --> 01:16:44,464
But this is Minnesota, and I've got
Political Science, and I've gotta go.

952
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,501
I'm really very flattered.

953
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:56,359
- A guy I met in Miami.
- What'd he want?

954
01:17:19,483 --> 01:17:22,802
Kelly? Kelly, I gotta talk to you.

955
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:26,456
- I'm sorry. I've got English lit.
- That's all right.

956
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:30,227
Listen. I just need two minutes
to talk to you in private.

957
01:17:30,294 --> 01:17:33,980
- Didn't you hear what she said the first time?
- Certainly I heard what she said.

958
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:37,867
I'm only standing a foot away.
How could I possibly miss it?

959
01:17:37,934 --> 01:17:40,136
- I just need to talk to you for two minutes.
- Hey!

960
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:43,156
It's okay.
I'll see you in class.

961
01:17:50,881 --> 01:17:53,966
I mean, what did you
think it was, a game?

962
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:56,919
This is no game.

963
01:17:56,987 --> 01:17:59,589
This is my life.

964
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:03,226
I don't play games with my life.

965
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:05,228
You really got a divorce?

966
01:18:05,296 --> 01:18:10,517
You think I was just really fooling around
with you in Florida?

967
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:13,086
Didn't I tell you
I was gonna get a divorce?

968
01:18:13,154 --> 01:18:15,788
I don't play games with my life.

969
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:18,057
Gee, I'm really flattered.

970
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:30,570
I'll tell you the truth. I was under
the impression that our relationship--

971
01:18:35,142 --> 01:18:39,346
was at a much more advanced stage...

972
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:42,031
than the point where you're
really very flattered.

973
01:18:42,099 --> 01:18:45,318
I just gave up a whole goddamn marriage.

974
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:53,209
You caught me off guard.
It's my first day back at school.

975
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:57,096
- I've got English lit.
- Oh, you know, screw English lit!

976
01:18:57,181 --> 01:19:00,115
I just gave half my life away!

977
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:06,356
I mean--

978
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,960
you don't even say hello to me!

979
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:14,847
Where's your goddamn laugh?
I haven't heard your goddamn laugh...

980
01:19:14,915 --> 01:19:17,701
one time since I've been here.

981
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:20,486
I can't help it.
Florida seems like such a long time ago.

982
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:23,523
It's two weeks ago. What, you can't retain
a memory for two weeks?

983
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:25,908
I gave up $6,000.

984
01:19:25,976 --> 01:19:28,077
I gave up my wife.

985
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:31,697
I gave up my car.
And you can't retain a memory for two--

986
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:33,933
What, are you-- are you re--

987
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:40,372
What was all the-- what was all the
"you're sitting on my stool"?

988
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,541
"That's my spot."

989
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:46,612
What is all that crap?
Really, that's just a bunch of crap!

990
01:19:48,331 --> 01:19:50,433
And I'm a schmuck!

991
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:55,755
- I was very attracted to you.
- Were you?

992
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:59,759
<i>You were very attracted to me.
You were very-- well, that's cute.</i>

993
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:02,028
That's a cute thing.

994
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:04,664
So I was, uh...

995
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:06,932
Something to do.

996
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:13,039
No, I can understand that.
I can under--

997
01:20:13,107 --> 01:20:15,074
Listen. What is it--

998
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:18,461
I had a crummy divorce.
What is it to me, right?

999
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:20,830
I also got a suntan.

1000
01:20:20,898 --> 01:20:23,816
You really have to look at it that way.
That's the way life is--

1001
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:25,985
good and bad, you know.

1002
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,454
The important thing is
that you get to English lit.

1003
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:32,791
<i>That's really the important
thing that we do here.</i>

1004
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:35,578
- Hey.
- What?

1005
01:20:35,646 --> 01:20:39,198
Don't get so morbid.
Give a girl a chance.

1006
01:21:12,132 --> 01:21:15,251
Is this how they kiss in Minnesota?

1007
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:20,023
I'm getting a house this afternoon.

1008
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,026
First, you have to take me
back to English lit.

1009
01:21:24,094 --> 01:21:28,180
What time is your last class?
Pick you up after your last class.

1010
01:21:28,248 --> 01:21:31,951
Well, it's at 2:30, but...

1011
01:21:32,019 --> 01:21:35,604
I was supposed to meet someone.

1012
01:21:35,672 --> 01:21:38,591
What, the guy with the big neck?

1013
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:42,045
That guy's got a 40-inch neck.
You know, he's finished.

1014
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:45,131
That guy is through.
That's over, really.

1015
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,233
The money is here.

1016
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:51,136
But I wouldn't start in with him.
He's captain of everything.

1017
01:21:52,956 --> 01:21:57,960
I spent three years in the armed forces.
That guy is through.

1018
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:16,829
Kelly!

1019
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:20,182
Kelly--

1020
01:22:24,321 --> 01:22:26,656
I'm getting sick and tired
of you bugging Kelly.

1021
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:29,942
Yes, I understand.
I'd like to introduce myself.

1022
01:22:29,977 --> 01:22:33,696
My name is Leonard Cantrow. I'm with
the Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics.

1023
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:37,700
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
May I see that cigarette?

1024
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:52,849
May I see the pack that came out of?

1025
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:56,168
You wanna just step back there a minute, please.
You a student here?

1026
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:58,638
- Yeah.
- What year are you in?

1027
01:22:58,722 --> 01:23:02,141
- Sophomore.
- What's your name, please?

1028
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:04,643
You don't need my name.

1029
01:23:04,678 --> 01:23:07,346
Son, I don't want any trouble here.
I just asked you your name.

1030
01:23:07,431 --> 01:23:10,332
- No.
- What is your name?

1031
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,352
What is your name?

1032
01:23:18,525 --> 01:23:20,860
Apparently that fellow has
something to be frightened of.

1033
01:23:20,944 --> 01:23:24,429
- Do you fellows have anything to be frightened of?
- I don't.

1034
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:28,667
- How long have you known Miss Corcoran, please?
- About two years.

1035
01:23:28,735 --> 01:23:31,203
To the best of your knowledge,
does she use drugs of any kind?

1036
01:23:31,238 --> 01:23:33,873
No.

1037
01:23:33,957 --> 01:23:37,609
- Do you boys have any reason to run?
- No.

1038
01:23:37,677 --> 01:23:41,914
Then why don't you just walk, then?
Just walk on.

1039
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:45,067
You tell your friend I'm coming back tomorrow.
Thank you, fellas.

1040
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:48,187
Just keep your nose clean.
Kelly.

1041
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:50,522
Keep moving, please.

1042
01:23:58,081 --> 01:24:01,801
<i>- Where? At my place?
- No, not a motel.</i>

1043
01:24:01,869 --> 01:24:06,171
<i>Where? You want to suggest a place?
Wherever you wanna suggest.</i>

1044
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,525
We have a summer cabin in the mountains.

1045
01:24:09,592 --> 01:24:12,211
It's not heated,
but we could have a big fire.

1046
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,747
- All right?
- A cabin.

1047
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:18,417
A cabin.

1048
01:24:18,485 --> 01:24:25,458
That's great.

1049
01:24:22,923 --> 01:24:25,458
All my life...

1050
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:29,795
I've dreamt of a cabin and a fire,

1051
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:31,881
an incredible girl.

1052
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:35,985
Have you got the nerve to try something
very dangerous?

1053
01:24:37,554 --> 01:24:41,674
What do you think?
I mean, what do you think?

1054
01:24:41,741 --> 01:24:44,743
We'll have to take off all our clothes.

1055
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:46,879
Okay?

1056
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:50,967
What a terrific idea.
Whatever it is, I love it!

1057
01:24:53,169 --> 01:24:57,090
- Remember, I'm not gonna sleep with you.
- That's all right.

1058
01:24:57,174 --> 01:25:01,093
Even if we just did this,
it would be terrific.

1059
01:25:02,762 --> 01:25:05,914
I've never done this before.
A girlfriend told me about it.

1060
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:09,669
I love her. Whoever she is, I love her.

1061
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:12,070
- I'm way ahead of you. Let me help.
- No, no.

1062
01:25:12,138 --> 01:25:14,590
That's the whole point-- no touching.

1063
01:25:14,658 --> 01:25:17,593
We take off everything and get as close
as we can without touching.

1064
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,680
- It's a lot harder than it sounds.
- I love it!

1065
01:25:20,747 --> 01:25:22,682
I love it!

1066
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,269
All my life I've wanted to be
in a place like this...

1067
01:25:26,336 --> 01:25:29,488
with a girl like you
playing a game like this.

1068
01:25:29,556 --> 01:25:32,741
- Hurry up. Let's play.
- I don't know if I can go through with it.

1069
01:25:32,809 --> 01:25:36,512
Oh, yes, you can. Sure.
I mean, it's just a game.

1070
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,382
The worst thing that
could happen is you'd lose.

1071
01:25:40,851 --> 01:25:43,969
All right.
Step back a few feet.

1072
01:25:47,924 --> 01:25:50,843
One more foot.

1073
01:25:52,262 --> 01:25:56,199
Why don't we begin?
Should we just start?

1074
01:25:56,266 --> 01:25:59,318
All right.
I'll go first.

1075
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,107
Thank you, God.

1076
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:25,928
I'm just seeing your masterpiece,
and I thank you for it.

1077
01:26:25,996 --> 01:26:28,397
Okay, now you.

1078
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:33,201
Now what do we do?

1079
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:36,689
We just walk towards each other
and see how close we can get,

1080
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:38,857
but we mustn't touch.

1081
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,046
I think we're close enough.

1082
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:06,885
No. Uh...

1083
01:27:08,438 --> 01:27:11,690
I think we could get a little closer.

1084
01:27:11,758 --> 01:27:13,693
You do?

1085
01:27:16,847 --> 01:27:19,382
I do. I honestly do.

1086
01:27:36,366 --> 01:27:39,852
I think my father misjudged you, Lenny.

1087
01:27:41,955 --> 01:27:43,922
I really do.

1088
01:27:45,308 --> 01:27:50,663
You're the most decent,
honorable man I have ever met.

1089
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:53,515
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Kelly.

1090
01:27:57,587 --> 01:28:00,690
- I'll sleep with you tomorrow night.
- Oh?

1091
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:06,696
Oh, I'll be back about 11:00.

1092
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:10,383
I have to borrow some books for class.

1093
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,601
Don't wait up.

1094
01:28:25,348 --> 01:28:28,183
I knew it could be like this.

1095
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:31,136
Never was like this.

1096
01:28:31,171 --> 01:28:33,539
I knew it was possible.

1097
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:39,061
Don't let me fall asleep.
I have to be back by 11:00.

1098
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:43,032
I knew I wasn't crazy.

1099
01:28:44,968 --> 01:28:48,888
A lot of people might've
thought I was crazy.

1100
01:28:48,955 --> 01:28:53,976
I knew-- I knew it.
I think I'm gonna surprise a lot of people.

1101
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:58,247
I know one who's gonna be surprised.

1102
01:28:58,314 --> 01:29:00,482
Don't worry about your father.

1103
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:03,252
Your father and I are gonna
understand each other.

1104
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:07,423
It's just a question of us
sitting down together.

1105
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:10,609
I love listening to you.

1106
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:13,312
You're so positive about everything.

1107
01:29:14,814 --> 01:29:17,082
Daddy's the same way.

1108
01:29:19,819 --> 01:29:22,704
- You like that, huh?
- I love that.

1109
01:29:22,772 --> 01:29:25,391
I don't want him in this house.

1110
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:29,645
I don't want him in this town.
This is my house.

1111
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:34,483
I pay taxes in this town. I don't want him
in my town. I don't want him in my house.

1112
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:39,071
- Well, why not, Duane?
- Because I hate him, that's why not.

1113
01:29:39,138 --> 01:29:44,043
But, despite that,
Kelly says he's an admirable young man.

1114
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:49,165
Well, can't you at least see him?

1115
01:30:00,893 --> 01:30:02,994
For me, daddy?

1116
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:07,833
Please do it... for me.

1117
01:30:18,778 --> 01:30:23,282
I understand you're quite taken with this part
of the country, Mr. Cantrow.

1118
01:30:23,366 --> 01:30:25,284
<i>Leonard. Yes, ma'am.</i>

1119
01:30:25,352 --> 01:30:28,503
I like what I see out here, and...

1120
01:30:28,571 --> 01:30:31,690
I like what I breathe out here.

1121
01:30:31,758 --> 01:30:36,194
I've just about made up my mind
that I'm gonna make this my home.

1122
01:30:36,262 --> 01:30:38,196
Oh!

1123
01:30:38,264 --> 01:30:41,100
Well, from what I've seen,

1124
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:44,152
I'd say you're
a very determined young man.

1125
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:48,490
I take that as a compliment, Mrs. Corcoran.

1126
01:30:53,713 --> 01:30:56,081
<i>Thank you.</i>

1127
01:30:56,149 --> 01:31:00,418
I don't mind saying this is one of the finest
meals that I've ever had.

1128
01:31:00,486 --> 01:31:03,339
Oh, thank you, Leonard.

1129
01:31:03,407 --> 01:31:05,374
It's simple, you know.

1130
01:31:05,442 --> 01:31:09,411
Mr. Corcoran doesn't
really care for fancy food,

1131
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:14,083
though I imagine you've tried just about
every kind of exotic dish in New York.

1132
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:16,685
Exactly. See, that's the trouble.

1133
01:31:16,753 --> 01:31:19,204
It's exotic, but it's not honest.

1134
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:21,941
I mean, it's fancy, but it's not real.

1135
01:31:22,008 --> 01:31:25,461
I mean, this is honest food.

1136
01:31:25,528 --> 01:31:28,480
There's no lying in that beef.

1137
01:31:28,548 --> 01:31:32,317
There's no, uh...
Insincerity in those potatoes.

1138
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:36,405
There's no deceit in the cauliflower.

1139
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:38,823
This is a totally honest meal.

1140
01:31:38,891 --> 01:31:42,144
You don't know what a pleasure it is
to sit down...

1141
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:46,314
in this day and age and eat food
that you can believe in.

1142
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:51,770
Oh! Well...
what an original way of putting it.

1143
01:31:51,837 --> 01:31:54,924
Leonard's so positive, isn't he, mother?

1144
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:59,594
Who does he remind you of
when he's so positive like that?

1145
01:31:59,662 --> 01:32:02,848
- Who, dear?
- You know.

1146
01:32:05,935 --> 01:32:08,237
Oh, yes.

1147
01:32:10,473 --> 01:32:13,642
Oh, my goodness.
Why didn't I notice that?

1148
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,781
Oh, of course.

1149
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:31,910
Tell me, Leonard,
have you given any thought...

1150
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:34,930
to what your future plans might be?

1151
01:32:34,998 --> 01:32:39,702
I've given it a lot of thought,
Mrs. Corcoran, careful thought.

1152
01:32:39,769 --> 01:32:44,105
I thought actually I would like to do
something that concerns the land.

1153
01:32:44,173 --> 01:32:47,776
The land?
Oh, you mean farming?

1154
01:32:47,844 --> 01:32:51,329
Farming? No, I don't really think so.

1155
01:32:51,397 --> 01:32:53,565
And yet, it's hard to say.

1156
01:32:53,633 --> 01:32:57,970
You see, I want to get back
to origins, to basics.

1157
01:32:58,037 --> 01:33:00,489
Back to the soil, so to speak.

1158
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:03,625
So many young people today
are going in that direction.

1159
01:33:03,693 --> 01:33:06,945
Concerned young people.

1160
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:09,698
I think we've taken enough
out of this country.

1161
01:33:09,765 --> 01:33:12,618
I believe it's time that
we started to think about...

1162
01:33:12,685 --> 01:33:15,187
Putting something back into this country.

1163
01:33:15,255 --> 01:33:19,057
Oh, you know,
that's very well put, Leonard.

1164
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:23,495
You know, I read an editorial
in the Minneapolis Star this morning...

1165
01:33:23,563 --> 01:33:26,131
that said the very same thing.

1166
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:28,634
Really?
I didn't see that.

1167
01:33:32,638 --> 01:33:34,640
Can I get you something, Duane?

1168
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:38,444
No, thank you.
I wonder if you ladies...

1169
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:41,247
would allow Mr. Cantrow and I
a few moments alone.

1170
01:33:41,314 --> 01:33:43,748
Oh, yes, of course. Certainly.

1171
01:33:43,816 --> 01:33:46,769
- Mr. Cantrow.
- Excuse me.

1172
01:34:11,994 --> 01:34:14,947
No, sir, thank you. I don't smoke.

1173
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:22,238
- Leonard.
- Sir.

1174
01:34:22,305 --> 01:34:25,040
I was very quiet at dinner tonight...

1175
01:34:25,107 --> 01:34:28,194
because I was listening.

1176
01:34:28,261 --> 01:34:30,228
I'm in the banking business.

1177
01:34:30,296 --> 01:34:33,482
I'm called upon to have
many business dinners.

1178
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:38,504
I find I can tell more about a man by listening
to his dinner table conversation...

1179
01:34:38,571 --> 01:34:43,808
than by reading all the books and the records
and the balance sheets in the world.

1180
01:34:43,876 --> 01:34:46,145
I heard everything you said--

1181
01:34:46,212 --> 01:34:49,598
your feeling about the big cities,
the clear air out here,

1182
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:53,602
the honest food,
getting back to the soil.

1183
01:34:55,572 --> 01:34:58,590
And I will tell you...

1184
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:02,711
quite honestly...
I was very impressed.

1185
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:07,365
- Oh, I'm very glad to hear that, sir.
- I was very impressed.

1186
01:35:07,433 --> 01:35:11,753
And I think
I can... also say...

1187
01:35:11,821 --> 01:35:13,922
quite honestly...

1188
01:35:15,759 --> 01:35:19,244
I have never heard such a crock
of horseshit in my life.

1189
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:22,214
Sir?

1190
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:25,634
"There's no deceit in the cauliflower."

1191
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:31,589
Where do you get ideas like that?
They just--

1192
01:35:31,657 --> 01:35:34,092
they just come out of
that New York head of yours?

1193
01:35:34,177 --> 01:35:37,696
I was merely trying to impress
the fact that it was a pleasure--

1194
01:35:37,764 --> 01:35:39,915
I see through you.

1195
01:35:41,351 --> 01:35:44,686
You don't think I see through you?

1196
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:49,758
You could wear two sweaters and a raccoon coat,
I'd still see through you.

1197
01:35:49,825 --> 01:35:53,878
I never once tried to misrepresent myself
or deceive anybody--

1198
01:35:53,946 --> 01:35:56,565
Leonard, you think you're
quite determined, don't you?

1199
01:35:56,633 --> 01:36:01,303
You think once you get your mind set
on something, that's it.

1200
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:03,472
Leonard,

1201
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:07,125
you don't know what determination is.

1202
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:10,312
I eat determination for breakfast.

1203
01:36:11,865 --> 01:36:15,083
You want to see a brick wall?

1204
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:18,436
You're looking at a brick wall.

1205
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,772
I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

1206
01:36:22,742 --> 01:36:25,744
Did you honestly think
you could come out here...

1207
01:36:25,812 --> 01:36:30,265
and wise-guy yourself a girl like Kelly?

1208
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:34,702
Maybe you wise-guyed
that football player away, but...

1209
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:38,006
this is my baby you're talking about.

1210
01:36:39,676 --> 01:36:43,362
Nobody wise-guys away my little baby.

1211
01:36:43,429 --> 01:36:46,615
I have nothing but the deepest respect,
love and feelings for--

1212
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:49,668
Do you want to talk figures?
All right, let's talk figures.

1213
01:36:49,735 --> 01:36:51,703
Tell me your figure, I'll tell you mine.

1214
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:56,407
- I don't understand. What do you mean, money?
- Five.

1215
01:36:56,475 --> 01:37:00,161
How does 5,000 grab you?

1216
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:03,414
I'm shocked.
I am shocked...

1217
01:37:03,482 --> 01:37:06,435
That you would even remotely suggest
that I'm gonna take--

1218
01:37:06,503 --> 01:37:10,189
I am talking 5,000 tax-free dollars.

1219
01:37:10,256 --> 01:37:13,742
- Is that remotely enough for you?
- Suggest that I'm gonna agree--

1220
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,928
because if it isn't, I will go 10,000.

1221
01:37:16,996 --> 01:37:19,798
Now, that's a lot
of bats and balls, Cantrow.

1222
01:37:19,866 --> 01:37:21,834
There's not enough money...

1223
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:23,802
...in all the banks of Minneapolis.
- 15,000.

1224
01:37:23,869 --> 01:37:28,823
15,000. You're talking to a brick wall,
young fellow, a rich brick wall.

1225
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:30,925
In all the banks of Minnesota.

1226
01:37:30,993 --> 01:37:35,831
Have you any conception of what
$20,000 feels like? What it looks like?

1227
01:37:35,898 --> 01:37:38,516
In all the banks of
the United States of America!

1228
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:41,319
I'm talking hard cash, goddamn it!

1229
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:46,408
Cold, hard American currency,
25,000 goddamn dollars!

1230
01:37:47,526 --> 01:37:49,461
Look, Mr. Corcoran.

1231
01:37:49,529 --> 01:37:52,564
I didn't come out here
to negotiate for Kelly.

1232
01:37:52,631 --> 01:37:55,600
I came out here to fight for her.

1233
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:59,154
I spent three years
in the United States army.

1234
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:03,792
I fought every goddamn minute
of those three years!

1235
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:07,412
Unfortunately not overseas
because of a minor back injury,

1236
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:11,450
but in the small army towns
of this country...

1237
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:15,336
Against the narrow-minded,
petty-brained bigots...

1238
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:17,973
who look down on anyone
who's nothing more...

1239
01:38:18,041 --> 01:38:21,092
Than your average
hardworking enlisted man!

1240
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,695
I don't want your money.

1241
01:38:23,762 --> 01:38:27,649
I don't want your goddamn lousy $25,000!

1242
01:38:30,302 --> 01:38:32,487
What do you want?

1243
01:38:34,457 --> 01:38:37,075
What do you want, goddamn it?

1244
01:38:39,195 --> 01:38:42,781
I want Kelly.
I want Kelly.

1245
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:47,402
Well, so do I, goddamn it!

1246
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:32,463
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here...

1247
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:35,884
in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

1248
01:39:35,952 --> 01:39:40,722
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony,

1249
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:43,308
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God...

1250
01:39:43,376 --> 01:39:45,877
And signifying unto us
the mystical union...

1251
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:48,864
that is betwixt Christ and his church.

1252
01:39:48,932 --> 01:39:53,534
Into this holy estate, these two persons
present come now to be joined.

1253
01:39:53,602 --> 01:39:57,138
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together,

1254
01:39:57,206 --> 01:39:59,241
let him now speak,

1255
01:39:59,308 --> 01:40:03,194
<i>or else forever hold his peace.</i>

1256
01:40:04,897 --> 01:40:08,349
<i>Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?</i>

1257
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:12,254
I do.

1258
01:40:30,073 --> 01:40:32,858
Repeat after me.

1259
01:40:32,925 --> 01:40:35,193
I, Leonard Allen Cantrow.

1260
01:40:35,261 --> 01:40:37,228
I, Leonard Allen Cantrow--

1261
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:39,397
The Lord bless you and keep you.

1262
01:40:39,465 --> 01:40:42,100
The Lord make the light
of his countenance to shine upon you...

1263
01:40:42,168 --> 01:40:46,605
and give you peace both now and forever.

1264
01:40:46,672 --> 01:40:48,607
Amen.

1265
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,142
- Lovely bride.
- Thank you.

1266
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:11,045
Here we are again.
You must meet my son-in-law.

1267
01:41:11,113 --> 01:41:13,314
- How do you do?
- Hello. Hello. Thank you.

1268
01:41:13,382 --> 01:41:15,316
Here's Mr. Lindstrom.

1269
01:41:15,384 --> 01:41:17,585
- Mr. Lindstrom.
- You are the luckiest man alive.

1270
01:41:17,653 --> 01:41:19,588
Thank you.
I know it.

1271
01:41:19,655 --> 01:41:22,807
It's actually ten years old.

1272
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:26,895
You're talking up to
$20,000 worth of land?

1273
01:41:26,962 --> 01:41:30,765
<i>I feel that so many people
are so concerned with...</i>

1274
01:41:30,833 --> 01:41:34,018
taking things out of the country...

1275
01:41:34,086 --> 01:41:37,989
rather than making a contribution
and putting things back in.

1276
01:41:38,057 --> 01:41:39,974
You know what I'm saying?

1277
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:43,845
I think you can get a lot of satisfaction
from planting things.

1278
01:41:43,913 --> 01:41:46,415
- It's more like Thomas Jefferson, you know.
- Exactly.

1279
01:41:46,482 --> 01:41:49,467
- We visited his home in Monticello lately.
- Yes.

1280
01:41:49,535 --> 01:41:52,887
- And he said the best government
is the least government.
- Yes.

1281
01:41:52,955 --> 01:41:55,190
His way of doing was something fabulous.

1282
01:41:55,274 --> 01:41:57,708
<i>The home he designed,
very resourceful.</i>

1283
01:41:57,776 --> 01:41:59,944
<i>What business are you in?</i>

1284
01:42:00,012 --> 01:42:02,864
We make food for veal calves.

1285
01:42:02,931 --> 01:42:05,033
It's a specialty kind of food.

1286
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,669
It develops, uh--
A European type...

1287
01:42:07,737 --> 01:42:10,955
- Of-- of veal calf.
- Uh-huh.

1288
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,525
<i>You know, I'm really
wide open as far as...</i>

1289
01:42:13,593 --> 01:42:16,444
<i>Where I might, uh, go with that.</i>

1290
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:20,165
But insurance is a field
that's been with us almost since the--

1291
01:42:20,232 --> 01:42:22,600
- What company are you--
- It's one of the first.

1292
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:24,669
It's called Alexander and Alexander.

1293
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:27,522
- It's a nationwide firm.
- Nation.

1294
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:31,109
<i>- Is that a growing field in this area?
- Oh, yes.</i>

1295
01:42:31,176 --> 01:42:35,046
- There's a lot of money in tear gas, uh--
- Yes, indeed.

1296
01:42:36,498 --> 01:42:40,018
Does your business bring you traveling?

1297
01:42:40,086 --> 01:42:44,022
There you are.
I've been looking all over the place for you.

1298
01:42:44,089 --> 01:42:47,308
- I'll be with you in a second.
- Wait a minute.

1299
01:43:05,127 --> 01:43:07,445
I would like to get back to origins.

1300
01:43:07,512 --> 01:43:10,248
I think many people don't think like this,

1301
01:43:10,315 --> 01:43:13,567
but I think we've taken enough out of
this country in many ways, you know?

1302
01:43:13,635 --> 01:43:15,853
Yeah.

1303
01:43:15,854 --> 01:43:18,072
I feel all of us should think
about putting something back in.

1304
01:43:19,508 --> 01:43:23,194
I'm in athletic equipment now, you know.

1305
01:43:24,547 --> 01:43:27,732
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

1306
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:31,453
What are you interested
in being when you grow up?

1307
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:34,906
Well, I haven't decided yet.

1308
01:43:34,973 --> 01:43:37,442
- How old are you?
- Ten right now.

1309
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,148
I was ten.

1310
01:43:46,085 --> 01:43:48,019
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1311
01:43:48,086 --> 01:43:50,054
Come on.

1312
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:27,508
<i># Hey, bless my soul #</i>

01:44:27,576 --> 01:44:29,510
