1
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,980
<i>Good morning, Presage employees.</i>

2
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,321
<i>We hope you're all ready for our exciting
team-building retreat.</i>

3
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,700
<i>Please enjoy your breakfast...</i>

4
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,329
<i>...and then make your way to the bus,
which will leave shortly.</i>

5
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,661
Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put
breakfast together for the retreat?"...

6
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,873
...I meant, like, some stale doughnuts,
some coffee.

7
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,378
But this is amazing.

8
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,212
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you
see my sales report for last month.

9
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,796
Oh, I saw it last night.

10
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,003
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?

11
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,422
Not yet.

12
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,886
Look, you just need to make a decision,
you know?

13
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,302
Are you gonna be "chef" or are you
gonna be "sales guy"?

14
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm saying that as your friend because,
as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.

15
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,685
As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
-Good.

16
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,523
<i>Inside my baby's room</i>

17
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,407
Hold on, man, I'll be right back.

18
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,327
<i>Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay</i>

19
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,533
<i>I moved in with-</i>

20
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,667
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.

21
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,332
Tell me that's a mistake.

22
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,129
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.

23
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,919
Uh, tell me what?

24
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,255
That I don't think it's such a good idea.

25
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,423
What, the trip? it's my brother's wedding.

26
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,266
What's going on here?

27
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,268
We should talk about this later.
Let's just-

28
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,273
What, pretend like I didn't see this for the
next two days? No, let's talk about this.

29
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,274
It's not working out, Sam.

30
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,320
We're not working out.

31
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,484
Hey.

32
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,370
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?

33
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,743
Not funny.
-Oh-

34
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,127
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.

35
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,913
So we're gonna be all business
for the next two days.

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,252
Sorry.

37
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,258
I love you, but doesn't change the fact
that you're still an intern.

38
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,808
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.

39
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,014
Why?

40
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,271
For the naked team-building.

41
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,622
Hey, Olivia.

42
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,078
Don't forget these.

43
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,586
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.

44
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,543
Hmm.
-I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.

45
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,049
Oh, well, you know...

46
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,383
...I'd rather be very Olivia.

47
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,138
We got a gig on Sunday.

48
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah, I'll be there.

49
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,509
Morning, Peter.

50
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,183
Looking good.
-Uh, hi.

51
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,519
Olivia. Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?

52
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,401
Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship...

53
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,813
...or does Daddy
just increase your allowance?

54
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,904
You know, if you wanna get rid of that
baby fat, you should try the gym.

55
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,615
They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.

56
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,869
You're good at that.

57
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,952
Sweetie, it's not fat.

58
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,168
They're called tits.

59
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,499
You're not looking so hot there,
Moll-face.

60
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,917
Gee, thanks.

61
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,969
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever
your boyfriend made?

62
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,598
I gotta tell you, he's a pre-Uh-oh,
that's what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?

63
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,510
Just leave me alone, Isaac.
-Hey, Moll? Moll? Look at me.

64
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,178
If you ever need anyone to talk to...

65
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,353
...I've been told I'm a good listener
by a lot of ladies. Shh, wait.

66
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,519
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is-?

67
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,437
Hey, let's sit next to each other
on the bus.

68
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,483
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?

69
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,068
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.

70
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,032
Why?
-Doesn't matter.

71
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,788
Never matters. "I'm sorry, because I-"

72
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,373
Oh, shit.

73
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,213
Hey, Stan, how's it going?

74
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,424
Uh, it's Sam, sir.

75
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,880
Did you just correct me?

76
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,596
No.

77
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,884
Look at me.

78
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,348
What's my name?
-Dennis.

79
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,888
Look away.

80
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,271
All set, Pete?

81
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,933
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.

82
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,774
What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?

83
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,028
Wasted time, sir.

84
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,403
Exactly. I wanna be on the road
in 90 seconds.

85
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,193
Uh, well, I just saw his car,
so I'll go track him down.

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,613
Way to show some initiative, Stan.

87
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,531
It's gonna be a good day.

88
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,039
Hey, guys.
-Hey, man.

89
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,416
What's up, bud?

90
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,255
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?

91
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,766
You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.

92
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,473
Three weeks ago they brought you in
as assistant plant manager...

93
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,186
...and now you got a day off?
-It's not a day off. it's a re-Re-

94
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,941
Re-Re-what? Retarded?

95
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,069
It's a retreat.

96
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,398
I don't wanna go. I'm just following orders.

97
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,568
So if you don't like it, then you can-
-I can what? What? I can what?

98
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,119
Nathan, hey. Come on, man,
we're all waiting for you.

99
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,914
Yeah, okay.
-Now, hold on. What you gonna say?

100
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,666
What you gonna say?

101
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,205
I got 15 years on you here. You got, what,
four years in some classroom upstate?

102
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,044
Listen, if you think I'm gonna sit here-

103
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,050
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,381
We're fine for the day.

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,592
Why do you let him get away with that?

106
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,306
No choice. He's the union rep.

107
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,564
I fire him and suddenly
I've got a factory full of Roys.

108
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,975
But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.

109
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,022
What about you?

110
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,813
When are they gonna offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?

111
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,198
They already did.
-Dude, that's great.

112
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,448
I don't know, man.

113
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,329
I mean, they wanna send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris...

114
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,036
...for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.

115
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,451
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.

116
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,544
Although now I'm not so sure.

117
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,176
Well, look, if you do go to Paris,
do me a favor.

118
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,758
What's that?
-Take Roy with you.

119
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,013
Aw, hell, no.

120
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,563
Hey, Sam.

121
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,065
You coming?

122
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,820
Yeah.

123
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:13,410
<i>Get ready for a new
adventure at 180 Corporate Consulting.</i>

124
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,876
<i>For the next two days, you will be tested,
both physically and mentally...</i>

00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,378
<i>...to help you reach your true potential...</i>

<i>This weekend, a professional will guide you
to achieving better results...</i>

128
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,720
What are those for?

129
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,385
Oh, it's, um, just something I do
to relax me. And for luck.

130
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,811
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players
at this kind of thing.

131
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,099
She's superstitious.

132
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,986
Hey, Katrina, how you doing?

133
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,407
Nah, just this stupid retreat thing
with the idiots from the office.

134
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,819
No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.

135
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,035
Hold on a sec, let me go someplace
a little more private.

136
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,076
Bald's the new black, sir.
Bald's the new black.

137
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,213
Yeah, no, hang on a sec, babe. Just
gonna head on back to my private office.

138
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,042
The right-hand side!

139
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,024
Whew.

140
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,342
Ow. Damn it.

141
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,050

<i>All we are-</i>

145
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,948
We'll tie it off from the far side.

146
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,203
Oh, whoa!

147
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,323
Whoa, what the hell?

148
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,412
Peter, did you feel that?
-What?

149
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,381
Something's wrong.

150
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,732
Look out!

151
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,021
Molly, come on.
-Candice.

152
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,649
Go!
-Go, go!

153
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,361
Candice! Candice!

154
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,619
Peter!

155
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,573
Peter! Peter!

156
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,251
No, Candice! Aah!

157
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,462
No!

158
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,213
Peter! Come on, Peter, let's go!

159
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,427
Molly, come on!

160
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,097
What the fuck?!

161
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,728
Oh, no! No! No!

162
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,565
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

163
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,416
Oh, Shit!

164
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,970
Over here! See the railing?

165
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,859
You can do this. Let's go.

166
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,815
Let's go. Do it!

167
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,651
You can do it. Don't look down!

168
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,736
Good. Good.

169
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,547
Run!

170
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,001
Help me!

171
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,669
Sam!
-Olivia!

172
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,299

Sam!
-I'm right here. I'm right here. Okay.

174
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,720
It's coming loose!

175
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,520
Do you feel it? All right.
-Olivia, come on.

176
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,183
it's okay, it's safe. Now you've just
gotta follow this to Molly's voice, all right?

177
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,852
Come towards me.
Come on, you're almost there! Come on.

178
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,240
Come on.

179

-Molly.

What are you talking about?

201
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,574
The bridge is gonna collapse.

Let's go!

00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,577
Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.

Molly, Sam, come on, guys.

218
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,245
Did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus?

219
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,129
No, he was fine. It's like he just snapped.

220
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,962

-What the hell is going on out here?

Get off the bus!

Come on!

225
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,222

<i>That's the big question here.</i>

227
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,239
How did you know?

228
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,159
It says right here in your statement:

229
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,867
"I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen."

230
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,622
That sounds premeditated to me.

231
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,658
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

232
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,333
I had a vision.

233
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,296
Okay. A vision.

234
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,507
Psychic phenomena, ghosts, Bigfoot.

235
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,637
You actually believe in that stuff?

236
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,843
I don't know.

237
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,306
I'll tell you what I believe:

238
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,346
There's an answer for everything.

239
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,015
There's an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone...

240
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,652
...the bridge was going to collapse,
and minutes later, it did.

241
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,111
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.

242
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,570
I just did.

243
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,369
And no one else did?

244
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,158
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.

245
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,917
Did Sam have issues with authority?

246
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,830
Did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior?

247
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,213
No.

248
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,418
Wait. "Extremist behavior"'?

249
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,675
You mean like a terrorist?

250
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,387
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?

251
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,892
Just his girlfriend.

252
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,521
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.

253
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,523
But that was in person.
-Molly.

254
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,772
Ex.

255
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,528
Tell me about the breakup.

256
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,736
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.

257
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,863
It's personal.

258
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,740
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.

259
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,908
What does that have to do
with anything?

260
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,961
I'm just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together...

261
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,293
...before I start moving them around,
making them fit.

262
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,879
Look, I just had a hunch that something
bad was gonna happen. That's it.

266
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,982
And?
-They're chalking it up to high winds...

267
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,108
...and structural damage
from the construction.

268
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,611
"High winds"?

269
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,737
Yeah. Send everyone home.

You're free to go.

271
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,289

we'll be seeing each other again.

were killed in the collapse.

the "lucky eight"...

280

Hey.

00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,690
Anybody know
when this thing's supposed to start?

285
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,193
When Dennis gets here, I guess.

00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,651
That agent still hounding you?

287
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:04,319
No. You heard the news,
it was natural causes.

288
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,654
Yeah, more like supernatural.

00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,916
How you holding up? I tried calling.

290
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,420
No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired-

291
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,707
So?

292
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,051
How did you explain it?

293
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,222
I didn't.

294
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,429
I couldn't.

295
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,389
Sam, there had to be a reason.

296
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,929
Heh. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.

297
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,562
Whatever answer you're looking for,
I don't have it.

298
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,072
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.

299
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,610
We should all just put it behind us
and be grateful we're still alive.

300
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,907

But the people that left us on the bridge
that day, they were more than that.

304
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,799
People like Jennifer Alcott...

305
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,428

306
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
...David Buckler.

307
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,555
Maybe you worked next to them.

308
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,440
Maybe you worked for them.

309
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,398
But we all worked with them, huh?

313
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,623
That's not funny.
-I know, I'm sorry.

314
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,706
I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.

320
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,151
What's that supposed to mean?

You all just be careful now.

322
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,324
Okay. Thanks for the advice!

-Yeah.

-Oh.

was you.

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,419
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.

352
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,004
You haven't done anything wrong.

353
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,053
Then, what? What is it?

354
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,594
Paris.

355
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,383
We talked about that.

356
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,397
I'm not going to uproot my life,
leave you, for that job.

357
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,058
But it's the only thing
you've ever dreamed of.

358
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,775
Life is too short, Sam.

359
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,531
You have to go after what you love.

360
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,741
I am.

361
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,240
You should take the job.

362
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,453
Go to Paris.

363
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,474
Hey.
-Hey.

364
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,059
What's the matter?

365
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,772
I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.

366
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,404
It's been really hard to concentrate
after everything.

367
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,736
Yeah? Are you sure?

368
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,738
Yeah.

369
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,780
Because this is the last practice
before the championship.

370
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,452
And it's your last practice
of your college career.

371
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,367
I know, but...

372
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,204
I think you got this.

373
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,249
Really?
-Yeah.

374
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,218
I mean, you love it out there.

375
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,297
Okay. You're right.

376
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,682
And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.

377
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,433
Yeah.

378
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,684
Here.

379
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,309
Thanks.

380
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,644
Come here.

381
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,401
Bye.

382
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,943
You got this.

383
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,536
You have to get a little more speed.
You gotta hit that follow-up.

384
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,259
I'm sore from the back extensions.
-Really?

385
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,679
Okay, seriously, this is stupid.

386
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,345
They've gotta make it cooler
or we're gonna pass out.

387
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,058
They're working on it.

388
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,315
Well, they should have it fixed by now.

389
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,333
Come on, Candice. You're up.

390
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,015
Come on, Candice. You got this.

391
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,333
Candice, now.

392
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,887
Really strong value on this.

393
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,067
Hey, coach! How was that?

394
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,836
I wanna see you guys
run the routine all the way through once.

395
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,234
That's good.
-Whew.

396
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,445
All right, Janine next. Let's go.

397
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,905
Let's go, ladies, and drink water.

398
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,870
That's it.

399
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,326
Every time, Candice.

400
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,125
There you go.
-Thanks.

401
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,215
Nicely done, Candice.

402
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,595
Okay, go to bars.

403
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,886
Come on. Hit the floor. You can do it.

404
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,311
Go hard this time, Candice.

405
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,692
Let's be aggressive.

406
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,530
Here we go, Candice. Stay loose.

407
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,158
Okay, Porter, it's your turn.

408
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,028
Stay focused.

409
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,701
Good.

410
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,543
Looking good, Candice.

411
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,416
Candice? Candice'?!

412
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,880
Oh, what happened?
-Don't touch her.

413
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,761
Someone call 911.

414
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,921
Candice?

415
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,111
Peter.

416
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,218
I came as soon as I heard.

417
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,507
She was doing great.

418
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,560
She was almost finished with her routine
and then...

419
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,564
Why did it happen?

420
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,785
This doesn't make any sense.

421
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,662
I don't know, man.

422
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,452
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.

423
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,016
Let's just go, Sam.

424
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,783
Hey.

425
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,031
How's it going?

426
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,905
It's weird.

427
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,536
Being here, I mean.

428
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,499
It's just so quiet.

429
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,841
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls
rerouted to corporate.

430
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,879
Yeah, well, it's depressing.

431
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,351
Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?

432
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,140
Hey, what's he doing here?

433
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,397
I think he just needed the distraction.

434
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,028
Yeah.

435
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,902
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.

436
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,155
Guess we all should have seen
that coming.

437
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,826
What?

438
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,868
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.

439
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,542
<i>Once you've handled the e-mail...</i>

440
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,583
<i>you'll need to deactivate all the key cards
of the deceased employees.</i>

441
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,251
<i>Instructions are in your binder.</i>

442
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,717
Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?

443
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,515
<i>The facility manager's dead.</i>

444
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>Dennis, you want me to fly someone
up there?</i>

445
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,933
No, no, I got it.

446
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,771
Aw, Debbie.

447
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,908
You were so naughty.

448
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,090
Fuck it.

449
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,183
Robert, my man.

450
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,902
OW.

451
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,826
Shit.

452
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,710
You shouldn't have, buddy.

453
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,590
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?

454
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,352
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.

455
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,688
So, uh, who wants one?

456
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,973
Where'd you get these?

457
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,270
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. it's good, right? Ha, ha.

458
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,938
I got something better.

459
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,985
Ooh, nice one.

460
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,695
Yeah, count me in.

461
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,028
Are you sure you wanna share that?

462
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,249
If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone,
which is just sad.

463
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,994
Well, this day just got way more fun.

464
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,467
No, I did call you.

465
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:13,271
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

466
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,228
Because I really do
wanna take you out again.

467
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,395
Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice
romantic dinner.

468
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,063
You know,
somewhere maybe outside the city.

469
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,482
Hold up.

470
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,029
You know what? I gotta go.

471
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,368
No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.

472
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:35,206
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?

473
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,120
Amber, yes, that's what I said.

474
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,333
Excuse me.

475
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:49,424
Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi-?

476
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,266
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.

477
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,272
Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

478
00:41:56,431 --> 00:42:00,436
So tell me about stress relief.

479
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,231
And what does this really get me?

480
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,116
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

481
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,573
Like massage therapy?

482
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,656
Erotic massage?

483
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,745
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.

484
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,881
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.
In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.

485
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,763
I'm just trying to clarify, though, that this
professional experience ends, uh...

486
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,798
...happy.

487
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,887
I know exactly what you need.

488
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,102
Oh, I'm sure you do.

489
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,437
Follow me, please.
-I'd love to.

490
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,977
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

491
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,736
Slow down there a little bit.

492
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,774
Yeah. Yeah, you have
a lovely little Canter.

493
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,950
Yum yum, dim sum.

494
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,489
Hold up there a second.

495
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,124
All right, these are solid.
Just making sure.

496
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,456
Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.

497
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,756
Ha, ha. Yo, Buddha.
Slow down on the rice cakes.

498
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,971
Just close your eyes.
-Mm-hm.

499
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,385
Relax.
-Ooh.

500
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,227
And Someone will be in
to service you soon.

501
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,312
Oh, yeah.

502
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,656
Oh, yeah.

503
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,166
Feels dynamite.

504
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,249
No, no. You're going the wrong way there,
little lady.

505
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,466
Oh.

506
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,628
Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?

507
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,183
Okay, I'm sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?

508
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,395
Maybe I should go.

509
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,477
Don't know what that means. No idea. Yep.

510
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,108
OW!

511
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,314
Fuck!

512
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,110
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.

513
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,445
Holy shit, you're strong.

514
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,733
CHO:

515
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,243
What are you doing? Ow.

516
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,824
You're a little aggressive.

517
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,407
What's "capay"?
I don't know what that means.

518
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,164
I don't want a "foo-hay." No "foo-hay." Aah!

519
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,463
Cheers.

520
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,928
Mm.

521
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,139
Shit, that's my ride.

522
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,895
Shit. I gotta go.

523
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,806
Leaving more for us.

524
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,233
All right, well, more for me.

525
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,525
All right, bye.

526
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,034
See you later.
-Okay.

527
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,241
Later.

528
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,873
This is the end,
so, what are we toasting to?

529
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,830
To, uh, finding new jobs.

530
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,370
Because it's only a matter of time
before they shut us down.

531
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,210
Hear, hear.
-Oh. To starting over.

532
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,011
Peter?

533
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,551
It just doesn't make sense.

534
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,561
She dies doing something
that she's done...

535
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,644
...almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.

536
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,314
She said she didn't wanna do it.

537
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,730
She said she wasn't ready.

538
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,318
And I should have stopped her.

539
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,945
I should have done something.
I should've-

540
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,455
Peter, there wasn't anything
you could've done.

541
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,622
How do you know?

542
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,754
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

543
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,939
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.

544
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,943
Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.

545
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,603
Does that mean anything?

546
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,192
You told me to call if I saw anything odd.

547
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:19,862
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis,
and call me if you see anything strange.

548
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,449
Stranger.

549
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,913
Should we maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?

550
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,537
Over and out.

551
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,708
All right, ahem,
show me how this happened.

552
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,085
I don't think I can.

553
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,845
What do you mean?

554
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:43,602
I mean, I could try it a hundred times and
never re-create exactly what happened here.

555
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,558
This is some freaky shit.

556
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,570
God!

557
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,202
Oh, that actually felt great.

558
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,582
Oh, yeah. Awesome.

559
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,540
Oh...

560
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,627
Wait. Are those things even sterilized?

561
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,093
No, no. I'm not catching any diseases
unless I've earned them.

562
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,558
Wait a second. You understood that.

563
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,693
You speak English.

564
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,985
Oh.

565
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,039
All right, you know what?

566
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,077
Let's do this.
Two billion people can't be Wong.

567
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,079
I said Wong. You follow me?

568
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,588
You get it, you're Chinese.

569
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,379
Ow, ow. Okay, it's in. it's definitely in.
Ow, okay, yes, it is in.

570
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,803
How many of these are you gonna
put in me?

571
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,407
Oh, uh, hey,
can you grab that for me? Thanks.

572
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,906
Hey.

573
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,323
That's not very nice, you know.

574
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,630
Okay, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.

575
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,470
I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.

576
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,428
Once again, Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.

577
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,565
Thirty minutes. You sleep.

578
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,286
Sleep.

579
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,397
Oh.

580
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,439
Hey! Fire!

581
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,479
Hello?!

582
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,692
Hey!

583
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,570
Hey! Hey!

584
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,111
Hey, there's a fire in here!

585
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,196
Hey, there's a fire!

586
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,282
Get in here!

587
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,637
Oh, shit.

588
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,959
<i>You should come with me.</i>

589
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,620
To Paris?

590
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,416
Yeah, you know, you said it yourself.
Like, you're gonna have to start over.

591
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,297
Start over with me.

592
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,555
How many drinks have you had?

593
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,684
Enough. Molly, I'm serious.

594
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:39,018
Look, you were right.
If I don't take the job, I'll regret it.

595
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,232
But I'm not willing to lose you.

596
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,940
Why does it have to be
one or the other?

597
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,313
I'm better when you're with me.

598
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,159
Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.

599
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,216
They're saying it was a freak accident.

600
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,468
Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.

601
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,801
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.

602
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,095
First Candice, now Isaac.

603
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,100
It can't be a coincidence.

604
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,019
It's not.

605
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,933
Where are you going?

606
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,766
It's that creepy dude.

607
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,731
Why are you following us?

608
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,063
Who are you?

609
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,910
You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.

610
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,324
What are you doing?

611
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,239
My job.

612
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,333
What's happening to us?

613
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,510
What makes you think I know anything?

614
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,845
You warned us.

615
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,390
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.

616
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,601
It's just that I've seen this before.

617
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,561
You've seen what?

618
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,102
A lucky few survive a disaster.

619
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:13,320
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.

620
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,286
You changed things on that bridge.

621
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,541
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.

622
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,123
So, what, we're doomed to die?

623
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,121
I mean, is that it?

624
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,879
We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?

625
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,759
Are you saying that we can't stop this?

626
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,671
You were supposed to die on that bridge.

627
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,261
You're not supposed to be here.

628
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,809
You shorted Death.

629
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,767
So you let Death
have somebody else in your place...

630
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,933
...and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living.

631
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,945
All the days and years
that they have yet to live.

632
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,698
And they take your place in death.

633
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,450
Then the books are balanced.

634
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:01,580
Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get
their life? Is that what you're telling me?

635
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,037
I don't make the rules.

636
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:10,252
I just clean up after the game is over.

637
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,141
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.

638
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,808
They weren't supposed to survive,
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

639
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,893
No.

640
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,061
No, not all of us.

641
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,572
Molly made it, she didn't die.

642
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,074
What?

643
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:42,618
Well, when I had that vision,
or premonition, or whatever it was...

644
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,996
...I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

645
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,285
You survived.

646
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,670
You saved her?

647
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,504
Why, because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us?

648
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,465
That's not what he's saying. I don't
deserve to live more than anyone.

649
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,301
You deserve to live
more than Candice.

650
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,635
Whoa, Peter, hang on.

651
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,176
No, look, guys, come on.

652
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,310
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid,
are you?

653
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,723
Killing people
to survive Death's list. Really?

654
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,569
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what that guy's selling.

655
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,776
Yeah? What else is it, then?

656
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,824
Shit.

657
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,363
We need to tell Olivia.

658
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,327
Come on.

659
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,916
My forms are all signed.

660
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,379
I see that it's been quite a while
since your first consultation.

661
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,885
What made you decide
to take the leap today?

662
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,306
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life...

663
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,684
...and I just don't wanna miss anything...

664
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,140
...you know, important.

665
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,975
Same reason I had it done myself.

666
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:53,267
Come on in back. Let's get you started.
-Okay.

667
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,360
Oh.

668
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,827
Yep, that's the first step.
You'll never need those again.

669
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,624
Here we are. Come on in.

670
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,215
What's with these?

671
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,015
Oh, just for some of
our younger patients.

672
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,179
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.

673
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,403
What was that?

674
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,159
Relax.

675
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,162
You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.

676
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:51,667
Okay, I'm gently going to
position your head...

677
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,874
...and I want you to tell me...

678
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,873
...when this feels snug.

679
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,462
I can't move my head.

680
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,469
Perfect. Just what we want.

681
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,386
There we go.

682
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,178
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.

683
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,774
And you will feel a little numbness
in your eye...

684
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,400
...which is a good thing.

685
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,746
Deep breath.

686
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,794
Relax.

687
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,638
Very good.

688
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,514
Thattagirl.

689
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,241
There.

690
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,119
That's not so bad, is it?

691
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,708
Looks good.

692
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,185
What was that?
-Just relax, Olivia.

693
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,812
I'm just gonna enter some data into...

694
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,317
Dottie!

695
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,063
Dot-

696
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,903
Do you know what?
My assistant's given me an incomplete file.

697
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,817
I'll be right back.

698
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,947
Hold on, you're leaving?!

699
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,272
Is that supposed to be happening?!

700
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,817
Help me!

701
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,456
Olivia Castle. Where is she?

702
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,744
She might be in danger.

703
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,289
She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.

704
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,511
Help me!

705
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,809
Help me!

706
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,121
This has never happened before.

707
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,495
Sam.

708
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,877
Stay with me tonight, please.

709
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,842
Of course.

710
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,762
Five different systems had to go wrong...

711
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,804
...for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly. Five.

712
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,722
What do you want from us?

713
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,187
I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.

714
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,068
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.

715
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,106
Three? That's a pattern.

716
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,620
Now...

717
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,627
...I know you two didn't do this.

718
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,129
All right?

719
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,879
But I think you know something.

720
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,720
What is it?

721
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,270
We don't know anything.

722
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,141
Take a guess.

723
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,483
We think we weren't supposed to survive
on that bridge.

724
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,864
What?

725
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,828
And now something
is trying to set it right.

726
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,077
"Something"?

727
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,463
That's all you got?

728
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,881
Right now, yeah.

729
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:37,508
But if you come up
with any other explanations, let us know.

730
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,301
Thank you.

731
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,313
"Something."

732
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,406
Hey.

733
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,826
Been up long?

734
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,625
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.

735
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,295
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.

736
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,431
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about,
in the premonition...

737
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:26,353
...we all got off the bus,
but the ground gave way and Candice fell.

738
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,473
Then the bus tipped over.

739
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,647
And Isaac, he never got off the bus.
He went with it.

740
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,187
What are you getting at?

741
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,482
I know that there was just
so much going on...

742
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,361
Look, I know that I helped you across.

743
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,746
Then I reached back for Olivia.

744
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,667
But she didn't make it. She fell.

745
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,914
So first was Candice.

746
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,797
Then Isaac.

747
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,261
Then Olivia.

748
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,507
They're dying in order.

749
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,510
Who dies after Olivia?

750
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,589
<i>Roy, would you come
to the control room, please?</i>

751
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,475
Uh-oh, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.

752
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,278
Okay, schoolboy,
what do you wanna talk to me about?

753
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,243
What is with your timecard?
-Let's talk about my timecard.

754
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,875
You out my hours,
which means you cut my pay!

755
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,205
I cut everyone's hours, okay?

756
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,497
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.

757
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,665
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.

758
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,335
My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
-Roy.

759
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,596
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent,
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

760
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,880
No, we gotta move, man.

761
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,392
Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
-Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!

762
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,848
We gotta move now!

763
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,190
Roy! You okay down there?

764
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,404
Hey, Dennis?
-Hey.

765
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,541
They're closing us down.

766
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,997
They're shutting down the plant?

767
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,461
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.

768
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,295
Can you believe it? Us?

769
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,631
It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.

770
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,340
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.

771
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,881
Yeah, Dennis, we got bigger problems.

772
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,467
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

773
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,560
Who's Isaac?

774
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,814
Isaac Palmer, tech support.

775
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,142
Wasn't he dead already?

776
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,685
No, Dennis.

777
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:25,195
Listen, it's going to happen to us too
if we don't do something about it.

778
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:29,160
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.

779
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:33,415
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.

780
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,541
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.

781
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,498
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.

782
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,545
Anyone could be next.

783
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,332
It could be you. Understand?

784
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,967
Nobody's safe.

785
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,672
What are you talking about?

786
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,681
We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.

787
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,719
And so now it's kill or be killed.

788
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,475
You get that, Dennis?

789
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,644
Whatever.

790
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,650
I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.

791
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,198
I Will.

792
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,284
Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis. Um-

793
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,372
Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.

794
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,414
He's yelling about "kill or be killed."

795
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,503
Oh, yeah,
it definitely sounded like a threat.

796
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,566
What happened?

797
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,649
I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.

798
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,531
Nathan. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

799
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,365
We heard, and we thought-
-No. No, uh, I'm good.

800
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,738
Did you kill him?

801
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,239
What?

802
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,000
No. No, I just-

803
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,037
It was just timing, you know?
He got in the way and-

804
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,500
No, you did, didn't you?

805
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,042
You saw it coming, and then you took
his life. You put him in the way.

806
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,835
No, I didn't really do anything.

807
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,846
Tell us the truth: Did you or didn't you?
-Hey, Peter, calm down.

808
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,382
Did you or didn't you?

809
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,265
Did you or didn't you?

810
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,102
Yes. I think I did.

811
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,184
I killed him.

812
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,275
So if the theory works,
then you traded spots.

813
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,113
He should have your death,
and you should have his years.

814
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,156
How do we know for sure?

815
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,196
I think there's an order to these deaths.

816
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,584
They mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge.

817
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,540
Then who would be next?

818
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,623
Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?

819
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,128
Who is it, Sam?

820
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,338
Who's what?

821
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,134
Dennis! It was Dennis.

822
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,560
No shit.

823
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,347
Jesus.

824
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,443
Why are you fighting me on this?

825
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,980
You're not seriously going to work,
are you?

826
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,447
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.

827
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,283
If Death is gonna come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.

828
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,197
You have to do something.

829
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,083
What, kill someone so I can live?
-No, of course not.

830
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,995
We'll just have to
figure something else out.

831
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,255
I have figured it out.

832
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,675
Something saved me on that bridge.

833
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,676
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.

834
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,472
Maybe.

835
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,510
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.

836
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,187
So if it happens tomorrow,
or 50 years from now, whatever.

837
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,568
As long as we're together...

838
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,028
...I'll be okay.

839
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,575
Right? Why don't you come by
after my shift...

840
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,828
...and I'll make you
a nice late dinner, okay?

841
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,963
All right, give me this.

842
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,175
Excuse me.
We don't have to wait for them, do we?

843
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,639
I'll let you know.
-Okay, thank you.

844
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,815
<i>To the girl on the run</i>

845
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,827
Veal's ready, take it out.

846
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,080
Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.

847
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,630
Whoa.

848
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,086
Pan coming through.

849
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,382
Whoa, watch yourself.

850
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,482
Okay. Meat's in. Pick it up, eh?
-Yes, sir.

851
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,032
Whoa.

852
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,038
That could've been ugly, huh? Ha, ha.

853
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,871
Yeah. Could've been.

854
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,248
Vincent, speed it up, okay?

855
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,885
Whoa, hey!

856
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,448
Hey, clean that grate.

857
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:18,919
Just met your girlfriend.
-Oh.

858
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,009
Are you sure it's okay
if I make her a little something?

859
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,678
Make sure to clean up afterward.

860
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,594
I will, of course. Thank you.

861
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,263
And, chef...

862
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,725
The apprenticeship.

863
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,394
If the offer still stands...

864
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,904
...I'd like to take it.

865
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,066
It's yours.

866
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,256
Okay, no more suspense.

867
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,089
What you've been waiting for.

868
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,306
Wow. You're gonna help me
with this, right?

869
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,932
Yeah, sure, if you want me to-

870
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,593
No? You don't want me to...?

871
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,557
So how's your French?

872
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,306
<i>Heh. Terrible.</i>

873
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,147
Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.

874
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,484
Why?
-I took the internship.

875
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,571
What? Sam, that's amazing.

876
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,743
I'm so proud of you.

877
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,676
Peter.
-Hey.

878
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,518
You okay, man?
You look a little, uh, upset.

879
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,605
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a rough couple days.

880
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,984
Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.

881
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,816
For some more than others.

882
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,030
Do you mind if I come in?

883
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,537
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, come in.

884
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,703
Here, have a seat.

885
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,129
Thanks.

886
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,544
Hey, Peter.

887
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,509
Hi, Molly.

888
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,111
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.

889
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:50,236
Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.

890
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,580
Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought-

891
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,333
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

892
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,420
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.

893
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,252
Uh...

894
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,258
Still alive, I mean.

895
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,760
I'm next to go, right?

896
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,759
It's me and then you, isn't it?

897
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:16,396
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night,
you know...

898
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,728
...thinking about if I could really do it.

899
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,149
Do what?
-Take someone else's life.

900
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:29,568
If I could actually kill some stranger,
replace their life with my own.

901
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,449
And I thought about it.

902
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,239
And I convinced myself that...

903
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,117
...yeah, I could.

904
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,209
<i>So I went on a walk.</i>

905
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,125
<i>You know, nowhere in particular..-</i>

906
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,171
<i>...but every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself</i>

907
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:52,135
<i>Heh. Like clockwork.</i>

908
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,643
<i>I could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley.</i>

909
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,813
Or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic.

910
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,978
<i>You know?</i>

911
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,105
<i>It'd be real easy.</i>

912
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,399
Peter, what did you do?

913
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,537
Did you...?
-No, I didn't.

914
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,501
<i>I couldn't.</i>

915
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,506
<i>I realized that...</i>

916
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,589
...I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.

917
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,391
And I thought about Candice,
and I thought, "Wait a minute.

918
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,349
Candice didn't deserve to die.

919
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,066
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.

920
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,443
I don't."

921
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,651
Do I?

922
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,028
No, of course you don't.

923
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,407
Well...

924
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:03,704
...none of us deserve to die,
then why is it...

925
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,965
...that you deserve to live, Molly?

926
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,172
You said it yourself...

927
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,550
...you don't.

928
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,640
Go!

929
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:25,938
Repeat, shots fired.
Requesting backup. 1026 Washington.

930
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:30,063
Hide and I'll distract him.
When you can, go.

931
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,657
Not done yet, Sam.

932
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,615
Where is she?

933
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,410
Where is she?!
-I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.

934
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,415
You're gonna have to kill me first.

935
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,792
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.

936
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,207
Death's after you too.

937
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,751
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.

938
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,513
Just think for a minute, all right?

939
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,265
You are not a killer.

940
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,260
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.

941
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:05,855
I don't wanna die yet either.

942
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,074
Heh. It's not your time yet.

943
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,247
Don't worry, Molly...

944
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,959
...I didn't kill him.

945
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:36,137
But I didn't need to, Molly...

946
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:41,309
...because Death
is gonna do that for me.

947
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,137
Doesn't mean I can't help it.

948
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,814
That's it.

949
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:32,735
Are you okay? What's going on?
-It's Peter. He has a gun.

950
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,655
Oh, my God.

951
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,746
You killed him.

952
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,623
It's Sam's turn.

953
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,181
Peter, just go.

954
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,768
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

955
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,103
Please.

956
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,222
I'm sorry, Molly.

957
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,144
But you just witnessed the murder
of a federal agent.

958
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:22,319
And I'm not gonna spend
the life I just earned in prison.

959
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,415
Molly, go! Go get help!

960
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,571
You son of a bitch!

961
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,828
Tell Candice I love her.

962
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,242
Peter.

963
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,354
It's gone. You killed him.

964
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,982
So does that mean I get Block's life?

965
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,485
Yeah.

966
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,070
I guess I do.

967
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,546
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

968
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,012
You're gonna make me sit in the middle?
-Uh-huh.

969
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,348
I'm like twice your size.
-Not really.

970
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,512
All right.
-Sit down.

971
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,023
I'll remove him.
-Fuck you. I'll remove myself.

972
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,399
Get off him!

973
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:00,810
Settle down!

974
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,855
Come on, Browning! Come on, you punk!
-Get off the plane!

975
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,490
Get off the plane. You don't understand!

976
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,366
Everybody just stay where you are.

977
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,282
What's all that about?
-I have no idea.

978
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:17,577
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be pulling away from the gate as-</i>

979
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,757
Here we go.

01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,507
<i>The cabin lights
have been dimmed for takeoff</i>

981
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,288
<i>With curiosity</i>

982
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,168
<i>Dust in the wind</i>

983
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:13,633
Sorry about that.

984
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,221
Oh, excuse me.

985
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:23,063
Those passengers who got off the plane
earlier, what was that all about?

986
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,899
A kid had
a panic attack and wanted off the plane.

987
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,151
Said he had some kind of vision.

988
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,365
No.

989
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,576
Oh, my God!

990
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,537
Sam.

991
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,312
I got you!

992
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,447
Sam!
-Molly, hold on!

993
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,075
No!

994
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,787
No!

995
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,687
Nice of you to come, Nathan.

996
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,103
I know Roy
wasn't the easiest guy to work with.

997
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,564
You know.

998
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,858
I still can't believe he's gone, though.

999
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,493
Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

1000
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,904
I guess it was for the best.

1001
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,405
What do you mean?

1002
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,746
Company did an autopsy
for insurance purposes.

1003
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,004
Turns out Roy had an enlarged
blood vessel in his brain so big...

1004
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,416
...it was about to burst.
They said he'd be dead any day now.
