2
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:53,442
11:55... almost midnight.

3
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,753
Enough time for one more story,

4
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,466
one more story before twelve.

5
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,160
Just to keep us warm.

6
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:12,072
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

7
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:18,234
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April,

8
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,087
out on the waters
around Spivey Point,

9
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:26,293
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,064
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

11
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,567
<i>For a moment,
they could see nothing,</i>

12
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:36,870
<i>not a foot ahead of them.</i>

13
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,606
Then they saw a light.

14
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:46,112
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore,

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,883
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

16
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:55,455
<i>They steered a course
toward the light,</i>

17
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:59,892
<i>but it was a campfire
like this one.</i>

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,052
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

19
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:06,544
The hull sheared in two.

20
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,969
The mast snapped like a twig,

21
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:14,107
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

22
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,144
<i>At the bottom of the sea</i>

23
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:21,881
<i>lay the Elizabeth Dane
with her crew,</i>

24
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:25,385
<i>their lungs filled
with salt water,</i>

25
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:30,056
<i>their eyes open and staring
into the darkness.</i>

26
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:34,060
<i>And above,
as suddenly as it had come,</i>

27
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:38,431
<i>the fog lifted, receded
back across the ocean,</i>

28
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,034
<i>and never came again.</i>

29
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:45,237
But it is told by the fishermen

30
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:48,240
and their fathers
and grandfathers

31
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:52,545
that when the fog
returns to Antonio Bay,

32
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,882
the men at the bottom of the sea,

33
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,285
out in the water by Spivey Point,

34
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:05,091
will rise up and search
for the campfire

35
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,831
<i>that led them to their
dark and icy death.</i>

36
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,668
Twelve o' clock,

37
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:19,805
the 21st of April.

38
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>It's twelve midnight,</i>

39
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,198
<i>and we just started
the little witching hour.</i>

40
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,833
<i>This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.</i>

41
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:25,204
<i>And I'll be here right
up until about 1:00.</i>

42
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,452
<i>I'm all through, father.</i>

43
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:56,553
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

44
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,924
Uh... I won't need you until
4:00 tomorrow, Bennett.

45
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,058
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:07,589
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

47
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,432
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

48
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:15,537
Why don't you come in at,
uh, 6:00

49
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,476
instead of 4:00 tomorrow?

50
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,077
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:35,507
Uh, Bennett?
Eh, Bennett?

52
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:40,145
Bennett?

53
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,015
Hello?

54
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:01,266
Uh...

55
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,382
<i>It's 59 degrees outside.</i>

56
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,170
<i>And let me be the first to wish
Antonio Bay a Happy Birthday.</i>

57
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:56,639
<i>We're one hundred years old today.</i>

58
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,309
<i>The weatherman's been
trying to spoil it for us.</i>

59
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,644
<i>He says we may be in
for some rain tonight.</i>

60
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,182
<i>But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.</i>

61
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,118
<i>I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.</i>

62
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,822
<i>Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...</i>

63
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,523
<i>just to see if he's right.</i>

64
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,392
<i>And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.</i>

65
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,163
<i>Uh, there's a cutter run</i>

66
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:21,664
<i>aground over here on
the east bay, over.</i>

67
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:25,100
Global 1x5.

68
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:26,669
<i>It's the Lady Belle Pacific,</i>

69
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,739
<i>serial number 024KL596.
Over.</i>

70
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,694
<i>Global 1x5, the Lady Belle
Pacific is sea worthy,</i>

71
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:35,795
<i>no major damage.</i>

72
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,695
<i>Why don't you send
a tow on over here,</i>

73
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:40,232
<i>about a quarter mile
above the boatel. Over.</i>

74
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,957
<i>This is K-A-B,
Antonio Bay, California.</i>

75
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,627
<i>Six minutes after midnight.</i>

76
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:47,799
<i>Haven't heard from
the weatherman yet,</i>

77
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
<i>so I can't say for sure
about that rain,</i>

78
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,886
<i>but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.</i>

79
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,292
<i>I'm Stevie Wayne.</i>

80
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,893
<i>And if you don't have
anything to do right now,</i>

81
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,429
<i>I'll be here playing music all
through the witching hour.</i>

82
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,987
<i>Even if you do have
something to do,</i>

83
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,888
<i>keep me turned on for a while,</i>

84
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,823
<i>and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.</i>

85
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:16,324
OK!

86
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:37,779
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,881
- How far you going?
- Other side of town.

88
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,584
That's close enough.

89
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,855
- Make it?
- Yeah. Thank you.

90
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,734
- Sip?
- Thanks.

91
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,677
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

92
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,548
I just really want to be careful.

93
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,049
Can I ask you something?

94
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,584
- Sure.
- Are you weird?

95
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,055
Yes, I am.

96
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,556
Yes, I am weird.

97
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:21,556
- You are weird. You're weird.
- Yes.

98
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,091
Thank God you're weird.

99
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:26,061
The last one I had was so normal,
it was disgusting.

100
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:27,696
He picked me up in Santa Barbara.

101
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,798
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

102
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:32,701
Oh, yeah. I thought you
never hitchhiked before.

103
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,639
Not before last week.

104
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,244
You're my...

105
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:43,045
thirteenth ride.

106
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:46,014
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

107
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,951
Heh.
We'll see.

108
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,121
Look out!
Ohh!

109
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:01,296
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

110
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,864
- You're sure?
- I'm fine. I think so.

111
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,966
What the hell was...

112
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,044
<i>It's exactly twelve
minutes after midnight,</i>

113
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:15,845
<i>and this is Stevie Wayne...</i>

114
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,214
Let's get out of here.

115
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:22,684
<i>I'm high tonight in the K-A-B
lighthouse on Spivey Point.</i>

116
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:25,353
<i>And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st.</i>

117
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:27,822
<i>And a Happy Birthday
for Antonio Bay.</i>

118
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,725
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

119
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:33,662
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep,

120
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,731
well, stay up with me,

121
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,636
and I'll figure out some
way to keep you occupied.

122
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:43,571
Or not.

123
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,245
K-A-B.

124
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,247
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

125
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,948
Hi, Dan.
What have you got?

126
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:54,749
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely,

127
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,297
if there's anything
I can do about it.

128
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,653
<i>Never lonely, Dan.</i>

129
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,389
<i>I thought you were
off work at 8:00.</i>

130
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,190
I changed shifts so I can make
it to the big party tonight.

131
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:03,291
Will you be there?

132
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:06,652
Well... until I can
talk someone else

133
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:09,598
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

134
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,300
And "it" means day and night.

135
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,801
<i>Too much work.</i>

136
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,702
Well, that's what I get
for owning a station.

137
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,130
And if you don't tell me why you
called in about 15 seconds,

138
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,341
I'm gonna have to hang up on you.

139
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:19,663
You want something to talk about?

140
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:20,742
<i>Anything.</i>

141
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,079
I've got a position on
a trawler about, ooh...

142
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:26,383
<i>15 Miles out,
called The Sea Grass.</i>

143
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,784
And I've got something
on my scope...

144
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,653
appears to be a fog bank.

145
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,154
Oh, it's about 25 Miles out,

146
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,561
moving in their direction.

147
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:35,924
Thanks, Dan.

148
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,494
That's worth about 10 seconds.

149
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,495
<i>I'm on the air. Bye.</i>

150
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,570
Ahoy, maties.
This is K-A-B, Antonio Bay.

151
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:52,524
Stevie Wayne here beaming
a signal across the sea.

152
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,445
<i>To the men of The Sea Grass,</i>

153
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,646
<i>15 Miles out tonight,
a warm hello,</i>

154
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,350
<i>and keep a watch out
for that fog bank</i>

155
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:01,851
<i>heading in from the east.</i>

156
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:06,220
<i>In the meantime, relax with
me while I play this song</i>

157
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:09,924
<i>from the Coupe de Villes...
dedicated just to you.</i>

158
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,926
Boy, would I like to meet her.

159
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,995
Heh. I saw her at a
grocery store one day.

160
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:14,696
And?

161
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,831
- You would like to meet her.
- She's crazy.

162
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,001
There's no fog bank out there.

163
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:20,702
<i>What do you know about her?</i>

164
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,771
<i>She owns that lighthouse.
I know that.</i>

165
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,473
Her son plays little league
with my kid brother.

166
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,607
She's a mother?

167
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,676
Ha ha. I thought you
were happily married.

168
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:31,580
- Huh. Not that happy.
- There's no fog bank out there.

169
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:41,522
Hey.
There's a fog bank out there.

170
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:46,394
All right.
I'm drunk enough.

171
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,931
Let's go back.

172
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:50,232
All right, all right.

173
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,239
Al, come here.

174
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,940
- Just give him a hand.
- Come here.

175
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:12,955
What was that?

176
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:43,152
Come here.

177
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,756
What was that?

178
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,433
It's the generator.

179
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,269
Wha... wha... wha...

180
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,941
Al.

181
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:24,693
It's gone.

182
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,795
Hey, there was just
a ship out there.

183
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,432
Al, listen.

184
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,733
Nothing.

185
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,968
- Listen.
- Who's there?

186
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:46,381
Who is that?

187
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:02,897
Unh!

188
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:06,000
Al!
Aah!

189
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,171
Arrrrgh!

190
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,274
Aaah!

191
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,564
Al, it's right beside us.

192
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,937
It's big, Al.
It's a ship.

193
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,440
It's a big ship!

194
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:50,745
What happened?
Did you get wet?

195
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,033
It's 12:43...

196
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:17,338
and I've got four in a row for
you right here on K-A-B.

197
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,644
Nothing but water, Stevie.

198
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:01,483
But it sure beats Chicago.

199
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,057
K-A-B.

200
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,769
I like what you said

201
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,218
but for your information,
you lied.

202
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,629
The fog bank has moved due west

203
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:17,032
<i>and probably missed
the ship entirely.</i>

204
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,303
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

205
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:22,004
I've got a wind
blowing due east.

206
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:24,572
Now, what kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

207
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,808
<i>You got me.</i>

208
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,209
I'm not so sure I want you.

209
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,245
You're just a voice on the phone.

210
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,746
<i>And you're just a voice on the
radio. We'd make a perfect couple.</i>

211
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,883
<i>You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.</i>

212
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,053
Sorry, Dan.

213
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,557
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

214
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,526
<i>OK, mystery lady.</i>

215
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:46,427
Good night.

216
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:47,195
<i>Good night.</i>

217
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:10,918
Not bad.

218
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,554
I started a week ago
in San Diego,

219
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:16,557
right up the coast,
5 drawings a day.

220
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,296
It'll probably take me a
month to get to Vancouver,

221
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,763
and if I can sell 'em for 5
bucks apiece, I'll be rich.

222
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:23,897
Yeah.

223
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:28,102
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

224
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,172
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth.

225
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,774
- Nick.
- Hello, Nick.

226
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,244
Hi.

227
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,413
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

228
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:41,882
Wait a minute. You said,
"can I ask you something?"

229
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,619
Well, something to me means one
thing. San Diego is two things.

230
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:46,654
OK.

231
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,093
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

232
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,029
Never a chance to do
anything I wanna do.

233
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:57,197
Aww.

234
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,867
Aww.

235
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,470
What do you want to do?

236
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:04,376
I don't know.

237
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,777
That's OK.
Me neither.

238
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:11,880
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

239
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:15,250
Uh-uh.
The drawing's free.

240
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,610
It's 1:00, straight up,</i>

241
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,611
<i>the end of the witching hour</i>

242
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,813
<i>and time for me to sign off.</i>

243
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:27,457
<i>So until tomorrow night,
at six P.M.,</i>

244
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,941
<i>when K-A-B comes back on the air,</i>

245
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,560
<i>this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light,</i>

246
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:35,230
<i>hoping you have a
nice rest of the night.</i>

247
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:36,817
Hey, mom!
Hey, mom!

248
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:40,453
<i>Mom!</i>

249
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,491
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

250
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:47,495
Andy...
I love you,

251
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,531
but sometimes you're a real pain.

252
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,859
Sure, mom, but look it.
First, it was a gold coin,

253
00:26:53,935 --> 00:26:56,490
and then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

254
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:00,307
- This is one of those times.
- Uh-huh, but look at it, mom.

255
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:07,848
Good morning, Andrew. Did you
have a nice time last night?

256
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,852
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

257
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,322
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

258
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,858
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have a
stomach pounder and a coke?

259
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,994
- After lunch.
- OK.

260
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:22,630
I'm gonna go
look for another one.

261
00:27:22,697 --> 00:27:24,965
Maybe this time I can
get the gold coin.

262
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,427
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

263
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:54,114
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

264
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,196
- That's the last I saw of him.
- Al said 7:30, right here.

265
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,265
Well, you know Al.
If I were you, I'd give myself...

266
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,169
<i>Did you call the
coast guard, Hank?</i>

267
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,771
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

268
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:04,171
- They're still out there...
<i>- No, he wouldn't do that.</i>

269
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:05,338
He'd do anything.

270
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:07,508
<i>Al and I got drunk so many times
together, I can't count 'em all,</i>

271
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:10,378
<i>but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.</i>

272
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:13,747
<i>He's too good a sailor to stay out there
all night and not let somebody know.</i>

273
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:16,850
- You sound like his wife.
<i>- Just his friend.</i>

274
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:19,420
- You worry too much, Nick.
- Yeah.

275
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:25,116
- Where are we going?
- I'm going to talk Ashcroft

276
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,728
into taking out his boat and
looking for the Sea Grass.

277
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:31,132
- Who's Ashcroft?
- Someone who owes me a favor.

278
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,934
Can I come along?

279
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:35,836
I thought you had to
move on to Vancouver?

280
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:38,606
- Eventually.
- Yeah.

281
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:46,348
<i>The sheriff will
drive his own car.</i>

282
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,241
The mayor and his wife

283
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,984
<i>are to be picked up at 6:45 and
brought to the mayor's box.</i>

284
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:55,556
<i>Then we'll have speeches by</i>
the mayor, the sheriff, and me.

285
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:57,892
- Oh, do you have my notes?
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,429
<i>Then we will pass out the candles
and begin the procession.</i>

287
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,000
<i>Then I will go home
and pass out.</i>

288
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,901
<i>I'm almost afraid to look.</i>

289
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:08,568
<i>Well...</i>

290
00:29:08,637 --> 00:29:11,471
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

291
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,542
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
- A work of art.

292
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:18,112
Sandy, just be civil to
me for another five hours.

293
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,536
That's all I ask.

294
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,374
<i>Let's see now. Oh, the candles.</i>

295
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,351
Did you order the candles?
What a thought, a candlelight

296
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,954
- procession with no candles.
- All taken care of.

297
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:28,757
And the promotional material...

298
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:31,792
- Did you get that over to Stevie?
- Signed, sealed, and delivered.

299
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,795
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times,

300
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,100
- but you do keep me together.
- Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

301
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:11,199
Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today,</i>

302
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:15,169
<i>The Sea Grass had not responded
to radio communication.</i>

303
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:18,872
<i>The coast guard has begun a
sweep South from Watley,</i>

304
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,943
<i>around Arcom Reef, and should
be in the area of Spivey Point</i>

305
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:25,146
<i>in approximately one hour.</i>

306
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:28,283
<i>Repeating this bulletin
from the coast guard,</i>

307
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,520
<i>be on the look out for the
Sea Grass, a 30-foot trawler,</i>

308
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:36,690
<i>last seen approximately 15
Miles east of Spivey Point.</i>

309
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,762
<i>If you sight this vessel, please
notify the coast guard immediately.</i>

310
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:56,244
- Nick, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

311
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:00,048
- Is it always like this?
- It's always different.

312
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:04,418
- You're worried, aren't you?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:06,454
She can get real mean.

314
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:08,089
<i>There.</i>

315
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:13,326
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

316
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,864
Oh, yeah.

317
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:22,369
<i>Well, if I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.</i>

318
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,705
<i>- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Too excited?</i>

319
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:27,641
No. Al went out on his boat last
night and didn't come home.

320
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,088
<i>- He still isn't back.</i>
- Mrs. Williams!

321
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:31,481
<i>I called the coast guard,
and they said,</i>

322
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,582
<i>"oh, he might have
had engine trouble."</i>

323
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:34,623
They said not to worry.

324
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,620
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

325
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:38,789
<i>Maybe you ought to go home.</i>

326
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,672
That's the last place
I want to go.

327
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:43,559
<i>My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night</i>

328
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
<i>and didn't stop until
6:00 this morning.</i>

329
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:46,560
What happened?

330
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,929
He was pointed toward
the ocean and growling.

331
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,242
What does that tell you?

332
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:53,114
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

333
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:56,203
I heard the church bells at midnight
as I started to drift off to sleep,

334
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:59,273
and suddenly, my car alarm went
off for absolutely no reason.

335
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:00,374
<i>- Really?</i>
- Uh-huh.

336
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:03,820
Woke up the whole block.
This town sits around for 100 years

337
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:06,847
and nothing happens, and then one
night, the whole place falls apart.

338
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:08,216
<i>Al?</i>

339
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,185
Take this line, too.

340
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,186

341
00:32:13,254 --> 00:32:15,489
<i>Tommy!
Dick!</i>

342
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,696
<i>Cabin and steering
house are empty.</i>

343
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,234
Maybe somebody picked them up.

344
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:30,771
- There's water in the generator.
- But the deck is as dry as a bone.

345
00:32:57,265 --> 00:33:00,500
There you have it.
My next project: Restoration</i>

346
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:03,536
<i>of the Morgantown Road Cemetery.
It's historical.</i>

347
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:05,473
- Our ancestors are buried here.
- It's gonna cost a lot.

348
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,876
Come on, Sandy. So? This town
should be proud of its past.

349
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:13,046
But trying to get anyone involved in
community affairs is like pulling teeth.

350
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,779
<i>Better get the estimates ready for
the council meeting next month.</i>

351
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:16,884
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

352
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:19,220
Sandy, you're the only person
I know who can make

353
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,889
"yes, ma'am" sound like
"screw you."

354
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,990
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:25,159
Now, if we'll just say a little prayer
asking that he not be in his cups.

356
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:34,154
<i>Not a good sign.</i>

357
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:40,207
<i>Father Malone?
Father Malone!</i>

358
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,649
- Hello!
- Another bad sign.

359
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:51,886
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

360
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,873
Father Malone!

361
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:19,079
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

362
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:21,581
- Mrs. Williams...
- Are you all right?

363
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,818
I have something to show you.

364
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:31,759
"December 9.

365
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:36,063
"Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

366
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,131
"He stood in the shadows

367
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,369
"to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

368
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:44,805
"What a vile disease this is.

369
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:48,976
"He is a rich man
with a cursed condition,

370
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:53,480
"but this does not prevent him from
trying to better his situation

371
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,949
and that of his comrades
at the colony."

372
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:19,041
Every single gauge is broken.

373
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,611
- All the glass is shattered.
- Remind you of something?

374
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:25,113
- Last night.
- Your truck.

375
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,615
Yeah.
Yeah.

376
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,123
The thermometer's broken.

377
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,327
The Mercury's stuck at 20 degrees.

378
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,664
There's no water got in here,

379
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,501
but something awful cold did.

380
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:51,571
"December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

381
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,541
"He wants to move off
Tanzier Island

382
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:58,479
"and relocate the entire
colony just north of here.

383
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,481
"He has purchased a clipper ship

384
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:04,652
"called the <i>Elizabeth Dane.</i>

385
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,920

"I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion

388
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:18,365
"toward this poor man with
my revulsion at the thought

389
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,435
of a leper colony
only a mile distant."

390
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,622
It's rusted to the wall.

391
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,427
It was on.

392
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:58,105
- They drank a lot of beer last night.
- Every night.

393
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,407
What's it like?

394
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,544
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning...

395
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:04,715
I mean fishing.

396
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,849
You fish.

397
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,486
The only thing I know about
fishing is you use a lot of worms.

398
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:13,854
Hmm.

399
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:16,390
Salt water.

400
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,528
She was clean 2 nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

401
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,297
And now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

402
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:30,203
"April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

403
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,873
"From midnight until 1:00,

404
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:36,676
"we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

405
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:41,181
<i>"I tell myself that Blake's gold
will allow the church to be built</i>

406
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:44,117
"and our small settlement
to become a township,

407
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:47,387
"but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel

408
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:50,690
being an accomplice to murder."

409
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,496
Now what?

410
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:59,599
Wait for the coast guard.

411
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:07,340
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

412
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,244
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

413
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:12,645
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking.

414
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:15,548
- The weirdo at the door last night.
- That isn't you.

415
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:17,150
I'm not so sure.

416
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:21,555
Things seem to happen to me.
I'm bad luck.

417
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:26,660
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

418
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:29,863
I don't believe in anything much.

419
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:34,768
Something did happen once.

420
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:39,673
My father was a fisherman.

421
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,777
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

422
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:48,481
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

423
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:51,920
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

424
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:55,322
He looked to windward

425
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:58,326
and saw a brig under shortsail

426
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,361
heading right for him.

427
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:07,234
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

428
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:11,905
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

429
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,375
My dad and two of his hands,

430
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:19,079
they boarded the brig...
the <i>Resa Jane.</i>

431
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:21,916
No one was on board.

432
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:27,254
<i>There was food on the table...
and a hot, steaming cup of coffee.</i>

433
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:31,525
<i>But underneath, a tin cup
was rusted to the table.</i>

434
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:35,362
And then something caught
my father's eye.

435
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:41,168
<i>It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.</i>

436
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:45,004
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket

437
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:47,140
of his jacket, and zippered it up.

438
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:51,378
He came home,
told us the story.

439
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:54,414
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

440
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,084
<i>It was gone.</i>

441
00:39:59,853 --> 00:40:01,821
I think I'll go to
Vancouver now.

442
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,693
Aaah!

443
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,831
"April 21st.
The deed is done.

444
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,434
"Blake followed
our false fire on shore,

445
00:40:14,502 --> 00:40:17,671
"and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off Spivey Point.

446
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:20,774
"We were aided by
an unearthly fog

447
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:23,510
"that rolled in

448
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,847
"although God had no part
in our actions tonight.

449

"Blake's gold will be
recovered tomorrow,

<i>but may the lord forgive us
for what we have done."</i>

451
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:36,924
I couldn't read any further.

452
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,729
Your grandfather
had a way with words.

453
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:47,901
Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

454
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:50,804
We're honoring murderers.

00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:36,069
Father, where did you find this?

478
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:40,874
My grandfather hid
his sins in the walls.

479
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,977
- When did you find it?
- Last night...

480
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:47,614
<i>Just after midnight.
What difference does it make?</i>

481
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:50,484
That's the same time the
rest of the town fell apart.

482
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:53,355
Yes.

483
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:56,956
And the same time

484
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:01,428
the six conspirators met
one hundred years ago.

485
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:03,330
It's really getting late.

486
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,132
Uh, there's not much we can do

487
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,066
about any of this.
Are you going

488
00:44:07,134 --> 00:44:09,436
to give the benediction
tonight, father?

489
00:44:10,503 --> 00:44:12,739
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

490
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:17,510
- Do we take that as a "no"?
<i>- Maybe it's just as well.</i>

491
00:44:20,913 --> 00:44:22,782
We're leaving now, father.

492
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,484
Will you be all right?

493
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:30,056
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden

494
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:32,559
and ask him to just drop by.

495
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:36,563

511
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:46,165
Aah!

512
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,040
<i>Nine.</i>

513
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,816
<i>Every hour on the hour,</i>

514
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:04,884
<i>K-A-B news and weather.</i>

515
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:07,086
<i>Ten.</i>

516
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:09,355
<i>Every hour on the hour,</i>

517
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:12,125
<i>K-A-B news and weather.</i>

518
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:17,096
<i>End side two, K-A-B promos.</i>

519
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:31,108
How can a man drown and
not touch the water?

520
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:33,880
He had water in his lungs,

521
00:46:34,647 --> 00:46:36,049
salt water around his mouth,

522
00:46:36,116 --> 00:46:37,684
seaweed in his clothes.

523
00:46:39,152 --> 00:46:40,219
Unless...

524
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:44,891
You OK?

525
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,927
Did you see his eyes?

526
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:49,929
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

527
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:00,335
Andy, the telephone.

528
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,241
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

529
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,547
Hello?

530
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:09,549
Andy, where did you get
that driftwood?

531
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:11,950
I told you, mom, it was on
the beach this morning.

532
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,520
- Where?
<i>- By the rocks.</i>

533
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:14,954
What was it doing?

534
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:17,456
First it was a gold coin

535
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:19,192
and then it turned into the wood.

536
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:21,294
Andy, I want you to
stay away from the rocks.

537
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:22,362
Do you understand?

538
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,498
Don't pick up anything
else off the beach.

539
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:26,399
<i>It didn't belong to anybody.</i>

540
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:27,967
I know, honey. It's all right.

541
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:29,703
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else

542
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,838
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

543
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:33,373
<i>OK.</i>

544
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:35,542
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

545
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,244
<i>She just came in.</i>

546
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:41,114
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

547
00:47:42,181 --> 00:47:44,617
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

548
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:46,119
Oh, mom.

549
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:47,588
<i>Promise me.</i>

550
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:50,590
Oh, OK.

551
00:47:51,558 --> 00:47:53,092
I love you, Andy.

552
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,762
<i>Me, too, mom. Bye.</i>

553
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,423
Ahoy, maties.

554
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:26,827
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

555
00:48:27,495 --> 00:48:30,362
And K-A-B, Antonio Bay,
California,

556
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,864
is on the air.

557
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:34,968
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate

558
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:37,737
the 100th birthday of Antonio Bay.

559
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:41,374
So let's get down to business.

560
00:49:03,663 --> 00:49:05,564
What did your mother want, Andy?

561
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:06,765
Nothing.

562
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:09,068
Oh, it must have been something.

563
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:10,904
Mm, nothing.

564
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:12,839
Hey, Mrs. Kobritz,

565
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:15,074
what are those clouds out there?

566
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:23,832
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds

567
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:27,620
in each ocular orbit entering
into the cranial cavity.

568
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:30,389
<i>Also jagged lacerations
to the face...</i>

569
00:49:30,457 --> 00:49:32,091
Do you want to wait out front?

570
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,593
I'd rather wait with you.

571
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:34,994
OK.

572
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:36,929
Thorax has been crushed,

573
00:49:36,997 --> 00:49:39,200
and the lungs are
filled with fluid.

574
00:49:40,868 --> 00:49:42,201
Talk to you a minute?

575
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:43,569
Yeah.

576
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,342
- She gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

577
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:52,291
Did you talk to Simms?

578
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:53,346
I got him on the radio.

579
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:55,247
He's coming back from Bodega Bay.

580
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:56,749
What the hell happened out there?

581
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:58,385
There was rust all over everything.

582
00:49:58,652 --> 00:49:59,817
It was like the boat
had been out there

583
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:01,254
a long time, taking on water.

584
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:03,190
He was down below near the bunks.

585
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:05,925
Nick, his wounds are
covered with algae,

586
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:08,726
his lungs are full, and there's
silt under his fingernails.

587
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:12,562
I tell you, I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

588
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:13,766
Now he's lying in there
on the table

589
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:16,235
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

590
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:41,259
- Do you feel that?
<i>- I'll tell you what happens.</i>

591
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:44,762
- It just got cold in here.
<i>- You see, the water acts like ice.</i>

592
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:58,177
A whole body would take
a year to decompose,

593
00:50:58,245 --> 00:51:00,579
longer if it was down far enough,
cold enough.

594
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,114
But he was on the boat.

595
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:04,150
He was below decks.

596
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:05,484
No.

597
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,787
Dick Baxter died in the ocean.

598
00:51:23,837 --> 00:51:26,197
You remember last October,
those three kids that went diving

599
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:28,206
- for that old boat off the point?
- Yeah.

600
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:30,242
We got to 'em, they'd
been down for a week,

601
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,510
maybe ten days.

602
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:33,612
I swear to you right now,

603
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:35,547
he's been down longer.

604
00:51:40,988 --> 00:51:42,488
Aah! Nick!

605
00:52:58,298 --> 00:53:00,433
<i>And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship</i>

606
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,835
<i>upon our coast was, of course,</i>

607
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:05,171
<i>a tragedy to those
who were on the ship,</i>

608
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:09,442
<i>it still was the catalyst
that brought together</i>

609
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:11,944
<i>all of the people of
this wonderful area.</i>

610
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:13,645
<i>They came together,</i>

611
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:16,582
<i>they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay,</i>

612
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,319
<i>the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen</i>

613
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:22,822
<i>who sit on my left
and my right tonight.</i>

614
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:27,025
Kathy, the Coast Guard's
looking for them.

615
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,028
Now, they're gonna cover
the area pretty good,

616
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:32,465
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

617
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,334
I understand, sheriff.

618
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:36,969
Thank you.

619
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:41,140
I got to go. I'm up next.

620
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:46,712
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

621
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:53,450
It's funny...
but all I can think about is

622
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,522
my silly dog barking
all night and,

623
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:01,025
and me just,
just wishing Al would come home.

624
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:06,865
Now, we can't have the...

625
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:09,767
chairlady of the birthday
celebration in tears, can we?

626
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,870
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

627
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:14,205
Oh, I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

628
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,743
I appreciate all your help, Nick.

629
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,311
That's all right.

630
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,531
<i>I searched a long
time for this one.</i>

631
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:41,768
<i>I hope you remember it.</i>

632
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:48,574
<i>Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.</i>

633
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:51,643
<i>The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.</i>

634
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:53,812
<i>And we'll have that
candlelight procession</i>

635
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:55,214
<i>in about an hour.</i>

636
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:57,884
<i>So if you hurry,
you can still make it.</i>

637
00:54:58,351 --> 00:54:59,786
<i>The coast guard dropped me a note</i>

638
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,821
<i>saying they found the Sea Grass
earlier this afternoon,</i>

639
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:05,992
<i>but there's no further word
as to the condition of the ship</i>

640
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,094
<i>or the men on-board.</i>

641
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:11,397
<i>I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.</i>

642
00:55:12,064 --> 00:55:14,833
<i>Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.</i>

643
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:20,539
I'll be right back.

644
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:30,082
K-A-B.

645
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,850
Hello.
My name's Nick Castle.

646
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:33,785
You don't know me,
but <i>I'm one of the men</i>

647
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:35,387
<i>who found the Sea Grass
this afternoon.</i>

648
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:36,388
Oh, I'm sorry.

649
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:37,896
I really don't have
any further word.

650
00:55:37,957 --> 00:55:38,690
<i>I understand.</i>

651
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:41,759
That's not what I called about.
It's... uh, you just mentioned

652
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:43,830
something now on the
radio about the fog.

653
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:55,674
Well, this is going to
sound a little strange.

654
00:55:57,842 --> 00:56:00,912
<i>I saw the fog last night out
in the ocean in the distance.</i>

655
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:03,715
<i>It was... glowing.</i>

656
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:11,289
Well, what seemed to
be happening is

657
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:14,959
that the wind was moving due east,
and the fog just kept moving west.

658
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:16,863
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

659
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,331
Right now it doesn't.

660
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:20,332
<i>Something happened last night.</i>

661
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,261
At the same time that
fog was moving in,

662
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:25,437
this whole town went unglued.
Hold on.

663
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:32,411
I've got some more
birthday music for you

664
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:34,413
and a few other surprises.

665
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:37,182
<i>Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.</i>

666
00:56:37,784 --> 00:56:41,020
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

667
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:53,698
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

668
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:55,067
There's one other thing.

669
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:57,737
<i>It may have nothing to
do with the Sea Grass.</i>

670
00:56:58,105 --> 00:56:59,338
<i>Oh, anything.</i>

671
00:57:00,406 --> 00:57:04,109
My son found a piece of
driftwood this morning.

672
00:57:10,282 --> 00:57:12,418
Hey, hey, Mel.
How you doing?

673
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:16,186
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

674
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:18,124
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

675
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,792
Yeah.
I thought you were off tonight.

676
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:20,960
I love my job.

677
00:57:21,428 --> 00:57:22,028
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

678
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:24,397
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank

679
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:25,831
moving in the southeast there.

680
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:27,333
Where?

681
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,634
Oh, you'll see it. I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

682
00:57:30,703 --> 00:57:32,371
Yeah, Mel.
I'll see you.

683
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,247
Ah.

684
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:44,049
<i>There you are.</i>

685
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:55,861
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse

686
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:57,263
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

687
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:58,864
- Sure.
- Come on.

688
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:04,536
K-A-B.

689
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:05,537
<i>Hi, sweetheart!</i>

690
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:07,373
I thought you were celebrating.

691
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,208
I couldn't spend
an evening without you.

692
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:12,777
Well, I'm up in about 30
seconds. What's new?

693
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:14,347
<i>Another fog bank.</i>

694
00:58:15,214 --> 00:58:16,214
Where?

695
00:58:16,382 --> 00:58:18,484
<i>It's coming in off the
ocean from the southeast.</i>

696
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:20,186
It's heading inland.
It should be here

697
00:58:20,254 --> 00:58:22,355
at the weather station
in 5-10 minutes.

698
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:24,923
Dan, hold on.

699
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:28,427
I have a special weather bulletin.

700
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,928
The Tri-County Weather Station
reports a fog bank

701
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:33,432
moving southeast along the coast.

702
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,066
For whoever's interested,

703
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,903
<i>that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.</i>

704
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,471
<i>Repeating,</i>

705
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:42,374
<i>a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast</i>

706
00:58:42,442 --> 00:58:45,344
<i>toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.</i>

707
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,417
Dan, are you still there?

708
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:54,153
I'm still here.
Heh heh heh.

709
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:56,722
Hey, you, uh,
sound different tonight,

710
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,191
<i>uh, kind of intense.</i>

711
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:01,092
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

712
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,428
<i>Wait a minute.
I thought you told me</i>

713
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:03,896
<i>you didn't like to
talk on the telephone</i>

714
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:05,431
<i>because you talked
on the radio all day.</i>

715
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:06,765
Dan, where's the fog now?

716
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:09,802
Well, it should be right
outside my door now.

717
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:14,974
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

718
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:21,646
<i>I can see it.</i>

719
00:59:21,715 --> 00:59:23,916
Hey, now, what is the big deal?

720
00:59:23,983 --> 00:59:26,118
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

721
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:28,326
No. There's something
different about this fog, Dan.

722
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:29,321
It glows.

723
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:30,923
<i>Can't you see anything yet?</i>

724
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:34,426
Glows?
Oh, I get it.

725
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:36,629
You take something to
keep you going, right?

726
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:39,098
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

727
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:42,102
- Hey.
<i>- What?</i>

728
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:44,804
The lights went out.

729
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:47,941
Everything's going crazy.

730
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:51,176
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

731
00:59:51,244 --> 00:59:54,413
<i>- Dan, what is it?</i>
- What the hell's that?

732
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:56,548
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

733
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:58,651
What is it?
<i>What's happening?</i>

734
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,153
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

735
01:00:01,421 --> 01:00:02,389
<i>Dan, listen to me.</i>

736
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:05,657
Hold on, sweetheart.
I wanna check this out.

737
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:07,760
<i>Dan!</i>

738
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:10,396
<i>Dan, stay on the phone!</i>

739
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:24,977
This has got to be a joke.

740
01:00:30,383 --> 01:00:33,986
<i>Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart, playing a stupid joke.</i>

741
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:39,257
And whoever it is... they ain't
gonna like finding me home.

742
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:41,026
Dan, stay away from the door!

743
01:00:41,694 --> 01:00:43,228
<i>Dan!</i>

744
01:00:44,898 --> 01:00:47,866
<i>Dan!</i>

745
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,707
Hello?

746
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,477
Anybody here?

747
01:01:03,116 --> 01:01:05,187
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking

748
01:01:05,188 --> 01:01:07,188
this 100-year-old
business too seriously.

749
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:11,323
Dan!

750
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:16,161
Dan!

751
01:01:19,299 --> 01:01:21,666
Aaaah!

752
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:32,177
Dan.

753
01:02:00,674 --> 01:02:04,910
And so all of us living
here in Antonio Bay today

754
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:06,979
owe a great debt of gratitude

755
01:02:07,046 --> 01:02:09,448
to those men and women
a hundred years ago

756
01:02:09,716 --> 01:02:12,951
<i>who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow</i>

757
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:14,386
<i>into what it is today.</i>

758
01:02:14,554 --> 01:02:18,754
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

759
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:25,236
I have an urgent bulletin.

760
01:02:25,564 --> 01:02:29,068
Will sheriff David Simms please
contact K-A-B radio immediately?

761
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:32,371
The number is 555-2131.

762
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:34,039
This is an emergency.

763
01:02:36,342 --> 01:02:40,245
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

764
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:43,015
We have a vital,
thriving community.

765
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,217
And I say we have to
keep it that way.

766
01:02:48,688 --> 01:02:50,168
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

767
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:53,793
<i>Sheriff David Simms, please
contact K-A-B immediately.</i>

768
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,963
<i>555-2131.
This is an emergency.</i>

769
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:07,973
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

770
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:11,310
Hello?

771
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:14,313
Sheriff Simms?

772
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,860
And so, as we make our way to
the presentation of the statue,

773
01:03:24,195 --> 01:03:27,404
<i>I think we should all keep in mind
the significance of this night</i>

774
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:29,862
<i>for every citizen of Antonio Bay.</i>

775
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,647
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

776
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:25,349
<i>Single file. Don't push.
Take your time.</i>

777
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:40,165
Andy!

778
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:53,579
Start!

779
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:56,114
Please start!

780
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,054
<i>Why did all the lights go out?</i>

781
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:05,691
Oh, one of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

782
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,695
They usually take care
of these things right away.

783
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:12,898
I think it's kind of neat.

784
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:26,678
<i>Hello?</i>

785
01:05:28,147 --> 01:05:29,081
Hello?

786
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:42,760
What's that now?

787
01:05:59,445 --> 01:06:01,012
Start!

788
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,920
Andy!
Andy, get out of the house!

789
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:10,355
Mrs. Kobritz,
get him out of the house.

790
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:11,623
Please! Run!

791
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:14,526
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

792
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:16,061
Are your bedroom windows closed?

793
01:06:16,129 --> 01:06:17,462
I'll go see.

794
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:20,332
Hello?

795
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,673
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

796
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,676
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

797
01:06:31,744 --> 01:06:33,912
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

798
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:41,786
Wow!
Look at that!

799
01:06:42,054 --> 01:06:44,456
- Are your windows all closed?
- Yes, ma'am.

800
01:06:44,524 --> 01:06:46,025
I wonder about
your mother's bedroom.

801
01:06:58,137 --> 01:07:01,073
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

802
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,643
<i>Andy, run! Run!</i>

803
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:08,046
<i>Mrs. Kobritz, run!</i>

804
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:13,585
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

805
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:15,387
I think I should stay.

806
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:16,854
Right now. Right now.

807
01:07:16,922 --> 01:07:17,889
- Yes.
- Right now.

808
01:07:39,111 --> 01:07:40,078
Go to your room.

809
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:41,779
I want to see who it is.

810
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,081
No.

811
01:07:43,348 --> 01:07:45,117
<i>Can't I stay for 2 more seconds?</i>

812
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:50,922
<i>OK, OK, I'm going.</i>

813
01:08:04,703 --> 01:08:06,771
Mrs. Kobritz?

814
01:08:10,109 --> 01:08:11,809
Mrs. Kobritz?

815
01:08:16,849 --> 01:08:19,051
Please.
My son is trapped!

816
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:22,787
<i>887 White Beach Lane.</i>

817
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:25,724
<i>Someone get to 887
White Beach Lane.</i>

818
01:08:27,727 --> 01:08:29,561
Mrs. Kobritz?

819
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:41,274
<i>My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!</i>

820
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:50,182
<i>Please, someone.</i>

821
01:08:52,085 --> 01:08:53,818
<i>My son is trapped!</i>

822
01:08:55,254 --> 01:08:56,821
<i>877 White Beach Lane.</i>

823
01:09:02,495 --> 01:09:04,363
<i>Come on!
Get out of there, now!</i>

824
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:16,308
<i>Andy, run! Run!</i>

825
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,612
Come on!
Come on.

826
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:22,214
Go! Go!

827
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:36,060
Come on!

828
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:38,696
<i>Ease it, don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.</i>

829
01:09:39,532 --> 01:09:40,965
Oh, Jesus.

830
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:48,507
Come on, Beth!
Come on.

831
01:09:48,774 --> 01:09:51,175
Come on. Come on.
It'll go. It'll go. It'll go.

832
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:52,210
Nick!

833
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:53,711
<i>Reverse! Reverse!</i>

834
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:54,779
Come on!

835
01:10:01,954 --> 01:10:03,688
Come on, do it!
Do it!

836
01:10:27,946 --> 01:10:30,482
<i>...wait for the last 20 minutes.</i>

837
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:32,851
I think it's best we
call it a night here.

838
01:10:33,418 --> 01:10:36,188
Another 5 or 10 minutes, everyone
will have seen the statue.

839
01:10:36,255 --> 01:10:38,790
All right, but let's get 'em
through as quickly as we can.

840
01:10:38,857 --> 01:10:41,425
It'd probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

841
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,761
We can close up here.

842
01:10:42,828 --> 01:10:43,963
I should see it
through to the end.

843
01:10:43,968 --> 01:10:46,736
Mrs. Williams, there's
nothing more to do here.

844
01:10:46,799 --> 01:10:48,433
Let me take you home.

845
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:51,770
A little annoying,
but you're right.

846
01:10:52,137 --> 01:10:53,171
Would you please take me?

847
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:54,172
Yes, ma'am.

848
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,540
- I'll call you tomorrow, Kathy.
- OK, thank you.

849
01:11:01,647 --> 01:11:03,881
<i>Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.</i>

850
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:07,584
<i>I'm sorry that I didn't come
for you, that I wasn't there.</i>

851
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:10,822
Andy, please understand.

852
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:15,493
I have to stay here.

853
01:11:26,772 --> 01:11:30,209
The fog...
is moving inland

854
01:11:31,376 --> 01:11:32,982
<i>away from the beach</i>

855
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:37,483
<i>towards Antonio Bay.</i>

856
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:45,624
<i>It's over by the armory.</i>

857
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,793
<i>I can't remember
the name of the...</i>

858
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:51,029
<i>No, no...
I think it's Chestnut.</i>

859
01:11:56,635 --> 01:11:58,570
Feel like listening
to some music?

860
01:11:59,938 --> 01:12:01,206
Sure.

861
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:03,808
<i>It's moving faster now.</i>

862
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:05,343
<i>Up Regent Avenue.</i>

863
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,178
<i>Up to the end of Smallhouse Road.</i>

864
01:12:07,446 --> 01:12:08,746
What's that?

865
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:13,818
<i>It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.</i>

866
01:12:14,286 --> 01:12:15,720
<i>Broad street.</i>

867
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:19,291
<i>Clay Street.</i>

868
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:21,325
Nick!

869
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,285
<i>It's moving down 10th street.</i>

870
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:50,021
<i>Get inside and lock your doors.</i>

871
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:51,589
<i>Close your windows.</i>

872
01:12:51,657 --> 01:12:53,358
<i>There's something in the fog.</i>

873
01:13:00,398 --> 01:13:02,867
<i>If you're on the South
side of town, go north.</i>

874
01:13:03,035 --> 01:13:04,869
Stay away from the fog.

875
01:13:13,312 --> 01:13:17,282
<i>Richardsville pike up to Beacon
Hill is the only clear road.</i>

876
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,484
<i>Up to the church.</i>

877
01:13:19,952 --> 01:13:22,721
<i>If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.</i>

878
01:13:30,496 --> 01:13:32,797
<i>Now the junction
at 101 is cut off.</i>

879
01:13:33,265 --> 01:13:36,601
<i>If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.</i>

880
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:38,736
<i>It's the only place left to go.</i>

881
01:13:39,004 --> 01:13:41,505
<i>Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.</i>

882
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:50,514
<i>It cut us off!</i>

883
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:52,085
- Where is it?
- Right behind us in the driveway.

884
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,250
Quick, inside.

885
01:13:57,055 --> 01:13:57,889
<i>Come on.</i>

886
01:13:58,557 --> 01:13:59,824
<i>Hurry.</i>

887
01:14:01,459 --> 01:14:02,394
<i>Father?</i>

888
01:14:02,461 --> 01:14:04,228
Is there a basement
or cellar in here?

889
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:06,163
- We can't hide any longer.
- We have to try!

890
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,466
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

891
01:14:12,538 --> 01:14:14,306
Is there a basement
or cellar here, Father?

892
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:16,008
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

893
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:17,875
Come on.
Hurry.

894
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:19,778
Come on.
Give me that.

895
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:51,175
The fog is sweeping inland.

896
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:55,513
<i>It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.</i>

897
01:15:20,539 --> 01:15:21,773
Blake and his men
have come for us.

898
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:23,574
- Who's Blake?
- Oh, it's in the journal.

899
01:15:23,742 --> 01:15:25,743
- What journal?
- I don't know.

900
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:27,367
- Father, where's the journal?
- What are you talking about?

901
01:15:27,372 --> 01:15:28,589
- What?
- Where's the journal?

902
01:15:28,614 --> 01:15:29,948
It's... It's in there.

903
01:15:37,155 --> 01:15:38,156
Over by the window?

904
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,591
- It can do us no good now.
- It's all we've got.

905
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:42,960
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

906
01:15:43,028 --> 01:15:45,229
Get back.
Shut the door.

907
01:16:25,404 --> 01:16:28,004
- "Six must die." That was on the...
- The three men on the <i>Sea Grass.</i>

908
01:16:28,074 --> 01:16:29,915
- And the weatherman is four.
<i>- Mrs. Kobritz.</i>

909
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:32,518
- Yeah, five.
- And one of us makes six.

910
01:16:32,578 --> 01:16:33,978
That's what they want.
They've come back

911
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:35,747
for the six original conspirators.

912
01:16:35,815 --> 01:16:37,081
There must be something in here!

913
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:39,717
- It's me they want. I am the!
- Why would they want you?

914
01:16:39,785 --> 01:16:41,352
Wait, father.
You didn't read us this.

915
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,354
Look. "Were it possible
to raise the dead,

916
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,790
<i>"I would return Blake's
fortune to him intact,</i>

917
01:16:45,858 --> 01:16:48,560
<i>"save the money spent on
these walls that hide it."</i>

918
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:50,395
"My fellow conspirators believe

919
01:16:50,463 --> 01:16:53,130
"that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen from them,

920
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:55,299
"when in fact, I am the thief,

921
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:58,002
and God's temple is
the tomb of gold."

922
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,838
"I am the thief, and God's
temple is the tomb..."

923
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:05,443
Now, wait. Get...
get rid of that.

924
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,211
<i>Nick!</i>

925
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:09,614
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

926
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:33,103
- Give me a hand.
- Andy, stay right there.

927
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,074
Nick.

928
01:17:58,196 --> 01:17:59,263
<i>The gold.</i>

929
01:18:18,717 --> 01:18:20,885
He melted down the gold into this.

930
01:18:22,921 --> 01:18:23,955
Aah!

931
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,050
<i>Somebody help her!</i>

932
01:18:34,766 --> 01:18:36,266
<i>Nick, no!</i>

933
01:18:39,104 --> 01:18:41,737
Don't go in there!

934
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:25,216
Blake, I have your gold.

935
01:19:33,057 --> 01:19:34,091
Blake?

936
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:13,598
This is your gold, Blake.

937
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:17,301
<i>My grandfather stole
it from you.</i>

938
01:20:19,571 --> 01:20:21,640
I'm the one who must
answer for it.

939
01:20:35,653 --> 01:20:37,622
I'm the sixth conspirator.

940
01:20:40,358 --> 01:20:42,260
I'm father Malone.

941
01:20:43,728 --> 01:20:45,363
Take me.

942
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:43,120
Father Malone!

943
01:24:03,528 --> 01:24:04,562
Look.

944
01:24:14,972 --> 01:24:16,473
It's going away.

945
01:24:52,576 --> 01:24:55,379
<i>I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.</i>

946
01:24:56,447 --> 01:25:00,685
Something came out of the fog
and tried to destroy us.

947
01:25:02,453 --> 01:25:04,521
In one moment, it vanished.

948
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:07,593
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare

949
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,032
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds,

950
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:15,109
it could come again.

951
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,403
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice,

952
01:25:20,271 --> 01:25:23,341
look across the water
into the darkness.

953
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:27,511
Look for the fog.

954
01:25:57,141 --> 01:25:59,143
Why not six, Blake?

955
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:03,647
Why not me?
