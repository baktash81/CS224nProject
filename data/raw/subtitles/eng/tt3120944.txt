2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,443
<i>Lord, I have waited for
you to lead us out of Babylon,</i>

3
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:40,309
<i>for! was just a boy
when! came here.</i>

4
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:46,051
<i>The generation which
offended you has passed</i> away,

5
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,788
and now their children's
children yearn to see a home

6
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,327
they have never known.

7
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,335
You have spoken through
your prophet, Jeremiah,

8
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:02,396
"When 70 years are
completed for Babylon,

9
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:08,446
"I will come to you
and fulfill my gracious promise

10
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:15,618
and bring you back
to this land."

11
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,748
My heart
grows with excitement

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,761
that now
that time has come.

13
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:48,083
An old man who comes
unbidden is often a fool.

14
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,179
And less often
come as assassins.

15
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,087
Perhaps a foolish assassin.

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,561
Forgive us, my king.

17
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,293
<i>Do you know
whom you address?</i>

18
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,528
He is the king of Babylon,

19
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,401
ruler of the four
quarters of the earth,

20
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,443
Kurus,
in the old Persian tongue.

21
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,206
<i>He has seized
by might-of-arms</i>

22
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:21,274
the birthright which would
otherwise have been denied him.

23
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,186
He is Cyrus the Great.

24
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,284
Leave us.

25
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,362
Who are you, old man?

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,173
I am Daniel
of the tribe of Benjamin,

27
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:50,374
made captive nearly 70 years ago
by Nebuchadnezzar.

28
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,314
My king,
I have heard of this man.

29
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,219
He served Darius well after he
captured the city in your name.

30
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,417
It is said he spent
a night in the lions den.

31
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,190
<i>The beasts
would not touch him.</i>

32
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,696
Is this true?

33
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,790
It is.

34
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,297
I know who you are now.
Tell me why you're here.

35
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,739
I seek
to tell you a story,

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,606
a tale of four kings:

37
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,774
one great, one foolish,
one who has been deceived,

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,286
and one who is destined
to be regarded as wise

39
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,753
through all the ages
of the world to come.

40
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,757
Stories from
your imagination?

41
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:39,491
No, king, for I will
speak only the truth,

42
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,533
and if you would
not wish to hear it,

43
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,764
you must bid me
speak nothing.

44
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,737
Come.

45
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,674
You will give us
entertainment while we eat.

46
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,641
Please.

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,372
My king, we're expected
in Babylon this evening.

48
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,410
The palace will be there
in the morning.

49
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,455
As you wish.

50
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,278
I cannot, oh king.

51
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,509
<i>which is prepared
according to their rituals.</i>

52
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,387
<i>To do otherwise, even
from the hand of the king,</i>

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,289
is to defile themselves.

54
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,558
<i>You promised me
a tale, four, in fact.</i>

55
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,428
I delayed my journey
to listen.

56
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,023
I will hear them now.

57
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,530
So be it, my lord.

58
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,300
The first king I will speak of
is Nebuchadnezzar,

59
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,704
King of Babylon.

60
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,572
When I was just a boy,

61
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,612
he threw down
the Assyrian empire,

62
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,841
my people's ancient nemesis,

63
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:09,977
but the destruction of Israel's
enemies brought us no relief

64
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,717
because in the 3rd year
of Nebuchadnezzar's reign,

65
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:18,728
he turned his gaze upon
Jerusalem and besieged it,

66
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,391
and the Lord delivered
the king of Judea into his hand

67
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,868
along with all of his officers,
nobles, and administrators.

68
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,748
<i>When the exiles
arrived in Babylon,</i>

69
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,342
<i>Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz,
his chief eunuch,</i>

70
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,410
to select some
of the Israelites

71
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,717
<i>from the royal family
and nobility,</i>

72
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,781
<i>young men without
any physical defect</i>

73
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,794
<i>and showing aptitude
for every kind of teaming,</i>

74
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,490
<i>one of whom was myself.</i>

75
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:04,005
<i>III</i>

76
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,587
O Lord...

77
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:31,066
Jerusalem has sinned greatly.

78
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,797
Like a widow is she.

79
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,101
Once great
among the nations,

80
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:42,540
a queen among the people,
has become a slave

81
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:49,075
and her children
captive before the foe.

82
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,554
My eyes overflow with tears,

83
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,625
for you, Lord,
are righteous,

84
00:06:54,714 --> 00:07:00,858
yet we rebelled
against your command.

85
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,696
Comfort me, O Lord.

86
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:11,106
Comfort me and my brothers,
and restore our spirit.

87
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,723
As do I.

88
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,128
<i>I</i> feel that we shall
never see her again.

89
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,191
Have faith, my brothers.

90
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,663
<i>I have only begun my studies,</i>

91
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,137
but here...

92
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,200
the prophet, Jeremiah,
son of Hilkiah,

93
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,071
has written that we shall
serve the king of Babylon

94
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,739
for 70 years...

95
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,511
Seventy years
is a long time.

96
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,176
<i>As punishment for our sins.</i>

97
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,450
we would be very old.

98
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,686
Very old, indeed.

99
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,026
<i>You are
summoned for your meal.</i>

100
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,464
and leave the rest
of our people behind?

101
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,802
Yes, look at
who they've taken.

102
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,205
The scholars, the princes,
our military leaders,

103
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,806
<i>and our families.</i>

104
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,177
You take away the leaders,

105
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,772
and the rest
can easily be governed.

106
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,483
and our clothes
so we'll look like them.

107
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,953
We need to make
each other a promise,

108
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,890
never to become like them.

109
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,987
My brothers,
such a promise is worthless,

110
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,191
for we are but men.

111
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,735
What we need to promise
is to always love our God

112
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,499
and be obedient to him,

113
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,203
and in so doing, what we become
on the outside will not matter.

114
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,535
Set it here.

115
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,881
Lord Steward,
please allow me to as k.

116
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,286
<i>What is this meat?</i>

117
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,584
Where is it from,
and how was it slaughtered?

118
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,822
The cattle
are from the king's herd.

119
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,228
They are fattened
along the river

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,197
and strangled before
the altars of Marduk

121
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,701
<i>before their?esh
is carried to the kitchens.</i>

122
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,863
<i>The swine are
from the king's pens.</i>

123
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,906
<i>They are fed on choice food,</i>

124
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,603
and it is rumored the king's
executioner laces their feet

125
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,839
with the entrails
of his victims,

126
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,849
<i>so that the king's chosen
may feast and grow strong</i>

127
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,579
on the flesh of his enemies.

128
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,178
It is considered
the greatest of delicacies.

129
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,315
To some perhaps,
but not to us.

130
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,957
<i>We are forbidden to eat it,</i>

131
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,653
<i>for the Almighty
has commanded us,</i>

132
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,058
"The pig is unclean.

133
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,962
You are not to eat their meat
or touch their carcasses."

134
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,728
<i>Nor can we eat anything
sacrificed to gods</i>

135
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,133
other than our own.

136
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,172
But the king cannot-he will not
change the customs of his hall

137
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,138
to fit your wishes.

138
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,833
You must know this.

139
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,037
And we will not
ask him to.

140
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,044
But you must eat.

141
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,115
I have been charged
with your well-being.

142
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,912
If you are seen
to be wasting away,

143
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,010
I'm afraid of what my lord,
the king, will do.

144
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,886
He will have my head.

145
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,653
And we would
not wish it so.

146
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,752
Therefore,
put your servants to the test.

147
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,298
<i>For 10 days give us nothing
but vegetables to eat</i>

148
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,094
and mater to drink.

149
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,691
Then compare our appearance

150
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,765
to that of the other young men
who eat the royal food.

151
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,872
- Ten days?
- Ten days.

152
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:40,612
And if after that your
appearance is found wanting?

153
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,712
Then we will
do as you wish.

154
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,054
<i>Your request was polite.</i>

155
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,096
I'm rather surprised
it was honored.

156
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,291
I have no doubt the Lord
favorably disposed his heart

157
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,767
to hear our request.

158
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,804
<i>By the end of 10 days,</i>

159
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,864
my companions and I looked
healthier and better-nourished

160
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,173
than the young men
who ate the royal food,

161
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,205
<i>and so the chief eunuch
allowed us to continue</i>

162
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,185
refusing the wine
and choice fare,

163
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,280
<i>and we remained un-de?led.</i>

164
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,696
<i>The period of our instruction
went by quickly.</i>

165
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,755
<i>During those many years we
were living in a foreign land,</i>

166
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,891
<i>speaking a foreign language,</i>

167
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,267
<i>and living under
a foreign king.</i>

168
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,708
<i>Despite this,
our hearts belonged only to God,</i>

169
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,303
<i>and at the end of that time
my companions and I</i>

170
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,308
<i>were presented before
Nebuchadnezzar himself.</i>

171
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,784
The king's executioner,
Arioch, <i>will</i> be <i>in</i> the chamber.

172
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,821
If you are found unworthy,

173
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,984
you will be
executed on the spot,

174
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,221
and so will I.

175
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:16,070
Lord, king, I present you
the princes of Judah,

176
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,273
<i>preserved by the
right hand of your mercy</i>

177
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,411
and tutored by the
left hand of your wisdom.

178
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,892
<i>They are come before you now for
judgment as to their training.</i>

179
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,726
They are Belteshazzar,
Shadrach,

180
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,996
Meshach, and Abednego.

181
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,003
Who am I?

182
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,871
You are Nebuchadnezzar,

183
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,106
son and heir of Nabopolassar,
king of Babylon.

184
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,942
<i>You have destroyed
Nineveh the Mighty,</i>

185
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,344
seat of Assyria,

186
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,442
and taken from her hand
the scepter of nations.

187
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,854
<i>You are the commander of
commanders and king of kings,</i>

188
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,018
from the rising of the sun unto
its setting in the western sea,

189
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:09,226
<i>and beneath heaven there is
none more powerful than thee.</i>

190
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:18,138
You, come forth.

191
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,440
Why should I allow you,

192
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:31,420
sons of my former enemies,
to serve in my court?

193
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,354
Because you have spared
the lives of our people

194
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,892
who were delivered
into your hand

195
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>and because the word
of the prophet Jeremiah</i>

196
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,328
has come unto us saying,

197
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,957
"This is what
the Lord God Almighty,

198
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,093
"the God of Israel,
says to all those

199
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,502
"carried into exile
from Jerusalem to Babylon,

200
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,165
<i>Build houses,
and settle down.</i>

201
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,107
"'Plant gardens,
and eat what they produce.

202
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,975
Marry and have
sons and daughters.

203
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,107
Also, seek the
prosperity of the city

204
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,845
'"to which I have
carried you into exile.

205
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,944
<i>Pray to the Lord for it,</i>

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,582
for if it prospers,
you too will prosper."'

207
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,426
This is good.

208
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:19,033
<i>So now even your God
commands you to serve me.</i>

209
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,934
I have no need
of lap dogs.

210
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,472
Would you dare
to tell me the truth

211
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,008
even if you knew
it would displease me?

212
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,100
Lord, king,
it must be so.

213
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,408
I will speak only the truth,

214
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,278
and when you
would not hear it,

215
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,841
you must ask me nothing.

216
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,994
I pronounce them worthy.

217
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,362
<i>Have their names be written
in the Book of the Wise.</i>

218
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,537
<i>Nebuchadnezzar's
questioning showed wisdom.</i>

219
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,474
A fonner enemy
can be a good counselor.

220
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,544
<i>And a wise king is capable
of choosing whom to trust,</i>

221
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,143
for are you not Croesus,

222
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,189
<i>formerly king of Lydia</i>

223
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,451
and once the richest
man <i>in</i> the <i>world</i>

224
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,459
<i>whose name alone
signified riches</i>

225
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,927
almost beyond
comprehending?

226
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,262
I am he.

227
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,462
Trusting the words
of the Oracle of Delphi,

228
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:33,169
I went to war with Cyrus
and was defeated.

229
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:38,409
<i>Cyrus pardoned me
and my family.</i>

230
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,478
I am eternally grateful.

231
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,613
<i>Worthy
counselors, rare indeed,</i>

232
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,659
<i>as Nebuchadnezzar
came to learn at a time</i>

233
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,226
when his Babylonian
counselors, his magi,

234
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:59,133
sorcerers, diviners,
magicians, and astrologers

235
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,166
<i>were unable to help him.</i>

236
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,971
No!

237
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,209
What is it, my king?

238
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,612
Summon my counselors.

239
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,513
The enchanters, the sorcerers,
or the astrologers?

240
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,178
All of them!

241
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,458
<i>on. king!</i>

242
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,325
Your wisest subjects
have arrived.

243
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,264
Command, and it is done.

244
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,235
I've had a dream
that troubles me.

245
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,669
I need to know
what it means.

246
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,638
Oh, king, tell your
servants your dream,

247
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,231
and we will
interpret it for you.

248
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,573
No.

249
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,737
What need I have wise men
who are not wise, hmm?

250
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,140
Astrologers who read
nothing in the stars.

251
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,980
Magicians who
perform children's tricks.

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,419
Sorcerers who divine nothing
except what I tell them.

253
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,013
No, it is enough for the
king to dream his dreams.

254
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,992
It is up to you
to discern and interpret them.

255
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,292
But, my lord, if only
you would tell us your dream

256
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,730
we could interpret it,
as we have always done.

257
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,399
Always.

258
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,397
I know you're
trying to gain time

259
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,302
or trick me into revealing
what I've seen.

260
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,341
Either may
I'll have none of it.

261
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,173
<i>But there's no man on
earth who can do what the king asks.</i>

262
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,647
<i>No king has ever asked
such a thing before.</i>

263
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,081
Only the gods
could know these things,

264
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,779
and when we ask
they don't answer.

265
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,250
Well, I suggest you try
and get them to answer,

266
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,587
or beg that they endow you
with the necessary skills

267
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,525
to divine it on your own,

268
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,064
for as I am king I swear
that when the sun rises,

269
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,191
if my dream is not
made known to me

270
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,031
along with its interpretation,

271
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,436
you will all be made shorter
by the height of your heads.

272
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,667
You may withdraw

273
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,674
Now!

274
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,546
<i>Lord Ashpenaz, is it true?</i>

275
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,141
It is.

276
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,220
Why has the king
issued such a harsh decree?

277
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,756
Why don't you come along with me
and ask him yourself?

278
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,298
- Lord, king.
- What?

279
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:18,535
Belteshazzar
requests an audience.

280
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,576
Speak.

281
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,374
<i>Oh king, live forever.</i>

282
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,777
I have heard your decree,

283
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,407
and I understand that
I shall fall beneath the blade

284
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,214
if your dream is not
made known and interpreted.

285
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,655
<i>i ask only for more time that
i might withdraw for a while,</i>

286
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,125
my friends and I,
to pray to our God

287
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,322
and see if he might not
make the dream known to us.

288
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,797
The time is fixed.
It cannot be altered.

289
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,631
The sentence is to be
carried out at sunrise.

290
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:51,801
<i>You may withdraw
so long as you return at dawn,</i>

291
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,707
as your fate
and that of the others

292
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,301
is one in the same,

293
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,509
and when you return be sure to
bring your companions with you.

294
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:05,214
<i>Shall I send
guards along, my king?</i>

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,449
No.

296
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:13,428
<i>No, if he says he'll pray,
he'll pray not?ee.</i>

297
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,432
Of that much
at least I'm sure.

298
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,298
<i>Even if we
were to?ee the city</i>

299
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,167
<i>the whole world
would've been against us,</i>

300
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,400
<i>not that it mattered.</i>

301
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,775
<i>I had given my word
and intended to keep it.</i>

302
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:35,284
<i>I would pray and hope
that the answer came.</i>

303
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,183
<i>Prepare to
bind the prisoners.</i>

304
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,189
Once the sun rises
there can be no delay.

305
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,326
<i>Bring forth the councilors!</i>

306
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,530
Oh king, live forever.

307
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,504
Oh <i>king,</i> do not
execute these men, <i>I</i> beg you.

308
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,735
<i>Belteshazzar,
your death is upon you as well</i>

309
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,574
unless you know my dream
and can interpret it.

310
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,242
lam, and I will.

311
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,343
<i>Praise be to the God
of rm] fathers forever and ever.</i>

312
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,322
He gives wisdom to the wise
and knowledge to the discerning.

313
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,620
<i>He reveals
deep and hidden things</i>

314
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,195
and has made plain
all that you have asked,

315
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,927
for he has shown me
the vision of the king.

316
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,897
Then speak!

317
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,771
As you lay upon your bed,
oh king, you looked,

318
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,810
and there before you
stood a large statue,

319
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,676
awesome in its appearance.

320
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,909
<i>The head of the statue
was made of pure gold,</i>

321
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,886
its chest and arms of silver,

322
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,819
its belly
and thighs of bronze,

323
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,515
<i>its legs of iron,</i>

324
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,550
<i>its feet partly of iron
and partly of baked clay.</i>

325
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,462
As you were watching,
a rock was cutout

326
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,228
but not by human hands.

327
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,430
<i>it struck the statue
on its feet of iron and clay</i>

328
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,733
and smashed them.

329
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,606
Then the iron, the clay, the
bronze, the silver, and the gold

330
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,373
were all broken
to pieces at the same time,

331
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,349
<i>and the winds swept them
away without a trace,</i>

332
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,718
but the rock that struck
the statue became a mountain

333
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,985
and filled the whole earth.

334
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:33,469
You have done what
I was told was impossible.

335
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,969
This mystery
has been revealed to me

336
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,007
not because I am
wiser than other men

337
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,604
but because God wishes you

338
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,974
to understand
the meaning of your dream.

339
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:52,855
You know my dream
as if you dreamt it yourself.

340
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,521
What does it mean?

341
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,621
You, oh king,
are the king of kings.

342
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,859
The God of heaven
has given you dominion

343
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,562
and power
and might and glory.

344
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,765
<i>In your hands
he has placed mankind.</i>

345
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,740
He has made you
ruler over the nation,

346
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,405
for you are
the head of pure gold.

347
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,641
<i>After you,
another kingdom will rise,</i>

348
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,843
inferior to yours.

349
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,615
Next, a third kingdom,
one of bronze,

350
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,020
will rule over
the whole earth.

351
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,925
<i>Finally, there will be
a fourth kingdom strong as iron,</i>

352
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,623
for iron breaks
and smashes things to pieces,

353
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,029
but just as you saw

354
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,364
that the feet and toes
were partly of baked clay

355
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,766
<i>and partly of iron,</i>

356
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,034
so this people will be a mixture
and not remain united

357
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,439
any more than
iron mixes with clay.

358
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,909
<i>And in the time
of those kings</i>

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,843
the God of heaven
will set up a kingdom

360
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,973
that will never
be destroyed.

361
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,881
It will crush those kingdoms
and bring them to an end

362
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,912
<i>but will itself
endure forever.</i>

363
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,752
The Almighty
has shown the king

364
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,350
what will take place
in the future.

365
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,555
The dream is true,

366
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:11,031
and the interpretation
is trustworthy.

367
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:18,107
lam the head of gold?

368
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:23,073
Yes, oh king,
you are the head of pure gold.

369
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,378
Surely your God
is the God of gods,

370
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:32,684
the ruler of kings,
and the revealer of mysteries.

371
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:38,417
Let this man be paid honor
and present him with incense.

372
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,928
<i>Thus, the
king made me ruler</i>

373
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,398
<i>over the entire
province of Baby Ion,</i>

374
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,059
<i>and at my request</i>

375
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:49,833
<i>made Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego administrators.</i>

376
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:54,604
<i>King Nebuchadnezzar made
an image of gold 90 feet high.</i>

377
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:59,011
<i>All were commanded
to fall down and worship,</i>

378
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,177
<i>and all did as commanded
except for three.</i>

379
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,977
- King.
- Live forever!

380
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,078
A moment
of your precious time.

381
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,954
<i>As your dutiful servants,</i>

382
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:14,794
<i>we know the law that when
the horn sounds we all bow down.</i>

383
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,456
And worship your image.

384
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,092
But these Jews
whom you have set over

385
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,467
<i>the affairs of the
province of Babylon</i>

386
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,198
pay no attention
to you, oh king.

387
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,803
<i>None.</i>

388
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,671
<i>They neither
worship your gods</i>

389
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,870
or serve the image
of gold you've created.

390
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,537
<i>Nothing.</i>

391
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,013
Is this true?

392
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,916
Do you refuse
to worship my statue?

393
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,955
Oh king, we do not need to
defend ourselves before you

394
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,547
in this matter.

395
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,954
Really?

396
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,959
Then you shall be
thrown into the furnace,

397
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,929
<i>and no guard
will save you from rm] hand.</i>

398
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,659
If we are thrown
into the blazing furnace,

399
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,860
our God will
defend us from it.

400
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,736
<i>And if he does not,
we want you to know, oh king,</i>

401
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,536
that we will not
serve your gods

402
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,938
or worship
the statue of gold-

403
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,739
Enough!

404
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,213
<i>You dare to defy me?</i>

405
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,848
<i>Let the furnace
be heated sevenfold.</i>

406
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,182
Bind them,
and cast them into the fire!

407
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:49,725
There were three
thrown into the fire.

408
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,693
Certainly, your king.

409
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,630
But now I see four,

410
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,827
and the fourth-

411
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:06,706
<i>The fourth looks like
an angel of God.</i>

412
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,037
<i>The fire has not
harmed your bodies.</i>

413
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,673
<i>Not a hair is singed.</i>

414
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,915
Your robes, there's not even
a smell of the fire on you.

415
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,028
Praise be to your God

416
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:32,898
<i>who sent his angel
to rescue his servants.</i>

417
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,096
<i>You trusted in him.</i>

418
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,936
You defied my commands.

419
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,010
<i>You were willing
to give up your lives</i>

420
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,706
rather than serve any
but your own God.

421
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,885
Therefore, I decree
any who speaks ill

422
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,590
of the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, Abednego,

423
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:06,602
<i>will be out into little pieces
and his house turned to rubble,</i>

424
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:11,658
<i>for no other God
can save in this way.</i>

425
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,646
<i>And for a time all was well</i>

426
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,910
<i>until Nebuchadnezzar's
sleep was troubled</i>

427
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,316
yet by another dream.

428
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,321
It seems like
Nebuchadnezzar's life was rife

429
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:31,019
with dreams and prophesies
much like my own has been.

430
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,620
Before I was born,
my grandfather, Astyages,

431
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,359
<i>was troubled by a dream</i>

432
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,068
<i>where a?ood
beginning near his throne</i>

433
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,638
was overflowing
the whole earth.

434
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,037
<i>When he went
to his astrologers</i>

435
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:49,204
<i>and his diviners
for an interpretation,</i>

436
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,143
they told him that
his grandson was destined

437
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,809
to one day usurp him.

438
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,012
<i>So he sent his daughter,
Mandane, into exile,</i>

439
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,817
and when a son
was born to her

440
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,415
he conspired
to have it stolen

441
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,820
<i>and exposed
on a hilltop to die.</i>

442
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,363
<i>But a shepherd whose wife</i>

443
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,366
<i>had recently given birth
to a stillborn child</i>

444
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:16,030
persuaded her husband to trade
her dead infant for the living,

445
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:20,234
<i>and the shepherd
raised the boy as his own.</i>

446
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,245
<i>The king, upon being
presented with the dead infant,</i>

447
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,440
repented of his crime.

448
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,046
<i>He didn't learn
until 10 years later</i>

449
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,380
<i>that the boy
was actually alive,</i>

450
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,355
<i>at which time
he pardoned the boy</i>

451
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,755
and restored him
to his rightful parents,

452
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,090
and for a time
the matter was forgotten.

453
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,994
<i>Until one day, years later,</i>

454
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,431
when you marched
into your grandfather's city

455
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,034
at the head of your troops
and seized the throne of Medea,

456
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:53,804
<i>taking the old man captive, and
the prophecy was proven true.</i>

457
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:58,142
<i>Old Astyages, he
knew of the prophecy,</i>

458
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,443
but he was powerless
to overcome it.

459
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,380
As all men are powerless
to prevent their fate

460
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,150
<i>if the prophesizing be true.</i>

461
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:12,719
<i>Listen then, as i tell
of the prophetic vision</i>

462
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,424
<i>that fed to
Nebuchadnezzar's madness.</i>

463
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,933
For when he dreamed
that great dream,

464
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,301
his enchanters, sorcerers,
and astrologers

465
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,810
were once again unable
to interpret the vision.

466
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,435
When I was asleep

467
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,744
I had a dream
which made me afraid.

468
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:39,187
<i>The images I saw
terri?ed me.</i>

469
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:44,353
Belteshazzar,
I looked and saw before me

470
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,293
a tree
in the middle of the land.

471
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,889
<i>A tree grew strong and tall.</i>

472
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,333
<i>Its top touched the sky,</i>

473
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,861
<i>and it was visible
to the ends of the earth.</i>

474
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:03,105
<i>its leaves,
they were beautiful.</i>

475
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,442
Its fruit was abundant.

476
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,484
<i>The beasts of the?eld
took shelter under it,</i>

477
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,453
and the birds of the air
lived in its branches,

478
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,788
and from it
every creature was fed.

479
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,057
<i>Then I looked again,</i>

480
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,430
and I saw a messenger
coming down from heaven,

481
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:29,494
and he cried out aloud,
"Cut down the tree!

482
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,871
<i>Trim off its branches.</i>

483
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,035
"Strip its leaves.

484
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,238
"Scatter its fruit.

485
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,304
"Let the beasts
?ee from under it

486
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,511
<i>and the birds
?y from its branches,</i>

487
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,884
<i>but let the stump
and its roots,</i>

488
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,048
"bound in iron and brass,

489
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,592
"remain in the ground
in the grass of the field.

490
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,590
<i>Let it be drenched
by the dew from heaven.</i>

491
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,866
"Let it live with
the animals of the earth,

492
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:02,200
"and let its mind be changed
from that of a man

493
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,002
to the mind of an animal."

494
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:12,037
<i>This is the dream that I had.</i>

495
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,583
What does it mean?

496
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:21,017
My lord, if only the dream
applied to your enemies

497
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,491
<i>and its meaning
to your adversaries.</i>

498
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,028
The tree which you saw

499
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,533
which grew large and strong
with its top touching the sky,

500
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,560
you, oh king, are that tree.

501
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,631
<i>You have become
great and strong.</i>

502
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,570
Your greatness has grown
until it reaches the sky,

503
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:45,546
and your dominion extends to
the distant pans of the earth.

504
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:49,244
But you saw a messenger,
a holy one,

505
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,286
coming down
from heaven, saying,

506
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,448
"Cut down the tree,
and destroy it,

507
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,618
<i>but leave the stump,
bound with iron and bronze,</i>

508
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,224
"in the grass of the field

509
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:03,026
"while its roots remain
in the ground.

510
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,590
<i>Let him be drenched
with the dew of heaven.</i>

511
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:10,606
Let him live
like wild animals."

512
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,337
This is the interpretation,
oh king,

513
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,276
and this is the decree

514
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:22,147
that the Most High has issued
against my lord, the king.

515
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,117
<i>You will be
driven away from people</i>

516
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,347
and live with
the wild animals.

517
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,085
You will eat grass like cattle
until you acknowledge

518
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,185
<i>that the Most High is sovereign
over the kingdoms of men</i>

519
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:38,030
and gives them
to anyone he wishes.

520
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,194
<i>The command to leave the
stump of the tree with its roots</i>

521
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,967
<i>means that your kingdom
will be restored to you</i>

522
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:49,341
when you acknowledge
that the Most High rules.

523
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,351
<i>Therefore, oh king,
be pleased to accept rm] advice.</i>

524
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,250
Renounce your sins
by doing what is right

525
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,290
<i>and your wickedness
by being kind to the oppressed.</i>

526
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:06,294
Seek the Lord
while he may be found,

527
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:11,561
and it may be that
your prosperity will continue.

528
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,398
<i>But the memory
of kings is often short,</i>

529
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,995
<i>and 12 months later</i>

530
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,007
<i>when the king was walking
on the roof of the royal palace</i>

531
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,441
<i>of Babylon...</i>

532
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,479
<i>In all the world
is there anything like this?</i>

533
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,071
No, my king.

534
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,016
<i>My great wall which
mountain-like cannot be moved.</i>

535
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,351
I've made with mortar
and brick its foundations.

536
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,119
I've placed upon the very bosom
of the underworld, its top.

537
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,684
I've raised mountain high.

538
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,095
Is this not
the great Babylon

539
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,565
that I have built
as my royal palace

540
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:51,607
with my mighty power
for the glory of my majesty?

541
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,040
<i>His words
were still on his lips</i>

542
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,636
<i>when a voice
came down from heaven,</i>

543
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,308
<i>Nebuchadnezzar,
for your arrogance</i>

544
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,115
<i>and your failure
to give glory to the Most High,</i>

545
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,418
<i>your authority
is stripped from you.</i>

546
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,653
<i>Go now from this kingdom
which you claim.</i>

547
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:15,390
<i>Your mind shall be reduced
to that of an animal,</i>

548
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,659
<i>and you will wander the land</i>

549
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:24,570
<i>until you acknowledge the
glory of God as above your own.</i>

550
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,133
<i>Immediately what had
been said about Nebuchadnezzar</i>

551
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,609
<i>was fulfilled.</i>

552
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,480
The greatest
of those below heaven,

553
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,519
he sought to make
himself as great as he

554
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,112
who rules above heaven,

555
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,453
and the Lord
would not have it.

556
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:20,086
Because he insisted on being
more than he was made,

557
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,222
he became less
than he was made.

558
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,530
Because he aspired
to be more than a man,

559
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,127
he became
less than a man.

560
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,367
He became
like the wild beasts.

561
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,434
How did he survive
alone in the wilds?

562
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,843
<i>Even in his insanity</i>

563
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,776
neither the lion
nor the bear disturbed him

564
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,182
<i>though he wandered
alone and unarmed</i>

565
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,723
and slept naked in the places
where they found their food

566
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,418
because it
had been prophesied

567
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:55,794
that one day he would
honor the Most High.

568
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,606
<i>For I years he ranged
the wild lands of Babylon,</i>

569
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,440
<i>but it was not until the full
time of his exile was completed</i>

570
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,243
<i>that he turned his
eyes toward heaven</i>

571
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,146
<i>and declared-</i>

572
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:20,622
Praise be
to the Most High.

573
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:25,592
Honor and glory
to him who lives forever.

574
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,197
<i>Rise, Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

575
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:49,876
For he is to be given
his eternal dominion.

576
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:56,220
Before him all the people of the
earth are regarded as nothing.

577
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,520
He may do as he pleases

578
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:04,396
with the powers of heaven
and all the people of the earth,

579
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:10,234
and no one, no one,
may say him, "Nay."

580
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:17,678
No one may say him,
"Navy.

581
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:40,797
Beware your place,
for I am not as I was.

582
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:46,931
Let it be recorded
that I, Nebuchadnezzar,

583
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:53,471
do praise, exalt,
and glorify the King of heaven

584
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,484
because everything
he does is right,

585
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:01,546
and all his ways are just,

586
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:07,654
and those who walk in pride
he is able to humble.

587
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,528
<i>And so Nebuchadnezzar
returned to his throne,</i>

588
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,866
<i>but eventually he was
gathered to his fathers,</i>

589
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,997
<i>and a series of new kings
came to the throne,</i>

590
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,902
<i>none lasting more
than a short time.</i>

591
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,909
<i>You're about to tell
about the downfall of Babylon,</i>

592
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,673
are you not?

593
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,271
I am.

594
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,782
Well, at last we come
to the pan of the tale

595
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,716
where I have some
knowledge to share.

596
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:35,656
<i>For though I had conquered
from east to west,</i>

597
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,623
Babylon was
the last to resist me,

598
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,491
and I dreaded its siege,

599
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,030
<i>for Babylon's wealth had allowed
her to lay in enough grain</i>

600
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,426
to last for years,

601
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,436
<i>and her towers, walls,
and gates were so formidable</i>

602
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,339
that even untrained men
could defend them with ease,

603
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,468
<i>walls too high to scale,</i>

604
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,877
<i>with parapets wide enough
for chariots to patrol them,</i>

605
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,916
<i>and a rivet-fed moat to cross
before even getting there.</i>

606
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,508
It was enough
to freeze the heart

607
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,714
of even an old soldier
such as I am.

608
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,885
Then one night
as I lay on the ground

609
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,830
courting sleep
that would not come,

610
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,423
a thought came to me.

611
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,832
From whence it came
I do not know,

612
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:26,603
like some spirit of God
whispered it in my ear.

613
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,703
But the River Euphrates
which flowed down to Babylon

614
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:35,045
<i>raised above its natural level
hemmed in by dams and dikes,</i>

615
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,781
but if dams were opened full
and the dikes were broken,

616
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:43,019
the river which ran straight
through the heart of the city

617
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,391
would fall to nothing.

618
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,691
<i>An army poised
and ready to strike</i>

619
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,426
could march into the city
on its dry riverbed

620
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,799
<i>underneath the gates
designed to repel ships</i>

621
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,533
when the river
was at its normal level.

622
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,543
<i>And I suddenly realized
I'd been given a key</i>

623
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,477
to defeat
the mighty Babylon.

624
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,411
It was as though
in all the world,

625
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,847
throughout all of history,

626
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,509
I was the only one
that had the thought.

627
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,387
<i>All it required was
the right moment to act.</i>

628
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,519
A night when
every man in Babylon,

629
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,427
<i>from the least
to the king himself,</i>

630
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,899
would drink himself ill
in honor of their gods

631
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,698
who were naught
but worthless idols

632
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,966
and could not protect them.

633
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,632
<i>Listen, oh king,</i>

634
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,872
<i>and I will tell of the
second king of my story,</i>

635
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:42,110
Belshazzar,
king of Babylon,

636
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:47,020
both foolish and wicked
of equal measure.

637
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,881
But, king.

638
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,980
Enough!

639
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:26,495
We still have our threefold
walls with their battlements,

640
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,655
and within our granaries
we have grain enough to endure

641
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,561
a seed of 10 years.

642
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,727
Our watchmen have seen
the Persians digging, my lord.

643
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,534
They seem quite
concerned about this, my king.

644
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,904
Yes, yes, they will
look to build a siege ramp

645
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,908
against the city.

646
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,642
First, they must build
a causeway across the moat.

647
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:52,779
That alone will take months.

648
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:58,850
In the meantime,
let us feast and toast Marduk,

649
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,929
patron god of Babylon.

650
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,895
To Marduk!

651
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:15,999
These cups have a taste,
and I will not have it so.

652
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,615
Bring me the golden vessels
from the temple of Jerusalem.

653
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,689
But, my king,
is it wise to use the vessels?

654
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:32,285
My king, these cups
are considered sacred,

655
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,891
are they not, my king?

656
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:39,696
Perhaps in Jerusalem by that
pathetic desert deity of Judah,

657
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,898
but here they are
spoil for our gods,

658
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:50,706
and they would have you
use them as I see fit.

659
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,248
Bring them!

660
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,824
Yes, you see these vessels?

661
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:15,132
<i>In Jerusalem, they were used
for the worship of their God.</i>

662
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:20,608
Now, instead of the blood
of bulls and rams,

663
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,134
let them flow
with foaming wine,

664
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:27,078
<i>for! am not
a devourer of blood.</i>

665
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:33,713
I am a devourer of drink
and choice fare.

666
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,787
To Marduk,
the god of our city!

667
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,191
To Marduk!

668
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,959
<i>And to our
idols of gold and silver,</i>

669
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:48,059
bronze and iron,
wood and stone,

670
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,698
partake of our pleasures,
and protect our city.

671
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:38,013
Whoever reads this
and tells me what it means

672
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,645
<i>shall be clothed in purple</i>

673
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,885
and have a gold chain
placed around his neck

674
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,054
and be made third highest ruler
in the kingdom.

675
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,099
<i>And all the
king's wise men came in,</i>

676
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,436
<i>but they could not
interpret the inscription</i>

677
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,211
<i>or tell the king
what it meant,</i>

678
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:07,340
<i>so Belshazzar became
even more terri?ed.</i>

679
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,783
A Judean once told
Nebuchadnezzar, your forefather,

680
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,285
of his dreams.

681
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,721
He succeeded
when everyone else had failed.

682
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:19,283
This man, Daniel, whom
the king called Belteshazzar,

683
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,193
he could tell you
what this writing means.

684
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,822
<i>Does he still live?</i>

685
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,128
He does.

686
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,399
Bring him to me quickly,
but do not harm him.

687
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,431
<i>We shall soon learn if this
Hebrew can do as you say.</i>

688
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,007
<i>Nothing it would seem is
too sacred not to be profaned</i>

689
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,347
under the influence of wine.

690
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,411
Nothing, oh king.

691
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,231
How can I be
of service, highness?

692
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,425
Are you Daniel,

693
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,059
one of the exiles my father
brought back from Judah?

694
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,466
I am he.

695
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,400
I am told you are able
to give interpretations

696
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,773
<i>and solve difficult problems.</i>

697
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,005
<i>H you can read
the writing on that wall,</i>

698
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,070
<i>you will be
clothed in purple,</i>

699
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,481
<i>have a chain of gold
placed around your neck,</i>

700
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:21,416
<i>and be made third highest
ruler in the kingdom.</i>

701
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:27,827
Long ago I told your forefather,
Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar,

702
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,126
that I would speak to him
only the truth

703
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,964
and that if he
rather not hear it,

704
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:39,200
he should ask me nothing.

705
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:44,871
Perhaps it would be better
if you asked me nothing.

706
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,245
No, it is unseemly
for a king to be baffled

707
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,911
<i>by a message
in his own hall.</i>

708
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,387
No human hand
has scribed it.

709
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,049
<i>No other tongue
can interpret it.</i>

710
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:03,497
Tell me what it means,
be of good or ill.

711
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:08,162
Oh king,
the Most High God

712
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,239
gave your father,
Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar,

713
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:15,141
greatness and glory,

714
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,839
but when his heart
became arrogant

715
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:23,248
he was deposed from his throne
and stripped of his glory

716
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:28,484
until he acknowledged
that the Most High is sovereign

717
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,253
over the kingdoms of men.

718
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,387
<i>Even though
you knew all this,</i>

719
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,193
<i>you should have
appealed to him.</i>

720
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:43,533
Instead, you've set yourself up
against the Lord of heaven.

721
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,507
<i>You had the goblets
of his temple brought to you</i>

722
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:52,138
and praised the gods
of bronze and iron,

723
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,479
wood and stone,
instead of him.

724
00:47:55,572 --> 00:48:01,989
These vessels were made for
the service of the Most High,

725
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:08,022
and you have used them
to pour wine for your harlots.

726
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:17,405
Would you humble the Almighty
by desecrating his possessions?

727
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,335
<i>Would you bind him
like a captive</i>

728
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,502
and beat him like a slave?

729
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,410
Would you pluck out his eyes

730
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:32,944
<i>and have him beg for scraps
of food beneath your table?</i>

731
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:39,289
This you would do if you could,
and the Almighty knows it.

732
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,555
<i>This is his answer to you.</i>

733
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:50,037
<i>The Lord God will
strike you down like an enemy,</i>

734
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:55,065
for he has bidden his angel
to unsheathe his sword.

735
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:59,603
These then are the
words he has written.

736
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:06,451
"Mene," God has numbered
the days of your reign

737
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,117
and brought it to an end.

738
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:15,162
"Tekel," you have been
weighed in the scales

739
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:19,291
and found wanting.

740
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:24,998
"Upharsin,"
your kingdom is divided

741
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:28,406
and given to the Medes
and Persians.

742
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:34,505
This very night your life
will be demanded of you,

743
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:41,249
and before the sun rises
your flesh will grow cold.

744
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:47,296
Thus says the Lord,
"Your line is ended.

745
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:53,960
Your rule is over.
Your kingship is no more."

746
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,973
Is there nothing
to be done?

747
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:06,004
No, in your arrogance you
have doomed not only yourself

748
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:12,416
but your house, your line,
your inheritance, your city,

749
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:16,151
and your kingdom.

750
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:21,286
Choose now where you will
spend your last few hours.

751
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:26,061
But knowing your fate,
who now will love thee?

752
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:30,366
Who now will fear you?

753
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,340
Will the least
of your slaves comfort you,

754
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,570
or will they desert you,

755
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:43,641
seeking to avoid
the fate which is yours?

756
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:52,085
Let it be
as I have commanded.

757
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,686
<i>Let this man
be clothed in purple,</i>

758
00:50:55,752 --> 00:51:00,360
a chain of gold
placed around his neck,

759
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,630
for I am not dead yet.

760
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,109
<i>All hail, King Darius!</i>

761
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,750
I am King Belshazzar
of the Babylonia. Unhand me!

762
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,315
- Surrender or die!
- Never!

763
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,097
Send word to Cyrus
this city's taken in his name.

764
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,367
As he has commanded,
I shall assume the crown.

765
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,375
<i>Do you know
who stands before you?</i>

766
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,519
You are Darius,
the Mede-Persian,

767
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,522
<i>uncle and father-in-law
to Cyrus</i>

768
00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:01,120
who has by stratagem
taken this city.

769
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:05,667
By right of conquest,
you are now the king.

770
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:09,396
Yes, and you are
an official of Babylon.

771
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,166
Why should I not kill you?

772
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:16,267
It is true I served Babylon
in the days of Nebuchadnezzar

773
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,542
<i>whom I served
truly and well,</i>

774
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:25,554
but her latter kings
I did not serve until tonight.

775
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,680
How is this possible?

776
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:33,818
It is a reward
for letting Belshazzar know

777
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,158
that you were
about to take the city.

778
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,561
Who told you?

779
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,463
Have we a traitor
in our ranks?

780
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,867
It was revealed to me
by my God

781
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,236
<i>who sent his angel to scribe
the writing on that wall.</i>

782
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,209
<i>It is true.</i>

783
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:55,408
He read the inscription
and revealed the message.

784
00:52:55,472 --> 00:53:00,148
<i>He told the king that
he would die this very night.</i>

785
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,384
<i>Though brought here
as an exile in my youth,</i>

786
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,589
by birth am a Hebrew
from the kingdom of Judea,

787
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,531
and I serve the God
of my forefathers.

788
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:18,573
<i>The Most High
reveals to me what he sees?t.</i>

789
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,541
Am I to believe your God
revealed my coming to you?

790
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,668
If I was to lie,

791
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,271
would this be
the lie I would choose?

792
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,908
Who else could have
revealed your deepest secret

793
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,417
and known ahead of time
that you would succeed

794
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:40,518
or known with certainty
that you would slay Belshazzar?

795
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:45,828
<i>And how could you have done so
if the Lord had not decreed it?</i>

796
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:49,631
For is it not by the
hand of the Most High

797
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:54,870
that both victories
and disasters come?

798
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,776
I would have you put this gift
of divination in my service,

799
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,684
<i>yet how do! know
I can trust you, Hebrew?</i>

800
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,757
I will speak to you
honestly, my king,

801
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:13,317
and when you
would not hear the truth

802
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,796
you must ask me nothing.

803
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,423
So be it.

804
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,830
I see by your insignia

805
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,801
<i>you were made third
in all of Babylon,</i>

806
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,894
but that is not
the Persian way,

807
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,531
for below me I have
three administrators,

808
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,473
all of equal rank.

809
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,375
<i>Yet! shall name you
one of the three.</i>

810
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,243
<i>What of the
other counselors?</i>

811
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,941
Slay them.

812
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:38,578
<i>H they were loyal to the former
master, they are no good to me.</i>

813
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,985
If they were
disloyal to him,

814
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,690
then they will be
disloyal to me.

815
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,522
<i>Ah, Darius.</i>

816
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,291
He's twice my uncle
by blood and marriage

817
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,299
and serves me well
as co-counsel to my empire.

818
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,996
<i>As it pleased Darius
to appoint 120 satraps</i>

819
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:01,834
<i>to rule throughout the kingdom
with administrators above them,</i>

820
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,638
one of whom was me,

821
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,770
<i>but before long
I so distinguished myself</i>

822
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:10,875
that Darius planned to set me
over the whole kingdom.

823
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,477
Which would cause
great envy among the others.

824
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,318
Yes, oh king.

825
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,586
So they called
a meeting in secret

826
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,720
<i>and planned
for rm] destruction.</i>

827
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,391
- Are we safe?
- Yes.

828
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,936
- Did anyone see you?
- No.

829
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,965
Why are we meeting
so far from the city?

830
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,566
Do you think
it would be wise

831
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,407
for this meeting
to be overheard by anyone?

832
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,979
Are you sure
you weren't followed?

833
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,879
Not unless
whatevers following has wings.

834
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,350
We don't have much time.

835
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,351
Daniel being put over us,

836
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,086
if we allow it to stand,
means our demise.

837
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,690
Once he is in charge

838
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,730
he'll be looking into
everything we do.

839
00:55:56,786 --> 00:56:00,632
Perhaps we
should eliminate him.

840
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,033
<i>How?</i>

841
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,469
- A hunting accident.
- He doesn't hunt.

842
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,473
A sudden illness
or a drowning.

843
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,566
Who would believe it?

844
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,973
Maybe we can
ensnare him.

845
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,639
How? There is no corruption
in him nor any negligence.

846
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,705
He is as diligent
as he is skillful.

847
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,113
There must be some way.

848
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,387
He claims he's so effective
because three times a day

849
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,046
his heart inclines
to the city of God.

850
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,648
There's a spirit
of excellence in him.

851
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,090
In every test
he has proven faithful.

852
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,690
No one is that honest.

853
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,091
On the contrary,

854
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,921
I had a man
try to bribe him once,

855
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,555
and a very generous
bribe at that.

856
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,567
He would have
no pan of it.

857
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,398
Such a man is dangerous.

858
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,802
How long before he learns

859
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,602
that we've been
generous with ourselves

860
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,835
and covered the thefts
with false accounts?

861
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,377
We'll never be able to find any
basis for charges against him

862
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,573
unless it has something
to do with that God of his.

863
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,671
That invisible God of his.

864
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,550
No altars, no shrines, no idols,
laying claim to every good thing

865
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,952
yet somehow
not responsible for the bad.

866
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,116
I've seen him praying
before his window on his knees

867
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,520
facing Jerusalem
morning, noon, and night,

868
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,994
always the same.

869
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,860
Then perhaps
we need to make him stop.

870
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,559
He won't do it.

871
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,799
Then perhaps we need
to make sure he continues.

872
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,739
You say there is nothing anyone
can do to stop his prayers.

873
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,673
No, nothing.

874
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:19,544
What if the penalty for
this devotion of his was death?

875
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,446
If we could forbid
his prayers for an entire month

876
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,451
under penalty
of immediate execution?

877
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,043
Don't be ridiculous.
He'll just stop praying.

878
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,088
No, he won't.

879
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,556
I know him.

880
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,718
He can't keep himself from
praying to that God of his

881
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,592
for one day,
let alone a month.

882
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,427
I still don't see
how it will ever work.

883
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,898
The king knows
that Daniel and his people

884
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,595
pray continuously
and only to one God.

885
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:47,937
Which is why we need
to disguise our purpose.

886
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,805
A more fitting
testimony to your honesty

887
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,575
could not have been made.

888
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,015
Had there been any
infidelity in your record

889
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,746
they would have
discovered it.

890
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,790
Indeed, they could find
nothing amiss in my work,

891
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,827
neither willfully nor through
negligence or lack of care,

892
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:10,591
so they tried to trip me up
with my prayers.

893
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,123
But since worship of the
Most High was not prohibited

894
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:20,766
by the laws of the realm, they
had to conceal their purpose

895
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:25,245
like poison
in a cup of honey.

896
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,038
Oh king, it has come
to our attention that...

897
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,743
...there are those
among your subjects

898
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:34,687
<i>who still cling
to the old gods of Babylon</i>

899
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,917
<i>in the hopes that their line
of kings may yet be restored.</i>

900
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,756
And have not
submitted to your rule.

901
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,663
Who are they that I may bring
them before me and destroy them?

902
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,133
it is not that simple of a
matter to detect them, oh king,

903
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,725
for they are devious

904
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,066
and work to hide
their treasonous thoughts.

905
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,663
And have you
come before me

906
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,709
without a plan
for discovering them?

907
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,777
We would dare not do so,
oh king.

908
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,972
<i>Indeed, we have
labored to construct a plan</i>

909
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,277
whereby the loyalty
of all may be tested.

910
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:03,880
Then speak of it.

911
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,977
<i>If, oh king,
you were to issue an edict</i>

912
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,716
that none in Babylon
nor anywhere in the empire

913
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,793
<i>may pray to anyone,
be it to God or man,</i>

914
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,228
except to you
for a period of 30 days.

915
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,664
But what of the gods of Persia,
my servant, obey?

916
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,931
and offer them sacrifice.

917
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:31,143
and in this way ingratiate
yourself to the gods themselves

918
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,941
<i>because for an entire month</i>

919
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,778
all of their worship
would come from you.

920
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,612
<i>and the old gods of Babylon
will be starved for worship,</i>

921
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,554
<i>lessening their power.</i>

922
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,320
How would you
enforce such an edict?

923
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,993
No one would be allowed to
go before any altar or shrine

924
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,930
for the entire period
except for you.

925
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,863
And anyone found
violating the decree

926
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,800
would be thrown into
the lions den before sundown

927
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,667
<i>on the very day
of the offense.</i>

928
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:06,277
In a single stroke.

929
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,815
I approve your plan.

930
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,647
<i>I, Darius,
command it be made so.</i>

931
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,743
In anticipation
of your approval, oh king,

932
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,153
we have taken the liberty
of drafting the edict

933
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,748
and bringing it along.

934
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,157
Well done.

935
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,287
<i>Bring it here
that! may?x rm] seal.</i>

936
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:37,641
<i>Let all the world
hear and obey.</i>

937
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:42,239
<i>So Darius found no
need to consider it further.</i>

938
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:45,285
Darius had a great deal
of experience as a soldier,

939
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,187
but very little as a ruler
until Babylon fell.

940
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:53,318
<i>Once signed, the
order could not be changed.</i>

941
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,293
<i>That every order be upheld,</i>

942
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,264
<i>for the law cannot
be countermanded</i>

943
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:02,029
and the laws cannot
contradict themselves,

944
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,934
<i>but each law be?xed,
unchangeable,</i>

945
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,370
<i>for the king cannot err.</i>

946
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,336
<i>And once a law is written,</i>

947
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:11,208
even the king himself
cannot change it.

948
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,178
<i>Such is the law of Persia.</i>

949
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,813
The king's seal
is barely dry.

950
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:22,050
Already you
have defied his law.

951
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,113
You made your choice.

952
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,955
You chose your God
over your king.

953
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,961
Take him away!

954
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:42,834
Oh king, it is my
sad duty to inform you

955
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:47,813
that someone has already
defied your decree.

956
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,781
Bring him to me.

957
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,318
<i>Bring forth the prisoner.</i>

958
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,263
<iDaniel.</i>

959
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:08,267
<i>He is one of the
exiles from Judah.</i>

960
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,066
He pays no attention
to you, oh king,

961
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,902
<i>or to the decree
you have pm in writing.</i>

962
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,102
<i>He still prays
three times a day.</i>

963
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,772
What sort of
foolishness is this?

964
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:22,110
Daniel is my chief adviser.

965
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,741
No one is above the law.

966
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,117
Yes, sadly, oh king,
no one is above the law.

967
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,850
Bring forth the tablet.

968
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,297
Is this not the edict
from the king,

969
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:42,325
<i>signed with your own seal?</i>

970
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,804
"Let it be known
that for the next 30 days

971
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:51,345
<i>anyone who prays to any god or
man other than Darius the king</i>

972
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,505
"shall be thrown
into the lions den

973
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,511
"on the same day
the offense is discovered.

974
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,982
<i>By my hand and seal,
Darius the king,</i>

975
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:05,457
ruler of the Medes
and Persians."

976
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,323
Call my counselors together.

977
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,801
We will begin the trial.

978
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:20,204
<i>Oh king, live forever.</i>

979
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,334
There is no need
of a trial.

980
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,344
I am guilty.

981
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:29,348
<i>Knowing the king's command,
I have disobeyed it.</i>

982
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:32,079
The commands
of the king are immutable

983
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:36,123
and once uttered
cannot be changed.

984
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,520
I shall command
my wise men

985
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,795
to make every effort
to search out some reason

986
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,990
that the law
may be found unenforceable.

987
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:47,329
I do not think
they will find one.

988
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,497
<i>Let them search, oh king,
but only for a short time</i>

989
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:55,202
because your own law commands
that sentence be carried out

990
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,040
the day of the offense.

991
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:03,379
Already the shadows
are starting to grow long,

992
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,977
and you have
only until sunset.

993
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,114
<i>Darius was angry with himself</i>

994
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:12,022
<i>for allowing himself
to be fooled,</i>

995
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:16,893
seeing that their purpose
was not for his honor and glory

996
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:21,264
but rather
for my destruction.

997
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:25,203
<i>And so Darius
had the law books searched</i>

998
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,036
<i>to discover if there
might be some legal way</i>

999
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,134
<i>to spare my life.</i>

1000
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,220
It is as I expected.

1001
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,884
Why didn't I consult you before
passing that accursed law?

1002
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,485
<i>Now I'm forced to abide
by my own decree.</i>

1003
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:53,033
A king who will not enforce
his own laws cannot be a king.

1004
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:58,334
<i>Your enemies know this
and use it to their advantage.</i>

1005
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,203
<i>Do not grieve, oh king.</i>

1006
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:06,042
The Most High does not
want you to deliver me.

1007
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,878
If he grants me deliverance,

1008
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:12,317
it will be by his
own hand not yours.

1009
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:17,324
It is a privilege
he reserves unto himself.

1010
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,263
And now it is time, oh king,

1011
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:40,273
that I may not
break your laws a second time.

1012
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:44,943
I will walk with you,
Daniel, one last time.

1013
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,544
As you wish, oh king.

1014
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,150
Of those who esteemed
to bring about my death,

1015
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,559
I will say only this.

1016
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:59,224
My forefather, Abraham,
came from this land,

1017
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,360
and the Most High
said unto him,

1018
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,371
"I will make you
into a great nation.

1019
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,670
"I will bless those
who bless you,

1020
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,937
and whoever curses you
I will curse."

1021
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,142
They have surely cursed me

1022
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:21,238
and may yet live to reap
the fruits of that curse.

1023
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:22,115
and may yet live to reap
the fruits of that curse.

1024
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:29,262
A cup of wine
from the king's own hand.

1025
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,593
I cannot drink it, oh king.

1026
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,668
It is blessed to your gods,
not mine.

1027
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,261
Not so, Daniel.

1028
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,668
<i>I have gone to your people</i>

1029
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,503
and asked for wine
which was blessed by them.

1030
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:47,139
In the cup
I have poured no libation.

1031
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,413
One last gesture
of friendship.

1032
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:54,011
My king.

1033
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:00,087
Good bye, my friend.

1034
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:04,290
Farewell
but perhaps not good bye.

1035
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,698
We have yet to see
what the dawn will bring.

1036
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:22,243
Hear, oh Israel,
Lord our God,

1037
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:30,218
the Lord has won.

1038
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,598
He is angry with us.

1039
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,604
It will fade.

1040
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,768
By tomorrow morning
Daniel will be a distant memory,

1041
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,604
and the king
will need us again.

1042
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,793
Have mercy on me, O God.

1043
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:49,162
No, no,
take it away, all of it!

1044
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:56,142
Tonight I honor Daniel
in silence with fasting.

1045
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,474
Now leave me!

1046
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,615
<i>God, have mercy on me.</i>

1047
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:20,395
In you my soul takes refuge
in the midst of lions,

1048
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:27,573
<i>surrounded by ravenous beasts
with teeth of spears,</i>

1049
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:33,474
with tongues
as sharp as swords.

1050
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:38,177
I call upon your name,
O Lord.

1051
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:44,691
From the depths of the pit,
hear my plea.

1052
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,590
Come near.

1053
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:50,789
You say, "Do not fear."

1054
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:56,700
O Lord, take up my case.

1055
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:00,605
Redeem my life.

1056
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:10,342
Oh, a divine plan,
my friends.

1057
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:13,478
A toast to the lions
who show no partiality

1058
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,750
to a Hebrew
over any other man.

1059
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:12,602
I will extol
the Lord at all times.

1060
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:17,673
His praise
be ever on my lips.

1061
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:26,782
<i>But those
who seek the Lord</i>

1062
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:32,458
will lack
for no good thing.

1063
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:38,800
<i>A righteous man
may have many troubles,</i>

1064
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:44,334
but the Lord rescues him
from them all.

1065
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:58,653
You have rescued me
from the mouth of lions,

1066
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:04,698
<i>and I will declare your name
to rm] brothers.</i>

1067
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:11,728
<i>In the congregation
I will praise you.</i>

1068
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,673
<i>Out of "w way!</i>

1069
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:22,044
Daniel!
Servant of the living God,

1070
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,319
has your God
been able to save you?

1071
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:33,426
Oh king, live forever.

1072
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,496
My God has sent his angel,

1073
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:40,431
and he shut the mouth
of the lions.

1074
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,468
<i>They have not hurt me</i>

1075
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:46,836
because I was
found innocent in his sight.

1076
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,068
Come forth.

1077
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:04,517
Behold, there is
no sign of wound on him,

1078
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,824
for he has
trusted in his God.

1079
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,898
Surely your God
is above all men,

1080
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:17,802
for while you were in the
lions den you were in his hand.

1081
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:25,902
How much must the man pay if he
steals another man's treasure?

1082
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,915
With his hands perhaps.

1083
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,077
But what if that man
who is robbed is the king

1084
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,951
and the treasure
his prized possession?

1085
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,548
Is there any penalty
less than death which will do?

1086
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:41,527
If so, speak now,
and let me consider it.

1087
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,563
But, oh king,
he is a Hebrew.

1088
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,030
Why should you
put such trust in him?

1089
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,431
This Hebrew is the
greatest treasure I possess.

1090
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,832
He speaks to his God,

1091
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,099
and more importantly
his God speaks to him.

1092
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,142
You have deceived me
as to your purpose.

1093
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,708
You fashioned my own words
as a snare above my feet

1094
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:03,113
knowing my edict
could not be reversed,

1095
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:07,643
but the living God,
the God of Daniel,

1096
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,816
has delivered him
out of my hand.

1097
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,828
For 6 days
they have hungered,

1098
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:19,127
but today they shall feed.

1099
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,428
No!

1100
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,833
No, please!

1101
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,427
No!

1102
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,568
Please!
Please wait, king, please!

1103
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,975
You fools.

1104
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,638
Did you not think
I would punish you?

1105
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,043
No, my king.

1106
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,986
They have spread a net
for my feet.

1107
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:48,927
I was bowed down
in distress.

1108
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:53,989
They have dug
a pit in my path,

1109
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:58,766
but they have fallen
into it themselves.

1110
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:04,809
<i>I, Darius, issue a decree
that in every part of my kingdom</i>

1111
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:10,213
people must fear
and reverence the God of Daniel,

1112
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:18,121
for he is the living God,
and he endures forever.

1113
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,159
His kingdom
will not be destroyed.

1114
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,563
His dominion will never end.

1115
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,158
He rescues, and he saves.

1116
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:34,071
He performs signs and wonders
in the heavens and on the earth.

1117
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:45,618
He has rescued Daniel
from the power of the lions.

1118
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:03,225
<i>And sol served
Darius throughout his reign.</i>

1119
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:09,003
<i>However, my heart
stiff longed to see Jerusalem.</i>

1120
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:13,546
<i>For 70 years! had waited,</i>

1121
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:16,640
<i>and I knew
our time was near.</i>

1122
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:27,591
<i>Lord, through your
prophet, Jeremiah,</i>

1123
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,324
"When 70 years are
completed for Babylon,

1124
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:37,901
"I will come to you
and fulfill my gracious promise

1125
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:44,809
and bring you
back to this land."

1126
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,076
My heart
grows with excitement

1127
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,983
that now
that time has come.

1128
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,934
And so your journey
has led you here.

1129
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,897
You have spoken
of three kings:

1130
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,669
Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty;

1131
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,368
Belshazzar, the foolish;

1132
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:22,046
<i>Darius, who was deceived.</i>

1133
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,674
Who is this fourth king?

1134
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:30,121
It is he of whom
these scrolls speak of.

1135
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,193
<i>It is one chosen by
the Most High</i>

1136
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:37,787
<i>to perform great
and mighty deeds</i>

1137
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:42,359
<i>before he was ever
knitted in his mother's womb.</i>

1138
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,333
Hear then, oh king,
the words which were Mitten

1139
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,933
<i>more than 150 years ago,</i>

1140
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:54,674
for these are the words
of the prophet Isaiah,

1141
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,807
son of Amoz.

1142
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:02,322
<i>From the east! summon
a ravenous bird of prey</i>

1143
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:06,723
<i>"from a far off land
to ful?II my purpose.</i>

1144
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:09,762
<i>When I have said,
I will bring about;</i>

1145
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:14,698
what I have planned,
that will I do."

1146
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,738
A bird of prey?

1147
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:22,832
<i>The Lord's chosen will carry
out his purpose against Babylon.</i>

1148
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:26,846
His arm will be against
the Babylonians.

1149
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,848
He pursues them unscathed

1150
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,147
by a path
he has not travelled before.

1151
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:36,848
<i>True,I had never saw
the regions of the Euphrates</i>

1152
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,722
or further westward
until I came in conquest.

1153
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,853
And yet you chased
your enemies uninjured.

1154
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,931
They had no power to rally.

1155
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,728
<i>You were not led into ambush,</i>

1156
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,827
<i>and you were safe as far as
you chose to pursue them,</i>

1157
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,235
were you not?

1158
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,774
That's true.

1159
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:58,868
<i>This is what the
Lord says to his anointed.</i>

1160
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,814
"Cyrus, whose right hand
I take hold of-"

1161
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,850
Cyrus?

1162
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,249
It mentions me by name?

1163
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,310
It does.

1164
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:12,916
<i>To Cyrus,
whose right hand! take hold of</i>

1165
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,755
"to subdue nations
before him,

1166
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,194
"and to strip kings
of their armor,

1167
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,061
<i>to open doors before him</i>

1168
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,261
<i>so that gates
will not be shut.</i>

1169
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:27,330
<i>"I will go before you
and will level the mountains.</i>

1170
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,431
"I will break down
gates of bronze

1171
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,035
"and cut through
bars of iron.

1172

01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,460
<i>And when you
captured Babylon,</i>

1177
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:54,261
<i>their treasures were
the richest in the world,</i>

1178
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,858
were they not?

1179
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:59,928
Oh, indeed they were,
and Croesus will testify.

1180
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,340
Yes, quite
the most magnificent.

1181
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,140
<i>Oh king, if! may.</i>

1182
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:09,339
Please continue.

1183
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:15,353
"Cyrus, for the sake of Jacob
my servant, of Israel my chosen,

1184

01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:40,170
I am the Lord.
There is no other."

1191
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:47,244
And do you understand
that the Most High has the power

1192
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:53,316
to raise up kings
and to throw them down?

1193
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:57,022
Yes, I do.

1194
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,496
I profess it.

1195
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:03,331
<i>And that you, oh king,

Yes, how else to ex plain
my unlikely birth

1199
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:19,411
or my survival
or successes?

1200
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:23,183
How else
might it be explained?

1201
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:29,285
All my life I had always thought
of myself as favored by my gods.

1202
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:35,899
Is it possible that
I've been favored by yours?

1203
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,097
<i>You have answered
your own question, oh king.</i>

1204
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,502
<i>For nearly 2 centuries</i>

1205
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:45,203
the message <i>in</i> this scroll
has awaited your coming.

1206
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,577
This is what the Lord says.

1207
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:53,050
"I am the Lord
who has made all things,

1208
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,088
<i>who alone stretched
out the heavens,</i>

1209
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,315
<i>"who spread out
the earth by myself,</i>

1210
01:21:57,379 --> 01:22:00,019
<i>who foils the signs
of false prophets</i>

1211
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,357
<i>and makes fools of divine-rs,</i>

1212
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,294
<i>"who overthrows
the learning of the wise</i>

1213
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:08,596
"and turns it into nonsense,

1214
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:13,538
"who says of Jerusalem,
It shall be inhabited.

1215
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:17,201
the towns of Judea,
they shall be built,

1216
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:21,509
<i>"and of their ruins,
I will restore them. '</i>

1217
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:27,349
Who says of Cyrus,
He is my shepherd,

1218
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,982
"'and I will accomplish
all that I please.

1219
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,616
"'He will say of Jerusalem.

1220
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:36,559
"Let it be rebuilt,"
and of the temple,

1221
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:40,656
"Let its foundation
be laid.\x22'

1222
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,062
He even calls me
a shepherd,

1223
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:49,438
<i>I, who was saved
by a shepherd's hand?</i>

1224
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:52,478
And I was raised
in a shepherd's house.

1225
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:57,449
It's I who refer to myself
as a shepherd of my people.

1226
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,109
<i>Who else could
have known this</i>

1227
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,951
but the power of God
or his prophet?

1228
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:06,515
Seventy years are over,
my king.

1229
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:12,463
<i>Seventy years since I was
taken from the land of rm] birth.</i>

1230
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,693
<i>Babylon has been punished.</i>

1231
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,163
You have punished her.

1232
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,432
Only one thing remains:

1233
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,532
For you to free her.

1234
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:28,478
Oh <i>king,</i> the
<i>words</i> of the scrolls

1235
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,675
<i>are in a tongue
foreign to us.</i>

1236
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,219
Should we not
at least confirm them?

1237
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,754
No.

1238
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:38,547
Old friend,
have you heard nothing?

1239
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:42,594
<i>Do you not recognize
the truth when you hear it,</i>

1240
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,494
or do you suppose this
Daniel has spent a lifetime

1241
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:52,061
<i>arranging events in the hopes
of one day deceiving me?</i>

1242
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,299
Your God has
called me a shepherd,

1243
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,036
<i>and so to your
people I shall be,</i>

1244
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:00,568
<i>to rescue them
from wolves and tyrants,</i>

1245
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,206
to gather them gently

1246
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,376
and to relieve
them from bondage

1247
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:11,446
and provide for their return.

1248
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,618
And so say I, Cyrus,
king of the Persians,

1249
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:19,597
let Jerusalem be rebuilt.

1250
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:23,794
The Lord God of heaven has given
me all the kingdoms of the earth

1251
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,400
and has appointed for me

1252
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:30,340
to build a temple
in Jerusalem in Judea.

1253
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:34,608
Any one of his people among you,
may his God be with you.

1254
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,807
Let him go to
Jerusalem in Judea

1255
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,052
and build a temple of the Lord,
the God of Israel-

1256
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:45,217
<i>In all my years
I had never known envy,</i>

1257
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:51,355
<i>but that day I came closer
to tasting it than I ever have,</i>

1258
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:56,334
for <i>I would</i> never see the temple
<i>I</i> so yearned to see.

1259
01:24:56,391 --> 01:25:00,134
<i>However, my heart was joyous</i>
as <i>my brothers and sisters</i>

1260
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:05,371
<i>departed on their journey home
while! remained in Babylon</i>

1261
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,811
<i>awaiting the day
when I, too,</i>

1262
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,516
<i>would be gathered
to rm] ancestors.</i>

1263
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,577
And remember me also,
O Lord,

1264
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:19,421
and show mercy
according to your great love.

1265
