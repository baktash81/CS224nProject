32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,642
My lord.

33
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,244
I learn in this letter...

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,019
...that Don Pedro of Aragon...

35
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,924
...comes this night to Messina!

36
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,322
He is very near by this.

37
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,664
He was not three leagues off when I left him.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,000
How many gentlemen have you lost
in this action?

39
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,767
But few of any sort, and none of name.

40
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,709
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed...

41
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:37,112
...much honor on a young Florentine
called Claudio.

42
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,214
He hath borne himself beyond
the promise of his age...

43
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,223
...doing, in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion.

44
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:50,495
Is Signior Mountanto returned
from the wars or no?

45
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,428
I know none of that name, lady.

46
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,365
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

47
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,493
He's returned and as pleasant as ever he was.

48
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,564
I pray you, how many hath he killed
and eaten in these wars?

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,771
But how many hath he killed?

50
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,005
For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

51
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,140
He hath done good service
and a good soldier too, lady.

52
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,276
And a good soldier to a lady.

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,947
-But what is he to a lord?
-A lord to a lord.

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,021
A man to a man,
stuffed with all honorable virtues.

55
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,685
It is so, indeed.

56
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,823
He is no less than a stuffed man.

57
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,661
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

58
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:33,102
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her.

59
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,664
They never meet but there's
a skirmish of wit between them.

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,101
Who is his companion now?

61
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,542
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

62
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,482
He is most in the company
of the right noble Claudio.

63
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,145
O, lord!

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,280
He will hang upon him like a disease.

65
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,557
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,
and the taker runs presently mad.

66
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,128
God help the noble Claudio!

67
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,925
If he have caught the Benedick...

68
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,399
...it will cost him a thousand pound
ere he be cured.

69
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,935
I will keep friends with you, lady.

70
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,700
-Do, good friend.
-You will never run mad, niece.

71
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,637
No, not till a hot January.

72
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,809
Don Pedro is approaching!

73
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,032
Good Signior Leonato,
are you come to meet your trouble.

74
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,710
The fashion of the world is to avoid cost,
and you encounter it.

75
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,575
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of your grace.

76
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,488
My lord.

77
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,327
I think this is your daughter.

78
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,926
Her mother hath many times told me so.

79
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,800
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

80
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,704
Signior Benedick, no!

81
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,477
If Signior Leonato be her father...

82
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,379
...she would not have his head on her shoulders
for all Messina.

83
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,544
I wonder that you will still be talking,
Signior Benedick. Nobody marks you.

84
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,781
What, my dear Lady Disdain!

85
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,452
Are you yet living?

86
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,459
Is it possible disdain should die...

87
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,962
...while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick?

88
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,858
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain
if you come in her presence.

89
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,794
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

90
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,872
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies,
only you excepted...

91
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,171
...and I would I could find in my heart
that I had not a hard heart, for I love none.

92
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,972
A dear happiness to women.

93
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,513
They would else be troubled
with a pernicious suitor.

94
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,448
I thank God and my cold blood,
I am of your humor for that.

95
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:57,386
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.

96
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,685
God keep your ladyship still in that mind...

97
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,421
...so some gentleman or other shall 'scape
a predestinate scratched face.

98
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,961
Scratching could not make it worse,
an 'twere such a face as yours were.

99
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,931
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.

100
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,337
A bird of my tongue is better
than a beast of yours.

101
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,069
I would my horse had
the speed of your tongue! But...

102
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,579
...keep your way, in God's name I have done.

103
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,849
You always end with a jade's trick.

104
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,817
I know you of old.

105
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,616
Signior Claudio, Signior Benedick...

106
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,385
...my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.

107
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,389
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month.

108
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,405
Let me bid you welcome, my lord.

109
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,806
Being reconciled to the prince, your brother...

110
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,309
...I owe you all duty.

111
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,516
I thank you.

112
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,655
I am not of many words...

113
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,257
...but I thank you.

114
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,127
Please it your grace lead on?

115
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,827
Your hand, Leonato, we will go together.

116
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,644
Benedick.

117
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,919
Didst thou note
the daughter of Signior Leonato?

118
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,113
I noted her not, but I looked on her.

119
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,751
Is she not a modest young lady?

120
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,726
Do you question me
for my simple true judgment...

121
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,628
...or would you have me speak after my custom,
a professed tyrant to their sex?

122
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,394
No. I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

123
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,767
Why, ' faith me thinks
she's too low for a high praise...

124
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,966
...too brown for a fair praise,
and too little for a great praise.

125
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,806
This commendation I can afford her,
that were she other, she were unhandsome...

126
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,779
...and being no other but as she is,
I do not like her.

127
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:07,781
Thou thinkest I am in sport.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

128
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,321
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?

129
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,588
Can the world buy such a jewel?

130
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,353
Yea, and a case to put it into.

131
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,229
But speak you this with a sad brow?

132
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,868
In mine eyes,
she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.

133
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,675
I can see yet without spectacles
and I see no such matter.

134
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,245
There's her cousin,
an' she were not possessed with a fury...

135
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,442
...exceeds her as much in beauty as
the first of May doth the last of December.

136
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,686
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband.

137
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,316
Have you?

138
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,521
I would scarce trust myself...

139
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,220
...though I had sworn the contrary...

140
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,896
...if Hero would be my wife.

141
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,031
Is't come to this?

142
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,627
Shall I never see
a bachelor of three-score again?

143
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,567
Gentlemen.

144
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,176
What secret hath held you here,
that you followed not to Leonato's?

145
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,736
He is in love.

146
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,006
With who? That is your grace's part.

147
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,674
With Hero...

148
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,150
...Leonato's short daughter!

149
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,256
Amen, if you love her,
for the lady is very well worthy.

150
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,824
-You speak this to fetch me in.
-By my troth, I speak my thought.

151
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:27,490
-And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
-And, by my two faiths and troths, I spoke mine.

152
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,834
-That I love her, I feel.
-That she is worthy, I know.

153
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,428
That I neither feel how she should be loved
nor know how she is worthy...

154
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,408
...is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me.
I will die in it at the stake.

155
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,604
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty.

156
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,579
That a woman conceived me...

157
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:44,975
...l thank her.

158
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,052
That she brought me up,
I likewise give her most humble thanks.

159
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,917
But that I will hang my...

160
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,748
...bugle in an invisible baldric...

161
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,754
...all women shall pardon me.

162
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,022
I will live a bachelor.

163
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,190
I shall see thee 'ere I die, look pale with love.

164
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,003
With anger, with sickness,
or with hunger, my lord...

165
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,503
...not with love.

166
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,436
Well, as time shall try.

167
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,939
"In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke."

168
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,570
The savage bull may,
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it...

169
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,309
...pluck off the bull's horns
and set them in my forehead.

170
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,716
And let me be vilely painted
and in such great letters as they write:

171
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,880
"Here is good horse to hire,"
let them signify under my sign:

172
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,187
"Here you may see Benedick, the married man."

173
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,386
Benedick.

174
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,796
Repair to Leonato's.

175
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,764
Tell him I will not fail him at supper,
for indeed he hath made great preparation.

176
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,660
Examine your conscience.

177
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,799
And so I leave you.

178
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,737
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

179
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,878
No child but Hero. She's his only heir.

180
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,284
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

181
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,720
My lord,
when you went onward on this ended action...

182
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,622
...I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,
that liked...

183
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,225
...but had a rougher task in hand
than to drive liking to the name of love.

184
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,696
But now...

185
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,027
...I am returned and that war-thoughts
have left their places vacant...

186
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,167
...in their rooms come thronging soft...

187
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,946
...and delicate desires...

188
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,277
...all prompting me how fair young Hero is.

189
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,515
Saying...

190
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,416
...I liked her ere I went to wars.

191
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,489
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
and tire the hearer with a book of words.

192
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,758
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it.

193
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,635
And I will break with her and with her father
and thou shalt have her.

194
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,929
I know we shall have reveling tonight.

195
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,969
I will assume thy part in some disguise and...

196
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,111
...tell fair Hero I am Claudio.

197
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,910
And in her bosom, I'll unclasp my heart...

198
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,813
...and take her hearing prisoner,
with the force and...

199
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,613
...strong encounter of my amorous tale.

200
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,918
Then, after to her father will I break...

201
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,087
...and the conclusion is...

202
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,958
...she shall be thine.

203
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,091
In practice let us put it presently.

204
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,834
What the good-year, my lord.

205
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,671
Why are you thus out of measure sad?

206
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,680
There is no measure
in the occasion that breeds.

207
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,255
Therefore the sadness is without limit.

208
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,418
You should hear reason.

209
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,123
And when I have heard it...

210
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,262
...what blessing brings it?

211
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,064
I cannot hide what I am.

212
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:56,274
I must be sad when I have cause
and smile at no man's jests...

213
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,934
...eat when I have stomach...

214
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,508
...and wait for no man's leisure...

215
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,941
...sleep when I am drowsy...

216
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,880
...and tend on no man's business...

217
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,951
...laugh...

218
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,909
...when I am merry...

219
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,186
...and claw no man in his humor.

220
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:20,856
But you must not make full show of this
till you may do so without controlment.

221
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,433
You have of late
stood out against your brother...

222
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,003
...and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace...

223
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,630
...where it is impossible
you should take true root...

224
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,573
...but by the fair weather that you make yourself.

225
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,803
I had rather be a canker in a hedge...

226
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,881
...than a rose in his grace.

227
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,543
In this, though I cannot be said to be
a flattering, honest man...

228
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,986
...it must not be denied
but I am a plain-dealing villain.

229
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,187
If I had my mouth...

230
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,220
...l would bite.

231
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,560
If I had my liberty...

232
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,697
...l would do my liking.

233
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,927
In the meantime...

234
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:01,101
...let me be that I am and seek not to alter me.

235
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,902
Borachio!

236
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,675
What news?

237
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,874
I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.

238
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,513
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?

239
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,613
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

240
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,691
Who?

241
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,249
-The most exquisite Claudio?
-Even he.

242
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,690
How came you to this?

243
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:29,300
I heard it agreed upon that the prince
should woo Hero for himself...

244
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,201
...and having obtained her,
give her to Count Claudio.

245
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,597
Come.

246
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,809
Come, let us thither.
This may prove food to my displeasure.

247
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,707
That young start-up hath all
the glory of my overthrow.

248
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,239
If I can cross him any way...

249
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,885
...I bless myself every way.

250
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,285
You are both sure...

251
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,851
...and will assist me?

252
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,650
To the death, my lord.

253
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,623
-Shall we go prove what's to be done?
-We'll wait upon your lordship.

254
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,720
-Was not Count John here at supper?
-I saw him not.

255
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,487
How tartly that gentleman looks!

256
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,723
I never can see him but
I am heart-burned an hour after.

257
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,026
He's of a very melancholy disposition.

258
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:55,218
He were an excellent man that were made
just in the midway between him and Benedick.

259
00:20:55,554 --> 00:21:00,423
The one is too like an image and says nothing,
and the other too like my lady's eldest son...

260
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,152
...evermore tattling.

261
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,622
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue...

262
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,596
...in Count John's mouth...

263
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:12,534
...and half count John's melancholy
in Signior Benedick's face.

264
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,666
With a good leg.

265
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,102
And a good foot, uncle.

266
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,037
And money enough in his purse.

267
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,238
Such a man would win any woman in the world.

268
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,813
If he could get her good will.

269
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,753
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee
a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

270
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,561
Lord, I could not endure a husband
with a beard on his face.

271
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,223
I'd rather lie in the woolen.

272
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,029
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.

273
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,831
And what should I do with him?

274
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,395
Dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman?

275
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,940
He that hath a beard is more than a youth.

276
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,409
And he that hath no beard is less than a man.

277
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,709
And he that is more than a youth is not for me.

278
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,582
And he that is less than a man, I am not for him.

279
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,147
Yet in faith, she's too cursed.

280
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,917
Well, then, go you into hell?

281
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,049
No, but to the gate.

282
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,254
And there will the devil meet me
like an old cuckold...

283
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,729
...with horns on his head, and say:

284
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,527
"Get you to heaven, Beatrice.

285
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,466
"Here's no place for you maids

286
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,265
So away to Saint Peter for the heavens.

287
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,408
He shows me where the bachelors sit.

288
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,543
And there live we as merry as the day is long.

289
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,315
Well, niece,
I hope you will be ruled by your father.

290
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,489
Yes, faith,
it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy...

291
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,615
...and say, "Father, as it please you."

292
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,822
But yet for all that, cousin,
let him be a handsome fellow...

293
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,031
...or else make another curtsy
and say, "Father, as it please me."

294
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,533
Daughter...

295
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,968
...remember what I told you.

296
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,208
If the prince do solicit you in that kind...

297
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,240
...you know your answer.

298
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,754
Well, niece.

299
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,849
I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.

300
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,659
Not till God make men
of some other metal than earth.

301
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,199
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

302
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,737
I have a good eye, uncle.
I can see a church by daylight.

303
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,940
The revellers are entering!

304
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,051
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

305
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,385
I know you well enough.
You are Signior Antonio.

306
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,181
At a word, I am not.

307
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,418
I know you by the waggling of your head.

308
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,822
At a word, I am not.

309
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:26,694
Come, come, do you think I do not know you
by your excellent wit?

310
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,091
Can virtue hide itself?

311
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,863
Go to, mum, you are he.

312
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,131
Graces will appear, and there's an end.

313
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,806
Well, I would you did like me.

314
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,439
So would not I, for I have many ill qualities.

315
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,178
-Which is one?
-I say my prayers aloud.

316
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,524
-Will you not tell me who told you, sir?
-No, you shall pardon me.

317
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,064
-Nor will you not tell me who you are?
-Not now.

318
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,261
That I was disdainful...

319
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,201
...and that I had my good wit
out of the "Hundred Merry Tales."

320
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,997
Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.

321
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,507
What's he?

322
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,578
I'm sure you know him well enough.

323
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,075
Not I, believe me.

324
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,671
Did he never make you laugh?

325
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,013
I pray you, what is he?

326
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,848
Why, he is the prince's jester.

327
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,855
A very dull fool.

328
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,660
His only gift is in devising impossible slanders.

329
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,593
None but libertines delight in him,
for he both pleases men and angers them...

330
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,768
...and then they laugh at him and beat him.

331
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,500
I am sure he is in the fleet.

332
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,842
I would he had boarded me.

333
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,079
When I know the gentleman,
I'll tell him what you say.

334
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,307
Do.

335
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,888
We must follow the leaders.

336
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,219
In every good thing.

337
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,181
Are not you Signior Benedick?

338
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,953
You know me well. I am he.

339
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,326
Signior,
you are very near my brother in his love.

340
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,462
He is enamoured on Hero.

341
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,701
I pray you, dissuade him from her.
She is no equal for his birth.

342
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,595
How know you he loves her?

343
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,908
I heard him swear his affection.

344
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,240
So did I, too.
And he swore he would marry her tonight.

345
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,979
Come, let us to the banquet.

346
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,260
Thus answer I in name of Benedick...

347
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,191
...but hear these ill news
with the ears of Claudio.

348
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,064
'Tis certain so...

349
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,606
...the prince woos for himself!

350
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:31,009
Friendship is constant in all other things...

351
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,313
...save in the office and affairs of love.

352
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,886
This is an accident of hourly proof...

353
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,622
...which I mistrusted not.

354
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,656
Farewell, therefore, Hero!

355
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,904
-Count Claudio?
-Yea, the same.

356
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,700
-Come, will you go with me?
-Whither?

357
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,399
About your own business.

358
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,673
-The prince hath got your Hero!
-I wish him joy of her!

359
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,146
Did you think the prince
would have served you thus?

360
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,841
I pray you, leave me.

361
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,748
Alas, poor hurt fowl!

362
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,316
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me,
and not know me!

363
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,628
The prince's fool?

364
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,021
I am not so reputed.

365
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,425
It is the base, the bitter disposition of Beatrice...

366
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,994
...that puts the world into her person
and so gives me out.

367
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,031
Well...

368
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,738
...I'll be revenged as I may.

369
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,840
Now, signior, where's the count?

370
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,610
Troth, my lord, I found him here
as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.

371
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,583
I told him, and I think I told him true...

372
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,213
...that your grace had got the good will
of this young lady.

373
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,019
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.

374
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,063
The gentleman that danced with her
told her she is much wronged by you.

375
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,066
She misused me past the endurance of a block!

376
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:02,037
She told me, not thinking I had been myself,
that I was the prince's jester...

377
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,071
...that I was duller than a great thaw...

378
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,407
...huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me...

379
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,538
...that I stood like a man at a mark...

380
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,616
...with a whole army shooting at me.

381
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,447
She speaks poniards...

382
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,712
...and every word stabs.

383
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,656
If her breath were terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her.

384
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,694
She would infect to the North Star.

385
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:28,664
So, indeed, all disquiet,
horror and perturbation follows her.

386
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,991
Look, here she comes.

387
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,863
Will your grace command me any service
to the world's end?

388
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,671
I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes...

389
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,747
...that you can devise to send me on.

390
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:47,181
I will fetch you a hair off
the Great Cham's beard...

391
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,615
...do you any embassage to the Pigmies...

392
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:55,724
...rather than hold three words'
conference with this harpy.

393
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,623
You have no employment for me?

394
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,762
None, but to desire your good company!

395
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,298
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not.

396
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,168
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue!

397
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,202
Come, lady, come.

398
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,673
You have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

399
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,539
Indeed, my lord.

400
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,675
He lent it me awhile.

401
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,315
And I gave him use for it...

402
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,956
...a double heart for his single one.

403
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,891
Marry, once before he won it of me,
with false dice.

404
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,125
Therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

405
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,099
You have put him down, lady,
you have put him down.

406
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,862
So I would not he should do me, my lord...

407
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,539
...lest I should prove the mother of fools.

408
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,180
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.

409
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,650
Why, how now, Count, wherefore art thou sad?

410
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,279
Not sad, my lord.

411
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,714
-How then? Sick?
-Neither, my lord.

412
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,815
The count is neither sad, nor sick...

413
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,585
...nor merry, nor well...

414
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,261
...but civil count...

415
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,459
...civil as an orange,
and something of that jealous complexion.

416
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,060
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true...

417
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,505
...though I'll be sworn, if he be so,
his conceit is false.

418
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,576
Here, Claudio.

419
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,012
I have wooed in thy name...

420
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,947
...and fair Hero is won.

421
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,114
I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained.

422
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,385
Name the day of marriage...

423
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,856
...and God give thee joy.

424
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,122
Count, take of me my daughter...

425
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,591
...and with her my fortunes.

426
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,458
His grace hath made the match...

427
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,235
...and all grace say Amen to it.

428
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,835
Speak, Count...

429
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,145
...'tis your cue.

430
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,653
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

431
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,216
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.

432
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,615
Lady...

433
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,956
...as you are mine...

434
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,093
...I am yours.

435
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,836
Speak, cousin!

436
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:25,171
Or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss,
and let not him speak neither.

437
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,421
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

438
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,092
Yea, my lord, I thank it.

439
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,357
Poor fool.

440
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,726
It keeps on the windy side of care.

441
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,330
My cousin tells him in his ear
that he is in her heart.

442
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,507
And so she doth, cousin.

443
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,946
Good Lord, for alliance!

444
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:12,919
Thus goes everyone to the world but I,
and I am sunburnt.

445
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,018
I may sit in a corner
and cry heigh-ho for a husband.

446
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,931
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

447
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,500
I would rather have one of your father's getting.

448
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,297
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?

449
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,000
Your father got excellent husbands,
if a maid could come by them.

450
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,274
Will you have me, lady?

451
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,106
No, my lord...

452
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,548
...unless I might have another for working-days.

453
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,086
Your grace is too costly to wear every day.

454
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:53,463
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me.
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

455
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,228
Your silence most offends me...

456
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,030
...and to be merry best becomes you...

457
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,608
...for, out of question,
you were born in a merry hour.

458
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,542
No, sure, my lord...

459
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,271
...my mother cried.

460
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,182
But then there was a star danced...

461
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,913
...and under that was I born.

462
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,887
Cousins.

463
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,889
God give you joy!

464
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,701
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

465
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,870
There's little of the melancholy element in her.

466
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,878
She is never sad but when she sleeps,
and not ever then...

467
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,474
...for I've heard my daughter say
she hath often dreamt of unhappiness...

468
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,850
...and waked herself with laughing.

469
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,824
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

470
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,951
By no means.

471
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,393
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

472
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,596
If they were but a week married,
they would talk themselves mad.

473
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,305
-Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
-Tomorrow, my lord.

474
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:14,341
Not till Monday, my dear son,
which is hence a just seven-night...

475
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,912
...and a time too brief, too,
to have all things answer my mind.

476
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,246
I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.

477
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,717
I will, in the interim,
undertake one of Hercules' labors...

478
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,689
...which is to bring Signior Benedick
and the Lady Beatrice...

479
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,852
...into a mountain of affection,
the one with the other.

480
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,290
I would fain have it a match,
and I doubt not but to fashion it...

481
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,300
...if you minister such assistance
as I give you direction.

482
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:42,702
My lord, I am for you,
though it cost me 10 nights' watchings.

483
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,240
And I, my lord.

484
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,502
And you, too, gentle Hero?

485
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,376
I will do any modest office, my lord,
to help my cousin to a good husband.

486
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,811
If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer.

487
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:58,184
His glory shall be ours,
for we are the only love-gods.

488
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,623
Go with me, I will tell you my drift.

489
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,447
I do much wonder...

490
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,352
...that one man...

491
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:36,256
...seeing how much another man is a fool
when he dedicates his behaviors to love...

492
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,319
...will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others...

493
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:44,492
...become the argument of
his own scorn by falling in love.

494
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,963
And such a man is Claudio.

495
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:55,036
I have known when there was no music with him
but the drum and the fife...

496
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,506
...and now would he rather hear
the tabor and the pipe.

497
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,379
I have known when he would have
walked 10 mile afoot to see a good armor.

498
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:07,446
And now will he lie 10 nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

499
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:12,456
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,
like an honest man and a soldier.

500
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,162
Now is he turned orthography.

501
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,427
His words are a very fantastical banquet...

502
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,002
...just so many strange dishes.

503
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:27,909
May I be so converted, and see with these eyes?
I cannot tell. I think not.

504
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,572
I will not be sworn...

505
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,707
...but love may transform me to an oyster.

506
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,943
But I'll take my oath on it,
till he hath made an oyster of me...

507
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,488
...he shall never make me such a fool.

508
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,956
One woman is fair, yet I am well.

509
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,128
Another is wise, yet I am well.
Another, virtuous, yet I am well.

510
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,824
But till all graces be in one woman...

511
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:52,094
...one woman shall not come in my grace.

512
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,096
Rich she shall be, that's certain.

513
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,637
Wise, or I'll none.

514
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,645
Virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her.

515
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,974
Fair, or I'll never look on her.

516
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,315
Mild...

517
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,882
...or come not near me.

518
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,421
Of good discourse. An excellent musician.

519
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,350
And her hair...

520
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,558
...shall be...

521
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,759
...of what color it please God.

522
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,366
The prince and Monsieur Love.

523
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,563
I will hide me.

524
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,955
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

525
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,722
Very well, my lord.

526
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,862
Come, Balthasar.

527
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,956
We'll hear that song again.

528
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,742
Now, divine air.

529
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,637
Now is his soul ravished!

530
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:14,407
Is it not strange that sheeps' guts
should hale souls out of men's bodies?

531
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,224
"Sigh no more, ladies

532
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,520
"Sigh no more

533
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:28,294
"Men were deceivers ever

534
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,196
"One foot in sea

535
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,269
"and one on shore

536
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:39,332
"To one thing constant never

537
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,412
"Then sigh not so

538
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,175
"but let them go

539
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,183
"And be you blithe

540
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,583
"and bonny

541
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:55,648
"Converting all your sounds of woe

00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:03,832
"Into Hey nonny, nonny

543
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,300
"Sing no more ditties

544
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,404
"Of dumps so dull and heavy

545
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,041
"The fraud of men

546
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,312
"was ever so

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,253
"Since summer

00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,847

"And be you blithe and bonny

00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,932
"Converting all

"your sounds of woe

00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:52,705
"Into Hey nonny, nonny"

555
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,850
-By my troth, a good song.
-And an ill singer, my lord.

556
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,723
No, no, faith, thou singest well enough.

557
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:08,525
An' he had been a dog that should have
howled thus, they'd have hanged him.

558
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,133
Come hither, Leonato.

559
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,365
What was it you told me of today?

560
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,840
That your niece Beatrice was
in love with Signior Benedick?

561
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,574
I did never think that lady
would have loved any man.

562
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,049
No, nor I neither.

563
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,744
But most wonderful that
she should so dote on Signior Benedick...

564
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,887
...whom she hath in all outward behaviors
seemed ever to abhor.

565
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,052
Is it possible?

566
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,121
Maybe she doth but counterfeit?

567
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,063
Faith, like enough.

568
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,930
O, God!

569
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,567
Counterfeit?

570
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:52,233
There was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion...

571
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,277
...as she discovers it.

572
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,304
Why?

573
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,344
What effects of passion shows she?

574
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,176
Bait the hook well. This fish will bite.

575
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,479
What effects, my lord?

576
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,624
-You heard my daughter tell you how.
-She did, indeed.

577
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,361
How, I pray you?

578
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,036
You amaze me!

579
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:33,349
I should think this a trick,
but that the gray-bearded fellow speaks it.

580
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,543
Hath she made her affection
known to Benedick?

581
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,419
No, and swears she never will.
That's her torment.

582
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,190
She'll be up 20 times a night...

583
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,729
...and there she'll sit in her smock
till she have writ a sheet of paper.

584
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,390
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps...

585
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,898
...sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, curses:

586
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,131
"O sweet Benedick!

587
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,964
"God give me patience!"

588
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,544
She doth indeed, my daughter says so.

589
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,739
My daughter is sometime afeared...

590
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,282
...that she will do a desperate outrage to herself.

591
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,711
It is very true.

592
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,347
-It were good that Benedick knew of it.
-To what end?

593
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,427
He would make but a sport of it
and torment the poor lady worse.

594
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,893
I'm sorry for her.

595
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:23,096
I pray you, tell Benedick of it,
and hear what he will say.

596
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,428
Were it good, think you?

597
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,503
Hero thinks surely she will die...

598
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,332
...for she says she will die if he love her not...

599
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,740
...and she will die, ere she make her love known,
and she will die, if he woo her.

600
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:40,149
If she should make tender of her love,
'tis very possible he'll scorn it...

601
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,981
...for the man, as you know all,
hath a contemptible spirit.

602
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,831
I love Benedick well...

603
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,699
...and I could wish he would
modestly examine himself...

604
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,300
...to see how much he is unworthy...

605
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,873
...so good a lady.

606
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,010
My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.

607
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,114
If he do not dote on her upon this,
I will never trust my expectation.

608
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,629
Let the same net be spread for her, and that
must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry.

609
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,163
Let us send Beatrice to call him in to dinner.

610
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,774
This can be no trick.

611
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,914
The conference was sadly borne.

612
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,207
They have the truth of this from Hero.

613
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,718
Love me?

614
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,517
Why...

615
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,892
...it must be requited.

616
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,157
I hear how I am censured.

617
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:07,203
They say I will bear myself proudly
if I perceive the love come from her.

618
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:12,241
They say, too, that she will rather die
than give any sign of affection.

619
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,904
I did never think to marry.

620
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,079
I must not seem proud.

621
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,745
Happy are they that hear their detractions
and can put them to mending.

622
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,220
They say the lady is fair.
I can bear them witness.

623
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,814
And virtuous, 'tis so, I cannot reprove it.

624
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,895
And wise, but for loving me.

625
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,395
By my troth, it is no addition to her wit...

626
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,292
...nor no great argument of her folly...

627
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,962
...for I will be...

628
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,632
...horribly in love with her.

629
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,770
I may chance have some odd quirks...

630
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,144
...and remnants of wit broken on me...

631
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,242
...because I have railed
so long against marriage.

632
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,546
But doth not the appetite alter?

633
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,593
A man loves the meat in his youth
that he cannot endure in his age.

634
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:09,598
Shall these quips and sentences
and paper bullets of the brain...

635
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,897
...awe a man from the career of his humor?

636
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,593
No.

637
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,367
The world must be peopled.

638
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,710
When I said I would die a bachelor...

639
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,441
...l did not think I should live...

640
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,543
...till I were married.

641
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,019
Here comes Beatrice!

642
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,424
By this day, she's a fair lady.

643
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,256
I do spy some...

644
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,267
...marks of love in her.

645
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,080
Against my will I am sent to bid you
come in to dinner.

646
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,018
Fair Beatrice.

647
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,221
I thank you for your pains.

648
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,095
I took no more pains for those thanks...

649
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,029
...than you take pains to thank me.

650
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,034
If it had been painful, I would not have come.

651
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,965
You take pleasure, then, in the message?

652
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,039
Yea.

653
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,067
Just so much as you may take
upon a knife's point.

654
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,881
You have no stomach, signior? Fare you well.

655
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,966
"Against my will, I am sent...

656
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,228
"...to bid you come in to dinner."

657
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,775
There's a double meaning in that.

658
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,683
But are you sure that Benedick
loves Beatrice so entirely?

659
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,621
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.

660
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,520
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

661
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,223
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it.

662
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,831
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick...

663
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,994
...to wish him wrestle with affection
and never let Beatrice know.

664
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,298
Why did you so?

665
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,068
Doth he not deserve as full as fortunate
a bed as Beatrice shall couch upon?

666
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:37,112
O God of love! I know he doth deserve
as much as may be yielded to a man.

667
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:42,083
But nature never framed a woman's heart
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.

668
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,416
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes...

669
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,959
...misprising what they look on,
and her wit values itself so highly...

670
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,358
...that to her all matter else seems weak.

671
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,086
She cannot love.

672
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,492
Sure, I think so.

673
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,734
-Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
-No.

674
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:03,132
Rather I will go to Benedick
and counsel him to fight against his passion.

675
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,708
Do not do your cousin such a wrong.

676
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,403
She cannot be so much without true judgment...

677
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,772
...having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is prized to have...

678
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,214
...to refuse such a gentleman
as Signior Benedick.

679
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,183
He is the only man of Italy.

680
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,220
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

681
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,084
-When are you married, madam?
-Why, every day.

682
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,659
Tomorrow!

683
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:35,661
She's limed, I warrant you.
We have caught her, madam.

684
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,872
If it prove so, then loving goes by haps.

685
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,636
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

686
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,645
What fire is in mine ears?

687
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,745
Can this be true?

688
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,583
Stand I condemned for pride
and scorn so much?

689
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,457
Contempt, farewell.

690
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,059
And maiden pride, adieu.

691
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,495
No glory lives behind the back of such.

692
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,262
And, Benedick...

693
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,072
...love on.

694
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,210
I will requite thee.

695
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,844
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.

696
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:22,112
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee...

697
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,313
...to bind our loves up in a holy band.

698
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:29,658
For others say thou dost deserve, and l...

699
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,759
...believe it...

700
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,392
...better than reportingly.

701
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,285
Are you good men and true?

702
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,860
Yea!

703
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,689
Being chosen for the prince's watch...

704
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,191
...this is your charge.

705
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,802
You are to bid any man stand,
in the prince's name.

706
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,965
How if he will not stand?

707
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,174
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go.

708
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:33,281
If he will not stand when he is bidden,
he is none of the prince's subjects.

709
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,375
True!

710
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,148
And they are to meddle with none
but the prince's subjects.

711
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,496
You shall also make no noise in the streets.

712
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,937
We will rather sleep than talk.

713
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,168
You speak like an ancient...

714
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,440
...and a most quiet watchman...

715
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,439
...for I cannot see how sleeping should offend.

716
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,748
If you meet a thief...

717
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,721
...you may suspect him,
by virtue of your office...

718
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,792
...to be no true man...

719
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,290
...and, for such kind of men...

720
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:27,968
...the less you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your...

721
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,036
...honesty.

722
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,538
You have been always called
a merciful man, partner.

723
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:38,205
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will...

724
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,714
...much more a man
who hath any honesty in him.

725
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,308
'Tis very true.

726
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,288
Well, masters.

727
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,534
Good night.

728
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,737
An' there be any matter of weight chances...

729
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,764
...call up me.

730
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,836
Come, neighbor.

731
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,246
We hear our charge.

732
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,786
Let us sit here upon the bench till 2:00,
and then all to bed.

733
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,181
One word more, honest neighbors.

734
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,950
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door...

735
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,558
...for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight.

736
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:32,862
Adieu.

737
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,568
Be vigitant, I beseech you.

738
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,470
It is so.

739
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,011
The Count Claudio shall marry
the daughter of Leonato.

740
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,810
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.

741
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:25,081
Any bar, any cross, any impediment
will be medicinable to me.

742
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,053
I am sick in displeasure to him...

743
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,923
...and whatsoever comes athwart
his affection ranges evenly with mine.

744
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,892
How canst thou cross this marriage?

745
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,933
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly
that no dishonesty shall appear in me.

746
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,501
Show me briefly how.

747
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:43,868
I think I told your lordship a year since,
how much I am in the favor of Margaret...

748
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,464
-...the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
-I remember.

749
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,340
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night...

750
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,006
...appoint her to look out
at her lady's chamber window.

751
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,549
What life is in that
to be the death of this marriage?

752
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,017
Well, the poison of that lies in you to temper.

753
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,410
Gallants.

754
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,518
I am not...

755
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,512
...as I have been.

756
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,051
So say l.

757
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,417
Methinks you are sadder.

758
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,429
I hope he be in love.

759
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,664
Old signior, walk aside with me.

760
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,929
I have studied some wise words
to speak to you...

761
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,470
...which these hobby-horses must not hear.

762
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,808
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

763
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,649
My lord and brother, God save you.

764
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,280
Good e'en, brother.

765
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,854
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.

766
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:06,979
In private?

767
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,526
If it please you. Yet Claudio may hear.
What I'd speak of concerns him.

768
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,992
What's the matter?

769
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,932
You may think I love you not.

770
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:25,370
Let that appear hereafter,
and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.

771
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,470
-Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?
-You know he does.

772
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,147
I know not that, when he knows what I know.

773
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,931
Hero!

774
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,614
The lady is disloyal.

775
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,953
If you love her now, tomorrow wed her.

776
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:14,546
But it would better fit your honor
to change your mind.

777
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,500
Conrade!

778
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,511
What, Conrade!

779
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,303
Conrade, I say.

780
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,639
Here, man, I am at thy elbow.

781
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,345
Mass, and my elbow itched,
I thought there would a scab follow.

782
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,254
I will owe thee an answer for that.

783
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,358
And now forward with thy tale.

784
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,363
-Sit close, then.
-Some treason, masters.

785
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:56,796
I know him!

786
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:01,661
I have, tonight, wooed Margaret...

787
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,373
...the Lady Hero's gentlewoman...

788
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:06,899
...by the name of Hero.

789
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,844
I shall first tell thee how the prince,
Claudio, and my master...

790
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,552
...planted by my master, Don John...

791
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,382
...saw this...

792
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,823
...amiable encounter.

793
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,287
And thought they Margaret was Hero?

794
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,523
Aye, and away went Claudio, enraged.

795
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:32,367
We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!

796
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,698
Call up the right master constable.

797
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,364
We have here recovered...

798
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,239
...the most dangerous piece of lechery
that was ever known in the commonwealth.

799
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,904
-Masters!
-Never speak.

800
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,256
There, sir.

801
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,757
What would you with me, neighbors?

802
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,666
Sir, our watch tonight,
excepting your worship's presence...

803
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,229
...hath ta'en a couple of
as arrant knaves as any in Messina.

804
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,641
A good old man, sir. He will be talking.

805
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,374
As they say, when the age is in, the wit is out.

806
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,847
Well said, i' faith, neighbor Verges.

807
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,945
Well, God's a good man.

808
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,116
An' two men ride of a horse,
one must ride behind.

809
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,997
-All men are not alike, alas, good neighbor.
-Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.

810
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,627
Gifts that God gives!

811
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,527
Neighbors, you are tedious.

812
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,197
It pleases your worship to say so...

813
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,077
...but we are the poor duke's officers.

814
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:53,444
But truly, for mine own part,
if I were as tedious as a king...

815
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,716
...l could find in my heart to bestow it all...

816
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,189
...on your worship.

817
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,988
All thy tediousness on me?

818
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:13,159
I would fain know what you have to say.

819
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:17,137
Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended
two auspicious persons...

820
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,573
...and we would this morning
have them examined before your worship.

821
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,810
Take their examination yourself, and bring it me.

822
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:27,144
I am now in great haste,
as it may appear unto you.

823
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,479
Drink some wine ere you go.

824
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,517
We are now to examination these men.

825
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,625
Meet me at the jail.

826
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,249
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

827
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:43,886
No.

828
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:47,926
To be married to her.

829
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,628
You come to marry her.

830
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,035
Lady...

831
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,604
...you come hither to be married to this count.

832
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,504
I do.

833
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:04,037
If either of you have any inward impediment
why you should not be conjoined...

834
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,583
...l charge you, on your souls, to utter it.

835
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,251
-Know you any, Hero?
-None, my lord.

836
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,414
-Know you any, count?
-I dare make his answer, none.

837
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,282
Stand thee by, friar.

838
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,326
Father, by your leave...

839
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,261
...will you, with free, unconstrained soul,
give me this maid, your daughter?

840
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,995
As freely, son, as God did give her me.

841
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:31,506
And what have I to give you back,
whose worth may counterpoise this...

842
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,863
...rich...

843
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,700
...and precious gift?

844
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,575
Nothing, unless you render her again.

845
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,840
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.

846
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,978
There, Leonato, take her back again!

847
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,580
Give not this rotten orange to your friend.

848
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:53,890
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor.

849
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,165
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

850
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,928
Would you not swear...

851
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,699
...all you that see her, that she were a maid,
by these exterior shows?

852
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,706
But she is none!

853
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,336
She knows the heat...

854
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,578
...of a luxurious bed!

855
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,547
-What do you mean, my lord?
-Not to be married...

856
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,616
...not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

857
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:18,876
No!

858
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,482
Dear my lord...

859
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,757
...if you, in your own proof...

860
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,088
...have vanquished the resistance of her youth...

861
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:32,823
-...and made defeat of her virginity--
-No, Leonato!

862
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,303
I never tempted her with word too large.

863
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,976
But...

864
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,871
...as a brother to his sister...

865
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:47,480
...showed bashful sincerity and comely love.

866
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,184
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?

867
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,014
You seem to me as Dian in her orb.

868
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:58,521
But you are more intemperate in your blood
than Venus...

869
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,789
...or those pampered animals...

870
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,096
...that rage in savage sensuality.

871
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,869
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

872
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:13,305
-Sweet prince, why speak not you?
-What should I speak?

873
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:17,503
I stand dishonored, that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale.

874
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,141
No!

875
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,747
What man was he talked with you yesternight...

876
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,520
...out at your window betwixt 12:00 and 1:00?

877
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,615
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

878
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,627
Why, then you are no maiden.

879
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,659
Leonato, I'm sorry you must hear.

880
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:40,566
Upon mine honor, myself, my brother
and this grieved count did see her...

881
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:43,599
...hear her, at that hour last night...

882
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:48,373
...talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain...

883
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:53,141
...confessed the vile encounters they have had
1,000 times in secret.

884
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:56,877
How now, cousin!

885
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,148
Come, let us go.

886
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,985
These things, come thus to light,
smother her spirits up.

887
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,123
Cousin, wherefore sink you down?

888
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,097
Hath no man's dagger here...

889
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,705
...a point for me?

890
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,041
Do not live, Hero!

891
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,977
Do not ope thine eyes!

892
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:31,276
Hero!

893
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,318
Grieved l, I had but one?

894
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,487
Why had I one?

895
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,324
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?

896
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,459
Leonato!

897
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:49,168
-She is fallen into a pit of ink.
-Sir, be patient.

898
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:54,099
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
I know not what to say.

899
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,171
On my soul, my cousin is belied!

900
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,247
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

901
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,808
No, truly not, although, until last night,
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

902
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,387
Confirmed!

903
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,656
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie?

904
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,257
Hence from her! Let her die!

905
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,066
Hear me a little.

906
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,432
Lady, what man is he you are accused of?

907
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,469
They know that do accuse me. I know none.

908
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,871
There is some strange misprision in the princes.

909
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,912
Two of them have the very bent of honor.

910
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:35,143
If their wisdom's been misled in this,
the practice of it lives in John the bastard.

911
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:39,620
If they wrong her honor,
the proudest of them shall well hear of it.

912
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,818
Pause awhile,
and let my counsel sway you in this case.

913
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,060
Your daughter here the princes left for dead.

914
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,733
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
and publish it...

915
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,065
...that she is dead indeed.

916
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,397
What shall become of this?

917
01:07:57,706 --> 01:08:01,005
She dying, as it must be so maintained...

918
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,806
...upon the instant that she was accused...

919
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,405
...shall be lamented, pitied...

920
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,485
...and excused of every hearer.

921
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,679
So will it fare with Claudio.

922
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:16,349
When he shall hear she died upon his words...

923
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,826
...the idea of her life...

924
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,489
...shall sweetly creep into
his study of imagination...

925
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,325
...and every lovely organ of her life...

926
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:30,471
...shall come appareled in more precious habit,
than when she lived indeed.

927
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,999
Then shall he mourn...

928
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,901
...and wish he had not so accused her.

929
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,280
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.

930
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,578
Being that I flow in grief...

931
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,818
...the smallest twine may lead me.

932
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,619
'Tis well consented.

933
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,517
Presently away.

934
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,025
Come, lady.

935
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,565
Die to live.

936
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,733
This wedding-day perhaps is but prolonged.

937
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,998
Have patience and endure.

938
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,625
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

939
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,795
Yea...

940
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,605
-...and I will weep a while longer.
-I will not desire that.

941
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,506
You have no reason. I do it freely.

942
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,205
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

943
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:49,441
How much might the man deserve of me
that would right her!

944
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,452
Is there any way to show such friendship?

945
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,387
A very even way, but no such friend.

946
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,616
May a man do it?

947
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,650
It is a man's office...

948
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,789
...but not yours.

949
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,061
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.

950
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,898
Is not that strange?

951
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,674
As strange as the thing I know not.

952
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,869
It were as possible for me to say
I loved nothing so well as you.

953
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,309
But believe me not.

954
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,945
And yet I lie not.

955
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,647
I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing.

956
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:31,489
-I am sorry for my cousin.
-By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

957
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,159
Do not swear, and eat it.

958
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:39,166
I will swear by it that you love me, and I
will make him eat it that says I love not you.

959
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,363
Why, then, God forgive me!

960
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,166
What offence, sweet Beatrice?

961
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,867
You have stayed me in a happy hour.

962
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:51,545
-I was about to protest I loved you.
-And do it with all thy heart.

963
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,750
I love you with so much of my heart
that none is left to protest.

964
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:02,958
Come.

965
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,452
Bid me do anything for thee.

966
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,429
Kill Claudio.

967
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:17,128
Not for the wide world.

968
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,434
You kill me to deny it.

969
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,872
-Fare thee well.
-Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

970
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,412
I am gone, though I am here.

971
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:26,913
There is no love in you.

972
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,745
-Nay, I pray you, let me go.
-Beatrice!

973
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,012
-In faith, I will go.
-We'll be friends first.

974
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,920
You dare easier be friends with me
than fight with mine enemy.

975
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,821
Is Claudio thine enemy?

976
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,723
Is he not approved in the height a villain...

977
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,261
...that hath slandered, scorned,
dishonored my kinswoman?

978
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,595
O, that I were a man!

979
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:46,668
What...

980
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,531
...bear her in hand until they come
to take hands...

981
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,164
...and then, with public accusation...

982
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,802
...uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor....

983
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,142
O God, that I were a man!

984
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,546
I would eat his heart in the marketplace!

985
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,448
Hear me, Beatrice.

986
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,255
Talk with a man out at a window.

987
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,248
-A proper saying!
-Nay, but, Beatrice--

988
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,987
Sweet Hero.

989
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:18,324
She is wronged, she is slandered...

990
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,667
...she is undone!

991
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:26,374
He is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it.

992
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:34,376
I cannot be a man with wishing...

993
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:39,512
...therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

994
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,115
By this hand, I love thee.

995
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:46,353
Use it for my love some other way
than swearing by it.

996
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,296
Think you in your soul
the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

997
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,760
Yea.

998
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,503
As sure as I have a thought...

999
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,932
...or a soul.

1000
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,277
Enough.

1001
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,169
I am engaged.

1002
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,978
I will challenge him.

1003
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:10,919
Go.

1004
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,349
Comfort your cousin.

1005
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,681
I must say she is dead.

1006
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,627
And so...

1007
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,557
...farewell.

1008
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,934
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

1009
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,238
Which be the malefactors?

1010
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,444
Marry, that am l...

1011
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:17,810
...and my partner.

1012
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,253
But which are the offenders
that are to be examined?

1013
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,622
What is your name, friend?

1014
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,756
Borachio.

1015
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,335
Write down, Borachio.

1016
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,971
-Yours, sirrah?
-I am a gentleman, sir.

1017
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,746
And my name is Conrade.

1018
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:52,451
Write down, master gentleman Conrade.

1019
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:55,523
Masters, it is proved already that you are...

1020
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,386
...little better than false knaves.

1021
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,890
How answer you for yourselves?

1022
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,595
Marry, sir...

1023
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,092
...we say we are none.

1024
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:07,991
You.

1025
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,095
Sir, I say to you, we are none.

1026
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,806
Have you writ down, they are none?

1027
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,435
Master constable,
you go not the way to examine.

1028
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:20,912
You must call forth the watch
that are their accusers.

1029
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,650
Let the watch come forth.

1030
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:28,382
Masters, I charge you, in the prince's name,
accuse these men.

1031
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:32,854
This man said, sir, that Don John,
the prince's brother, was a villain.

1032
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,292
-Write down Prince John a villain.
-Master constable.

1033
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,593
Pray thee, fellow, peace.

1034
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,533
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.

1035
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,175
-What heard you him say else?
-Marry.

1036
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,872
That he had received 1,000 ducats of Don John...

1037
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,107
...for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

1038
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:58,016
-Flat burglary as ever was committed.
-Yea, by mass, that it is.

1039
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,982
-What else?
-And that Count Claudio did mean...

1040
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,556
...upon his words...

1041
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:06,754
...to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly,
and not marry her.

1042
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:10,730
Thou wilt be condemned
into everlasting redemption for this.

1043
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,661
-What else?
-This is all.

1044
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:19,138
Prince John is, this morning,
secretly stolen away.

1045
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:24,068
Hero was in this manner accused,
in this very manner refused...

1046
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:28,013
...and upon the grief of this, suddenly died.

1047
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,015
Master constable...

1048
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,083
...let these men be bound,
and brought to Leonato's.

1049
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:42,085
-Come, let them be opinioned.
-Let them be in the hands....

1050
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,923
Off, coxcomb!

1051
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,464
God's my life, where's the Sexton?

1052
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,665
Let him write down
the prince's officer coxcomb.

1053
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,910
Come, bind them. Thou naughty varlet!

1054
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,773
Away! You are an ass!

1055
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,250
You are an ass!

1056
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,333
Dost thou not suspect my place?

1057
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,930
Dost thou not suspect my years?

1058
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,671
O that he were here to write me down an ass!

1059
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:33,976
But, masters, remember, I am an ass.

1060
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,542
Though it be not written down,
forget not that I am an ass.

1061
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,526
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself.

1062
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,397
Bring me a father that so loved his child...

1063
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:59,369
...whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,
and bid him speak of patience.

1064
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,809
But there is no such man.

1065
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:05,441
For, brother, men can counsel
and speak comfort to that grief...

1066
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,071
...which they themselves not feel.

1067
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,948
But, tasting it, their counsel turns to passion.

1068
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,884
-But--
-I pray thee, peace.

1069
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,189
I will be flesh and blood...

1070
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:19,282
...for there was never yet philosopher
that could endure the toothache patiently.

1071
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,828
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.

1072
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,058
Make those that do offend you suffer, too.

1073
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,300
There thou speakest reason. Nay, I will do so.

1074
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,005
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied...

1075
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,734
...and that shall Claudio know,
so shall the prince...

1076
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:38,370
-...and all of them that thus dishonor her.
-Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.

1077
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,182
-Good e'en.
-Good day to both of you.

1078
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,443
Hear you, my lords--

1079
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,247
-We have some haste.
-Some haste, my lord!

1080
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:46,911
Well, fare you well, my lord.

1081
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,456
Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.

1082
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,287
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good man.

1083
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,191
If he could right himself with quarrelling,
we would lie low.

1084
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,263
Who wrongs him?

1085
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,831
Marry, thou dost wrong me,
thou dissembler, thou.

1086
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:00,766
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.
I fear thee not.

1087
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:04,305
Marry, beshrew my hand,
if it should give your age such cause of fear.

1088
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,340
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

1089
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,535
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.

1090
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,010
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool.

1091
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:16,014
-I say thou has belied mine innocent child.
-You say not right, old man.

1092
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,643
My lord, I'll prove it on his body, if he dare.

1093
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,779
Away! I will not have to do with you!

1094
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,685
Canst thou so daff me?

1095
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,361
Thou hast killed my child!

1096
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:31,187
If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.

1097
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,325
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed.

1098
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,098
But that's no matter, let him kill one first.

1099
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,834
I'll whip you from your foining fence.
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

1100
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,035
-Brother--
-Content yourself.

1101
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,341
God knows I loved my niece.

1102
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:47,979
And she is dead...

1103
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,744
...slandered to death by villains...

1104
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:53,753
...scrambling, outfacing,
fashion-monging boys...

1105
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,016
...that lie, and cog...

1106
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,719
-...and flout, deprave and slander--
-Brother Antony.

1107
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:04,697
'Tis no matter. Do not you meddle.
Let me deal in this.

1108
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,830
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.

1109
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,362
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death...

1110
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,999
...but, on my honor, she was charged
with nothing but what was true...

1111
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,609
...and very full of proof.

1112
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,177
My lord--

1113
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,846
I will not hear you.

1114
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:20,937
No?

1115
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:23,282
Come, brother, away.

1116
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,079
I will be heard.

1117
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,279
And shall...

1118
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,989
...or some of us will smart for it.

1119
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,700
See, here comes the man we went to seek.

1120
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:48,134
-Now, signior, what news?
-Good day, my lord.

1121
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:51,269
Welcome, signior.
You are almost come to part almost a fray.

1122
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:54,678
We had like to have had our two noses
snapped off with two old men.

1123
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,941
Shall I speak a word in your ear?

1124
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,715
You are a villain. I jest not.

1125
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,620
I will make it good how you dare
and when you dare.

1126
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,660
Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice.

1127
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:11,326
You have killed a sweet lady,
and her death shall fall heavy on you.

1128
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,230
Fare you well, boy.

1129
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,262
You know my mind.

1130
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,338
My lord...

1131
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,942
...for your many courtesies I thank you.

1132
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,883
I must discontinue your company.

1133
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,210
Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina.

1134
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:37,551
You have, among you,
killed a sweet and innocent lady.

1135
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,056
For my Lord Lackbeard there...

1136
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,054
...he and I shall meet.

1137
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,629
Till then...

1138
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,999
...peace be with him.

1139
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,407
He is in earnest.

1140
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,846
-In most profound earnest.
-And hath challenged thee.

1141
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:04,280
Most sincerely.

1142
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,596
Officers...

1143
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,700
...what offence have these men done?

1144
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:25,170
Marry, sir, they have committed false report.

1145
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,174
Moreover, they spoke untruths.
Secondarily, they are slanders.

1146
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,837
Sixth and lastly, they belied a lady.
Thirdly, they verified unjust things.

1147
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,849
And, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

1148
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,056
Who have you offended, masters,
that you are thus bound to your answer?

1149
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,921
This learned constable is too cunning
to be understood.

1150
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,795
I have deceived even your very eyes.

1151
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,855
What your wisdoms could not discover...

1152
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:56,028
...these shallow fools have brought to light...

1153
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,072
...who in the night...

1154
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,305
...overheard me confessing to this man...

1155
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:04,712
...how Don John, your brother...

1156
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,541
...incensed me to slander the Lady Hero.

1157
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,817
How you saw me...

1158
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,447
...court...

1159
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,150
...Margaret.

1160
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:20,150
How you disgraced Hero...

1161
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,663
...when you should marry her.

1162
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,261
The lady is dead...

1163
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:30,064
...upon mine and my master's false accusation.

1164
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,075
Sweet Hero!

1165
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,939
Come, bring away the plaintiffs.

1166
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:44,311
By this time, our sexton hath reformed
Signior Leonato of the matter.

1167
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,776
And, masters...

1168
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:49,914
...do not forget to specify,
when time and place shall serve...

1169
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,219
...that I am an ass.

1170
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:52,520
Here, here...

1171
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:56,192
...comes master Signior Leonato,
and the sexton, too.

1172
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:04,702
Which is the villain?

1173
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,900
Let me see his eyes.

1174
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,971
If you would know your wronger...

1175
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:10,668
...look on me.

1176
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:15,676
Art thou the slave that with thy tongue
hast killed mine innocent child?

1177
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:16,842
Yea.

1178
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,649
-Even I alone.
-No.

1179
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,889
Not so, villain. Thou beliest thyself.

1180
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,927
Here stand a pair of honorable men.

1181
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,456
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.

1182
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:34,562
I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death.

1183
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,661
Record it with your high and worthy deeds.

1184
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,532
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

1185
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,974
I know not how to pray your patience.

1186
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,646
Yet I must speak.

1187
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,413
Choose your revenge yourself.

1188
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,621
Impose me to what penance
your invention can lay upon my sin.

1189
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:00,759
Yet sinned I not but in mistaking.

1190
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,953
By my soul, nor l.

1191
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,259
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live.

1192
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:10,165
That were impossible. But I pray you both...

1193
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:14,941
...possess the people in Messina here
how innocent she died.

1194
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:19,238
And if your love can labor ought
in sad invention...

1195
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:22,577
...hang her an epitaph upon her tomb...

1196
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:28,120
...and sing it to her bones, sing it tonight.

1197
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:31,717
Tomorrow morning come you to my house...

1198
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:35,719
...and since you could not be my son-in-law...

1199
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,562
...be yet my nephew.

1200
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,730
My brother hath a daughter...

1201
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,270
...almost the copy of my child that's dead...

1202
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,706
...and she alone is heir to both of us.

1203
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:55,376
Give her the right
you should have given her cousin...

1204
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:59,617
...and so dies my revenge.

1205
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,385
O noble sir...

1206
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,223
...your overkindness doth wring tears from me.

1207
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,763
I do...

1208
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,669
...embrace your offer...

1209
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:21,497
...and dispose for henceforth of poor Claudio.

1210
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:25,104
Tomorrow, then, I will expect your coming.

1211
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,913
Tonight I take my leave.

1212
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,957
This naughty man shall, face to face,
be brought to Margaret...

1213
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:42,594
...who I believe was packed in all this wrong.

1214
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,688
No, by my soul, she was not...

1215
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:47,630
...nor knew not what she did
when she spoke to me...

1216
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:52,566
...but always hath been just and virtuous
in any thing that I do know by her.

1217
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:58,074
Moreover, sir,
which indeed is not under white and black...

1218
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:01,671
...this plaintiff here, the offender,
did call me "ass."

1219
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:05,912
I beseech you,
let it be remembered in his punishment.

1220
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:10,089
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

1221
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,756
Your worship speaks like a most thankful
and reverend youth...

1222
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:16,591
...and I praise God for you.

1223
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,933
There's for thy pains.

1224
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,568
God save the foundation.

1225
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,467
Go.

1226
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:32,003
I discharge thee of thy prisoner,
and I thank thee.

1227
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:38,348
I leave with your worship an arrant knave,
which I beseech your worship...

1228
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,354
...to correct yourself, for the example of others.

1229
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,160
God restore you to health!

1230
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:50,562
I humbly give you leave to depart.

1231
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,763
And if a merry meeting...

1232
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,129
...may be wished...

1233
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,294
...God prohibit it.

1234
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,434
Come, neighbor.

1235
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:25,227
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.

1236
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:28,334
Farewell, my lords. We look for you tomorrow.

1237
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:29,968
We will not fail.

1238
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:32,172
Tonight...

1239
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:34,268
...I'll mourn...

1240
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:35,903
...with Hero.

1241
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,837
"Done to death...

1242
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,468
"...by slanderous tongues...

1243
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,208
"...was the Hero...

1244
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:18,945
"...that here lies.

1245
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:24,642
"Death, in guerdon of her wrongs...

1246
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,689
"...gives her fame...

1247
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,951
"...which never dies.

1248
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,919
"So the life...

1249
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,596
"...that died with shame...

1250
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,699
"...lives in death...

1251
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,938
"...with glorious fame."

1252
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:05,715
"Pardon, goddess of the night

1253
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:12,255
"Those that slew thy virgin knight

1254
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:18,294
"For the which, with songs of woe

1255
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:22,569
"Round about her tomb

1256
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:25,237
"they go

1257
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,747
"Midnight

1258
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,013
"assist our moan

1259
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,849
"Help us

1260
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:38,187
"to sigh and groan

1261
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:41,591
"Heavily, heavily

1262
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:47,023
"Heavily"

1263
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,838
"The god of love

1264
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:05,516
"That sits above

1265
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:11,790
"And knows me

1266
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:14,828
"And knows me

1267
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:19,897
"How pitiful I deserve...."

1268
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,596
I mean in singing.

1269
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:25,497
But in loving...

1270
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:30,505
...Leander, the good swimmer,
Troilus, the first employer of panders...

1271
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:34,069
...and a whole bookful of these
quondam carpet-mangers...

1272
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:37,742
...whose names yet run smoothly
in the even road of a blank verse...

1273
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,480
...why, they were never so truly turned...

1274
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:42,852
...over and over...

1275
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:46,449
...as my poor self in love.

1276
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,291
Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme.

1277
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:50,987
I have tried.

1278
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,528
I can find out no rhyme to "lady," but...

1279
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:58,227
..."baby," an innocent rhyme.

1280
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:02,400
For "scorn," "horn," a hard rhyme.

1281
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,910
For "school," "fool," a babbling rhyme.

1282
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,343
Very ominous endings.

1283
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:13,012
No, I was not born under a rhyming planet...

1284
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:16,820
...nor I cannot woo in festival terms.

1285
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:22,621
Sweet Beatrice...

1286
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,964
...wouldst thou come when I called thee?

1287
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:27,762
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

1288
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:29,961
Stay but till then.

1289
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:33,673
"Then" is spoken. Fare you well now.

1290
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,236
And yet...

1291
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:39,473
...ere I go...

1292
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,978
...let me go with that I came...

1293
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:48,050
...which is with knowing what passed
between you and Claudio.

1294
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:51,852
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.

1295
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,928
Foul words is but foul wind,
and foul wind is but foul breath.

1296
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,589
Foul breath is noisome.
Therefore I will depart unkissed.

1297
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:01,327
Thou hast frighted the word
out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.

1298
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:05,098
But I must tell thee plainly,
Claudio undergoes my challenge...

1299
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:08,175
...and either I must shortly hear from him...

1300
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:11,369
...or I will subscribe him a coward.

1301
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,677
And, I pray thee now...

1302
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:18,185
...tell me...

1303
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:23,381
...for which of my bad parts
did thou first fall in love with me?

1304
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:26,421
For them all together...

1305
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:29,929
...which maintains so politic a state of evil...

1306
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:33,728
...that they will not admit any good part
to intermingle with them.

1307
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:38,131
But for which of my good parts
did you first suffer love for me?

1308
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,501
Suffer love! A good epithet!

1309
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:42,576
I do suffer love indeed,
for I love thee against my will.

1310
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,168
In spite of your heart, I think. Alas...

1311
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:46,704
...poor heart.

1312
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:49,408
If you spite it for my sake,
I will spite it for yours...

1313
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,849
...for I will never love that which my friend hates.

1314
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:56,446
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

1315
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:00,082
And now tell me...

1316
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:02,390
...how doth your cousin?

1317
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,223
Very...

1318
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:06,700
...ill.

1319
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,669
And how do you?

1320
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:13,205
Very ill too.

1321
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:16,107
Serve God...

1322
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:19,003
...love me...

1323
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,013
...and mend.

1324
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:26,811
-Madam!
-Here comes one in haste.

1325
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,445
You must come to your uncle.

1326
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,454
Yonder's old coil at home.

1327
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:36,695
It is proved
my lady Hero hath been falsely accused...

1328
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:40,529
...the prince and Claudio mightily abused...

1329
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:43,831
...and Don John is the author of all...

1330
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,997
...who is fled and gone.

1331
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,134
Will you come...

1332
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:50,842
...presently?

1333
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,604
Will you go hear this news, signior?

1334
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:58,583
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap,
and be buried in thy eyes...

1335
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:01,951
...and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's.

1336
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:06,359
Did I not tell you she was innocent?

1337
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,294
So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
upon the error you heard debated.

1338
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:13,992
But Margaret was in some fault for this.

1339
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:16,399
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

1340
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:18,802
Now, daughter,
and you gentlewomen all, withdraw...

1341
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:21,431
...and when I send for you, come hither masked.

1342
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:28,144
The prince and Claudio promised
by this hour to visit me.

1343
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:30,241
You know your office, brother.

1344
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:34,082
You must be father to your brother's daughter,
and give her to young Claudio.

1345
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:36,986
Which I will do with confirmed countenance.

1346
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,287
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

1347
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:43,454
-To do what, signior?
-To bind me, or undo me. One of them.

1348
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:46,765
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior...

1349
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,597
...your niece regards me with an eye of favor.

1350
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:53,139
The sight whereof I think you had from me,
from Claudio and the prince.

1351
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,368
-But what's your will?
-Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.

1352
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,674
But, for my will, my will is your good will...

1353
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:03,648
...may stand with ours,
this day to be conjoined...

1354
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,481
...in the state of...

1355
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:08,054
...honorable marriage...

1356
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,589
...in which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

1357
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:13,660
-My heart is with your liking.
-And my help.

1358
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,172
Here come the prince and Claudio.

1359
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,221
Good morrow to this fair assembly.

1360
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:46,691
Good morrow, prince. Good morrow, Claudio.

1361
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,585
We here attend you.

1362
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:52,762
Are you yet determined today
to marry with my brother's daughter?

1363
01:37:55,269 --> 01:37:56,896
Call her forth, brother.

1364
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:58,627
Here's the friar, ready.

1365
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,284
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

1366
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,018
This same is she...

1367
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:23,262
...and I do give you her.

1368
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,337
Sweet...

1369
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:33,704
...let me see your face.

1370
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:35,805
No, that you shall not...

1371
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:40,006
...till you take her hand before this friar
and swear to marry her.

1372
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:47,880
Give me your hand, before this holy friar.

1373
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:52,917
I am your husband...

1374
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:56,757
...if you like of me.

1375
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,937
Hero that is dead.

1376
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:13,544
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

1377
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:16,742
And when I lived...

1378
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:19,917
...I was your other wife.

1379
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:24,214
And when you loved...

1380
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:27,924
...you were my other husband.

1381
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:31,754
One Hero died defiled, but I do live...

1382
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,024
...and surely as I live...

1383
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,466
...I am a maid.

1384
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:11,160
All this amazement can I qualify.

1385
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:13,364
When after that the holy rites are ended...

1386
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:16,966
...I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.

1387
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:25,885
Soft and fair, friar.

1388
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,048
Which is Beatrice?

1389
01:40:36,563 --> 01:40:38,531
I answer to that name.

1390
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:46,838
What is your will?

1391
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:50,333
Do not you love me?

1392
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,107
Why, no.

1393
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:56,142
No more than reason.

1394
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,719
Your uncle, the prince and Claudio
have been deceived.

1395
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,481
They swore you did.

1396
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:05,555
-Do not you love me?
-Why, no. No more than reason.

1397
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:10,619
Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula
are much deceived...

1398
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:13,791
-...for they did swear you did.
-They swore you were sick for me.

1399
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:16,699
-They swore you were nigh dead for me.
-'Tis no such matter.

1400
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:17,862
Then...

1401
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:19,672
...you...

1402
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:23,072
-...do not love me?
-No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

1403
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:27,675
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

1404
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:31,512
I'll be sworn upon it he loves her,
for here's a paper written in his hand...

1405
01:41:31,618 --> 01:41:35,384
...a halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
fashioned to Beatrice.

1406
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:39,391
And here's another...

1407
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:41,961
...writ in my cousin's hand,
stolen from her pocket...

1408
01:41:42,062 --> 01:41:44,462
...containing her affection unto Benedick.

1409
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:55,171
A miracle!

1410
01:41:55,876 --> 01:42:00,279
Here's our own hands against our hearts.

1411
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,208
Come...

1412
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,551
...I will have thee.

1413
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:08,617
But, by this light, I take thee for pity.

1414
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:12,320
I would not deny you.

1415
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,589
But, by this good day...

1416
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,320
...I yield upon great persuasion...

1417
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:21,191
...and partly to save your life,
for I was told you were in a consumption.

1418
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:22,427
Peace!

1419
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,500
I will stop your mouth.

1420
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:35,204
How dost thou, Benedick...

1421
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:37,206
...the married man?

1422
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:40,513
I'll tell thee what, prince...

1423
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:44,950
...a college of wit-crackers cannot
flout me out of my humor.

1424
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:48,355
Dost thou think I care for
a satire or an epigram?

1425
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:49,885
No.

1426
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:52,456
Since I do purpose to marry...

1427
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:56,728
...I will think nothing to any purpose
that the world can say against it...

1428
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:00,967
...and therefore never flout at me
for what I have said against it.

1429
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:03,732
For man...

1430
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:08,107
...is a giddy thing...

1431
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:10,941
...and this is my conclusion.

1432
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:22,757
For thy part, Claudio...

1433
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:25,197
...I did think to have beaten thee...

1434
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:28,757
...but in that thou art like to be my kinsman...

1435
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:31,236
...live unbruised...

1436
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,505
...and love my cousin.

1437
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:40,004
Come, come, we are friends.

1438
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:46,984
Let's have a dance ere we are married...

1439
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:51,785
...that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives' heels!

1440
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,226
We'll have dancing afterward.

1441
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:59,396
First, of my word. Therefore play, music!

1442
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,265
Prince...

1443
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:06,536
...thou art sad.

1444
01:44:06,873 --> 01:44:08,306
Get thee a wife.

1445
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:10,668
Get thee a wife!

1446
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:18,242
My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
and brought with armed men back to Messina.

1447
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:25,288
Think not on him till tomorrow.

1448
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:30,253
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.

1449
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:40,898
Strike up, pipers!

1450
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:50,848
"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more

1451
01:44:51,218 --> 01:44:55,154
