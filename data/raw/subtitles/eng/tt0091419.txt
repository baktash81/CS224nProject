of the month of September...

00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:04,971
...in an early year of a decade
not too long before our own...

3
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:11,373
...the human race suddenly encountered
a deadly threat to its very existence.

4
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:17,450
And this terrifying enemy surfaced,
as such enemies often do...

5
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,795
...in the seemingly most innocent
and unlikely of places.

Very little, Mr. Mushnik!

31
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,312
...and at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...

32
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,067
...concerning last Thursday's
total eclipse of the sun...

33
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:16,965

which has baffled the nation.

We thought that maybe some of those
strange and interesting new plants...

would attract business.

how ridiculous you sound?

160
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:02,084

in the window people don't suddenly--

Excuse me. l couldn't help noticing
that strange and interesting plant.

weird and exotic cuttings.

there that day.

you know, walk on by...

174
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,206
...when suddenly and without warning,
there was this...

175
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,962
...total eclipse of the sun.

176
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,972
It got very dark.

177
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,807
And there was this strange humming
sound, like something from another world.

178
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,425
When the light came back,
this weird plant wasjust sitting there.

179
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,973
Just stuck in among the zinnias.

180
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,573
''Audrey ll.''

181
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,522
I could have sworn
it hadn't been there before...

182
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,980
...but the old Chinese man
sold it to me anyways...

183
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,504
...for $1.95.

184
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:37,580
Well, that's an unusual story,
and a fascinating plant.

185
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:43,492
Oh, while l'm here,
l might as well take $50 worth of roses.

186
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,909
$50!

187
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,330
Can you break $100?

188
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,261
$100?

189
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:51,081
No.

190
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,384
Then l'll just have to take twice as many.

191
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,563
Twice as many?

192
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:55,877
Twice as many!

193
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,515
Twice as many!

194
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,348
That plant in the window,
it's simply amazing!

195
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:05,550
That plant in the window,
wherever did you get it?

196
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,877
-There it is, Marge.
-Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar.

197
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,670
Thank you very much, sir!

198
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:30,957
Thank you!

199
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,616
Thank you! Come again!

200
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,760
Come and look at the weirdo plant
some more!

201
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:37,679
lt's just going to get bigger
and more interesting.

202
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,831
Just don't stand there! Quick, quick!

203
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,164
Put the plant back.... What did you call it?

204
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,125
Audrey ll.

205
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:49,453
Put that Audrey ll back in the window
where passersby can see it.

206
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,100
l never thought this could happen!

207
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,272
l'm taking us all out to dinner tonight!

208
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,620
l'd love to, Mr. Mushnik, but l have a date.

209
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,643
With that nogoodnik?

210
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:05,356
You don't need a date with him.
You need major medical.

211
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,021
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik,
but he makes good money.

212
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,169
Besides...

213
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,828
...he's the only fella l got.

214
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:17,476
Enjoy dinner. Goodnight, Seymour.

215
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:19,685
Goodnight, Audrey.

216
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:22,019
Poor girl.

217
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:23,883
Are we still going out?

218
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,427
You're not going anywhere!

219
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:35,309
You're staying right here
and taking care of that sick plant!

220
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:39,430
l told you it's been giving me trouble.
Audrey ll is not a healthy girl.

221
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,772
Between us, neither is Audrey l.

222
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,406
lf l only knew what breed it was.

223
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,438
Who cares what breed it is?
Look what it's done for business.

224
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:50,089
Work. Nurse this plant back to health.
l'm counting on you.

225
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,206
-l know.
-You do?

226
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,352
-l do.
-So fix. Good night.

227
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:33,738
Twoey, l don't know what else
l can do for you.

228
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,873
Are you sickly, little plant,
or are you just plain stubborn?

229
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,787
What is it you want?

230
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,831
What is it you need?

231
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,767
''l've given you sunshine
l've given you dirt

232
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,823
''You've given me nothing
But heartache and hurt

233
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:56,782
''l'm begging you sweetly

234

238
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,957
''Now please, grow for me

239
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,983
''l've given you southern exposure

240
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:30,185
''l've pinched you back hard

241
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:32,399
''You're barely alive

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,461
''l've tried you at levels of moisture

243
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:37,444
''From desert to mud

''l've given you grow lights

''What do you want from me?
Blood?''

246
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,180
Damn roses! Damn thorns!

247
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:56,901
''l've given you sunlight
l've given you rain

248
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,010

''Oh, please...

00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:39,942
''...grow for me! ''

254
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,996
W-S-K-I-D.

255
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,107
Skid Row radio.

256
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,555
You're listening to radio station WSKID,
home of the hits.

257
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:19,078
Injust a few minutes we'll bring you
Wink Wilkensen's Weird World...

258
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,500
...where wonderful people
bring in their weird things.

259
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,494
But first, the weather.

260
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,773
Thank you. The weather today will be
partly cloudy with a chance of rain. Sorry.

261
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:33,580
The high temperature will be
in the low 50s tonight....

262
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,015
-Excuse me. l was told to come--
-You're next.

263
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:42,632
High tomorrow should be in the low 70s
with the low in the high 60s.

264
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:45,703
In the suburbs, the sun should be out
through most of the day...

265
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,419
...except for some cloudy patches
towards the evening.

266
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,780
The barometer reading should be 21.6.

267
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,262
The wind will be about...

268
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,074
...I'd say 12 miles per hour.

269
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,543
The sun will be rising tomorrow
at about 7:17 a.m...

270
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,396
...and it should be setting around 6:29 p.m.

271
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,622
The cold front is moving in
from the southwest.

272
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,221
It should brighten up by noon.

273
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:10,985
The weekend should be mild.

274
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,539
The average mean temperature
for the season....

275
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,096
You're listening to radio station WSKID.

276
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,625
And now, Wink Wilkensen's Weird World,
with your host, Wink Wilkensen.

277
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:32,068
Hi! lt's Weird Wink Wilkensen,
laughin' and scratchin' at ya.

278
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,320
How's everybody today?

279
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,846
l got a bit of a stiff neck.
Let me just fix this up.

280
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,196
That feels a lot better!

281
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,874
l got a great show for you today
with some wonderful weird stuff!

282
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,688
What are you doing here?

283
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:47,660
Please, put your clothes back on!
You can't do this to me!

284
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:49,515
What if your husband were to walk in?

285
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,405
l'm here, Wink. l love your show...

286
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,340
...but l've got to kill you both
with this machine gun.

287
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,187
You got me!

288
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:02,346
l feel so very weird!

289
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:05,572
Our first guest is a young man...

290
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:08,548
...you probably read about
in the newspapers by the name of...

291
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,333
...Seymour Krelborn. ls that correct?

292
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:14,308
Who has discovered a new breed of plant
unknown on this planet.

293
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:16,968
Let me play you down
to your seat, Seymour.

294
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,582
Hello, Seymour!

295
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:23,596
Hello, Wink.

296
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,182
l wish you folks at home could see this.

297
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:29,353
Seymour, where did you get
such a weird plant?

298
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,716
Well, you remember that total eclipse
of the sun about a week ago?

299
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,606
And thus we conclude our interview
with the young botanical--

300
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:43,467
Mind if I call you a genius?

301
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,516
Gosh, no!

302
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,689
The genius who has discovered
this amazing, unidentified plant.

303
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,890
I'd like to remind our listeners
that the Audrey II is on display...

304
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:53,609
...exclusively at
Mushnik's Skid Row Florists.

305
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,402
-Did l miss it?
-Mushnik's.

306
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,252
The address!

307
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:00,621
The address!

308
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:03,469
l said, mention the address!

309
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,556
Oh, well. lt's still good advertising.

310
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:11,364
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

311
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:15,017
l wanted to hear it so bad.
l tried to be on time, but--

312
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:16,996
Don't tell me. You got tied up.

313
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,275
No, just handcuffed, a little.

314
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:23,047
Girl. Hey, girl.

315
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,985
The mess you hang out with
is hazardous to your health.

316
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,700
That's for sure. But l can't leave him.

317
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,716
-Why not?
-He'd get angry.

318
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,947
lf he does this when he likes me,
imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.

319
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,949
So, dump the chump.
Get a guy who'll protect you.

320
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,290
How about the little jerk with the glasses?

321
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:42,755
Seymour?

322
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,069
Oh, we're just friends.

323
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:48,394
l don't even deserve a sweet, considerate...

324
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:51,269
...suddenly successful guy like Seymour.

325
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:54,029
That poor child suffers
from low self-image.

326
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:55,917
-You got a point.
-She got a problem.

327
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:00,965
''l know Seymour's the greatest

328
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:06,793
''But l'm dating a semi-sadist

''So l got a black eye

330

''Still that Seymour's a cutie

00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:27,652
''Well, if not, he's got inner beauty

''And l dream of a place

537
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:03,754
The sudden success around here?
The press coverage?

538
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:07,460
Look, you're a plant. An inanimate object.

539

l'm sure l need a long, slow root canal.

Let's go.

622
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:08,667
-l have a history of dental problems.
-Shut up!

623
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:11,643
Yes, Doctor.

624
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,547
l went to a terrible dentist Wednesday,
who was recommended to me...

625
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:21,305
...by somebody l saw Monday...

626
00:44:21,374 --> 00:44:23,796
...who's the brother of a man
l usually see Sundays.

627
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,042
Their mother taught them
everything they know.

628
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:29,590
She's gifted, but elderly.
People think she shouldn't be working.

629
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:33,336
l go to her because l'm just
incredibly devoted to her strength.

630
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:37,811
She can't really see who you are,
but she knows the sound of your voice.

631
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:42,135
lf you tell her where it is, the problem,
she eventually finds it and she does it.

632
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:45,403
l wish l had that stamina.
l can only go so long.

633
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,790
That's how l want to be.
l don't ever want to have to be just--

634
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,029
Comfy?

635
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,892
Yes, Doctor.

636
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:55,869
l remember the first time
l went to a dentist.

637
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:58,487
l thought, ''What a neat job!
lf only l were a dentist.''

638
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,631
The dentist l went to had the greatest car.

639
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:04,859
He had a Corvette. Everybody calls him
''Doctor'' and he's not really a doctor.

640
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:06,523
Oh, my God!

641
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:13,175
l got out of there okay,
but after it was all finished...

642
00:45:13,695 --> 00:45:16,510
...they gave me a candy bar.
l thought, ''l get a candy bar?''

643
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:20,766
You go through that and get chocolate.

644
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,592
You work with incredible professionals,
using incredibly wonderful equipment....

645
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:27,261
Let's look at that mouth.

646
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:30,456
Say, ''Aaah.''

647
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:50,835
Yeah, great!

648
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,010
You are something special.

649
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:55,420

652
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:12,792
Don't stop, Doc! Don't stop!
Come on! More!

653
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:17,020
What do you want? Say, ''Please! ''

654
00:46:26,878 --> 00:46:29,245

655
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:53,816
Get out!

656
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,325

657
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,470
Get out of here!

658
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,654
What's the matter?

659
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,324
Go on! Get out of here!

660
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:08,436

661
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,739

of my friends about you--

Goddamn sicko!

664
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,611
Let me ask you something.
Does this scare you?

665
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,502
Yes.

666
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:28,022
Would you like if l took this and made
straight for your goddamn incisors?

667
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,175
lt'd hurt, right?

668
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:30,748
You'd scream!

669
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,317
Get your ass in there!

670
00:47:34,238 --> 00:47:37,369
-Don't l know you?
-Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.

671
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:39,540
Your mouth's a mess, kid.

672
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:43,251
That wisdom tooth.
We'll rip that bugger right out of there.

673
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:46,872
What do you say?
There's always time for dental hygiene.

674
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,461
You ever seen the results
of a neglected mouth?

675
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,658
Look, Seymour.

676
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:55,349
This could happen to you.

677
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,167
Unless l take immediate action!

678
00:47:58,302 --> 00:47:59,546
What's that?

679
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:00,786
The drill.

680
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,262
lt's rusty!

681
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:03,578
lt's an antique.

682
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:06,045
They don't make them like this anymore.

683
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,131
Sturdy...

684
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:08,762
...heavy...

685
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:10,005
...dull.

686
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:15,962

687
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,899
Thank God.
l thought you wouldn't use any.

688
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:22,966
The gas isn't for you, Seymour. lt's for me.

689
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:25,819
You see, l want to really enjoy this.

690
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:30,069

my special gas mask!

691
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:36,051

increases my pleasure enormously.

692

Here we go!

693

Oh, Seymour, l'm flying!

695
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:22,134
What the hell is that?

696
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:23,415
A gun?

697
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,838
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!

698
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:31,415
l'm in trouble now, huh?

699
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,357
Wait till l turn this gas off.

700
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,161
Give me a hand, would you?

701
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:45,590
No, l guess you wouldn't, would you?

702
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,821
l could asphyx--

703
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,724
What'd l ever do to you?

704
00:50:06,782 --> 00:50:09,084
Nothing. lt's what you did to her.

705
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,717
Her who?

706
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,061
Oh, her.

707
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:14,995
Chop it up.

708
00:51:15,518 --> 00:51:16,500
What?

709
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:17,978
Feed me!

710
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,256
Okay, okay.

711
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:54,995
Audrey, what'd they say to you?

712
00:53:55,262 --> 00:53:56,309
Who?

713
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:57,682
The police.

714
00:53:57,757 --> 00:53:59,034
Oh, nothing.

715
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,550
Talk to me. Tell me what they said.

716
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:05,364
lt's Orin. They say he's disappeared!

717
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,028
The police told you that?

718
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,166
They suspect foul play.

719
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:12,759
They do?

720
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,961
His receptionist, this morning,
found the place a shambles.

721
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,295
Gas masks everywhere.

722
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:20,377
Things all over the floor.

723
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:22,715
They think....

724
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,137
l can't even think about what they think.

725
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,735
Don't cry, Audrey.

726
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:44,115
Would it be so terrible
if something had happened to him?

727
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:47,540
Seymour, what a thing to say!

728
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,811
Well, would it?

729
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,299
lt wouldn't be terrible at all.

730
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:55,643
lt'd be a miracle.

731
00:54:56,317 --> 00:54:59,994
Not to mention all the money l'd save
on Epsom salts and Ace bandages.

732
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:01,942
You see?

733
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,330
But l'd still feel guilty.

734
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:10,009
lf he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind...

735
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:12,659
...it'd be partly my fault just because...

736
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,252
...secretly l wished it.

737
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,060
Don't you waste another minute
thinking about that creep!

738
00:55:20,637 --> 00:55:24,020
There's a lot of guys that'd give anything
to go out with you.

739
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:27,319
Nice guys.

740
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,620
l don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

741
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:34,069
-That's not true.
-You don't know the half of it!

742
00:55:34,142 --> 00:55:36,116
l've led a terrible life.

743
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:40,082
l deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, DDS.

744
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:43,795
You know where l met him?

745
00:55:46,045 --> 00:55:47,475
ln The Gutter.

746
00:55:47,773 --> 00:55:48,984
The Gutter?

747
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:51,484
The Gutter. lt's a nightspot.

748
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:55,510
l worked there on my nights off
when we weren't making much money.

749
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:57,076
l'd put on...

750
00:55:57,246 --> 00:56:00,541
...cheap and tasteless outfits,
not nice ones like this.

751
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,213
Low and nasty apparel.

752
00:56:04,606 --> 00:56:06,711
That's all behind you now.

753
00:56:06,878 --> 00:56:08,852
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

754
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:12,499
You're a very nice person.
l always knew you were.

755
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:17,180
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs,
you know what l saw?

756
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:20,052
A girl l respected.

757
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:21,787
l still do.

758
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,204
''Lift up your head

Mr. Mushnik, you scared me.

l scared him?
After what l've seen, l scared him?

805

Do you think l didn't know, huh?
Oh, l knew.

806
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,427
l knew you'd lay down here,
on your pathetic little cot...

807
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:39,865
...and dream about her.

808
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:42,301
But l didn't know the lengths
to which you'd go...

809
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:44,537
...the depths to which you'd sink!

810
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:47,570
What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?

811
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,750
Little red dots all over the linoleum.

812
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:52,531
Little red spots on the concrete outside.

813
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:57,272
l'm talking blood, Krelborn.
l'm talking under my own roof.

814
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:59,767
An axe murderer!

815
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,426
''He's got your number now''

816
01:01:02,974 --> 01:01:04,184
l saw everything.

817
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,522
''He knowsjust what you've done''

818
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:08,596
Everything you did to her boyfriend.

819
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,125
''You've got no place to hide''

820
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,700
l saw you chopping him.

821
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:15,064
''You've got nowhere to run''

822
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,168
lt's true. l chopped him up,
but l didn't kill him!

823
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:20,212
''He knows your life of crime''

824
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:22,170
Tell it to the police.

825
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,855

You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.

837
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:20,341
But considering you're almost
like a son to me, l'm thinking...

838
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:22,552
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.

839
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:24,408
We don't?

840
01:02:25,149 --> 01:02:26,523
l'm thinking...

841
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:31,100
...what if l kept my mouth shut and
gave you a one-way ticket out of town?

842
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,622
You'd do that, sir?

843
01:02:35,709 --> 01:02:38,873
You could lay low for a while,
say 30, 40 years.

844
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,974
Meanwhile, l would keep the plant.

845
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:43,933
The plant?

846
01:02:43,997 --> 01:02:47,826
Of course, you'd have to teach me
how to take care of it while you're away.

847
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:50,963
Give me your secret gardening tips.

848
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:54,844
But then, if you'd rather hang....

849
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,090
What do l have to do?

850
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,418
Just feed it.

851
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,182
Feed it what?

852
01:03:18,397 --> 01:03:19,345
Minerals.

853
01:03:21,726 --> 01:03:24,114
Thursdays, you should give it water.

854
01:03:30,365 --> 01:03:31,642
But whatever you do....

855
01:03:32,573 --> 01:03:33,751
Yes?

856
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:38,709
Whatever you do....

857
01:03:38,813 --> 01:03:40,155
Yeah?

858
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:46,361
What the hell is...?

01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:57,660

-Just sign this release.
-Need a pen?

Aren't you thrilled?

869
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:24,888
Son, it's a cinch to get ratings.

870

-The title is Marvin's.
-The concept is mine.

-Sign!

01:04:37,181 --> 01:04:41,207
''lt's not a question of merit
lt's not demand and supply

875
01:04:41,662 --> 01:04:43,734
''They say the meek are gonna get it.

876
01:04:46,493 --> 01:04:49,046
''You know the meek are gonna get
what's coming to them''

877
01:05:13,469 --> 01:05:14,963
Oh, my God!

878
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:19,163
And here he is himself,
Mr. Seymour Krelborn!

879
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:21,908
Mr. Krelborn, there are many questions...

880
01:05:21,982 --> 01:05:24,502
...the people in our television audience
have for you.

881
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:26,940
Come and tell our viewers
at home and elsewhere...

882
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:30,453
...about this particularly amazing
agricultural phenomenon...

883
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:34,453
...that's made you one of the most talked
about plant scientists in the country--

884
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:38,322
Cut!

885
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:40,664
What happened
to the goddamned greenery?

886
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:43,196
-lt just needs to be fed.
-So feed it.

887
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:46,072
l can't feed it. Not now.

888
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:48,213
Then l'll feed it. Where's the plant food?

889
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:51,416
lt doesn't eat plant food.
And l can't feed it now.

890
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:53,334
Leave me alone.

891
01:05:53,405 --> 01:05:54,550
All of you.

892
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:56,180
Just go away.

893
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,424
Leave me alone. Get out of here.

894
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:00,119
Go away. Leave me alone!

895
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,573
Everybody go away!

896
01:06:03,645 --> 01:06:04,725
Leave me alone!

897
01:06:05,405 --> 01:06:06,714
You're hysterical.

898
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:08,310
l know. l'm sorry.

899
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:21,523
What am l gonna do?

900
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:25,364
l never should've started, but l did.
Now, if l don't feed it, it'll die.

901
01:06:25,437 --> 01:06:27,510
l'll lose her, l'll lose everything.

902
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:29,948
Who are you talking to?

903
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:31,958
Nobody.

904
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,071
You're acting funny.

905
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:36,571
lt wasn't nice throwing those people out.

906
01:06:36,637 --> 01:06:39,354
Those men said
Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips...

907
01:06:39,485 --> 01:06:41,973
...is sure to be a very big TV show.

908
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:44,572
l know. l'm sorry. l feel terrible.

909
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:45,652
Well, you shouldn't.

910
01:06:45,725 --> 01:06:49,041
They're coming back tomorrow
and they'll bring you a great big check.

911
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,828
l wish you were enjoying your success.

912
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,156
They said they're coming back
with money?

913
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,333
Tomorrow.

914
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:59,956
Then we could afford to get out of here.

915
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,109
What do you mean?

916
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:03,799
That's it. After tomorrow
we could leave here together.

917
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:05,301
Together?

918
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,214
lf you'll have me.

919
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:09,714
Audrey, will you have me?

920
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:11,604
What do you mean?

921
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:14,134
Marry me, Audrey.

922
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:15,772
Seymour, this is so sudden.

923
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:17,082
Will you?

924
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:23,993
Sure.

925
01:07:25,149 --> 01:07:27,571
Then that's it!
We'll go get married right now.

926
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:32,663
Tomorrow l'll be on TV, get the money
and then we'll live happily ever after.

927
01:07:32,733 --> 01:07:35,962
Oh, Audrey, l'll give you a wonderful life
with no plants, l promise.

928
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:38,581
-No plants at all.
-You're talking peculiar again.

929
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,955
We'll start tonight.
We'll go to City Hall, get married...

930
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:44,055
...and spend the night somewhere safe.
Some nice hotel.

931
01:07:46,077 --> 01:07:47,900
l've got to get ready!

932
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:49,459
Hurry. Hurry.

933
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,853
Feed me.

934
01:08:54,941 --> 01:08:56,697
Under no circumstances.

935
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,878
Feed me.

936
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:00,565
l will not, so stop asking.

937
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:01,945
Feed me!

938
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:03,254
No! No more!

939
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,145
l can't take living with the guilt.

940
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,131
Tough titty.

941
01:09:07,453 --> 01:09:08,947
Watch your language.

942
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:11,476
Cut the crap. Bring on the meat.

943
01:09:13,853 --> 01:09:16,886
l'll run to the corner, pick you up
some nice ground round.

944
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:20,313
-How about that?
-Don't do me no favors!

945
01:09:22,686 --> 01:09:24,889
lt's my last offer. Yes or no?

946
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,557
You sure do drive a hard bargain.

947
01:09:31,132 --> 01:09:33,042
Done. Fine. Great.

948
01:09:35,549 --> 01:09:38,037
Don't think you're getting dessert.

949
01:11:10,589 --> 01:11:13,109
-Hello.
-''Hey, little lady, hello''

950
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:15,798
Who is this?

951
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:18,323
''You're looking cute as can be''

952
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:19,930
ls this someone l know?

953
01:11:19,997 --> 01:11:22,233
''You're looking mighty sweet''

954
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:25,046
Seymour!

955
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:27,866
''No, it ain't Seymour. It's me!''

956
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,198
Oh, my God!

957
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:54,804
l don't believe it.

958
01:11:55,197 --> 01:11:57,433
Believe it, baby. lt talks.

959
01:11:58,012 --> 01:11:59,441
Am l dreaming this?

960
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:02,262
No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.

961
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:06,392
Something is very wrong here.

962
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:09,879
l need me some water in the worst way.

963
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:12,115
Look at my branches.

964
01:12:12,188 --> 01:12:14,709
l'm drying up. l'm a goner, honey!

965
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,418
''Come on and give me a drink''

966
01:12:18,749 --> 01:12:20,210
l don't know if l should.

967
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:22,456
''Hey, little lady, be nice''

968
01:12:22,557 --> 01:12:24,280
Do you talk to Seymour like this?

969
01:12:24,349 --> 01:12:26,967
''Sure do. l'll drink it straight''

970
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:28,628
Your leaves are dry.

971
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:31,035
''Don't need no glass or no ice''

972
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:32,857
l'll get the can.

973
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:35,640
''Don't need no twist of lime''

974
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,106
Here we go.

975
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,346
''And now it's suppertime! ''

976
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,562
Oh, relax, doll. lt'll be easy.

977
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,918
Get off of her! Get off!

978
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,484
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

979
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:29,016
Yes. l'm okay.

980
01:13:29,084 --> 01:13:33,045
l'm sorry. l never meant to hurt you.
l never meant to hurt anybody.

981
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:36,377
lt's just that somehow it makes
things happen. Terrible things.

982
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,061
l should've stopped
when l found out what it lived on.

983
01:13:39,133 --> 01:13:40,856
But it was so cute and harmless...

984
01:13:40,925 --> 01:13:44,024
...and we started doing business
and making money and you liked me--

985
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:48,220
Do you really think
l liked you because of that?

986
01:13:50,269 --> 01:13:52,887
l liked you from the day
l came to work here.

987
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:56,567
You mean, you'd still like me
even if l wasn't famous?

988
01:13:59,197 --> 01:14:01,084
l'd still love you, Seymour.

989
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,316
Really?

990
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:06,780
All l ever wanted was you...

991
01:14:08,732 --> 01:14:10,642
...and a sweet little house.

992
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:14,521
You're the most wonderful person
that ever lived.

993
01:14:14,588 --> 01:14:17,904
We're gonna get that little house
and everything will be okay.

994
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:21,242
''Suddenly Seymour

995
01:14:22,012 --> 01:14:24,947
''ls standing beside you

996
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:29,269
''Suddenly Seymour

997
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,537
''Showed me l can

998
01:14:32,604 --> 01:14:34,841
''Yes, you can--''

999
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:38,108
Excuse me, pardon me, beg your pardon.

1000
01:14:38,269 --> 01:14:40,636
lf you two kids would stop singing
for a moment...

1001
01:14:40,701 --> 01:14:43,123
...l've got something
l want to discuss with you.

1002
01:14:43,196 --> 01:14:45,368
Which one of you is Seymour Krelborn?

1003
01:14:47,068 --> 01:14:47,799
l am.

1004
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:48,916
lt's a pleasure.

1005
01:14:48,988 --> 01:14:51,956
Has your phone been busy!
l've been trying to reach you for weeks.

1006
01:14:52,028 --> 01:14:56,152
Patrick Martin, Licensing and Marketing,
World Botanical Enterprises.

1007
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,864
Son, kid, boy, are we gonna make
a fortune together!

1008
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:02,747
-He's not interested.
-He will be.

1009
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,254
Me and the guys at the home office
have been following this plant of yours.

1010
01:15:07,325 --> 01:15:10,325
We've come up with one incredible idea.

1011
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,631
We're very proud of it.

1012
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,234
Picture this.

1013
01:15:15,388 --> 01:15:18,803
We take leaf cuttings,
develop little Audrey lls...

1014
01:15:19,037 --> 01:15:22,485
...and sell them to florist shops
across the nation.

1015
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,552
Pretty soon every household in America
could have one.

1016
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:28,892
Every household in America!

1017
01:15:29,468 --> 01:15:31,988
For starters, kid. Why this thing could go...

1018
01:15:32,604 --> 01:15:33,531
...worldwide!

1019
01:15:34,108 --> 01:15:35,057
Worldwide?

1020
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,721
Think of it, boy.

1021
01:15:36,796 --> 01:15:38,803
Audrey lls everywhere!

1022
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:42,330
With the right advertising,
this thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1023
01:15:42,396 --> 01:15:43,672
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?

1024
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,839
What do you say, Seymour?
Do we have a deal?

1025
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:52,339
No! Keep your contract.
Nobody's touching that plant.

1026
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:54,005
We're offering a lot of money.

1027
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:56,215
Forget the money!
Keep it and get out of here!

1028
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,529
-Are you nuts?
-Yeah, l'm nuts.

1029
01:15:57,597 --> 01:15:59,669
Get out of here! Go on! Get out of here!

1030
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,395
l'll come back when you're
in a better mood.

1031
01:16:06,044 --> 01:16:07,800
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?

1032
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:09,079
l think so.

1033
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:12,727
He'll keep eating until there's nothing left.

1034
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:15,764
We've got to stop it, Seymour!
We've got to.

1035
01:16:16,668 --> 01:16:18,075
l've got to.

1036
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:20,568
l have to end this once and for all.

1037
01:16:21,085 --> 01:16:22,579
l'll bust that pod wide open.

1038
01:16:22,972 --> 01:16:25,273
Wait! l'm coming with you.

1039
01:16:25,468 --> 01:16:29,210
No, it's me that got us into this.
l'm the one to get us out.

1040
01:16:30,621 --> 01:16:32,376
Wait for me, Audrey.

1041
01:16:32,828 --> 01:16:35,446
This is between me and the vegetable.

1042
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:47,223
''Every household in America! ''
Thousands of you, eating!

1043
01:16:47,612 --> 01:16:49,881
That's what you had in mind
all along, isn't it?

1044
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:51,987
No shit, Sherlock!

1045
01:16:52,187 --> 01:16:56,442
We're not talking about one hungry plant.
We're talking about world conquest!

1046
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:58,804
