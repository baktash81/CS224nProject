14
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,298
With ten days off,
I figured you'd go abroad.

15
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,094
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,190
Yes.

17
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,532
Broke up with your boyfriend?

18
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,465
I just prefer the countryside.

19
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,802
- See ya!
- Bye!

20
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,267
Let's go play!

21
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,935
Bye now!

22
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,774
Later!

23
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,248
Did you get good grades?

24
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,442
No. But I don't care.

25
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,383
How come?

26
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,650
As soon as I get home,
we're traveling to Grandma's.

27
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,055
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,323
Lucky you!
Are you going away too?

29
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,330
Yeah, to Nagano.
How about you, Taeko?

30
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,330
I'm not sure.

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,068
My Dad bought a summer place.

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,828
Wow... that's great!

33
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,708
Such a bad grade in math again.

34
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,311
But I got a "B" in science.

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Are we going away for the holidays?

36
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,882
Not really.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,619
Take me someplace.

38
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,681
I'll take you to a movie.
Find out what's playing.

39
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,818
Not that. I mean to the country...

40
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,827
The country?

41
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,296
Like Grandma's country house.

42
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,889
Grandma lives with us.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,366
- Grandpa's then...
- He's dead.

44
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,565
We don't have relatives
in the country, so don't ask.

45
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,613
<i>My family had lived in Tokyo
for generations.</i>

46
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,775
<i>I envied friends who had family
in the countryside.</i>

47
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,848
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.

48
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,156
But I really want to go...

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,589
What about "Onoya"?

50
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,858
We're regulars.
They'd have a room for us.

51
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,127
Where's that?

52
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,693
Good idea.
Taeko's never been there.

53
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,965
That's right.

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,837
Is it in the mountains... by the sea?

55
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,836
It's in Atami.

56
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,069
Atami?

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,808
You get to ride the bullet train.

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,907
Sure, you ll love it.

59
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,679
Atami...

60
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,553
Lots of different hot springs...

61
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,886
There's a huge Roman Bath.

62
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,798
And others, like
the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

63
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,698
The beautiful Violet Bath!

64
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,032
The Violet Bath...

65
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,436
Oh yes. It's fantastic.

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,372
You love hot springs, right?

67
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,843
Since father's working,
you four go.

68
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,340
What?!

69
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,250
Us?

70
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,787
Go too?!

71
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,363
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,162
Everyone else has left town.

73
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,768
Aren't you going anywhere?

74
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,473
- Yes, I am.
- Where?

75
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,633
Atami.

76
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,038
Atami? What's in Atami?

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,944
Hot springs.

78
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,376
It's good timing.

79
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,480
We're going away next week.

80
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,150
No-one will be around for ages.

81
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,796
<i>Hello. Okajima residence.</i>

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,698
Nanako? It's Taeko.

83
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:41,297
I leave today. Any message for
your husband's family?

84
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,301
<i>Not really. Just buy them something.</i>

85
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,245
<i>Say it's from us and
I'll pay you back.</i>

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,785
Don't worry about it. How's Mom?

87
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,409
<i>She's out today.</i>

88
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,887
<i>She was mad you turned down
that guy's proposal.</i>

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,856
<i>"At 27, that's the best offer
she's going to get!"</i>

90
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,556
It's all she talks about.

91
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,533
<i>She's got a point.
You're not young anymore...</i>

92
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,829
Oh, yeah?

93
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,427
<i>Definitely.</i>

94
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,938
<i>You've got to settle down eventually.</i>

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,535
<i>By the way, did you really work
in the fields last year?</i>

96
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,308
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.

97
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,440
<i>Safflower?</i>

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,577
Thanks to you, I finally have family
in the countryside.

99
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,157
So, I'm making the most of it!

100
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,256
<i>Give me a break!</i>

101
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,096
<i>Rather than stay in that old house,</i>

102
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:43,191
<i>why not treat yourself
to a fancy hotel for once?</i>

103
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,395
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

104
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:50,132
No way. You mean
a hotel like "Onoya"?

105
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,642
<i>"Onoya"?</i>

106
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,872
<i>Not that again!</i>

107
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,150
<i>You've got to get over it.</i>

108
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,312
<i>Let go of that baggage from the past!</i>

109
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,693
<i>My sisters, of course, would never
go to a place like atami.</i>

110
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,669
Grandma...

111
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,571
Almost done?

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,341
Let's go to another bath.

113
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,846
We just went.

114
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,576
Only to the Swan Bath.

115
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:38,122
<i>Bored to tears, I went alone
to the Brothers Grimm Bath</i>

116
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,525
<i>the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath,</i>

117
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,960
<i>and the Violet Bath,
one after the other.</i>

118
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,089
It's enormous!

119
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,125
<i>When I got to the Roman Bath,
my head was spinning.</i>

120
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,831
It's amazing...

121
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,546
<i>And I fainted.</i>

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
<i>And with that, my trip was over.</i>

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,989
<i>Followed by endless weeks of vacation.</i>

124
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:33,704
<i>The other day, my sisters and I
were reminiscing.</i>

125
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,580
<i>We couldn't stop laughing</i>

126
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,048
<i>as the memories came flooding back.</i>

127
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,153
Had one before?

128
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,956
No, it's my first time.

129
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,091
I'm the one who asked for it.

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,426
Yeah, we know.

131
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,797
Where did you buy it?

132
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,267
Senbikiya in Ginza.

133
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,837
Must have been expensive.

134
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,034
How do we eat it?

135
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,369
Slice it into rings.

136
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,943
But how?

137
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,379
I don't know.

138
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,778
Didn't you ask in the store?

139
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,782
We'll eat it next Sunday.

140
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,292
Why not now?!

141
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,953
We don't know how.

142
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,632
I'll have a banana.

143
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,362
Me too.

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,174
Strange fruit they have
in those hot countries.

145
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,481
I'm home!

146
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,817
I know how to eat the pineapple!

147
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,215
Really?

148
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,390
I'll take that.

149
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,423
Mind your fingers.

150
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,826
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

151
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,001
What a nice smell.

152
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,313
It smells so good.

153
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,191
I see.

154
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,751
Get plates. Quick.

155
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,127
Okay.

156
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,196
Let us eat.

157
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,686
It's hard.

158
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,725
It's not very good.

159
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,389
Not so sweet.

160
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,559
Nothing like the canned stuff.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,503
Live long enough and you see
lots of different things.

162
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,143
- You can have mine.
- Mine too.

163
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,573
It's delicious...

164
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,348
Don't force yourself.

165
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,045
You'll get a stomachache.

166
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,263
What a let down.

167
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,132
Bananas taste much better.

168
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,466
You're so right.

169
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,701
Bananas are still the king of fruits.

170
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,071
I ll have one now.

171
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,503
The king of fruit is...

172
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,872
<i>the banana, after all.</i>

173
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,848
<i>The year I fainted at the baths and
had my first pineapple...</i>

174
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,654
<i>the Beatles came to Japan,
started the rock 'n'roll band</i>

175
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,625
<i>and electric guitar craze.</i>

176
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,931
<i>My sister Nanako, a freshman in
art school, was up on all the trends.</i>

177
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,103
Yeah, the Beatles'lyrics are great.

178
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:34,908
<i>When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd
cover her bottom going up the stairs.</i>

179
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,313
<i>My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy
about some Takarazuka actress.</i>

180
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,753
Yaeko...

181
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,786
I told you to knock!

182
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:57,467
<i>My sisters' memories are
mainly of fashion and pop trends.</i>

183
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,830
<i>For them, 1966 is the
height of nostalgia.</i>

184
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,770
<i>Whereas I was only ten years old.</i>

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,546
<i>My favorite band had yet to debut....</i>

186
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,280
<i>My only memories are the back and
forth between school and home.</i>

187
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,356
...mine was pinned on the wall!

188
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,618
That's nice.

189
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,095
And it might be entered in
an essay contest.

190
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,791
So, teacher kept it.

191
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,668
- I'd be so happy...
- You didn't finish lunch again.

192
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,836
Why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread?

193
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,840
'Cause I hate them.

194
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,537
I've got to throw it away.
What a waste.

195
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,112
Such a picky eater!

196
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,115
I'd rather you were a good eater
than a good essay writer.

197
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,839
How can you drink that stuff?

198
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,312
Milk's okay. It's onions I hate.

199
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,077
I'm leaving carrots
so I've got no choice.

200
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:24,514
Who decided we can only
leave one thing?

201
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,749
Shall I drink it?

202
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,086
Would you?

203
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,418
You'll eat my onions next time?

204
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,173
- Carrots?
- We're allowed one thing!

205
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,418
Two bowls is gross.

206
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,847
People who run in the corridor...

207
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,056
...when the hall monitor says
stop, should be punished.

208
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,591
How are you gonna do that?

209
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,566
They shouldn't do it.

210
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,861
That's right.

211
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,937
You might bump into someone.

212
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,373
If I bumped into you
I'd bounce a mile!

213
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,603
Get lost!

214
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,176
Running is no big deal.

215
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,375
I agree!

216
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,985
- Let's change the rule.
- But we already decided.

217
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,713
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

218
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,282
- Here!
- Miss Tani.

219
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,829
The hall monitor
should chase the offender,

220
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,457
catch them and punish them.

221
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,335
Mr. Suzuki.

222
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,236
Then the hall monitor should
be punished for running too.

223
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,775
He's right! He's right!

224
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,734
Way to go!

225
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,913
He's right.

226
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,004
Miss Tani.

227
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,380
The hall monitor shouldn't
be punished because...

228
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,019
...it's like a policeman
chasing a speeding car.

229
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,494
Any objections?

230
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,131
It makes sense...

231
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,968
No more running.

232
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:27,878
So, the hall monitor
can chase offenders.

233
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,482
Any other issues?

234
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,117
Miss Tani.

235
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,311
- Her again.
- Busybody.

236
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,753
Be quiet.

237
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,256
Some people don't finish lunch.

238
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,457
I just read an article
on the Vietnam War.

239
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,427
There are many
unfortunate people overseas.

240
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,093
We're very lucky.

241
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,103
Lucky to have you near me!

242
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,744
We should be grateful for our food.

243
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,680
We're allowed to leave
one thing on our plates,

244
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,583
but I think it's wrong!

245
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,952
Goody two-shoes.

246
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,851
- It can't hurt to leave one thing.
- Let's all leave milk...

247
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,125
- Give it to someone else...
- Of course.

248
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,328
- People hide leftovers in bread.
- That's cheating!

249
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,470
I hate school food.

250
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,273
If you want to speak,
raise your hand!

251
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,533
What a revolting situation.

252
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,383
<i>That night in bed,
after chatting to my sisters</i>

253
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,155
<i>more memories from fifth grade</i>

254
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,714
<i>came rushing back.</i>

255
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:55,426
<i>Our pet dog... . School sports day...</i>

256
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,862
<i>being scared by gross
horror comics....</i>

257
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,901
<i>longing for an electric
pencil-sharpener...</i>

258
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,737
<i>So many little details,
one after the other...</i>

259
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,207
<i>playing in my head like a movie,</i>

260
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,310
<i>almost overpowering me.</i>

261
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,084
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

262
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,752
That's her.

263
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,040
Hirota in our class
says he likes you.

264
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,044
Let's go.

265
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,922
We'll say we told you.

266
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,324
Told you.

267
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,832
Where is it?

268
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,960
Over there.

269
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,731
Shuji Hirota and Taeko Oka jima

270
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,635
lt's true!

271
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,241
What's he like?

272
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,972
- No idea.
- Me, neither.

273
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,571
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

274
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,379
No... of course not... not at all.

275
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,558
Which one is Hirota?

276
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,918
It's the girls from Room 5.

277
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,120
Hirota, they're looking for you.

278
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,488
I'm here!

279
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,227
Don't write silly things on the wall.

280
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,769
Taeko told us to tell you.

281
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,932
I didn't write anything.

282
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,739
You said you liked
Okajima in Room 5.

283
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,108
You did.

284
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,738
So, we wrote it for you.

285
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,987
<i>I love you so much....</i>

286
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,888
<i>But you're so far away....</i>

287
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,358
<i>Like gazing up at...</i>

288
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,689
Goodbye.

289
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,026
<i>A far distant star.</i>

290
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,831
Taeko!

291
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,836
We just went to see Hirota.

292
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,870
We told him not to
write things on walls.

293
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,343
Tsuneko!

294
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,939
Ah, no running.

295
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,616
Aren't you glad?

296
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,965
<i>5th Grade: Room 4</i>

297
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,509
Over here.

298
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,741
See? That's him.

299
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,988
What? Hirota likes Taeko?

300
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,388
He's amazing. A real star.

301
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,324
You mean baseball?

302
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,761
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

303
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,196
Really?

304
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,259
Our team plays his
in the next game.

305
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,040
Go, go, Hirota!

306
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,617
Go for it, Tono!

307
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,648
Hit it, Tono!

308
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,578
Kill it!

309
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,892
Go for it, Hirota!

310
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,856
Taeko's watching you!

311
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,897
Hit it, Tono!

312
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,052
Way to go, Hirota!

313
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,117
Strike him out!

314
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,487
Don't you dare cheer their side!

315
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,652
Of course not!

316
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,595
Go, go, Tono!

317
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,610
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

318
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,679
Hit it!

319
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,010
One leg stance!

320
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,563
Wow!

321
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,796
Way to go, Hirota!

322
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,646
<i>I knew nothing about baseball.</i>

323
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,478
<i>But even I could tell he was superb.</i>

324
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,494
Go, go, Hirota!

325
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,760
What's up, Taeko?

326
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:34,065
<i>Between the cold and the excitement,
I ran to the bathroom five times.</i>

327
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,829
Over here, over here!

328
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,438
Game!

329
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,243
Room 4 wins.

330
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,016
Thank you for the game.

331
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,121
You were great Hirota!

332
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,352
Good job.

333
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,360
You were amazing!

334
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,662
It was all your fault.

335
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,822
How come?

336
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,365
You don't know anything.

337
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,132
If Tono couldn't hit him,
how could we?

338
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,364
That's right.

339
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,173
You missed the throw and
three runs scored.

340
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,074
That's not true.

341
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,209
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

342
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,044
- Really?
- Great!

343
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,610
Hirota, you should go see her.

344
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,382
Yeah, you should.

345
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,949
I'm going home.

346
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,190
What's the matter, Taeko?

347
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,967
Look, she left.

348
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,781
Um...

349
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,286
...that stuff...

350
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,830
...on the wall...

351
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,566
Rainy day or...

352
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,833
cloudy or sunny day...

353
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,872
which do you like?

354
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,455
Cloudy.

355
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,795
Me too!

356
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:56,659
Rainy day or cloudy or sunny day.

357
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,160
Which do you like?

358
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,999
Me, too.

359
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:27,865
<i>I didn't intend the ten year-old me
to come on this trip.</i>

360
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,133
<i>But somehow, once she showed up</i>

361
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,536
<i>she wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

362
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,965
<i>But why me in the 5th grade?</i>

363
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:16,437
<i>Second hour, all boys play baseball,
all girls to the gym.</i>

364
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,344
<i>How come?</i>

365
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,938
<i>Baseball, great!</i>

366
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,627
<i>Today I'm going to talk about
something very important.</i>

367
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:44,369
You'll leave grade school,
then junior school then high school.

368
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,911
Then become grown ups and have babies.

369
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,005
A woman's body prepares
to have babies.

370
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,919
Did you know?

371
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,019
Really?

372
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,823
Mom told me
when I was in fourth grade,

373
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,900
since I'm an early-developer.

374
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,899
Early-developer?

375
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,230
That's right.

376
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,133
She said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early.

377
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,544
I bet those other girls

378
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,643
already have theirs.

379
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,548
- Are you gonna buy them?
- I am.

380
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,883
I knew it.

381
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,147
You'll buy them, too, right?

382
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,793
Well... yeah.

383
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,227
I think you should.

384
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,163
Nurse said
we all need them eventually.

385
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,634
That's true.

386
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,111
The girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary.

387
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,754
Did you know?

388
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,848
No.

389
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,928
But why?

390
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,257
How come you're buying underpants?

391
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,696
It's because...

392
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,893
Umm...

393
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,100
Why is the school selling underpants?

394
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,762
Are they for swimming?

395
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,202
You told Nakayama?

396
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,241
Why did you do that!?

397
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,144
You shouldn't tell boys.

398
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,979
It's supposed to be our secret.

399
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,990
It's because she likes him...

400
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,822
Did he ask you?

401
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,668
What's going on?

402
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,067
She told Nakayama about periods.

403
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,999
No!

404
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,203
He'll tell everyone.

405
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,675
I said to keep it secret.

406
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,406
You trust him?

407
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:10,245
- Oh no...
- Boys are disgusting.

408
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,685
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

409
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,886
Pervert!

410
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:23,700
<i>Looking up skirts was all the rage
and periods became an obsession.</i>

411
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,269
You got your period!

412
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,635
Cut it out!

413
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,666
<i>Second period break.</i>

414
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,641
Idiot.

415
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,837
Ouch.

416
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:35,913
Come here!

417
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,713
You've got a period.

418
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,444
No, I don't!

419
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,718
It's all Rie's fault.

420
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,221
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,489
What for?

422
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,031
For telling Nakayama.

423
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,600
It doesn't matter.

424
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,936
The nurse said it's very important.

425
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,169
I know.

426
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,302
I started when I was in fourth grade.

427
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,639
Really?

428
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,244
That's why I skip P. E. Sometimes.

429
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,916
You skip P. E. With a period?

430
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,079
Mom said I should.

431
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,885
He even said he felt sorry for us.

432
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,523
You told him about skipping P. E.?

433
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:31,593
He promised not to tell the others.

434
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,260
So, then they'll think

435
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,538
all girls who skip P. E. Have periods!

436
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,967
You think so?

437
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,100
Of course!

438
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,643
<i>Please excuse Taeko from P. E.
Because of her cold.</i>

439
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,848
I'm not missing P. E.

440
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,758
Your cold will get worse.

441
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,591
Then I'll stay home.

442
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,628
No. You don't have a fever.

443
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,289
Then I'll do P. E.

444
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,959
Fine, go ahead.

445
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,900
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

446
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,367
See you later.

447
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,739
Since when was she so fond of P. E.?

448
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
You're bright red.

449
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,723
She's right.

450
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,224
Are you okay?

451
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,288
I have a cold.

452
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,058
You have a fever.

453
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,391
You should skip P. E.

454
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,022
Yeah, you should.

455
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,760
I'll go tell the teacher.

456
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,093
No, don't.

457
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,430
Why not?

458
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,063
Mom already wrote a note.

459
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,237
There's no problem then.

460
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,470
Out of the way!

461
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,405
Ouch!

462
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,979
I'm missing P. E. Too.
Just like you.

463
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,992
Lucky them.

464
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,301
I wish I could play, too.

465
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,470
Do you...

466
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,311
...are you having a period?

467
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,772
Yes.

468
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,950
I'm not. I have a cold.

469
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,782
I know. You're sick.

470
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,618
Just sick. That's all.

471
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,752
A period isn't a sickness.

472
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,901
I could still play...

473
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,906
I'm gonna catch a period!

474
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,438
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

475
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,675
That was close.
Almost caught it...

476
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
Over here, over here!

477
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,013
"Catch a period"!

478
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,354
What a silly thing to say.

479
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,894
It's no laughing matter!

480
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,869
Taeko?

481
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,878
It's the period pair!

482
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,344
No, we're not!

483
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,482
Stupid boys.

484
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,322
You're so calm about it.

485
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:48,592
Mom said it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

486
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,201
I guess so, but...

487
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,966
<i>Like it or not,
a butterfly must first...</i>

488
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,111
<i>live as a caterpillar
before it can fly away.</i>

489
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,694
<i>Maybe I remember those days because</i>

490
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,959
<i>I was going through the
caterpillar stage.</i>

491
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,174
<i>Something definitely changed
when I started working.</i>

492
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:38,742
<i>at work and at play we girls were
livelier and more spirited than guys.</i>

493
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,583
<i>It was like
we'd finally found our wings.</i>

494
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,983
<i>But looking back now,</i>

495
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,891
<i>maybe we were just
flexing them pointlessly.</i>

496
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,230
<i>Perhaps the fifth grade me
was tagging along</i>

497
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,737
<i>with a message for me to reflect</i>

498
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,104
<i>and rethink my life.</i>

499
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:16,619
<i>Anyway, I decided to sleep
the rest of the way.</i>

500
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,833
Ouch!

501
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,878
<i>Excuse me,
has the Tokyo train gone?</i>

502
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,977
Was that your train?

503
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,141
No...

504
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,921
Taeko Okajima, right?

505
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,218
Yes, that's correct...

506
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,126
Thank goodness.

507
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,763
The car's this way.

508
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,728
Excuse me, but who are you?

509
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,866
You don't remember?

510
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,734
Of course you don't.

511
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,970
I'm Toshio. Kazuo s second cousin.

512
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,507
Oh, I see...

513
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,753
What's so funny?

514
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,863
Nothing. Sorry.

515
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,964
I thought you were trying
to steal my bag.

516
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,771
That's terrible.
Didn't I ask your name?

517
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:22,368
Yes, you did.
I just thought... sorry...

518
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,206
I beg your pardon.

519
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,648
No problem.

520
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,284
Where's Kazuo?

521
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,993
He asked me last night
to come pick you up

522
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,359
It's been raining?

523
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,193
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

524
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,594
I should've used my Dad's car

525
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,700
but I like mine better.

526
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,143
It's a little tight.

527
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,287
May I leave it on?

528
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,887
Sure.

529
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,853
This is unusual music.

530
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,859
It's a Hungarian group.

531
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,333
Hungarian?

532
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,000
You know a lot about it?

533
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,434
A little. It's farmer's music.

534
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,237
I like it because I'm a farmer.

535
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,508
Cool.

536
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,403
Right?

537
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,802
Remember last year's party
at the farmhouse?

538
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:37,605
A bunch of guys
turned up, right?

539
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,672
Maybe you don't remember.

540
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,955
They came to check out
the girl from Tokyo.

541
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,024
I was one of them.

542
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,588
Watch out, jerk!

543
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,101
I heard you're picking safflower.
Do you dye fabric?

544
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,737
Just curious.

545
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:16,309
Safflower's kind of unusual.
Well, maybe not for you.

546
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,120
It's known as a famous
local product but

547
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,491
hardly anyone grows it.

548
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:29,324
- Wasn't it big in the old days?
- For the merchants, sure.

549
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,361
They got rich, but for farmers,
it was just another crop.

550
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,475
Do you know: In time whose skin
will it grace, this crimson flower.

551
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,640
The famous Basho poem?
I read it before coming.

552
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,315
Is that so?

553
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,579
I only learned it last night.

554
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,694
I also read that the flower-pickers

555
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:03,395
couldn't afford to wear
the rouge they made.

556
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,875
Is that where you had the barbeque?

557
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,171
There'll be another this year, too.

558
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,689
Are market reforms making
agriculture difficult?

559
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,662
Absolutely.

560
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,929
As things go, Japanese farming
might just collapse,

561
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,334
all of sudden, one day.

562
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,703
But then again,

563
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,177
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work.

564
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,770
Isn't it the same in the city?

565
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,174
Yes.

566
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,450
But fewer people live for their work.

567
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,313
What about you?

568
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,451
Me?

569
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:09,727
I don't live for my job
but I don't hate it either.

570
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,866
I could farm twenty-four hours a day.

571
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,399
It's fascinating
to raise living things.

572
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,467
You have livestock?

573
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:29,149
Not that. We've got some animals,

574
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,690
but I'm talking about rice, apples,
cherries. They're all living things.

575
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,219
If we take good care of them,

576
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,923
I feel like
they'll do their best for us.

577
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,764
Listen to me preach.

578
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,539
Not at all. I get what you mean.

579
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,237
To tell the truth, I used to
work in an office.

580
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,872
I only just started farming.

581
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,017
Is that right?

582
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:07,623
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.

583
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,755
I quit work and joined
my friend's organic farm.

584
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,390
People said I'm nuts,
but I don't regret it.

585
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,961
Organic farm?

586
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:25,070
"Grown with no
artificial chemicals whatsoever."

587
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:29,404
Just blood, sweat and tears!

588
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:34,177
<i>We use all natural stuff,
no pesticides or anything.</i>

589
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:38,880
I've seen the labels:
"No chemicals used"

590
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,025
But it's not just that.

591
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,561
We bring out the plant's life force.

592
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:50,395
It's cool...
like lending nature a hand.

593
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,103
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

594
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,512
I was told to take you straight
to the fields.

595
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,608
Yes, I'm starting right away.

596
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,244
Not going to rest?

597
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:16,292
Don't you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft?

598
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,883
That's right, but...

599
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,362
I'm trying to become an early-riser.

600
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,526
That's why I took the night train.

601
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,365
You're certainly eager.

602
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,495
There it is!

603
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,754
'Morning, everyone!

604
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,298
Great to have you back, Taeko.

605
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,236
Thanks for having me.

606
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,775
Grandma, you re looking well.

607
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,311
Welcome back dear.

608
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,507
Aren't you tired?

609
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,008
No, not at all.

610
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,217
We made your bed just in case.

611
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,517
That's okay. Look, I'm raring to go!

612
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:32,789
Wearing work pants too!

613
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,665
That's all I brought.

614
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,927
Young people here don't wear
them any more.

615
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,437
You look like the real thing Taeko.

616
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,667
That's right.

617
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,961
Taeko!

618
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,060
Don't!

619
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,636
<i>And so began my second
taste of country life.</i>

620
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:39,418
<i>How could this yellow flower produce
such a bright red?</i>

621
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,533
<i>They told me a sad tale
from the old days.</i>

622
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,997
<i>The girls didn't have gloves,</i>

623
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:52,773
<i>and their bare hands
would get pricked by the thorns.</i>

624
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,212
<i>It was their blood that
made the red so deep.</i>

625
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,408
<i>I could imagine the resentment</i>

626
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:07,212
<i>they must've felt
toward the fancy city girls.</i>

627
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,462
<i>To make a handful of rouge took
nearly 500 lbs of petals.</i>

628
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:19,695
<i>This rouge was literally worth
its weight in gold.</i>

629
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,517
<i>The petals are washed, trodden,
then exposed to the air and the sun.</i>

630
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,724
<i>As the petals oxidize,
they gradually turn red.</i>

631
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,935
<i>After a few more days,</i>

632
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:05,201
<i>fermentation turns them bright red
and they become sticky.</i>

633
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:12,543
<i>Pounded, wrung into balls
and sun-dried, they finally become</i>

634
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:17,712
<i>the basic ingredient of rouge.</i>

635
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,228
<i>The liquid from the pressing
wasn't wasted either.</i>

636
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,455
<i>The red pigment in the yellow broth</i>

637
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,002
<i>was used to dye fabric.</i>

638
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,593
<i>Let's go dye our cloth.</i>

639
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,998
<i>Safflower do your best.</i>

640
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,702
<i>Cheer me up with
your pretty color.</i>

641
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:45,138
<i>For those village girls,
with no chance of make-up or kimonos,</i>

642
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,617
<i>Safflower dye brought color
into their drab lives.</i>

643
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:58,925
<i>The yellow pigment dissolves in water
leaving clothes a light pink.</i>

644
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,020
So pretty!

645
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:07,533
<i>Machines now take away
some of the work,</i>

646
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:12,535
<i>but the petal's still need
picking every day.</i>

647
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:44,265
<i>Rouge cakes soon mould,
and the flowers wait for no one.</i>

648
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:50,676
<i>No sooner are you done picking,
than they bloom again.</i>

649
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:59,145
<i>When the rains come,
work continues into the early hours.</i>

650
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,026
<i>Each day flew by,</i>

651
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:09,799
<i>Pleasantly tired, I thought about
the flower-pickers of old.</i>

652
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,364
<i>If I could've worked
like this as a child,</i>

653
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:20,675
<i>my school essays would've been
really interesting.</i>

654
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,454
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

655
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,121
5,000 yen? I can't give you that.

656
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,792
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

657
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,131
Are they that much?

658
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,036
Nonsense.

659
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,299
They're Pumas.

660
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,307
- Pumas?
- It's a brand.

661
00:56:55,378 --> 00:57:00,179
I'm not sure.
There must be cheaper ones.

662
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,308
How about the ones you've got?

663
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,853
Nobody wears them now.

664
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,114
Everyone's getting Pumas.

665
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,418
Who's everyone?

666
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,587
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

667
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,755
That's only four people.

668
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,297
Everyone's wearing them!

669
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,929
No. You never do your chores.

670
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,476
Did you ask for a dress for
your Barbie Doll?

671
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,544
Didn't you promise to ask only at
Christmas and your birthday?

672
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,281
You always spoil her.

673
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,213
Is that right, Taeko?

674
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:42,280
<i>All of a sudden,
the ten year-old me was back.</i>

675
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,424
But...

676
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,421
Yaeko got a kimono and
it wasn't even her graduation.

677
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,131
It's for tea-ceremony.

678
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,863
You keep asking for
lots of little stuff,

679
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,496
we get one or two big things.

680
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,402
Right?

681
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,736
Yep.

682
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,008
Stop that.

683
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,982
Always picky about food.

684
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,253
Dad loves the onions, right?

685
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:18,786
Anyway, that kimono will be
yours in the end.

686
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,026
Always hand-me-downs.

687
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,793
- Some people don't get anything.
- Exactly.

688
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,927
Then give me that enamel purse.

689
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,561
Didn't you give it to her yet?

690
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,904
You're too old for that.
Give it to her.

691
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,012
I don't want it.

692
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,314
Keep the stupid purse.

693
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,158
Then I won't give it to you.

694
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,553
I'm not buying you a new one.

695
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,493
Fine.

696
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,992
Good. I actually really like it.

697
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,996
I hate it.

698
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,271
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

699
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,812
See, has to be thrown away.

700
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,882
What a waste.

701
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,650
Don't throw it away! Please Mother.

702
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,015
It's your fault.

703
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,118
Finish it yourself next time.

704
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,350
You three are so selfish.

705
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,404
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

706
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,076
Yaeko won't give me hers.

707
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,046
You said you didn't want it.

708
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,814
Yeah, but...

709
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,583
You said it, you have to do it.

710
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,493
Hurry up and get ready.

711
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,769
I'll wear these!

712
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:15,238
Why is Yaeko coming?

713
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:21,173
You said it was just the three of us.

714
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:26,387
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

715
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:30,016
It's Chinese food.
The more the merrier.

716
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,923
Grandma's not coming.

717
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,725
She doesn't eat oily food.

718
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,466
If you don't want to come, stay here.

719
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,959
We're going Taeko.

720
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,797
Come on slowpoke.

721
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,066
I don't have a purse.

722
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,206
Lend her that enamel one.

723
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:44,930
Here.

724
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,796
Ouch.

725
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,837
Let's go.

726
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,537
I'm not going.

727
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,405
Okay. Let's go Mother.

728
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,244
Stay with Grandma then.

729
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,745
Not coming Taeko?

730
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,416
No I'm not.

731
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,838
We're off then.

732
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,144
I'm coming too!

733
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,465
No shoes!

734
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,264
Father please.

735
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,165
A button came off.

736
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,106
We didn't go out, of course.

737
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,651
My face was swollen and a cold towel

738
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,119
didn't stop the stinging.

739
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,320
That night I couldn't sleep

740
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,258
wondering why it was always me.

741
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,795
Figuring I must've been adopted

742
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,825
I cried myself to sleep.

743
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,799
Was it the first time he hit you?

744
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,431
Yes, the first and only time.

745
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:11,773
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

746
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,907
Maybe that's easier.

747
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,783
<i>When it's only once,
you can't stop thinking why.</i>

748
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:24,117
It's hard to imagine you
a selfish brat.

749
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,151
A spoiled brat.

750
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,198
I wasn't just fussy about
onions, either.

751
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:35,165
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

752
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,171
Wait a second!

753
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:42,074
Your poor Mom.
I shouldn't encourage you.

754
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,978
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

755
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,384
Good girl.

756
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,783
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

757
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,190
Hooray!

758
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,710
Hey!

759
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,377
100 yen each.

760
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:32,657
Taeko...

761
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,990
Tomorrow...

762
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,699
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

763
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,729
- Zao?
- Yes.

764
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,797
You went to Yamadera
last year, right?

765
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,997
The family said it was okay.

766
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,061
<i>The views at Zao were beautiful.</i>

767
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,737
<i>But Zao had become famous
and touristy.</i>

768
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,011
How come you re not married?

769
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,279
Do you find that strange?

770
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,954
Well, no, not really.

771
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,053
Lots of women work now.

772
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,650
Most of my friends are single.

773
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,625
Oh, is that right?

774
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,096
That's right.

775
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,697
I see.

776
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,192
It's true.

777
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,127
Right.

778
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,498
Really. It's very common.

779
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,446
Toshio?

780
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,378
In elementary school, could you
do fractions?

781
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,082
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

782
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,024
I don't remember.

783
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,253
I wasn't bad at math though.

784
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,729
I see.

785
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,159
Lucky you.

786
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:21,430
I bet you don't remember
'cause it was easy.

787
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,535
Maybe. Why do you ask?

788
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,801
It seems that people who could do it

789
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,538
went on to have easy lives.

790
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:37,547
One girl, completely average
...not even good at math,

791
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:41,145
always could do it perfect right away.

792
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,225
She grew up really normal

793
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,453
and now has two kids.

794
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,933
I was no good at it.

795
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,238
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

796
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:04,806
<i>Room 5, Taeko Okajima. 25 points</i>

797
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,848
Before the test...

798
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,755
...we had art class.

799
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,633
And... um... we did blow pictures.

800
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,395
Blow pictures?

801
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:33,341
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

802
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,606
and blow patterns in it.

803
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,113
And?

804
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,519
You blow like this,
really hard, right?

805
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,419
Yes?

806
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:53,351
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

807
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,858
That's why you did so badly?

808
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,763
That's right.

809
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,462
I see.

810
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:09,939
Do you know the answers now?

811
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,476
The correct answers?

812
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,910
Well...

813
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,050
Have Yaeko help you with them.

814
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,846
Yaeko?!

815
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,353
That's right.

816
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,121
Or Nanako, whichever.

817
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,259
I'll ask Nanako.

818
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:55,250
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait til after dinner?

819
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,162
I'll ask Yaeko...

820
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,578
Mother!

821
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,255
Mother! Mother!

822
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,992
What is this?!

823
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,992
How on earth...?

824
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:38,089
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

825
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:43,201
But this is beyond belief!

826
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,966
That's why I'm asking you...

827
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,974
Is she alright in the head?

828
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,101
Just help her.

829
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,239
Normally this is easy.

830
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,279
But that child's not normal!

831
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:13,091
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

832
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:19,030
<i>You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?</i>

833
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,706
Sit.

834
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,609
Say your times table from the top.

835
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,916
I know that.
I'm in fif th grade already!

836
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,354
Then why so many mistakes?!

837
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,053
It's dividing fractions.

838
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:51,169
Just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

839
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,741
They taught you that, right?

840
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,502
Then why do you get it wrong?

841
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,908
Yaeko, one step at a time.

842
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,482
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

843
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:19,595
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

844
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,661
how would this divide

845
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,166
between four people, right?

846
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:34,881
So, it's one, two, three,
four, five, six...

847
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,110
one-sixth each, right?

848
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:42,087
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

849
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,858
How come it's less when you multiply?

850
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:50,263
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

851
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:55,058
Anyway!

852
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,105
Forget about apples...

853
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:03,702
just remember to inverse and multiply.

854
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,380
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

855
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,548
No, S. K. D.

856
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:20,050
- She got "D" in math.
- "D"?

857
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,256
Yes, and just barely.

858
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:29,295
If she got half right,
it'd be worth scolding her.

859
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,134
Right.

860
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:34,901
Should you get her IQ checked?

861
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,706
They said it was fine
when she started.

862
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,474
Maybe she turned dumb?

863
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,379
Remember she fell downstairs
as a baby?

864
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,214
Right, in her walker!

865
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,354
I thought she was dead.

866
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,390
It was just a bump.

867
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:50,958
It's affecting her now.

868
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,720
That's it!

869
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,832
<i>Nonsense.
She's just no good at math.</i>

870
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,629
<i>She chats too much in class.</i>

871
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:05,297
<i>If she'd just listen,;
even an idiot can do it.</i>

872
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:09,707
<i>It's only two more years
until Junior High.</i>

873
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,543
Two-thirds of this apple,

874
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:18,746
divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.

875
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,121
Two-thirds of this,

876
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,989
into a quarter makes it...

877
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,870
Even now, dividing fractions
is difficult.

878
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:46,806
We farmers give up too easily.

879
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:52,146
We just yield to the flow and
follow what they do in the cities.

880
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,155
Let's rethink the real
meaning of prosperity.

881
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:59,250
Return to the old ways of farming.

882
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,121
Wow...

883
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:07,092
So, that explains the organic farming?

884
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:14,066
I'm just quoting my friend.

885
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,010
But I agree with it.

886
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,681
It's great the way you hold onto
your memories of math class.

887
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,117
It wasn't meant to impress you.

888
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:31,657
People say you work
in a great place

889
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,760
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

890
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:41,268
I really admire
your devotion to farming.

891
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,404
You re being sarcastic?

892
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,272
Of course not!

893
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,902
There aren't many people like you.

894
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,952
Farming's in total decline, right?

895
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:02,617
So we can't just carry on as normal.

896
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,488
We've got to think about the future.

897
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:10,256
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

898
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,663
otherwise we can't keep it up.

899
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,198
Taeko do you ski?

900
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:24,443
I've been with friends a few times.

901
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:28,607
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

902
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,947
Are you good?

903
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:35,713
No, but I'm an instructor there.

904
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:39,088
An instructor? You must be great.

905
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,593
All my friends are too. It's nothing.

906
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:11,219
At last, we're in the
middle of nowhere.

907
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,153
"Nowhere" huh?

908
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:17,390
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

909
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,325
Interesting point though.

910
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,273
City people see the trees and rivers

911
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,401
and are grateful for "nature".

912
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:34,882
But what you see here
is all made by man.

913
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:36,876
By man?

914
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,519
Farmers.

915
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,159
- That wood?
- Yes.

916
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,591
- Those trees?
- Yes.

917
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,022
- That stream?
- Yes.

918
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:55,032
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

919
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,168
someone's Great-Great Grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

920
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:01,640
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

921
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,041
I see.

922
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,544
Mankind battles nature
and receives from it.

923
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,643
They evolve together,
and create this scenery.

924
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:17,317
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

925
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:23,091
Farmers can't exist without nature.

926
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:28,335
So they've always taken great care

927
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,463
to give her a helping hand in return.

928
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:37,535
A collaboration between
man and nature...

929
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,646
That's the heart of country life.

930
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,750
That's why I feel so at home.

931
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,887
I didn't grow up here,
but somehow always felt...

932
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:53,620
my soul was at home here.

933
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:58,828
So that's it...

934
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,274
My back aches.

935
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:55,088
What's so great about organic farming?

936
01:19:56,324 --> 01:20:01,023
Only the theory. Like I said...

937
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,621
giving nature a hand is hard work.

938
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,126
Things haven't changed
in a hundred years.

939
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:12,873
No, even "organic" rice
uses weed-killer.

940
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:17,877
There's not enough labor
to weed by hand.

941
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,140
You're really working hard.

942
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,384
How about some tea?

943
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,517
Fantastic.

944
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,288
I felt like a break.

945
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,934
<i>Toshio let me try
a variety of things...</i>

946
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:49,341
<i>...until I felt I knew
all about country life.</i>

947
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,032
That's great...

948
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,688
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

949
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,198
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

950
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:56,002
It was my line in a school play.

951
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,306
I was "Village Child A".

952
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,948
Oh, I see.

953
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:05,446
I only ever had small roles too.

954
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,781
And you Naoko?

955
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:12,224
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

956
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:17,230
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

957
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,769
And now there are fewer kids.

958
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:26,898
I see. But getting the big
roles must be fun.

959
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:32,707
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

960
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:36,675
Good for you.
I was always mediocre.

961
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,185
The sports version
of "Village Child A"

962
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:44,324
Still, I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

963
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,986
It was going to make me a star.

964
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,064
A star?

965
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,154
Yes.

966
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,425
What kind of star?

967
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,865
That tiny role?

968
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,358
Yes.

969
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,130
Even though you weren't the lead?

970
01:22:58,506 --> 01:22:59,268
Yes.

971
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,638
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

972
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,868
Cause you were the cutest?

973
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,506
No, not that!

974
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,879
I rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

975
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:14,280
Even for "Village Child A"...

976
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:20,361
The line was so short,
I felt something missing.

977
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:25,429
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

978
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,865
I know. You made up more!

979
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,668
Exactly.

980
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:37,070
Look up there, the crows fly home.

981
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,807
- First one...
- Then two...

982
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,179
- Then three...
- Then four...

983
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:48,111
Farewell dear crows.
You take care now.

984
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,819
<i>And your teacher loved it.</i>

985
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:54,724
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

986
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,222
Very good everyone.

987
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:03,103
But let's stick to the script.

988
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,842
<i>after all that.</i>

989
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:21,047
<i>It wasn't a good line,
so I didn't mind.</i>

990
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,721
<i>I wasn't discouraged at all.</i>

991
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:30,054
<i>I realized that I could act
even when there were no lines.</i>

992
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:38,199
Behold, the crows fly home.

993
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,441
- First one.
- Then two.

994
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,777
- Then three.
- Then four.

995
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,932
That was all.

996
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,637
It was worth the effort.
"Village Child A" was a hit.

997
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,905
Believe it or not.

998
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:25,816
People asked if I'd had lessons.
Teachers praised me...

999
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:29,586
Then something amazing happened.

1000
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,594
Anyone home?

1001
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:35,555
Coming.

1002
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:41,033
<i>...and then the dynamite blew up
right in my face!</i>

1003
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,728
...right in my face!

1004
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,928
What? Our Taeko?

1005
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,643
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

1006
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:59,351
As a service to the community,

1007
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,480
please let your daughter perform.

1008
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,021
A star!

1009
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,723
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1010
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,690
We wouldn't take too long.

1011
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,596
Well, but...

1012
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:17,235
Of course we'd bring her
straight home.

1013
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,501
I'll be in a real play.

1014
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,703
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

1015
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:25,439
I'll be a star!

1016
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:34,949
<i>Oh, oh, oh,
oh what a wonderful day</i>

1017
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:41,325
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1018
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,009
Mother!

1019
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,242
So? So?

1020
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:02,177
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

1021
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,911
You were so good
in the school play.

1022
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,754
And? And?

1023
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,923
He practically begged me!

1024
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,199
Wow that's great!

1025
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,567
At least you're good at something.

1026
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,402
She writes good essays too.

1027
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:32,411
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

1028
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,541
That's right. That's right.

1029
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:39,916
I was lead in "The Poor Sparrow"
but no one came for me.

1030
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,951
You see, you see!

1031
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,255
Are you going to do it?

1032
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:11,012
This could lead to a career.

1033
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,050
Join the Takarazuka Theater.

1034
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:17,556
Start rehearsing now,
it's perfect timing.

1035
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:20,726
Acting is out.

1036
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,623
Show business people
are no good.

1037
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,267
"Show business"...
don't exaggerate...

1038
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,837
That's right. It's...

1039
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,269
I said no.

1040
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:33,833
Dinner.

1041
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,720
Father's so stubborn.

1042
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,764
Why did you have to
mention a career?

1043
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:04,031
- Can I bathe first?
- Sure.

1044
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,835
Or Takarazuka...?

1045
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:11,002
Or show business?
You know Dad...

1046
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,512
Why did you say that Nanako?

1047
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,646
That's enough.

1048
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:31,656
<i>Poor boy, poor boy,
Don't you feel sorry for me?</i>

1049
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,063
We won't take much of her time.

1050
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:37,702
I know but...

1051
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,970
I beg you.

1052
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,575
She's rather shy...

1053
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,914
the timid type...

1054
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:56,517
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1055
01:29:56,624 --> 01:30:01,823
<i>Poor boy, poor boy...</i>

1056
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:06,628
<i>.... Such a long way from home...</i>

1057
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:11,629
<i>Poor boy</i>

1058
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:25,950
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1059
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:27,580
I see.

1060
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,757
She's boasting to everyone.

1061
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:33,894
I see.

1062
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:37,226
Today her Mom met her at school

1063
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:41,893
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1064
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,230
A frilly thing out to here...

1065
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:52,440
Don't tell anyone
you got the first offer.

1066
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:58,483
Because that would hurt
Aoki very much.

1067
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,583
Do you understand?

1068
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:08,827
Do you understand?

1069
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:42,658
<i>Breaking through the waves</i>

1070
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,726
<i>Shooting through the clouds</i>

1071
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:55,766
<i>Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin
Island? Where will it take us?</i>

1072
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:05,712
<i>Something special waits for us,</i>

1073
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:10,621
<i>just over the horizon</i>

1074
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:16,061
<i>There 'll be hard times,
there 'll be sad times,</i>

1075
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,595
<i>but we'll never lose heart</i>

1076
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,758
<i>We hate to cry,
so let's laugh instead</i>

1077
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:24,103
<i>Let's go!</i>

1078
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:29,472
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1079
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,795
Poor you.

1080
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:56,135
I joined the drama group
in high school.

1081
01:32:56,571 --> 01:33:00,701
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1082
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,040
And then?

1083
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:06,177
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1084
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:12,241
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

1085
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,446
that was a joke.

1086
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,954
But...

1087
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:22,525
I guess Dads are the same all over.

1088
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:28,595
When I was in high school,
I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1089
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:36,538
I even wrote to my cousin
about schools there.

1090
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:39,207
Did you really?

1091
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:44,109
I gave up. But it annoyed me

1092
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:47,915
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

1093
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:53,058
Not anymore though.
I respect my dad...

1094
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,219
He's an expert farmer.

1095
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,060
But I know how you felt.

1096
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,761
Mine's just a funny story.

1097
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:04,997
No it's the same, I understand.

1098
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:14,078
But we'll never lose heart, we hate
to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1099
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:16,742
I also watched
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1100
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:18,016
Really?

1101
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,621
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1102
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:22,552
He was my hero!

1103
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:25,184
Of course.

1104
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:28,853
Those songs were full
of encouragement.

1105
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:31,557
What was that other one...?

1106
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:35,932
"If today's no good,
you'll have tomorrow"

1107
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,904
"If tomorrow's no good,
you'll have the next day"

1108
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:41,604
"If that's no good,
there'll be another"

1109
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:44,337
"There's always a tomorrow"

1110
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,277
What a weird song!

1111
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:56,919
<i>That song, about putting things off,
Toshio took</i>

1112
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,551
<i>in a positive, affirmative way.</i>

1113
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:04,957
<i>I liked his approach to life.</i>

1114
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,778
You're going tomorrow?

1115
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:28,514
Thank you for having me for so long.

1116
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,556
Thank you, my dear.

1117
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:40,358
Do you like it here?

1118
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:44,871
Very much. I feel so at home.

1119
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:48,464
Glad to hear it.

1120
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:52,106
I've lived here all my life.

1121
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:58,213
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

1122
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,345
You think it's better than Tokyo?

1123
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:03,656
Without a doubt.

1124
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:09,555
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...
People shouldn't live like that.

1125
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,961
This is a different world.

1126
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:17,333
You really like it here then?

1127
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:21,738
Yes. The nice surroundings,
the kind people...

1128
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,873
Taeko.

1129
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:31,378
Why don't you live here? With Toshio?

1130
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:40,154
Since his brother moved to Tokyo,

1131
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:44,960
why don't you stay here
and marry Toshio?

1132
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,362
Granny!

1133
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:49,766
Mother... you've gone too far!

1134
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:52,372
Taeko's shocked.

1135
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,840
Please think it over.

1136
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,771
Don't pay any attention. She's joking.

1137
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:01,209
Joking, right, Granny?

1138
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:03,977
No. I'm serious.

1139
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:06,746
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

1140
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:11,086
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1141
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:13,956
Of course we'd love it.

1142
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:19,556
But Taeko's a city person.

1143
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,691
Of course.

1144
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:24,828
But she loves it here,

1145
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:29,376
she works so hard on the land,
it's a joy to watch.

1146
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:33,877
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

1147
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,940
You're being rude.
You're embarrasing her.

1148
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:43,886
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.

1149
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:47,984
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1150
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:52,694
Please don't be angry.

1151
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:57,527
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

1152
01:37:57,638 --> 01:38:00,937
What're you talking about?

1153
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:06,210
She's only been here
twice on holiday.

1154
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,007
Suddenly bringing this up...
you're upsetting her.

1155
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,209
So you're against it?

1156
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:15,880
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

1157
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:20,359
We don't even know
how Toshio feels.

1158
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:23,430
One look at him and it's obvious.

1159
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:29,298
Don't dismiss it before
we've asked her.

1160
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:31,596
Taeko!

1161
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:38,973
Let her be.

1162
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:45,976
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

1163
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,780
I don't think I was wrong.

1164
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:09,033
<i>I'd never even thought
of being a farmer's wife.</i>

1165
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:13,538
<i>I was strangely moved,</i>

1166
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:15,773
<i>even imagining it might be possible.</i>

1167
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:21,181
<i>If only I could've replied:</i>

1168
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,813
<i>"I'd love to... ." like in a movie.</i>

1169
01:39:24,925 --> 01:39:26,483
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

1170
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:32,195
<i>Suddenly my love of the country,
and my play-farming,</i>

1171
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,626
<i>seemed so phony.</i>

1172
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,736
<i>Declaring my love for country life</i>

1173
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,776
<i>based on a ten day vacation,
now felt so embarrassing.</i>

1174
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:48,074
<i>Then with no warning....</i>

1175
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:51,910
<i>everyone seeing right through me.</i>

1176
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:55,250
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1177
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,853
<i>I ain't shaking hands with you.</i>

1178
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,800
<i>That shirt he wore today....</i>

1179
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:10,631
<i>What about it?</i>

1180
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,468
<i>Tanaka 's old shirt.</i>

1181
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,937
<i>Don't tell anyone.</i>

1182
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:20,742
<i>When it's his turn to feed the ducks,
he takes the bread home.</i>

1183
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,215
<i>Did you see his hands?</i>

1184
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:26,115
<i>Glad he's not sitting next to me.</i>

1185
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,254
<i>Poor Taeko.</i>

1186
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,789
<i>Have him switch places.</i>

1187
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:34,486
<i>He should sit with the boys.</i>

1188
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:36,153
<i>Right Taeko?</i>

1189
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:40,125
I don't mind.

1190
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,597
You shouldn't talk like that.

1191
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,428
You don't mind?

1192
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,165
Don't be a goody-goody.

1193
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,609
Don't you dare tell anyone
what we said.

1194
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:55,940
I'll beat you up!

1195
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:04,585
Don't go!

1196
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:19,233
What are you doing out here?

1197
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:23,068
Nothing. Taking a walk.

1198
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:27,705
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

1199
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,893
A little souvenir.

1200
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,392
Some of Mom's pickles.

1201
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:57,539
Please don't go back yet.

1202
01:41:57,644 --> 01:41:58,975
Why not?

1203
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:02,276
Just drive... anywhere.

1204
01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:04,283
Something wrong?

1205
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:09,656
I knew a boy named Abe.

1206
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:15,490
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.

1207
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:18,893
He once said,

1208
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,425
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1209
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:53,366
His family was poor.
He never had sports gear.

1210
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:58,932
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

1211
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:04,875
And if I complained or
even dared frown at him,

1212
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:08,345
he'd threaten to hit me.

1213
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:15,080
I hated it. I longed for
the end of the term,

1214
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,380
so we could change seats.

1215
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:23,328
I hated holding hands
in dance class,

1216
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:28,264
hated having to lend him
my homework.

1217
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:36,138
The girls gossiped
and called him names.

1218
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:41,947
But I wouldn't join in.

1219
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:47,217
I thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

1220
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:50,281
But one day...

1221
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,787
He was transferred in
the middle of the term.

1222
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:01,529
The teacher made us all
shake hands and say goodbye.

1223
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:06,301
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1224
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:12,972
His hands were filthy.

1225
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:20,284
Walking around,
shaking hands with us,

1226
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,746
he looked so nervous.

1227
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:30,226
Back at his own desk,
only I was left.

1228
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,960
When I held out my hand he said,

1229
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:41,831
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1230
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,345
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1231
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:59,218
I hated him the most.

1232
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:04,493
He knew that.

1233
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:08,165
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1234
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,836
What happened at the farmhouse?

1235
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:23,211
Ever since I was little...

1236
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,245
I just pretend to be nice.

1237
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,722
Nothing's changed.

1238
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,429
You're strange, today.
Not the usual you.

1239
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,572
I don't know what happened, but...

1240
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:53,577
It's nothing to do with that.

1241
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,251
I'm sorry.

1242
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:05,819
I just feel bad about what happened.

1243
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:12,662
I think that boy was stupid.

1244
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:17,834
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

1245
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:22,500
No, he liked the class president.

1246
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,610
He was always acting tough with me.

1247
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:32,743
Hands in pockets, spitting,
swearing, swaggering along,

1248
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:35,084
...showing off.

1249
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,712
Exactly.

1250
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:40,551
I know how he feels.
When I was little,

1251
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,322
I used to bully the girl I liked.

1252
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,227
That's not it.

1253
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:49,769
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1254
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:53,103
There's the problem.

1255
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:56,771
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1256
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,411
As if you know...

1257
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,041
Let me guess, then...

1258
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:06,182
He wasn't that tough.

1259
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,090
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

1260
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:19,664
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1261
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,292
He needed you to be tough with.

1262
01:47:23,403 --> 01:47:27,339
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

1263
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,845
He could only prove how
tough he was with you.

1264
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,363
Don't be filthy!

1265
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:49,519
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

1266
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,555
that I began copying him.

1267
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:56,628
Too late though, huh?

1268
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:59,765
I couldn't take back

1269
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:02,834
the pain I caused him.

1270
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:14,637
It's stopped raining.

1271
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:16,909
Oh, yes.

1272
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:23,280
The moon's out.

1273
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:37,501
Sometimes at night
you see raccoons here.

1274
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:41,001
Shall we go back?

1275
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:45,203
They must be worried about me.

1276
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:51,976
This'll be the talk of the town.

1277
01:49:52,452 --> 01:49:56,013
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

1278
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:59,586
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

1279
01:49:59,693 --> 01:50:04,494
Please, for my sake,
don't ask anyone.

1280
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,431
Shall I play that music?

1281
01:50:49,175 --> 01:50:52,667
<i>I began to think of
my feelings for him,</i>

1282
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:58,448
<i>and of his feelings for me,
for the very first time.</i>

1283
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:08,691
<i>How come he seemed to sort out
my mixed-up thoughts?</i>

1284
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:13,991
<i>How come I let him get so close?</i>

1285
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:19,596
<i>Somehow he seemed older than me.</i>

1286
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:27,006
<i>He was the one I wanted
to shake hands with.</i>

1287
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,308
<i>Just shake hands?</i>

1288
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,550
<i>What was this feeling?</i>

1289
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,357
<i>My mind raced as I sat beside him.</i>

1290
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:40,410
Have you got everything?

1291
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,249
Yes, I'm fine.

1292
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:44,650
We'll see you in the winter.

1293
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,626
I'll do my farming homework.

1294
01:52:48,728 --> 01:52:50,992
What about skiing?

1295
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,763
That just takes practice.

1296
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,497
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1297
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,068
What's that?

1298
01:52:59,172 --> 01:52:59,900
What?

1299
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:04,106
That's our secret.

1300
01:53:04,744 --> 01:53:08,043
Something was strange yesterday.

1301
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,549
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

1302
01:53:11,651 --> 01:53:14,449
I'll leave the ten year-old me,
at home.

1303
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,496
Wait for me!

1304
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:32,568
Take care Naoko.

1305
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,246
Goodbye.

1306
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:31,055
<i>Some say love, it is a river</i>

1307
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:37,494
<i>that drowns the tender reed.</i>

1308
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:45,905
<i>Some say love, it is a razor</i>

1309
01:54:47,847 --> 01:54:53,911
<i>that leaves your soul to bleed.</i>

1310
01:54:55,321 --> 01:55:01,920
<i>Some say love, it is a hunger,</i>

1311
01:55:03,763 --> 01:55:09,929
<i>an endless aching need.</i>

1312
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:18,866
<i>I say love, it is a flower,</i>

1313
01:55:20,113 --> 01:55:26,541
<i>and you its only seed.</i>

1314
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:38,487
<i>It's the heart, afraid of breaking,</i>

1315
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:45,967
<i>that never learns to dance.</i>

1316
01:55:46,806 --> 01:55:53,735
<i>It's the dream, afraid of waking,</i>

1317
01:55:54,747 --> 01:56:01,277
<i>that never takes a chance.</i>

1318
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:09,118
<i>It's the one who won't be taken.</i>

1319
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:17,293
<i>Who cannot seem to give.</i>

1320
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:25,607
<i>And the soul, afraid of dyin',</i>

1321
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:34,081
<i>that never learns to live.</i>

1322
01:56:38,057 --> 01:56:45,020
<i>When the night has been too Ionely</i>

1323
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:52,100
<i>and the road has been too long,</i>

1324
01:56:53,606 --> 01:57:00,375
<i>And you think that love is only</i>

1325
01:57:01,547 --> 01:57:08,282
<i>for the lucky and the strong,</i>

1326
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:17,024
<i>Just remember in the winter</i>

1327
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:23,660
<i>far beneath the bitter snows.</i>

1328
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:32,805
<i>Lies the seed,
that with the sun's love,</i>

1329
01:57:34,147 --> 01:57:42,247
<i>in the Spring becomes the Rose.</i>
