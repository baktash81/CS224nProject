1
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,834
"Beautiful stranger,
red hair, green jump suit,...

2
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:17,367
...walking dogs
in Washington Square Park."

3
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:21,040
"Can't forget you. Give love a chance.
Blackie."

4
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:23,167
Hope she gives him a chance.

5
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:26,338
Oh, Roberta, please!
He must be some kind of a pervert!

6
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,673
- He could be sincere.
- Nobody named Blackie is sincere.

7
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:32,215
He can't forget her, he's in love.
It's great.

8
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,344
Weren't you reading the want ads?

9
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,013
I know, I was.
I just... can't seem to find anything.

10
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,389
Don't settle for anything under 50,000.

11
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,933
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi, Adrian. What do you think?

12
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,438
- Roberta, the look is you.
- I just really wanted a trim.

13
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,611
No, this is your birthday present.

14
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,029
Give her something different, not weird...

15
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,829
Don't worry. Her husband'll love it.

16
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:59,164
- Wow, here it is! A message from Jim!
- Huh?

17
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,747
"Desperately seeking Susan.
Keep the faith. "

18
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,961
"Tuesday 10am. Battery Park,
Gangway one. Love Jim. "

19
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,545
- Who's Jim?
- Oh, God, that's tomorrow.

20
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,667
Who's Susan? You know these people?

21
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,552
No. Jim follows Susan
all over the country.

22
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:16,378
Last January she was in Mexico City,
then Seattle.

23
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,600
They send messages back and forth,
that's how they hook up.

24
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,684
Now they're in New York.

25
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:25,227
Desperate. I love that word.
It's so romantic.

26
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:28,191
Everybody I know is desperate
except you.

27
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,357
- I'm desperate.
- You?!

28
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,652
Well... sort of.

29
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,224
Room service!

30
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:57,392
It's open!

31
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,601
Smile.

32
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:05,566
I got you a newspaper and your tequila.

34
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,984
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,155
- Where do you want it?
- That's fine.

36
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,574
Don't spend it all in one place.

37
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,246
I won't. Thanks.

38
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,227
Jimmy!

39
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:47,395
It's about time!

40
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,801
Nice!

41
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,444
Bye-bye, Bruce.

42
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,612
It was fun, huh?

43
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,208
Hold the elevator!

44
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,594
Wait a second!

45
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,843
Roberta, don't let me eat these.
They're so good!

46
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,008
Hey, I think I've found one.

47
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,592
- One of what?
- upstairs. Come on.

48
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,349
He's been giving me the eye all night.

49
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,305
- Who is he?
- Who?

50
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,225
- In the corner, near Gary.
- Larry Stillman.

51
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,812
- Dr Stillman.
- Plastic surgery?

52
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,983
He's Gary's dentist.

53
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:15,188
Well, at least he's not a PhD.

54
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:25,078
- Gary, who's your friend?
- You know Becky.

55
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,245
Oh! Larry Stillman...

56
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,664
- My sister Leslie.
- Hi, how you doin'?

57
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:32,119
So you're a dentist...

58
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,548
Oh! Time out, everybody!

59
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,632
I've got a 10.58 spot.

60
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,633
- Oh, right!
- Great!

61
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,391
Rosemary will have another instalment
of Growing up In Queens.

62
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,557
The search continues for suspects...

63
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,603
...in the recent robbery
of ancient Egyptian artefacts.

64
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,264
That and more, next on the news at 11.

65
00:07:56,942 --> 00:08:00,526
Hi. I'm Gary from Gary's Oasis.

66
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:04,438
In our New Jersey showroom,
we have hundreds of models...

67
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:09,069
...of whirlpools and hot tubs
at the lowest manufacturer-to-you prices.

68
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:11,242
So come on out to Gary's Oasis.

69
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:15,749
- We're open seven days a week.
- Hey, Gary. Come on in!

70
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:26,672
At Gary's Oasis
all your fantasies can come true!

71
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,844
Very good!

72
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,285
It's gone for ever.

73
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,500
That funny, young, lost look... I loved.

74
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,298
It won't ever come back.

75
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,013
I killed that
when I told you about Rebecca.

76
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,720
You can watch in the bedroom
with the headphones.

77
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,890
I know.

78
00:10:57,604 --> 00:10:58,979
Gary,...

79
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,105
...do you ever remember your dreams?

80
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:04,271
I dunno, I never thought about it.

81
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,772
They liked the commercial,
don't you think?

82
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,358
Everyone thought you were great.

83
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:12,400
Oh, you're gonna...

84
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,699
...pick up the radio for the car
for me tomorrow, aren't you?

85
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,238
Sure.

86
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,409
Oh, don't forget...

87
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:25,411
Tell the guy you're my wife because we
put a sauna in the owner's apartment...

88
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,118
...and he's giving us a really great price.

89
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,247
Night, hon.

90
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:32,457
Hey! Don't eat all that cake!

91
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,155
- Susan!
- Hi.

92
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,911
My God, we all thought you were dead!

93
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,082
No, just in New Jersey.

94
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,949
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen,
for Ian, the fabulous Ian,...

95
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,328
...and his lovely assistant Crystal!

96
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,504
Hi.

97
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,592
- Susan! Where have you been?
- All over.

98
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,763
- Anybody I know?
- No.

99
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,933
Some guy from Atlantic City.

100
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,766
It was fun till he started getting serious.

101
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:25,432
- How's tricks?
- I'm ready to quit this dump. I really am.

102
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,560
Ray won't let me wear my glasses,...

103
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:30,481
...then Ian gets pissed off
when I can't do the tricks.

104
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,653
I mean, I'm only legally blind!

105
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:35,617
I could understand
if I wore my glasses on my tits,...

106
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,735
...but nobody here looks at my face!

107
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:40,408
Come on, let's just get outta here.

108
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:43,535
- I have to do the Disappearing Bluebird.
- Sounds great.

109
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,706
- Can't you wait?
- I'm really tired.

110
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,041
I could get some pizza
and meet you at home.

111
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:51,290
- You've got a place?
- Not exactly.

112
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:53,463
But I'm working on it.

113
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,341
Oh, no. I know what's coming now.

114
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,509
Just for tonight, I promise.

115
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,678
Come on!

116
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,969
Do you promise
only seven-digit phone calls?

117
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,427
Cross my heart. You won't regret it.

118
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,479
Thanks.

119
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,482
Welcome back.

120
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,519
I'll see you later.

121
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,008
Hey, baby. Take a paper.

122
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,478
Wow, I don't believe it.

123
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,231
Shit!

124
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,078
Excuse me!

125
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,833
- You got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

126
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,379
Susan!

127
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,756
How come you split
without saying goodbye in person?

128
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:03,089
Everybody says goodbye in person.

129
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,926
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

130
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,676
um, yeah, OK,
but I've only got a few minutes.

131
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:11,262
- Oh, great...
- It's a last-minute thing.

132
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:14,476
The band got this gig in Buffalo
and we start tonight.

133
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,929
Next time don't put
an ad in the paper, OK?

134
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:20,231
Susan, I've been looking for you
for weeks!

135
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,352
Come to Buffalo with me?

136
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,478
uh-uh, you'll be working.

137
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,069
- It's boring.
- Come to Buffalo.

138
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,531
I'll find some trouble
for you to get into.

139
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,699
I've had enough trouble already.

140
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,990
You... you were with this guy?

141
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,082
He was breathing when I left.

142
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,159
Hey! Beauty and the Beast,
we'll hit traffic on the bridge. Let's fly!

143
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,087
I don't like leaving you like this.

144
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:51,752
- I can take care of myself.
- I know.

145
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,425
Look, I'll give you a number. uh...

146
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:57,262
You got a pen?

147
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,928
All right, this is the number
of my friend Dez.

148
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,103
He's a great guy...

149
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:08,098
...and if you really get in a jam, call him.
He'll know how to reach me.

150
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:12,148
- Has he got any money?
- Forget it! He knows all about you.

151
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,787
No more dead bodies, OK?

152
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,957
I'll see what I can do.

153
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,203
Be here next time when I get back.

154
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,498
Come on, baby!

155
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:17,117
Check it out!

156
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:24,875
Hey, baby, I got
a pair of sunglasses just for you!

157
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,885
This hat'll look great on you, baby.

158
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,505
Take a look in the mirror.
Beautiful, right?

159
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,765
$10 for the set, all right? Ten bucks.

160
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,893
You gonna buy?
Hey, where you goin', babe?

161
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,514
Yo! Come back!
What are you doin' with my hat?

162
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,057
Give me my glasses, babe!
What's the matter?

163
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:45,518
- Oh, man! I don't believe it!
- I'm sorry.

164
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,694
What are you doin'?

165
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:50,196
- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean, "sorry"? Hey!

166
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:51,571
Sorry!

167
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,722
Do me a favour, baby.
Stay on the carpet, OK?

168
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,393
- They're great, aren't they?
- I know.

169
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,148
I gotta have 'em, but 65 bucks...

170
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:18,400
- That is the price.
- Forget it.

171
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,312
- I like the jacket.
- It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

172
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,031
But I bet he'd love it
if I swapped it for the boots.

173
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,950
Deal.

174
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,975
Gorgeous, isn't it?

175
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:03,148
It used to belong to Elvis Presley.

176
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:05,946
- Wanna try it on?
- All right.

177
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:52,185
We start off with the eggs.

178
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,151
These go very fast done two by two.

179
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,320
And this you can do in the morning...

180
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,531
...and get it all ready for baking.

181
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,366
I'm gonna bake it and then unmould it.

182
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,620
There are your six eggs.

183
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:12,879
Those get beaten up a little bit
and then in goes...

184
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,963
Hello, Roberta.

185
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:17,047
Hello, Julia.

186
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,631
Sorry, girls. I can't stay for dinner.

187
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:22,548
Some guy from West Germany's
got 1500 tubs...

188
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,673
...he can't get through customs.

189
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:26,846
I gotta go have dinner with him in town.

190
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,549
It just happened.
I'm sorry. You forgive me?

191
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,770
Looks interesting too.

192
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,567
- Get a good deal on the radio?
- Radio?

193
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:41,477
- Car radio. You just came from the city.
- Oh, my God, the radio.

194
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,487
- You forgot the radio?
- No!

195
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,240
um... Yeah, right, I guess I did.

196
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:50,370
You could have said
you didn't want dinner. I had to rush!

197
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,489
You said you didn't go anywhere.

198
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,414
What are you wearing?

199
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,752
A jacket.
It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

200
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,664
You bought a used jacket?
What, are we poor?

201
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,838
What's going on here?

202
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:13,178
Roberta, I gotta run! I'm late.

203
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,467
We'll talk later, all right?

204
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,808
All right, we'll talk later?

205
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,897
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

206
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,779
You sold it?

207
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:23,111
I had a key that was important.
I got my shit inside a locker.

208
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:26,779
- I sold it!
- I'll leave you my name and number.

209
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:56,146
Good goin', stranger.

210
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:59,316
Well, what fuckin' stranger?!

211
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:02,315
Festival seating. That means Portosans.

212
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:06,775
Portosans means pissing with flies.
I'm not gonna piss with flies.

213
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,444
You guys can piss in bottles.
What the hell is this? Woodstock?

214
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,342
- Projection.
- Dez, it's me. Jim.

215
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:38,303
Hold on a second.

216
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,313
Jesus Christ!

217
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:47,391
I'm stuck in Buffalo and I need a favour.
It's about Susan.

218
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:53,316
See, now some guy she met in Atlantic
City got pushed out of a hotel window.

219
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,692
This sounds wild. I'm sorry I missed it.

220
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:57,868
This is serious, Dez.

221
00:26:57,997 --> 00:27:02,408
And now some guy's run an ad to meet
her in Battery Park, signed "a stranger".

222
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:06,670
It sounds weird.
Could you just go down there...

223
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:08,669
...and make sure she's OK?

224
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:12,795
Jim, Victoria split on me last night.
I'm in a shitty mood.

225
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:15,796
I'm not in the mood for being a boy scout
right now.

226
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,171
Come on, Dez.
It'll take you half an hour.

227
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,888
- Come on!
- Give me a chance here. One second.

228
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,428
- She's got to meet him at 4 o'clock.
- That's in less than an hour!

229
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,771
Jim, I got a job here, you know!

230
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,939
This one favour.

231
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,524
Even if I could get someone
to fill in for me,...

232
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,812
...I don't even know what she looks like.

233
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,986
Look, you can't miss her.

234
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,699
She's incredibly pretty,
blonde hair, uh... medium height.

235
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,200
And she's got this green and gold jacket...

236
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,576
...with a pyramid with an eye on top
like a dollar bill. You can't miss it.

237
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,955
- All right, you owe me one.
- Great. Thanks, Dez, I appreciate it.

238
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,128
OK, yeah. Bye.

239
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,380
I lived in New York all my life.

240
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,675
We used to have Chinese restaurants,
Italian restaurants.

241
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:06,173
Now you have these sushi restaurants.
Everyone goes for sushi.

242
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:08,346
Sushi... I hate the stuff.

243
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:11,227
Although, I tell you,
I had some the other day.

244
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:15,101
I took it home, I cooked it, it wasn't bad.
It tasted like fish.

245
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:44,087
$9.20.

246
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,423
Here, keep the change.

247
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:51,718
Whoa! Hey! What is that? Hey, lady!

248
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,887
Hey! Hey, lady!

249
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:55,973
What is this?

250
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,010
Oh, that's cute!

251
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:04,772
Hi.

252
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,441
You look like I've seen you
somewhere before.

253
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:12,442
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.

254
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:18,699
- You doin' anything right now?
- I'm waiting for someone.

255
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:32,625
- Come with me, miss.
- I have to meet someone.

256
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,712
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- She's got all my stuff.

257
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:38,596
She'll give you the goddamn cab fare!

258
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:43,632
I don't need this aggravation.
I work for a living.

259
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,808
Theft of services. I know the law.

260
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:50,597
Well, hi!
Excuse me, but do you like candy?

261
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:53,485
- I got some Sugar Babies.
- No, thank you.

262
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:58,237
I wanted to have a chat. I was very close
to your boyfriend in Atlantic City.

263
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:02,361
- No, no, no. I'm married.
- No, I don't think so!

264
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,493
Susan!

265
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,950
Did you wear the pretty earrings
he gave you?

266
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:15,786
- Let's have a chat. My car is over there.
- Let go of me!

267
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:18,709
- Susan!
- Let go!

268
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:21,248
Susan!

269
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,685
Susan?

270
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:40,023
Susan?

271
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:44,438
- What happened?
- Are you OK?

272
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,404
My head hurts.

273
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,691
I'm Dez. I'm a friend of Jim's.

274
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,826
Jim?

275
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:56,655
Your boyfriend Jim.
Who was the guy hassling you?

276
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:01,201
- Guy?
- The guy that just ran off.

277
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:06,421
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

278
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,963
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

279
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:14,094
Are you OK?

280
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:16,263
Do you wanna see a doctor?

281
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,598
- I'm OK.
- You're OK.

282
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:23,645
She's OK. Show's over.

283
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,896
She's with me, she's OK.

284
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,567
Sit down?

285
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,319
Do you remember anything?

286
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,488
I don't know.

287
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,657
How did you get here?

288
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:39,613
I don't know.

289
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,414
Do you remember
what you had for breakfast?

290
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:47,077
I don't know.

291
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,876
You are Susan, aren't you?

292
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:53,592
- Susan?
- You don't know.

293
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:57,675
All right, what do we have here?

294
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,428
No purse?

295
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:02,640
Do you have anything in your pockets,
maybe?

296
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:13,188
Is that it?

297
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:16,232
Ah! Now we're getting someplace.

298
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:18,235
This is my phone number.

299
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:20,320
Jim must have given it to you.

300
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,239
This is like a déjà vu.

301
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:27,370
How can you have a déjà vu
if you don't remember anything?

302
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:30,581
No, no. I mean... this is all déjà vu.

303
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,327
This is a Port Authority locker key.

304
00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:39,797
I tell you what. I'm gonna
run you up to the Port Authority.

305
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,791
Maybe what's ever in the locker will
help you snap out of it. How's that?

306
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,216
- OK.
- OK.

307
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,679
Let's go.

308
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,393
Wait a minute.

309
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:57,142
This isn't some sort of trick, is it?

310
00:32:57,273 --> 00:33:01,485
- What do you mean?
- I mean I know a little bit about you, OK?

311
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:07,067
So don't even consider jerking me around
because I'm not in a great mood today.

312
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,238
Sure, I mean, I wouldn't...

313
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,406
...jerk you around.

314
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,576
I don't even know you.

315
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,579
You better wear this.

316
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,107
I hope it's filled with something good.

317
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,240
Look at this!

318
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,702
You sure do move around a lot, huh?

319
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,878
Yeah, I guess.

320
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:33,063
So this stuff does look familiar, right?

321
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:35,351
Well, it's not completely unfamiliar.

322
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:40,529
You know, when I close my eyes
I see a pyramid.

323
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:42,898
A pyramid?

324
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:45,358
Like on your jacket?

325
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:50,456
Oh, yeah. That must be what it is.

326
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:53,915
At least you got everything.
I hope you're feeling better.

327
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:56,083
- You are feeling better?
- Yeah.

328
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:59,795
Good. I gotta go.
I gotta get that scooter back.

329
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:02,841
So, uh... I'll see you around
maybe sometime, huh?

330
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,673
Maybe, uh... I'll see you with Jim.

331
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,674
OK? All right, take care! Bye.

332
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,847
Bye.

333
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,958
Susan!

334
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:41,788
Have you got a place to sleep tonight?

335
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,883
You can sleep at my place.

336
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:54,051
One night... on the couch.

337
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,219
But I don't want any drama.

338
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,388
I don't want your friends coming over.

339
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:03,263
And I want nothing disappearing
from my apartment. You got that?

340
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,945
Maybe you should quit?

341
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,653
Maybe.

342
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:29,291
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

343
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:34,838
OK, you. You're outta here.

344
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:38,841
It's about time.

345
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,659
I don't believe it.

346
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:38,600
Sorry, man. Have you been waiting?

347
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,195
- Never ever again!
- Listen, man, it was an emergency.

348
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:49,026
I understand. Never ever.
Don't ever ask me again.

349
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:51,197
- OK.
- Sorry.

350
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,783
This way.

351
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:07,044
- People live here?
- Yes, people live here!

352
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:10,756
I just thought it was sort of unusual,
that's all.

353
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,591
Two flights up.

354
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:23,100
Oh! Sorry.

355
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:31,731
Oh! Sorry, man. Excuse me.

356
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:36,527
Those look exactly like my speakers.

357
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,786
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

358
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:55,330
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that.

359
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,505
Thank you.

360
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:01,378
What the hell is goin' on here?

361
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,439
I don't believe it.

362
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,106
What you've gotta do is...

363
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,647
That's just great, Victoria.

364
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,406
It's my stuff, Dez.

365
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:29,576
So you just come and take it.

366
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,741
No phone call, no discussion,
no nothing.

367
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:36,289
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

368
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:41,836
Listen, uh... I'm gonna take
this stuff down to the Porsche.

369
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,457
I believe some of that stuff is mine.

370
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:48,009
Like the answering machine.
Like the Charlie Parker records.

371
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,008
- Oh, you can have it. Here.
- Thank you.

372
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,177
I'll send you a cheque for the rest, OK?

373
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,851
A cheque? Great.

374
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,067
- Hi.
- Hi.

375
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,236
He's really a nice guy.

376
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,404
You'll be happy together.

377
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,120
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

378
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:28,711
You know...
you could do a lot with this place.

379
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:30,881
There's a lot of light.

380
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:38,428
Ah, shit.

381
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:41,765
It happens, right?

382
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:48,058
Oh, hi, Dez. It's, uh... It's Jim here.

383
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:50,349
I'm just calling to see if Susan's OK.

384
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:54,185
I'm calling from, uh...
Oh, shit, I don't know where we are.

385
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:57,026
It's some motel... Hey, where are we?

386
00:40:57,157 --> 00:41:00,407
Anyway, no, look...
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

387
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:02,528
And thanks again for everything.

388
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:05,069
You're a pal. Thanks a lot. OK, bye.

389
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,872
That's gotta ring some bells.

390
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:13,002
- Honestly, no.
- No?

391
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,169
Terrific.

392
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,300
- I need a drink. Do you want something?
- All right.

393
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:21,380
Whatever you're having.
Apple juice. Coke. Perrier.

394
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,551
Miller or a Heineken?

395
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,136
- All right.
- Which?

396
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,926
Either one.

397
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,638
Please.

398
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:41,560
I don't believe it!

399
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,745
She took the refrigerator.

400
00:41:57,378 --> 00:42:01,540
- What did the police say?
- Most of these cases turn up in 24 hours.

401
00:42:01,673 --> 00:42:05,291
Did you tell them about the jacket?
Her wedding ring in the soap dish?

402
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,253
I told them!

403
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,930
They seem to think she's having an affair.

404
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:13,725
Oh, my God, maybe she is!

405
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,768
It's ridiculous.
Roberta is not having an affair!

406
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:20,477
- She's much too uptight.
- That is a horrible thing to say.

407
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:24,685
I suppose you're proud of the way you're
running around with Becky Shuman.

408
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:28,270
I didn't know you knew.
Anyway, we're not running around!

409
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:31,608
We're having
a perfectly respectable affair!

410
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:34,113
- Gary, let me ask you something.
- What?

411
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:38,738
Does Roberta have orgasms?
I mean, did she have them with you?

412
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:42,619
- Orgasms?
- You have heard of them, haven't you?

413
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:45,787
Maybe she left you
because you weren't satisfying her.

414
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:49,371
Leslie!
Not everybody is obsessed with orgasms!

415
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:51,963
- Some people just... have them.
- Did she?

416
00:42:52,093 --> 00:42:56,137
- Did Phil Donahue discuss orgasms?!
- You are really a pig!

417
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:59,429
- At least I know about feelings.
- Feelings. I feel! I feel!

418
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:03,507
You're disgusting. You're just like Daddy!
No wonder Roberta left you.

419
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:05,684
Would you stop saying that!

420
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:07,852
- Gary...
- Larry!

421
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:10,650
That looks great.
Any word from Roberta yet?

422
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:12,484
Fast work, Les.

423
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:14,650
Oh, let's have some chicken.

424
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:16,819
The chicken is for tomorrow. Larry!

425
00:43:16,948 --> 00:43:18,857
What did the police say?

426
00:43:18,992 --> 00:43:21,660
I can't believe
you're eating during a crisis!

427
00:43:21,785 --> 00:43:23,196
We're nervous!

428
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:26,116
Then take a Valium like a normal person!

429
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,375
She has great teeth.

430
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:37,504
That's why I showed up at Battery Park.

431
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,844
Jim said a friend of yours got killed
outside your hotel in Atlantic City.

432
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:45,011
He was pretty worried.

433
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,179
Killed?

434
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,181
Dead?

435
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,892
Sort of goes with the territory,
doesn't it, Susan?

436
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:57,397
Maybe I know who did it.

437
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,108
I wish I could remember.

438
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:05,362
Maybe you were the killer.

439
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,239
No!

440
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:16,536
I should probably lay low for while, huh?

441
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:19,166
It might be a wise idea.

442
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:23,916
You don't know
who the guy at the quay was?

443
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:28,508
Maybe a jilted lover?

444
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:34,262
I don't think so.

445
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:39,142
Maybe he was.

446
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:42,145
You know somethin'?

447
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:44,895
You are not at all what I expected.

448
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:48,981
You're not quite what I expected either.

449
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:13,460
Just how did I meet Jim? I mean, how...

450
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:16,258
How did I meet him?

451
00:45:16,388 --> 00:45:18,427
Maybe it would help.

452
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:21,011
I think it was at some coffee shop.

453
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:24,349
It was your first day at work.

454
00:45:24,478 --> 00:45:26,518
Jim waltzed in.

455
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,731
You brought his food over
and you ripped up the check.

456
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:34,727
Is he tall? I mean Jim.

457
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,979
He's about medium.

458
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,531
Is he sort of thin?

459
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,992
Sort of. Sort of, um...

460
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,905
...my build.

461
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,708
What colour eyes does he have?

462
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,833
Blue.

463
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,007
Like yours?

464
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:10,885
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

465
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,059
Sorry.

466
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,143
I don't know what happened. I just...

467
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,436
Sorry.

468
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:37,551
Come on.

469
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:01,822
Dez!

470
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,699
Dez...

471
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:12,248
Wanna go out to breakfast with me?

472
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:15,250
Breakfast?

473
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:20,381
What have you got on?
Some sort of disguise?

474
00:48:20,508 --> 00:48:23,759
- You don't like it?
- No, it's, uh...

475
00:48:23,888 --> 00:48:26,674
...sort of charming.

476
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:29,759
It's my treat.

477
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:32,974
What did you do? Rob a bank?

478
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:36,022
I don't know. Maybe.

479
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:39,648
Where do you wanna go?

480
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:42,018
See, I found this in the suitcase.

481
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:45,651
Gunny's Coffee Shop? I know the place.

482
00:48:45,781 --> 00:48:47,821
It's over on Center Street.

483
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,737
Maybe that's the place where I met Jim.

484
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,657
- So?
- So...

485
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:57,199
So we go there
and see if anybody remembers me.

486
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,583
So what do you think?
Anyone look familiar?

487
00:49:02,046 --> 00:49:04,287
No. Not yet.

488
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,890
I found this in the suitcase.
You ever hear of it?

489
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:19,550
The Magic Club? Yeah.
That's that place over on Broadway.

490
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:21,015
Why?

491
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:23,851
I thought I'd go there
and see if I remember anyone.

492
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:26,687
- You know what you're having?
- Sure.

493
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:28,857
What are you having?

494
00:49:28,986 --> 00:49:31,025
Well, it's your treat, right?

495
00:49:31,154 --> 00:49:33,147
Yeah, I got money.

496
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:35,358
I'm gonna have... blueberry blintzes.

497
00:49:35,493 --> 00:49:37,532
I'll have that too. That sounds good.

498
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,700
What can I get you?

499
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:42,201
Yes, I would like a... coffee...

500
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:45,329
...and a, uh... doughnut.

501
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,706
Miss! When you get a chance,
could you take our order?

502
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,795
You can stay. She's gotta go.

503
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:54,461
Mick, it's that crazy girl with the jacket.

504
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,631
- You, out!
- You know me?!

505
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:58,884
Yeah. You won't get a free meal here.

506
00:49:59,013 --> 00:50:02,381
- I got money, I can pay.
- I don't want your money. Get out.

507
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:05,221
- We got money. What is it?
- Mind your own business.

508
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:08,103
- This is my business, wait a minute!
- Come on, out!

509
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:10,934
- Hey, I'm with her.
- Come on, come on.

510
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,813
You're lucky I don't press charges!

511
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:16,568
Dez.

512
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:19,269
Are you OK? Are you all right? I'm sorry!

513
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:21,483
Rule number one was no drama.

514
00:50:21,617 --> 00:50:24,783
- Remember?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry.

515
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:28,078
Let's get out of here.

516
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:29,783
I'm sorry.

517
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,216
You won't even let me wear my glasses!

518
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,765
Go back to selling T-shirts!
You're fired!

519
00:50:52,894 --> 00:50:56,060
No, you don't, Ian, because I quit!

520
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,728
Hey! Not under the ladder!

521
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:07,447
My luck can't get much worse anyway.
Miserable scumbags!

522
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,655
Maybe I should've slept with him.

523
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:13,572
Man, some witch steals my clothes,...

524
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:17,950
...Meeker gets pushed out a hotel window
and now you get fired.

525
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:22,377
No offence, but bad luck really seems
to be following you around.

526
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,380
We're both free now.
Let's just go to the movies.

527
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:30,548
A double feature?

528
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:32,717
Come on!

529
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,475
I'll pay for the movie
if you pay for the popcorn.

530
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,178
OK, but listen. How much is popcorn?

531
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,349
- 2.50
- OK.

532
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:55,488
This must be the place.

533
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:58,534
Sir, could you pull over, please?
This is it.

534
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,118
I'm sorry about what happened.

535
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,370
- Are you sure you're not angry?
- Yeah.

536
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,249
- Really?
- I'm not angry.

537
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,084
OK. You're a real pal.

538
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,545
I'll tell Jim.

539
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:17,250
- Bye!
- Bye.

540
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,514
A real pal. I'll tell Jim...

541
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,388
Bleecker Street Cinema.

542
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:43,988
You just don't fire someone like that!

543
00:52:44,118 --> 00:52:46,193
Who am I gonna find
at such short notice?

544
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:48,368
Come on, Ray. You know lots of girls.

545
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:52,410
- Plenty of women need work.
- Ma! Let me take care of this.

546
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:53,621
Hello.

547
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,625
You saw the sign outside?

548
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,662
Are you looking for a job?

549
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:01,540
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

550
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:03,833
- She thinks she's looking for a job.
- No!

551
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:06,590
I am, I am! What kind of job?

552
00:53:06,722 --> 00:53:08,844
Come on in.

553
00:53:08,973 --> 00:53:11,012
This is Ray.

554
00:53:11,142 --> 00:53:13,181
- Hello.
- This is Ray's mom, Gilda.

555
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,424
Hi.

556
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:16,185
- This is Henry.
- Hi.

557
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:17,688
Hello, Henry.

558
00:53:17,814 --> 00:53:19,854
And I'm Ian.

559
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:36,952
Are you OK, Mr Glass?

560
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,453
Fine, thank you. Good night, Daisy.

561
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,909
I hope you get good news
about Mrs Glass.

562
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:43,040
Thank you.

563
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:45,621
Where did you get this bag?

564
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,795
It's mine. Mrs Glass give it to me.

565
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,964
Give me the bag, Daisy.

566
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,010
- Daisy, give me the bag!
- Sorry, you ain't getting this bag.

567
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:57,305
- Please, I'm asking you nicely.
- You're not getting this.

568
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:14,065
Hey, guys. Could you, uh...
have your picnic somewhere else?

569
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,286
Hey, guys!

570
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,333
Right...

571
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:29,915
Just try to be careful, all right?

572
00:54:33,257 --> 00:54:36,506
Listen, I don't get involved
in domestic disputes, OK?

573
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:38,461
There's no dispute.

574
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:40,920
She had the jacket on
when she disappeared.

575
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:44,091
It was very special to her
for some reason.

576
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:46,301
Don't you even remember her?

577
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:48,474
Don't you remember the jacket?

578
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:53,265
It was black and gold and it had
a sort of a pyramid thing on it...

579
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,142
...like on a dollar bill.

580
00:54:55,276 --> 00:54:57,315
Vaguely.

581
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:00,611
Great. Thanks.
You've been a terrific help.

582
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:02,815
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

583
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,576
She stopped in here
looking for the jacket, too.

584
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,742
Maybe you can help each other.

585
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,078
Susan, will you get the phone?

586
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:17,328
Susan! The phone's ringing!

587
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:21,420
Susan!

588
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,347
Hello?

589
00:55:32,518 --> 00:55:34,842
Yeah, hold on. She's right here.

590
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:41,063
- What?
- Another one of your secret admirers.

591
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:43,231
Hello?

592
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:45,775
Yeah. Who is this?

593
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:49,155
Gary Glass?

594
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,699
uh-huh.

595
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:58,327
Oh, so you're the witch's husband.
Where's my stuff?

596
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,618
Yeah.

597
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:03,954
Yeah.

598
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:06,126
Well, maybe I could help you.

599
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:11,873
Listen, meet me tonight at 10.30
at 30, West 21st Street.

600
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,629
I'll be waiting on the third floor
near the bar. You got that?

601
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:18,220
All right, I'll see you there.

602
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:23,516
Hey!

603
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:26,518
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

604
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:30,232
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Big Ray.

605
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:35,235
We have a wonderful line-up for you
this evening, for all you people.

606
00:56:35,364 --> 00:56:37,937
You, sir, the man in the red shirt...

607
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:40,566
- Where you from?
- I'm from Brooklyn!

608
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,944
Do we have anyone else here
from Brooklyn?

609
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,452
Right here.
Why don't you two share a cab home?

610
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:48,867
This is a great audience.

611
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,869
OK, let's get on with it.
Introducing, back from his...

612
00:56:53,005 --> 00:56:55,044
Susan! Come here!

613
00:56:55,174 --> 00:56:57,498
The one, the only, the innovator...

614
00:56:57,634 --> 00:57:00,754
From now on, I want you here
five minutes before we begin.

615
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:04,932
Remember, we start with the doves.
You look beautiful. Smile.

616
00:57:05,058 --> 00:57:07,975
Davina... Queen of the Night!

617
00:57:08,102 --> 00:57:11,055
So let's hear it
from all you lovely people. Come on!

618
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:45,542
Menthol, extra-long, ultra-thin!

619
00:57:45,677 --> 00:57:48,298
Extra-ultra long and thin!
Regular, unleaded...

620
00:57:58,897 --> 00:57:59,976
Please!

621
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:02,432
Come down!

622
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,449
Davina!

623
00:59:12,254 --> 00:59:14,294
Bow!

624
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:20,338
This one's worse than the other one!

625
00:59:22,304 --> 00:59:24,344
Nice try, kid.

626
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:27,143
Here you go. 20 bucks.

627
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,426
See you tomorrow night
at the same time.

628
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:31,933
- You're hiring me?
- Well, of course we are!

629
00:59:32,063 --> 00:59:33,142
Thank you!

630
00:59:33,272 --> 00:59:36,392
Take these guys home and practise,
all right?

631
00:59:36,526 --> 00:59:40,309
And, Susan... practise a lot! OK?

632
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:42,272
- All right.
- Good.

633
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:13,936
Gary Glass, right?

634
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,979
Yeah, how did you know?

635
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:18,153
Wild guess.

636
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:23,408
- She split on you, huh?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

637
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:25,577
Has she ever split on you before?

638
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:27,532
No, of course not.

639
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,791
- Did she do drugs?
- Drugs? Roberta?

640
01:01:31,377 --> 01:01:33,832
She's never smoked a joint
in her whole life.

641
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:37,711
She's probably
the straightest person in Fort Lee.

642
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,881
What are you driving at?

643
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:44,460
- Do you want something to drink?
- um... No, thanks.

644
01:01:44,597 --> 01:01:48,464
I'm on this health programme, you know?
No alcohol, no sugar...

645
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,676
- Do you wanna dance?
- Dance?

646
01:01:56,816 --> 01:01:59,936
Excuse me. Excuse me.

647
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:11,410
Did you read that stuff in the newspaper
about that guy Meeker?

648
01:02:11,538 --> 01:02:14,289
He got pushed out of a hotel window
in Atlantic City.

649
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:17,202
- No, why?
- Roberta's mixed up in it.

650
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,373
Roberta? That's impossible!

651
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:23,122
Fact. She's trying to frame me
for Meeker's murder.

652
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:25,296
Who's Meeker?

653
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,428
Who's Meeker and what does
he have to do with Roberta?

654
01:02:30,554 --> 01:02:33,970
Ex-partner and Roberta
were in on it together.

655
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,139
I- I think you're mistaken.

656
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:39,803
Roberta doesn't know anybody
in Atlantic City.

657
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,977
I've seen them together!

658
01:02:42,107 --> 01:02:45,606
You saw Roberta with another man! Who?

659
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,856
Looks like a real greaseball to me.

660
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:52,403
I don't believe a word you're saying.

661
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:54,940
Here, trust me. You wanna find your wife?

662
01:02:55,076 --> 01:02:58,410
- Yeah, of course I do!
- Good. Let's go to your place.

663
01:02:58,538 --> 01:03:00,577
My place?

664
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:03,038
Excuse me.

665
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:50,629
Excuse me!

666
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:53,004
Sir!

667
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,179
There's someone following me.

668
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,973
Please! Could you... Could you...

669
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,557
There's a man...
There's a man following me...

670
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,723
How do you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.

671
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:07,191
I know. I'm sorry, sir,
but could you please see if he's gone?

672
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,320
There's a man following me.
Could you see if he's gone?

673
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:12,486
- OK.
- Thank you.

674
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:16,572
You stay here.

675
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:19,371
Enrique will take care of it.

676
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:23,790
íNo mal!

677
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,956
Yeah.

678
01:05:27,211 --> 01:05:29,203
íCoño!

679
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:55,109
íHola! Soy Gary de Gary's Oasis.

680
01:05:55,237 --> 01:05:57,110
En nuestro local en New Jersey,...

681
01:05:57,238 --> 01:06:00,322
...tenemos cientos de bañeras calientes
a los precios más bajos.

682
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:02,406
Así que venga a Gary's Oasis,...

683
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:04,573
...abierto siete días a la semana.

684
01:06:04,703 --> 01:06:07,159
- íHola, Gary!
- No, muchachas. íNo!

685
01:06:08,624 --> 01:06:12,490
At Gary's Oasis
all your fantasies can come true!

686
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:17,876
Sir?

687
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:22,090
Sir!

688
01:06:36,982 --> 01:06:39,188
Taxi! Taxi!

689
01:06:41,026 --> 01:06:43,066
Taxi!

690
01:07:03,546 --> 01:07:06,632
- You'll get yourself in a twist.
- Wait! I have money!

691
01:07:06,759 --> 01:07:09,249
I have money in my bag!
I have money in my bag!

692
01:07:09,386 --> 01:07:12,421
OK. The earrings, I need them.

693
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:15,720
What earrings?
Look, I'm not who you think. Please.

694
01:07:15,849 --> 01:07:19,682
All right, all right, avoid the fate
of your late beloved boyfriend.

695
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:39,116
Was he your pimp?

696
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,285
What?

697
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:43,453
All right, play it that way.

698
01:07:43,582 --> 01:07:47,709
Come on, you've just got a little bump
on your head. You'll survive it.

699
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,089
What's your name?

700
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:58,258
You got a name, don't you?

701
01:07:58,387 --> 01:08:01,636
All right, we'll settle this
at the station house.

702
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:05,593
- Roberta.
- Roberta. That's a name.

703
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:07,767
I'm not who you think I am.

704
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,606
How do you use the birds?

705
01:08:30,415 --> 01:08:32,455
Nice place you got here, Gar.

706
01:08:32,585 --> 01:08:34,624
We like it.

707
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:40,120
Firm.

708
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:42,297
Y- Yeah.

709
01:08:45,762 --> 01:08:47,802
They're Roberta's.

710
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,675
"How To Be Your Own Best Friend. "

711
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:55,392
"I'm OK - You're OK."

712
01:08:56,314 --> 01:08:58,353
"Dr Ruth's Guide To Good Sex. "

713
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:01,105
Are these Roberta's, too?

714
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:03,560
I didn't know she read this stuff.

715
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:05,735
You know, Gar, between you and me,...

716
01:09:05,864 --> 01:09:08,817
...what do you really know about Roberta?

717
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:11,281
Nice wallpaper.

718
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,837
Don't you think
you ought to wait for Roberta...

719
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:33,045
...before you start taking her clothes?

720
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,219
She owes me a coat.

721
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,891
- What does she weigh?
- Roberta?

722
01:09:48,026 --> 01:09:50,018
105, 110.

723
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:52,644
We're close. Very close.

724
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,524
- Nice tub.
- You like it?

725
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,111
That's, uh...
It's one of our most popular items.

726
01:10:02,247 --> 01:10:07,122
You can install it in any bathroom and it
increases the resale value of your home.

727
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:09,208
I didn't say I wanted to buy one.

728
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:11,375
Right. Sorry.

729
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:16,883
You know, I could get used
to a place like this.

730
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:18,879
Got any pot?

731
01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:21,962
P- pot. um...

732
01:10:22,098 --> 01:10:24,256
usually I keep some around,...

733
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,883
...but r-right now I'm out.

734
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:29,058
You know how it is.

735
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,639
How about a match?

736
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:34,813
All right, stop.

737
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,061
Face forward.

738
01:10:37,194 --> 01:10:39,104
Smile.

739
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:41,277
Turn left.

740
01:10:42,282 --> 01:10:44,321
Next.

741
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:46,609
And then you start to think,...

742
01:10:46,745 --> 01:10:48,784
...what's it all about?

743
01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:52,453
The big picture, you know what I mean?

744
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:55,165
Sure I do, Gar.

745
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:57,333
I mean, there...

746
01:10:57,462 --> 01:11:00,083
There's more to life
than making money, right?

747
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,173
I mean, I know that. I mean...

748
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,340
Oh... Mm.

749
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,922
You know... You know how...

750
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:14,474
...all time comes from
a single point in the universe?

751
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,763
- You know what I mean?
- No.

752
01:11:27,197 --> 01:11:29,236
My husband.

753
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:32,693
We live in Fort Lee.

754
01:11:32,828 --> 01:11:34,950
There are...

755
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:39,788
...things happening in solar systems
so far away...

756
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:42,075
...that we can't even see them.

757
01:11:46,631 --> 01:11:48,873
I mean, what do... what do they care?

758
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:51,843
What do they care
if I am the spa king of New Jersey?

759
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,092
Hello. Glass house.

760
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:58,262
Hello?

761
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,183
- Hello?
- Spa king of New Jersey!

762
01:12:03,146 --> 01:12:05,269
Spa king!

763
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:11,897
Could I call someone else? Please?

764
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,320
Go ahead.

765
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:41,629
All right. You in the pink tutu.

766
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,970
Let's go.

767
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:51,602
Nice to have met you.

768
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:56,313
She better have a good explanation!

769
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:58,566
You haven't seen her and you're yelling.

770
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:03,440
I am not! I am wondering aloud why she
couldn't have called if she was in trouble!

771
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:06,528
Hear her side of it
before you do anything stupid!

772
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,447
Mr Glass. Sergeant Taskal. Have a seat.

773
01:13:09,579 --> 01:13:11,868
My sister Leslie.

774
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:15,625
She was arrested last night
on the Lower East Side.

775
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:19,334
She's in a holding tank downstairs.
I'll have her brought up.

776
01:13:19,464 --> 01:13:23,508
I telephoned you as soon
as I realised the photographs matched up.

777
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:25,922
Hey, Ronnie. Taskal here.
Bring up Glass.

778
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,092
We're dropping the charges.
Her husband is here.

779
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:32,927
Well, obviously
he hasn't picked her up yet.

780
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,769
Oh, Roberta.

781
01:13:36,896 --> 01:13:38,224
Let me see that.

782
01:13:38,355 --> 01:13:40,394
Oh, my God.

783
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:46,360
Mr Glass, somebody paid your wife's bail
a little while ago and she was released.

784
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:47,947
You just missed her.

785
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:49,899
Who-Who paid her bail?

786
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:52,238
Boyfriend. Pimp. Who knows?

787
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:54,407
Pimp?

788
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:59,741
I don't know how to thank you, Dez.
I'm really sorry.

789
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:01,914
Consider it my final favour, Susan.

790
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:04,581
You are really living up
to your reputation.

791
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:06,871
See, now, that's just it, Dez.

792
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:09,626
That's it! I'm not who you think I am.

793
01:14:09,757 --> 01:14:12,380
- I don't care who you are.
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

794
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:14,717
It's really getting complicated here.
I'm not...

795
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,886
Sssh. Stay right there.

796
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:33,611
I don't believe it.

797
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,481
God!

798
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:46,534
I don't believe Victoria would do this.

799
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:50,415
Oh, my God.

800
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:53,414
Maybe it was the guy
who grabbed me last night.

801
01:14:53,547 --> 01:14:55,586
What?

802
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,131
The guy who grabbed you?

803
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:00,419
See, he was after me, Dez.

804
01:15:00,554 --> 01:15:03,222
Well, not me exactly.
He was after Susan,...

805
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:05,174
...wherever she is, who I'm not!

806
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:07,595
He thinks she's staying here,
which she isn't because I am...

807
01:15:07,726 --> 01:15:09,765
I don't wanna hear it!

808
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:13,145
First of all, I get thrown out
on my ass on the sidewalk.

809
01:15:13,273 --> 01:15:17,021
Then I have to fork up $200 bail
to get you out of jail.

810
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:21,943
Now I come home and the whole place
is torn apart. Why, I don't know!

811
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:26,481
You know, I really don't need this shit,
Susan. I really don't.

812
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:27,781
Fine.

813
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:29,950
I'll leave.

814
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:34,158
Whoops!

815
01:15:40,588 --> 01:15:43,340
You know, I could have been killed
last night, Dez!

816
01:15:43,466 --> 01:15:45,506
I was really scared!

817
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:47,671
Forget it.

818
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:49,843
Sorry about this mess.

819
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,515
I can pay you back!
I'll send you a cheque.

820
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:55,681
Great. Another cheque.

821
01:16:20,207 --> 01:16:22,034
Sorry.

822
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:24,206
Hey, hey, hey.

823
01:16:24,336 --> 01:16:26,874
This mess isn't so bad.

824
01:16:27,255 --> 01:16:29,580
I've had worse parties than this.

825
01:17:50,704 --> 01:17:53,277
Richard Nolan and Bruce Meeker
were released...

826
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:56,416
...pending appeal of their 1982
conviction for smuggling.

827
01:17:56,543 --> 01:18:00,872
They are prime suspects in the
disappearance of the Nefertiti earrings...

828
01:18:01,005 --> 01:18:04,587
...from the Cairo collection
currently on display in New York.

829
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,717
Nefertiti? No shit!

830
01:18:07,844 --> 01:18:10,418
It's not uncommon!
I've just read an article...

831
01:18:10,556 --> 01:18:13,805
...about a woman who turned tricks
in the city all morning...

832
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:16,424
...and shopped all afternoon
before going home.

833
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,763
She did it for years
before her husband found out about it.

834
01:18:19,897 --> 01:18:24,226
Roberta can't be a prostitute. She doesn't
like sex that much. It's impossible.

835
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:39,074
Oh, my God. I have heard that four
out of five prostitutes are lesbians.

836
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,372
Leslie, I think that I would know
if my wife was a lesbian.

837
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:47,040
Why?!
You didn't know she was a prostitute.

838
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,251
Gary, I think you have
got to accept the fact...

839
01:18:50,382 --> 01:18:54,214
...that there is something very unusual
going on in your relationship.

840
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:56,716
Susan.

841
01:18:56,847 --> 01:18:58,803
- Susan!
- Who's Susan?

842
01:18:58,932 --> 01:19:02,051
uh... Don't get the wrong idea.
She was helping me find Roberta.

843
01:19:05,395 --> 01:19:07,435
Susan!

844
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:10,016
Susan!

845
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,941
What are you doing here?

846
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:14,985
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want first?

847
01:19:15,112 --> 01:19:17,733
- You said you were going to leave.
- OK, good news.

848
01:19:17,864 --> 01:19:19,941
Your wife isn't with the greaseball.

849
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:23,943
Susan, my wife has just been
picked up on the Lower East Side,...

850
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:26,783
...escaping from her gun-toting pimp!

851
01:19:26,914 --> 01:19:27,863
He's not a pimp.

852
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,956
- He's not a pimp.
- He's not a pimp.

853
01:19:30,084 --> 01:19:33,369
The bad news is he'll probably kill her
cos he thinks she's me.

854
01:19:33,504 --> 01:19:35,543
- What?
- Didn't you ever read this?

855
01:19:35,672 --> 01:19:37,630
She kept a diary.

856
01:19:37,758 --> 01:19:40,082
It's great stuff. "Couldn't sleep. "

857
01:19:40,218 --> 01:19:43,421
"Went into kitchen.
Gary came in. Turned on light. "

858
01:19:43,555 --> 01:19:46,471
"Gary left. Finished birthday cake. "

859
01:19:46,599 --> 01:19:51,259
Pages of it. It's gotta be a cover.
Nobody's life could be this boring.

860
01:19:51,394 --> 01:19:53,886
You shouldn't be reading that. It's private.

861
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:57,438
Yeah, well, it's not about her.
It's about me. Listen to this.

862
01:19:57,567 --> 01:20:00,900
"He's looking for Susan again.
She's late returning from Mexico. "

863
01:20:01,028 --> 01:20:02,985
"This is his fifth ad. "

864
01:20:03,113 --> 01:20:06,446
"Why does he want to see her so badly?
Who is she?"

865
01:20:06,575 --> 01:20:08,817
And there's my picture.

866
01:20:09,745 --> 01:20:12,910
Gary, why didn't you tell me
she read the personals?

867
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:15,078
We could've settled this yesterday.

868
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:17,959
She read them all the time. I didn't think...

869
01:20:18,085 --> 01:20:22,628
Yeah, well, fortunately for everybody,
I'm here and I'm thinking.

870
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:24,795
Give me the car keys.

871
01:20:27,343 --> 01:20:29,466
I'll bring it right back.

872
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:31,173
Hiya.

873
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:34,884
Gary! She is taking the car keys!

874
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,847
Shut up, Leslie. OK?

875
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:45,440
Diary. That little sneak,
what did she say about me?

876
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:12,374
"Desperately seeking
stranger seeking Susan. "

877
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:16,755
"Regarding key. Meet me Saturday night,
Magic Club, Broadway. 9.30pm. Be there. "

878
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:19,093
- Is that it?
- She'll love it.

879
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:21,262
Pay at the cashier.

880
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:28,348
"Single white male, 40,
looking for afternoon playmates. "

881
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:31,766
Is that it? Pay at the cashier.

882
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,323
Dez...

883
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:52,332
I'm not Susan.

884
01:21:53,462 --> 01:21:56,545
I'm a housewife
and I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

885
01:21:57,423 --> 01:21:59,878
I've been married for four years.

886
01:22:00,008 --> 01:22:01,668
My husband Gary...

887
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:05,966
He sells bathroom spas and saunas.

888
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:13,349
You never stop, do you?

889
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:15,685
No, really! Really!

890
01:22:15,815 --> 01:22:20,441
That's why I like you. I never know
what you'll say next. Come here.

891
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,733
Dez.

892
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:31,491
- What is that?
- I dunno.

893
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:35,870
Someone's trying to get in.

894
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:48,041
Oh, my God.

895
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:50,169
Oh, my God, it's Jim.

896
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:52,343
Oh, my God.

897
01:22:55,308 --> 01:22:58,842
Jim... Jim. Jim.

898
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:04,353
Thank God. You had me worried.
How you doing, man? Huh? Huh?

899
01:23:04,483 --> 01:23:07,353
Somebody jumped me. It was dark.

900
01:23:08,069 --> 01:23:10,227
Yeah. uh...

901
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,819
It was me.

902
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:16,112
I thought you were somebody else.

903
01:23:16,243 --> 01:23:18,282
Who did you think I was?

904
01:23:19,872 --> 01:23:23,453
Somebody's been following Susan.
I thought maybe you were him.

905
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,539
Who's following her?

906
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:27,412
I don't know.

907
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:29,336
You know Susan.

908
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,913
It's really tough
to get a straight answer out of her.

909
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,169
She needs me, Dez.

910
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:39,629
I think maybe she's ready to settle down.

911
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:44,224
Settle down? Susan? Come on, Jim!

912
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:47,434
She'd never do that.
She's really not the type.

913
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:49,555
Since when do you know her so well?

914
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:53,769
Well, I just can't see her settling down.
I mean, she's too wild.

915
01:23:53,902 --> 01:23:56,226
But that's what's so great about her.

916
01:23:56,362 --> 01:23:57,939
Is that so?

917
01:23:58,071 --> 01:24:01,404
I mean, you really seem
to have examined this.

918
01:24:02,117 --> 01:24:05,202
Well, we've been spending
some time together.

919
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:10,999
Just... what are you saying here, Dez?

920
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,535
Huh?

921
01:24:15,003 --> 01:24:17,245
I'm not gonna bullshit you, Jim.

922
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:20,465
It was a shitty thing to do.
I'm not saying it wasn't.

923
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,337
But you yourself said she was irresistible.

924
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:28,720
Oh, man.

925
01:24:28,849 --> 01:24:32,347
W- why don't you just hit me again
and, like, finish me off?

926
01:24:32,477 --> 01:24:34,517
- Look...
- Huh?!

927
01:24:34,646 --> 01:24:37,184
Don't cry about it.
I'm really crazy about her...

928
01:24:37,316 --> 01:24:39,308
...and she's really crazy about me.

929
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,767
- I'm sorry.
- Listen. I know Susan.

930
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:44,108
Whatever she told you doesn't mean shit.

931
01:24:44,237 --> 01:24:48,401
She plays with people, Dez. I oughta
know, I've been chasing her for years.

932
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:50,906
I don't think she's playing with me.

933
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:53,075
Bullshit.

934
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:55,703
All right, Jim.

935
01:24:55,831 --> 01:24:57,870
Why don't we just ask her?

936
01:25:00,418 --> 01:25:01,829
Susan!

937
01:25:01,962 --> 01:25:04,251
Su...! You mean she's here?!

938
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:07,042
Susan!

939
01:25:07,175 --> 01:25:09,630
- Come on out here.
- Susan...!

940
01:25:13,222 --> 01:25:15,261
Susan!

941
01:25:24,732 --> 01:25:26,771
She's gone.

942
01:25:28,694 --> 01:25:30,650
She was here.

943
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:32,819
I swear to God.

944
01:26:24,827 --> 01:26:26,866
Dez, are you up there?

945
01:26:28,288 --> 01:26:29,948
Yeah?

946
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:34,750
Guess what, man?
I think she's jerking us both around.

947
01:26:34,877 --> 01:26:36,502
What do you mean?

948
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:40,080
Check this out.
I mean, who the hell is this stranger?

949
01:26:56,062 --> 01:26:58,731
Susan, I still don't understand
why we're here.

950
01:26:58,856 --> 01:27:01,146
Trust me, Gar.
You're in for a real surprise.

951
01:27:01,277 --> 01:27:04,193
Your surprises are beginning
to make me nervous.

952
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:07,107
- What'd she say?
- We're in for a real surprise.

953
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:09,694
I guess we're not gonna see
Tony Bennett here.

954
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:11,865
I'd settle for a police escort.

955
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:14,828
How could you let her wear
Roberta's jacket?

956
01:27:14,954 --> 01:27:19,082
Hey, she's cold.
She's gotta wear something.

957
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:21,580
Why don't you
cut your fingernails?

958
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,999
I can't hear what you're saying...

959
01:27:30,677 --> 01:27:34,627
Dez, if she sees us both here,
she'll probably just split again.

960
01:27:34,765 --> 01:27:36,804
You could go home.

961
01:27:36,933 --> 01:27:39,886
I wanna see who this fuckin' stranger is.

962
01:27:46,984 --> 01:27:51,063
Let me guess. Triple tequila sunrise.

963
01:27:51,195 --> 01:27:53,271
Ginger ale.

964
01:27:56,074 --> 01:27:57,983
And you're the Scotch.

965
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:00,028
This must be yours.

966
01:28:00,162 --> 01:28:02,201
Rum and Tab.

967
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:09,620
Sit tight. I'm gonna
go look for the stranger.

968
01:28:10,588 --> 01:28:12,627
What stranger?

969
01:28:12,756 --> 01:28:15,923
- God, she's gorgeous.
- Beauty fades.

970
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,515
There she is.

971
01:28:30,647 --> 01:28:33,933
- Where?
- Right there. Talking to the cigarette girl.

972
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:36,854
That's not Susan.
I never even seen that girl before.

973
01:28:36,986 --> 01:28:39,607
Dez, that's Susan.
Don't you think I should know?

974
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:43,946
That might be a Susan
but that's not my Susan.

975
01:28:44,076 --> 01:28:47,658
- That's my Susan.
- Then who was the girl at Battery Park?

976
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:05,710
So who's the stranger?

977
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:07,920
Jimmy!

978
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:10,094
Who's the stranger?

979
01:29:10,224 --> 01:29:12,714
- It's a long story.
- uh-huh.

980
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:14,974
You wouldn't know her anyway.

981
01:29:15,103 --> 01:29:17,142
- Her?
- Yeah. Her.

982
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:22,568
Come on. We'll talk about it in private.

983
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:30,068
We've got three minutes before curtain!

984
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,239
Get your wig on and get out there!

985
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,575
I wonder what happened to Susan.

986
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,953
Looks like you lost your girlfriend.

987
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:47,413
Hey, Larry! I'm married, all right?

988
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,837
- Oh, please!
- What?

989
01:29:56,765 --> 01:29:59,387
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

990
01:29:59,518 --> 01:30:02,803
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Ray...

991
01:30:04,355 --> 01:30:07,225
Bartender...
Can I have the check, please?

992
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:11,729
Hey, is there anyone out here
from, uh... Queens?

993
01:30:11,861 --> 01:30:14,353
You. Well, I'm from
normal parents myself.

994
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:20,236
Anyway, we got a special treat
for you people this evening.

995
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,825
Introducing the one, the only...

996
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:25,327
Susan, get up here!

997
01:30:25,457 --> 01:30:28,742
...and his very lovely assistant, Davina...

998
01:30:28,877 --> 01:30:32,163
...Queen of the Night! So let's hear it!

999
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:46,343
Gary... Is that...

1000
01:30:46,476 --> 01:30:48,966
It can't be.

1001
01:30:49,103 --> 01:30:51,937
I'm really enjoying this. It's a great trick.

1002
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,321
Susan?

1003
01:31:02,448 --> 01:31:05,401
- Roberta?
- I don't believe it.

1004
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,947
- Roberta...
- Gary, sit down.

1005
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:19,119
uh... I think I'll be staying, thank you.

1006
01:31:42,693 --> 01:31:45,610
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1007
01:31:47,822 --> 01:31:50,063
She's really got style in a way.

1008
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:52,238
She's good, Gary.

1009
01:31:53,868 --> 01:31:55,909
Right. Sorry.

1010
01:32:38,574 --> 01:32:40,402
Bravo!

1011
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:47,875
That's him. That's the guy.

1012
01:32:50,919 --> 01:32:51,998
That's the guy!

1013
01:32:52,128 --> 01:32:53,920
Hey, help me!

1014
01:32:54,506 --> 01:32:57,424
Hey! That's the guy!
That's the guy! Help!

1015
01:32:57,551 --> 01:33:01,168
Somebody stop that guy! Help!

1016
01:33:05,223 --> 01:33:07,346
What... Roberta!

1017
01:33:07,476 --> 01:33:09,884
- Roberta!
- Who are you?

1018
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:14,269
What's going on?!

1019
01:33:19,737 --> 01:33:22,025
- Did he hurt you? I'll kill him!
- Gary!

1020
01:33:22,155 --> 01:33:25,192
- It's OK, I can take care of it now.
- Who is this guy?

1021
01:33:25,325 --> 01:33:27,364
Who are you?
What do you mean, who am I?

1022
01:33:27,493 --> 01:33:29,321
- Please...
- Oh.

1023
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,612
Gary... Dez.

1024
01:33:33,749 --> 01:33:36,418
Dez, this is Gary, my husband.

1025
01:33:37,252 --> 01:33:39,078
Hi.

1026
01:33:39,211 --> 01:33:42,213
- The hot-tub salesman?
- Yeah.

1027
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:45,175
So you were telling me
the truth last night.

1028
01:33:45,301 --> 01:33:47,340
Last night? Oh, no.

1029
01:33:47,469 --> 01:33:49,794
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Gary...

1030
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:52,800
- Is he the pimp the police mentioned?
- He's not a pimp!

1031
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:54,973
I'm not a pimp. I'm a friend of hers.

1032
01:33:55,102 --> 01:33:58,138
- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- I'm not sure myself.

1033
01:33:58,271 --> 01:34:00,310
- I'm having a hard time...
- So am I!

1034
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:04,021
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Please, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1035
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:05,562
OK, listen.

1036
01:34:05,694 --> 01:34:10,605
Dez. Dez, I really need to talk
to Gary alone, OK? Please?

1037
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:13,200
OK.

1038
01:34:13,326 --> 01:34:15,781
I really need some time alone too.

1039
01:34:16,621 --> 01:34:18,660
I'm sorry.

1040
01:34:27,672 --> 01:34:31,290
It's all right. It's all right.
The nightmare's over.

1041
01:34:45,438 --> 01:34:48,604
Don't make a peep.
You're gonna get me outta here.

1042
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:53,023
Nice legs.

1043
01:34:56,948 --> 01:34:59,984
- I don't understand why you're here.
- Why are you here?

1044
01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:02,904
Wait a minute. Never mind that.
Why did you leave me?

1045
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:04,946
It was sort of an accident.

1046
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,867
When you were soliciting,
that was an accident, too?

1047
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,039
Yes, of course! Gary!

1048
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,748
It all started with the personals.

1049
01:35:12,879 --> 01:35:15,915
There was this ad for Susan.
"Desperately seeking Susan. "

1050
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:24,463
Where did he go?

1051
01:35:24,597 --> 01:35:27,267
So they thought
I was a prostitute and arrested me.

1052
01:35:27,392 --> 01:35:29,265
Roberta, are you a lesbian?

1053
01:35:29,394 --> 01:35:31,931
Leslie said
lots of prostitutes are lesbians.

1054
01:35:32,062 --> 01:35:35,644
Gary, you're not listening to me.
I'm not a prostitute or a lesbian!

1055
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:39,143
We'll get professional help.
I don't care how much it costs.

1056
01:35:39,278 --> 01:35:43,322
- I just want you to come home with me.
- Why?

1057
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:45,938
Why? What do you mean, why?

1058
01:35:46,075 --> 01:35:48,150
Why do you want me
to come home with you?

1059
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:50,277
Come on, don't get excited, all right?

1060
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,535
What, are you on drugs
or something now?

1061
01:35:52,665 --> 01:35:54,657
God.

1062
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,499
Look at me.

1063
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,295
I looked at you. You look ridiculous.

1064
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,038
I mean look at me, Gary.
Look at me.

1065
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,301
I'm not coming home with you.

1066
01:36:14,642 --> 01:36:16,930
You're just tired.

1067
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:22,931
Why don't you get changed
and we'll talk about it at home?

1068
01:36:23,066 --> 01:36:24,809
Come on. Come on.

1069
01:36:28,905 --> 01:36:30,280
Fine. That's fine.

1070
01:36:30,406 --> 01:36:34,983
uh... I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna wait for five minutes.

1071
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:39,699
And if you're not there,
I'm gonna leave without you.

1072
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:43,455
Goodbye, Gary.

1073
01:37:16,196 --> 01:37:18,235
Hey! Whoa!

1074
01:37:23,203 --> 01:37:25,242
Where did you get this?

1075
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:28,495
Stay!

1076
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:36,794
Susan, what's going on?

1077
01:37:44,888 --> 01:37:46,168
Help me!

1078
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:49,634
Don't push!

1079
01:38:00,235 --> 01:38:02,228
Good goin', stranger.

1080
01:38:02,362 --> 01:38:04,401
Susan.

1081
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,116
Hi.

1082
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,289
What's going on?

1083
01:38:19,419 --> 01:38:21,577
My friend, this is the crucial moment.

1084
01:38:22,088 --> 01:38:25,422
Our force field power plant
has been transferred to the ship.

1085
01:38:25,592 --> 01:38:28,794
Our defences are at their weakest,
almost fully automatic.

1086
01:38:28,928 --> 01:38:32,794
The likelihood of a successful
mutant attack is at its strongest.

1087
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:37,261
- But they may be unaware.
- We've tried to keep them away...

1088
01:38:52,324 --> 01:38:54,031
Ow!

1089
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:56,945
- Hi.
- Hi.

1090
01:38:59,079 --> 01:39:02,115
Huh. How are you doin'?

1091
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:05,081
OK.

1092
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:10,124
So I guess your name isn't Susan, huh?

1093
01:39:11,548 --> 01:39:13,588
So what is it?

1094
01:39:13,717 --> 01:39:16,671
Roberta.

1095
01:39:16,803 --> 01:39:19,674
- Roberta.
- Mm-hm.

1096
01:39:21,933 --> 01:39:23,973
That's nice.

1097
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,358
Come on!
