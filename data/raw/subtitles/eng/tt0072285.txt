1
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:19,217
Madeleine, can we buy
some milk from you?

2
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
One quart.

3
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,976
Take it off the top
so there's lots of cream.

4
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,061
Thanks.

5
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:35,108
The same, but with more cream.

6
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,904
Thanks.

7
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,913
It's a shame. Such a nice girl.

8
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,375
Imagine not being able to talk.

9
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,169
Completely mute.

10
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,299
No wonder, after what happened.

11
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,306
Such a sweet, young girl.

12
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:11,561
It must be 15 years ago by now.

13
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,024
And the old man who raped her
got off scot-free.

14
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,569
They said he was insane.

15
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,698
Not responsible for his actions.

16
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,536
But it sure is strange
the girl can't talk.

17
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,540
The doctor said
it was because of the trauma.

18
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:37,170
Some kind of mental block.

19
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,329
Madeleine.

20
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,749
You better hurry if you want
to catch the 4:00 bus.

21
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:20,880
You haven't had any time off
for a month.

22
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:27,697
Can you give me a single reason
not to come to town with me?

23
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,920
Hi, my name is Tony.

24
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,974
Got this car today.
Isn't she a beauty?

25
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,103
A 3000 GTO.

26
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,190
157 horses.

27
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:10,365
Goes from zero to 100
in 8 1/2 seconds.

28
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,953
Max speed just over 200.

29
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,459
You buy the hottest car in town,
but still the best is missing.

30
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:26,381
A chick to drive around with.

31
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,205
Would you like something to eat?

32
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,251
It's on the company.

33
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:33,156
We'll start with cheese and herring...

34
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,827
followed by the pepper steak flambé.

35
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,872
Figs in cognac flambé.

36
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,334
Red wine,
and Akvavit with the herring...

37
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:49,172
and some champagne to start.

38
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,160
I like women
who don't talk too much...

39
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:46,706
but you set a new record.

40
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,108
Welcome.

41
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,078
May I take your coat?

42
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,209
Thanks.

43
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,171
Won't you sit down?

44
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,305
I'll get something to drink.

45
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,271
Cheers.

46
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,582
You aren't drinking.

47
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:56,127
It won't kill you.

48
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,756
Just good stuff.

49
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,760
Cheers.

50
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,437
Hello, nurse?

51
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,608
It's Tony. Is the doctor in?

52
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,363
Thanks, that's kind of you.

53
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,369
Hi, it's Tony.

54
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,872
A new prospect. 110 pounds.
A real beginner.

55
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,916
How much will we need?

56
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:03,254
Can you bring the shots immediately?

57
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,549
She's sound asleep now.

58
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,679
Sure, great. See you.

59
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,152
Hi, it's Tony.

60
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,117
In ten days
I'll have a fine new chick ready.

61
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,746
How about that?
The fifth this year.

62
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,876
Soon we can close up
and retire to Switzerland.

63
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,131
That's great. So long.

64
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,405
Good to see you, Sam.

65
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:22,125
Here's our patient.
She needs a little stimulation.

66
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,546
Just sign your name.

67
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,216
Sign the duplicate too.

68
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:40,555
No need to read it.
Just sign it.

69
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,519
Where the hell are you going?

70
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,995
There you are... my love.

71
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:51,209
Now, here's the situation.

72
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,255
You have become hooked on heroin...

73
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,217
which isn't like
your ordinary amphetamines.

74
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,930
It's the toughest narcotic
in existence.

75
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,641
You're hooked both physically
and psychologically...

76
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:11,730
and you'll die in 48 hours
if you don't get a fix.

77
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,482
But we're not going to have
any trouble, are we?

78
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:21,322
Do as I say and you'll get
your two shots a day.

79
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,395
{y:i}"I never want...

80
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:01,232
{y:i}to see you again.

81
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,693
{y:i}Because you never understood.

82
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:11,576
{y:i}You never understood
{y:i}how much I hated that terrible farm.

83
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:19,000
{y:i}How your protective instincts
{y:i}suffocated me.

84
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:28,551
I have found a wonderful man
who has given my life meaning.

85
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:36,226
I'm doing everything to forget
my horrible time with you.

86
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:42,065
I hope you'll forget
about me quickly.

87
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:49,364
You'll never see me again...

88
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:55,203
because I never want
to see you again.

89
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:08,091
Signed, Madeleine."

90
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:22,814
Well, my little friend,
now life really begins.

91
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:29,904
You'll get two of these a day
if you do as I say.

92
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,993
Your first visitor arrives at 1:00.

93
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,955
No mistakes, or you'll go without.

94
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:44,586
Now, let's have a look at your room.

95
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:04,939
The accountant is arriving soon.
Be nice to him.

96
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:41,142
Hi, sweetheart.
Take off your clothes.

97
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,778
Tony! What the hell?

98
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,363
Goddamn it!

99
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,490
What kind of bitches
do you have here?

100
00:26:55,532 --> 00:27:02,831
How can I go home to my wife
with my face looking like this?

101
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:08,586
Damn it!
I'm gonna scar her for life.

102
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,009
I'm doing great. How about you?

103
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:59,763
What? The pirate?

104
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:05,185
Let me check. Tuesday?

105
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:13,860
The pirate is available
between 2:00 and 4:00.

106
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,821
But the price has gone up.

107
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:20,533
Yeah, she's more than Sally.

108
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:24,079
Is that okay? Great.

109
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,416
My pleasure. Thank you.

110
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:53,525
This is how it is from now on.
You're on your own.

111
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,695
Every morning at 9:00,
you'll get a list from me

112
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:01,408
with names of customers
and times they'll arrive.

113
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:05,412
You'll get two packets
so you can make it through the day.

114
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,706
Monday's your day off.

115
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:14,212
On Sunday you'll get four packets
so you can make it through Tuesday.

116
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,758
If you behave, you'll get
a percentage of the profits.

117
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,013
That's fair, isn't it?

118
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:33,106
Here's today's list. In half an hour
you start with Mr. Andersson.

119
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,364
What?

120
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:49,456
That's right. I almost forgot.

121
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:11,186
Get undressed.

122
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,632
My name's Sally.

123
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:58,019
You poor thing.

124
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:02,023
The beginning's the worst.

125
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:06,361
You feel so sick you wanna die.

126
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:12,826
The only thing that keeps you going
is the dependency on dope.

127
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:20,625
If you go without for too long,
then you really start feeling things.

128
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,461
Goddamn!

129
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,633
I tried to leave here once.

130
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,761
I ran back to my little town.

131
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,514
To Mom.

132
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:41,813
But I fell apart.
I thought I'd die.

133
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:47,819
Tony sent two thugs to get me.

134
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,866
Horrible bastards.

135
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:58,705
They'll do anything
for a couple of grand.

136
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:05,837
After those guys,
being back here seemed all right.

137
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:14,387
At the most you'll last 30-36 hours
without getting a new hit.

138
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,432
After that, it's over.

139
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,477
You get paranoid.

140
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:26,608
Then you die,
unless you get another hit.

141
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:30,487
But I've got a plan of my own
to fall back on.

142
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,782
I hit up all the johns
for additional loot.

143
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:37,285
For a bit of extra service.

144
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:43,416
In a year I'll have enough
to take off for Switzerland.

145
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:49,839
There's a rehab clinic there
for drug addicts.

146
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:55,970
It takes four months
before you're cured.

147
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:00,392
But it takes dough.

148
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:06,147
Around 60,000
for the entire treatment.

149
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:12,404
I should be able to leave
in about a year.

150
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:48,953
I get this way sometimes.
I can't help it.

151
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:55,543
Hey, I saw Tony
had a letter for you.

152
00:38:55,585 --> 00:39:00,882
I took it when he wasn't looking.

153
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:07,389
{y:i}What a terrible letter
{y:i}we received today.

154
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,684
{y:i}How can our little Madeleine...

155
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:15,355
{y:i}be so full of hate?

156
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,692
What did we do wrong?

157
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:25,031
What we did wrong
you could have set right.

158
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:30,829
Now we have nothing to live for.

159
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:35,583
We are tormented by the fact
that our little Madeleine...

160
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:39,546
is so full of hate.

161
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:47,053
After all these terrible
disappointments...

162
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:51,516
your father and I
only want to tell you...

163
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,853
not to worry.

164
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,107
You will never see us again.

165
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:02,360
Madeleine...

166
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:07,532
you were our everything.

167
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:14,831
The sunshine of our lives.

168
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,918
Good-bye.

169
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:01,813
{y:i}The doctor said it was poison...

170
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,733
but I wonder where it came from.

171
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:09,195
It seems awfully strange
they were the only ones poisoned.

172
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:13,116
A lot of people bought milk that day.

173
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,744
Well, I wonder.

174
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:22,375
You don't pour poison
in your milk by mistake.

175
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,128
I still wonder if it wasn't...

176
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,924
Sure, after those terrible letters
the girl wrote her parents.

177
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:34,095
Terrible letters.
I read the last one.

178
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:38,641
They took it really hard.

179
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:47,872
So, you want to learn how to drive
faster than the average guy.

180
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:57,924
Half of this will do.

181
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:27,495
This is a model 96 rifle,
also called a Mauser.

182
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,665
It was used in both world wars.

183
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:33,001
If you lie down...

184
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:36,713
a little further back. There.

185
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:41,676
Hold it against your shoulder,
because it has a good kick.

186
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:45,221
Hold it steady.

187
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:48,767
To load, lower the weapon.

188
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:53,855
Pull the bolt up, then back,
and then insert the cartridge.

189
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:57,233
Push down
and move the bolt forward.

190
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,904
Then bring the gun up
against your shoulder.

191
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:04,032
Make sure you keep it
steady against your shoulder.

192
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:10,747
Place your finger on the trigger
and gently squeeze off a shot.

193
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,500
Reload.

194
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:18,046
Check your shoulder.

195
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,049
Now aim and squeeze.

196
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:26,304
You'll have a visitor today
who's never been here before.

197
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:30,225
Take good care of--

198
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:32,310
This is Tony.

199
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:35,647
Oh, hi there.

200
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:39,651
Good, as usual.

201
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:44,072
Sorry, what did you say?

202
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,950
The 2 4th? Let's have a look.

203
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:51,705
She's just great, as usual.

204
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,036
Step back.

205
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,622
You're striking too quickly.

206
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:25,251
Sink down and strike hard.

207
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:32,509
That's better. Step back.

208
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:50,151
Now look.

209
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:53,530
If you're coming
into a curve like this...

210
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:56,074
and you start to skid...

211
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:57,826
you have to steer into the skid.

212
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:02,038
Steer into it like this
until you come out of it here.

213
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,875
Then you floor it.

214
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:06,556
Wait here.

215
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:11,658
I have a present for you.

216
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,994
An extra hit.

217
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:18,873
By the way, Sally's gone.

218
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:24,295
She won't be back.
Got another job in Beirut.

219
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:31,553
That's her business.
Hope it works out well for her.

220
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,668
I can't teach you anymore.

221
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:28,480
I'll be damned! All bull's-eyes.

222
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:52,248
Hell, you want that much?

223
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:58,046
You want a powerful one?

224
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:10,243
I need two more bills.

225
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:15,623
You got a car too.

226
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:10,140
Three beers.

227
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,666
We've got trouble.

228
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:39,919
Madeleine shot a customer.

229
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:44,466
She may be after you too.

230
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:58,688
I got you two tickets to Spain.
Get lost until things cool off.

231
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:43,710
Yeah, it's me.

232
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:47,130
Come over right away.
I have a rush job for you.

233
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,590
What?

234
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:53,345
Right, 10,000 a head.
Hurry up, damn it!

235
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:56,473
Great. Bye.

236
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,067
Hello?

237
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:10,612
What? Axelsson?

238
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:16,076
You're scared?

239
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:19,829
Think how I feel!

240
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:26,336
Hell, no! She's gone nuts.
Completely mad.

241
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:32,967
No, of course I've closed the shop.
She has to return soon to get a fix.

242
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:36,596
Take my advice and go out
to the country until this is over.

243
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:39,140
What? No problem.

244
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:43,978
Someone's just come in. Bye.

245
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:48,108
I'm glad you got here so fast.

246
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:51,778
Madeleine shot two of her customers.

247
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,614
Set a trap for her
and then take her for a drive.

248
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:59,536
She is not to be found again.

249
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:35,071
I'm out. There's nothing left.
I'm completely cleaned out.

250
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:37,157
I know somebody.

251
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,828
The hot dog man in the harbor.

252
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:44,789
Go there.

253
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:16,232
{y:i}Car 411.

254
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:19,986
{y:i}This is 411, over.

255
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:28,745
{y:i}We have shots fired in the harbor.
{y:i}Warehouse three. Over.

256
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:35,877
41 1 , I read you.
Over and out.

257
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:48,199
Drop your weapon.

258
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:07,355
She's totally nuts.

259
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:12,110
She's challenged me to a duel.

260
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:15,572
I get to choose the weapons.

261
01:34:15,613 --> 01:34:19,909
She should be in a nuthouse.

262
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:24,164
Now she's gonna get
what's coming to her.

263
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:29,210
I'll get her once and for all.

264
01:38:54,934 --> 01:38:59,397
Madeleine,
what the hell are you doing?

265
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,276
Put down the gun,
and let's talk about this.

266
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:06,488
It's just a misunderstanding.

267
01:39:06,529 --> 01:39:09,866
What kind of nonsense is this?

268
01:39:09,908 --> 01:39:11,826
Put down the rifle.

269
01:39:11,868 --> 01:39:15,663
Madeleine, please.

270
01:39:26,758 --> 01:39:28,301
You fucking whore!

271
01:39:28,343 --> 01:39:30,804
Thought you could fool me, huh?

272
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:34,307
Damn slut!
Which knee should I blow away first?

273
01:39:34,349 --> 01:39:37,769
Fucking whore!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
