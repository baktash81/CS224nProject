An' Jes' cause dese yer tales 'bout

13
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,760

Like as not dey too busy goin' along
all mixt up wid dey own troubles, uh...

16
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,890
Like de time dat Miss Sally an' Mister John
was comin' down to de plantation.

17
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,120
Mama?

18
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,490
Yes Johnny?

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,730
Why are we going to Grandma's?

20
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,390
Well... I told you dear, for a visit.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,630
Why don't she come to see us,
like she did last spring?

22
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,270
Well, Because it... I thought
you'd enjoy seeing the plantation.

23
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,810
Is Grandma mad at us?

24
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,510
But of course not, Johnny.
What ever gave you that idea?

25
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Well, Georgie says everybody's mad
at what Daddy writes in the newspaper.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,630
Don't Grandma read the newspaper?
Don't she?

27
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,530
She does. And she likes what's in it.

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,260
John, please.

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,740
Are you mad at each other too?

30
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Why no, dear.
Of course not.

31
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,810
Gracious goodness, Johnny...
We's almost dar! Lissen!

32
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,570
You ain't never heer'd no
frogs like dem in Atlanta.

33
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,390
You know what they're saying?

34
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,320
Knee-deep! Knee-deep!

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,400
- Honest?
- Honest.

36
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,030
Knee-deep! Knee-deep!

37
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,320
You know, when I was your age,
I used to catch lots of 'em.

38
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,240
I remember one time I... ah... hid a whole box
of 'em over in your grandma's milk house

39
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
And they got loose.

40
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,040
Yes, an' I 'members what
you got for doin' it too.

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,310
Well, it was old Uncle Remus' fault, you know.
He told me that story about Brer Frog.

42
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,350
De tale 'bout his havin' a tail an' losin' it?

43
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,260
That's it. Only...
How can there be a tale...

44
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,390
When dey ain't no tail.

45
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,870
Aunt Tempy?

46
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
What is it, child?

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,760
Is Uncle Remus real?

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,960
Real? Co'se he's real. You jes' wait 'til
you hears him tell a tale 'bout Brer Rabbit.

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,460
Den you'll know he's real.

50
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,860
Welcome home, my daughter.

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,160
And you too, sir. Oh, it's good to have a man in
the house again. Turn around here, young man.

52
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:58,170
Let me have a look at you. You favor your
grandfather more every time I see you. Toby!

53
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,380
Yassum, Miss Doshy.

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,120
This is my grandson Johnny...
And he's the apple of my eye.

55
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,720
Now, you take good care of him
and show him our plantation.

56
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,650
And if he gets into trouble,
you see that he gets out of it.

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Yassum.

58
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,780
I hope you're a noisy boy.
I love noisy children.

59
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,280
It makes it so much easier to tell
where they are and what they're up to.

60
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,990
Aunt Tempy, is that Uncle Remus?

61
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,830
Uncle Remus? Lawzy no, honey.
Dat's jes' Ned.

62
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,690
Come on, I'll show you the big grandpa clock.

63
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,980
I've been hearing about the
clatter you've raised in Atlanta.

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,750
Thumping for cotton mills, railways,
and... heaven knows what.

65
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,390
Miss Doshy?
Where do you want me to put dishyer trunk?

66
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,690
Put it in the... Oh well, never mind.
Perhaps I'd better show him myself. Come along.

67
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,570
Now be careful you don't bump into things.

68
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,950
Sally...

69
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,210
Well? What are you going to tell her?

70
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,210
Have you changed your mind,
or are you still going to stay?

71
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,200
Oh, I have to stay John.
It wouldn't be fair to mama.

72
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,680
She has enough responsibility...
I'm not going to saddle her with ours.

73
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,870
But it's only for a short time.
She's be only too glad to take care of Johnny.

74
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,350
When dat big han' gits straight up,
watch out!

75
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,400
What I tell you!

76
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,590
Oh, Miss Doshy, Sally wants Johnny
to stay here for awhile... with you.

77
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,830
What will you do?

78
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,690
Oh, I'm going back.
And I want Sally to go with me.

79
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,080
It's no use, John.
I'm not going back.

80
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,270
Then... I'll have to go without you.
And I'd better hurry, or I'll miss my train.

81
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,090
Miss it! You won't regret it.

82
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,520
Daddy? You're going back?

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,260
Yes, son.

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,650
Why?

85
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,920
I have to.

86
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,620
But... You...
You've never left mama and me before.

87
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,080
No, I know. But I've got a job
to do, and you've got one too.

88
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,480
Taking care of mother and grandmother.
You'll do that now for me, won't you?

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,630
Goodbye, son.

90
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,240
- Goodbye Miss Doshy.
- Goodbye John.

91
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,010
- Goodbye Sally.
- Goodbye.

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,120
Daddy! Don't! Don't go! Please Daddy!
Please! I won't stay here!

93
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,630
If you go, I'm going too!

94
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200

Unc' Remus, I can't find Johnny no place.

How you like dat, Unc' Remus! It's Him.

310
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Mebbe it's jes his ghost.

Dat's him awright! Oh, oh!

- What's the matter, Toby?
- I'se jes' thinkin...

313
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,150
He's sho' gonna ketch it when he gits home.

314
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,640
I guess I better take my foot in my hand,
Uncle Remus, an' git a-goin.

315
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,410
Hol' on dar! I reckon you better let
ol' Unc' Remus go 'long wid you.

316
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,170
- Tempy.
- Yessum.

317
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,040
Tempy, go and find Uncle Remus
and see if Johnny is with him.

318
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,750
Never mind, Tempy!

319
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,770
Now, maybe I can get some sleep.

320
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,300
- You think they're waiting for me?
- Dey ain't passin' de time o' day.

321
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,990
Son! Where have you been?

322
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,240
Lawzy, Miss Sally, didn't sis
Tempy tell you he was wid me?

323
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,510
Yes, she told me...
but it's so long past Johnny's bedtime.

324
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,520
Tooby sho, Miss Sally, I was tellin' him
a tale 'bout Brer Rabbit, an'...

325
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,590
I plum forgot de time.

326
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,590
Well, I don't mind your
telling him stories, Uncle Remus.

327
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,030
But you know perfectly well,
it's too late for him to be up.

328
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,590
Yessum.
'Twon't happen again, Miss Sally.

329
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,060
I'm sure it won't. Well, son, let's run
along upstairs and get ready for bed.

330
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,020
Miss Doshy, Johnny forget de bundle.

331
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Didn't I tell you to run along home
befo' yo' maw takes a stick after you?

332
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,620
You and your stories!

333
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,180
Miss Doshy...
What us gonna do 'bout dat child?

334
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,270
I wish I knew. A grandmother
doesn't count for much these days.

335
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,530
Yassum, it's a pity, too.
What dat child needs is his paw.

336
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,390
And that's what his mother needs...
But I'm afraid it's going to take

337
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,770
a little while for her to find that out.

338
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,890
Might cut de time down a piece,
Miss Doshy, if you jes' draps a word.

339
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If I want your advice I'll ask for it.

340
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,370
I'm a stubborn old woman, Uncle Remus.

341
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,760
Yassum, Miss Doshy,
I knows dat.

342
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,120
- Well, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

343
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,360
You ain't mad wid
me, is you, Miss Doshy?

344
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,400
You meddling old rascal!
Of course I'm not mad with you.

345
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,990
- Looka here! I brung you sumpin!
- Oh, he's beautiful!

346
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,950
Mawnin', Brer Frog! How do you do?

347
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,530
Say 'knee-deep', Brer Frog,
'knee-deep', 'knee-deep'.

348
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,990
He got to be in de water befo' he say dat.

349
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,540
Where'd you get him? At the mill pond?

350
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:29,010
- Yea! How come you know dat?
- My daddy, he told me. He's caught lots of 'em.

351
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,140
Let's go down after breakfast
and get some more.

352
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,710
Yea, maybe Uncle Remus
'll let us use his frog box.

353
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,750
- Come on, Brer Frog! Say it.
- Johnny! Are you awake? Good morning, dear.

354
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,330
- Mawnin!
- Did you have a nice sleep?

355
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,700
Yes'm.

356
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,480
Come on! Take him!

357
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,980
Here we are now.
Let's hurry up and get dressed.

358
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,020
Do I have to wear that suit?

359
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,550
Yes, dear. Daddy's
mother is coming to see us today.

360
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,850
And the collar, too?

361
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,280
Yes, dear, of course.
She made it for you herself.

362
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,180
- She'll want to see how nice it looks on you.
- But Toby and I were goin frog huntin'.

363
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,780
Well that's all right, darling.
You can go another day.

364
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,950
Now get dressed
and come on down to breakfast.

365
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,180
Jes' lookin' at de mill pon'
won't hurt yo' clothes none.

366
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,060
It's no fun just to look.

367
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,320
Sho 'tis! 'Sides, us gotter take
Brer Frog back, ain't we?

368
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,430
We leave him 'round here, he liable to get
stomped on... or runned over... or lost.

369
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,360
You look mighty sad.

370
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,400
Like yo' miss yo' fambly.

371
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,530
S'pose you never saw
yo' maw or paw ag'in.

372
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,060
Well, I guess just taking
him back ain't frog huntin'!

373
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,460
Toby 'Cose 'tain't! Come on!

374
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,090
If you take dishyer horse,
we kin git dar a heap quicker. Here!

- Sho is lucky I was wid you.
- What's that for?

381
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,830
Test whether de wind blowin' good or bad.

382
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,920
An' if it's blowin' towards de bull,
dat ain't good.

383

'Cause den he smell you comin'

01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,740
I'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful.

758
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,600
But you and your stories
are making that very difficult.

759
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,670
I think maybe it would be better
if he didn't hear any more for awhile.

760
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,620
Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no...

761
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,580
They only confuse him.

762
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,060
Now I know you mean well, Uncle Remus,
but Johnny's too young.

763
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,080
- Miss Sally...
- I'll have to ask you not to tell him any more.

764
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,710
Yassum, Miss Sally...

765
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,230
But what else could I have done, mama?

766
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,440
I can't just overlook it,
he has to learn to mind.

767
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,660
That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories...

768
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:49,700
the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.

769
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,730
Well, he has his mother...
and his grandmother.

770
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,210
We're not enough, Sally.
The boy must have friends.

771
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,040
And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers
children, then it must be someone else.

772
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,250
Someone of his own age.

773
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,030
That's just good common sense.

774
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,750
What you trackin'
through here for anyway?

775
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,380
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout
messin' 'roun' my kitchen?

776
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,310
Johnny!

777
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,320
Yes, mama.

778
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,530
Do you know what next tuesday is?

779
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,690
Uh... of course. My birthday.

780
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:35,100
That's right, dear.
And what happens then?

781
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,000
I get presents.

782
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,830
And a birthday party.
Would you like that?

783
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,870
A party? Sure!

784
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,100
With lots of nice
little boys and girls.

785
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,240
Can I ask Ginny?

786
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,540
Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...

787
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,210
That one more won't
make any difference.

788
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,450
Gee! Thanks!

789
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,680
Will daddy come?

790
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,540
Well, dear... uh...

791
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:08,580
I'll write and ask him.

792
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,220
Oh boy.

793
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,750
Teenchy! Here Teenchy!

794
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,990
Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?

795
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:32,700
Uncle Remus? A present for Teenchy!

796
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,640
Where's Teenchy?

797
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,820
He's gone.

798
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:49,430
Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n might
happen to him... if he runs around loose.

799
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,690
He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.

800
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,730
Then, where is he?

801
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,550
He's back at de Favers.

802
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:05,030
Dat's what he b'longs an' you knows it.

803
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:09,290
But teenchy's my dog.
He's mine.

804
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,280
Ginny gave him to me,
and you said...

805
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,310
Nemmine what I said!

806
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,940
Yo' maw tol' you to take
dat dawg back whar he come from.

807
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:22,210
An' you ain't done it.
She don't like dat, an' I don't blame her.

808
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,320
But he wasn't botherin' anybody.

809
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:29,040
She yo' maw an' she
know what's bes' for you!

810
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:35,210
But... but... I... I love him. He... he loves me.
You should'na done it, Uncle Remus.

811
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,190
Jake'll drown him!
I know he will.

812
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,480
Ain't no use o' you carryin' on.

813
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,730
Puppy's gone an' dat's dat.

814
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,760
You don't even care! Teenchy's
gone... and you don't care at all.

815
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:54,760
Don't make no difference
whether I does or whether I don't.

816
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,660
I'm jes a wo' out ol' man
what ain't no good to nobody.

817
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,400
But uncle remus, you're...

818
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,220

<i>I went to the well to wash my toe! ~</i>

823
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:14,150
<i>~ When I got there, the well was bare!</i>
<i>What time is it, old witch! ~</i>

824
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,320
- Hurry, maw, hurry!

825
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,380
Please, maw!
The party'll be over.

826
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,180
If you don't quit bobbin' up

827
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,150
I'm just doin' like you told me.

828
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,490
Well, don't forgit

Pleased to meetcha!

830

That's the girl. Now you looks
pretty enough to go anywheres.

831
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,220
Ginny! Come on... we're late.

832
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,590

Don't forgit your manners.

837
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,930
It's real pretty.

Course! They're eatin' it right now.
But there'll be plenty left.

840
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,450
What do you do at a party...
'Sides have cake?

841
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,680
Oh, lots of things.
Play games, an'... get presents.

Don't pay any attention to them, Ginny.

01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,290
Don't pay any 'tenshun to 'em, Ginny!

851
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,280
- Quit it!
- Pretty strings.

852
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,940
You stop it.

853
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,840
Now look what you've done!

854
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,140
You've spoiled everything!

855
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,050
Ouch! Don't! Stop!

856
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:18,420

You're just makin' it worse.

It wasn't much

But dey ain't none of us ever had

You sho have, yes sir.
You've played your last trick on me.

01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:45,080
Here, hold that knot, you sho look

900
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:47,760
Yes sir, you looks mighty

901
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,800
Don't he look good in that
bow-tie, Brer Bear?

902
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,670
I ain't never seen nobody

01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:58,200
- He's all dressed up for dinna.

Now wait a minute.
Wait jes' a minute, Brer Rabbit.

01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:43,480
I can't help laughing, Brer Fox.
I'se just been to my lauging place.

912
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,110

Oh, dat just a secret

01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,520
You keep out of this Brer Bear.
It's another one o' his tricks.

917
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,180
