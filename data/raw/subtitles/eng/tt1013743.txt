00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,979
<i>Welcome to Wichita</i>
<i>Mid-Continent Airport.</i>

2
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,525
<i>Convenient, friendly, affordable.</i>
<i>Fly with us.</i>

3
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>Please note, the Kansas Clean Air Act has</i>
<i>designated this airport as non-smoking.</i>

4
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Baggage claim is located</i>

5
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,947
<i>on the east side of the terminal.</i>

6
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,418
<i>Hotel and ground transportation</i>
<i>information boards</i>

7
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,924
<i>and public telephones are located</i>
<i>opposite the baggage carousels.</i>

8
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,538
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please maintain visual contact</i>

9
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,237
<i>with your personal property at all times.</i>

10
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,646
<i>Please do not leave your baggage</i>
<i>or other items unattended.</i>

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,945
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

12
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,008
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

13
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,811
So, I'm gonna make it
onto the earlier flight, right?

14
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,112
Are you gonna check that?

15
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,153
No, I'm gonna carry it on.
It's got valuables in it.

16
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,222
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,535
- God, excuse me.
- No, I'm sorry.

18
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,875
That bag is wicked heavy, anyhow.

19
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,473
I was looking at my phone.
I hate it when people do that.

20
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,519
You have a little

21
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,325
smudge.

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,264
What are these?

23
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,003
Those are two barrel carburetors
for a Pontiac Tri-Power.

24
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,081
Those are exhaust tips for a '74 Z-28.

25
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,119
I restore old cars, so...

26
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,656
Hair-dryer.

27
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,829
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

28
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,974
- This is getting to be a habit.
- Yeah, it is.

29
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,874
Sorry about that.

30
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,106
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,352
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

32
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,854
- Boston?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,715
Gate 12.

34
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,317
- Enjoy your flight, Mr. Garcia.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,417
Hi.

36
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,489
I'm sorry. You're not on this flight.

37
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,492
Well, I just checked in
for this one, like, 10 minutes ago.

38
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,069
That must be some sort of mistake.

39
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,297
I'm sorry,
the computer shows that we're booked.

40
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,237
Listen, Sharry.

41
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,208
Tomorrow my little sister's
getting married. I practically raised her.

42
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,302
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

43
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,780
Listen, can you help me out for a second?
She's my little sister.

44
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,145
She's April, I'm June,

45
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,219
she's counting on me
to march her down the aisle tomorrow.

46
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,685
That's very sweet,

47
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,382
but the 11:50 will get you there
tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

48
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,017
Your boarding pass, sir?

49
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,989
Sometimes things happen for a reason.

50
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,766
- Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,904
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>
<i>for US Midland Air, flight 77</i>

52
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:11,170
<i>non-stop service to Boston's</i>
<i>Logan Airport, now boarding at gate 12.</i>

53
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,837
<i>Would all passengers holding</i>
<i>a valid boarding pass, please proceed...</i>

54
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,349
I should've seen it coming, boss.
He went on tilt, he came undone.

55
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,919
Coming undone in our business
means you need a margarita.

56
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,217
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people
in a government lab and blowing it up.

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,792
<i>It doesn't mean stealing an object</i>
<i>of critical importance.</i>

58
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,384
<i>- Does he have the Zephyr or not?</i>
- We believe so.

59
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,062
You believe so.

60
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,600
- Check it out.
<i>- I don't care what you believe, Fitz.</i>

61
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,693
<i>- I need you to clean your mess up.</i>
- Go back and play it again.

62
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,896
<i>I want the Zephyr.</i>

63
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,405
We'll have it in hand
by the time he lands in Boston.

64
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,738
Find out who and what she is.

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,610
Should I have the field office pick her up
in Wichita?

66
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,909
I got a better idea.

67
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,011
Miss Havens? We did find a seat for you.

68
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,584
<i>I'd like to have your attention, please.</i>
<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

69
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,220
<i>We will be departing</i>
<i>Wichita Airport shortly.</i>

70
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,230
<i>Thanks for your patience.</i>

71
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,269
I know it's policy or whatever
and it's just your job,

72
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,239
- but it's kind of lame.
- Again, I apologize.

73
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,673
Fitz. What did you do?

74
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,581
It's no wonder these airlines
are going out of business.

75
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,584
<i>We have been cleared onto the runway.</i>

76
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,119
There's nobody on the plane.

77
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,293
<i>The captain has turned on</i>
<i>the "fasten seatbelt" sign.</i>

78
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,731
<i>Please remain seated</i>
<i>until the sign has been turned off</i>

79
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,132
<i>and it's safe to move about the cabin.</i>

80
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,598
I'm June, by the way.

81
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,230
I'm Roy Miller.

82
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,734
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

83
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,804
Tequila on the rocks?

84
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

85
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,386
So, your sister's
getting married tomorrow?

86
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,413
- Excuse me?
- Your sister.

87
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,049
She's getting married tomorrow.
Congratulations.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,991
Yeah, thanks.

89
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,793
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.

90
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,837
I'm sorry, how's that?

91
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,668
April is getting married,
but not till Saturday.

92
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,968
You had me fooled.

93
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:28,479
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow.
So, I do, actually, have to go home.

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,348
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

95
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,028
It might be.

96
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,567
Wichita is a long way to go
for a carburetor.

97
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,103
It's not just any carburetor.
It's a triple deuce.

98
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.

99
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,107
And Kansas has the best scrap.

100
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,370
Really?

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,002
My dad had a garage,

102
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,910
and when I was a kid,
he bought this chassis.

103
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,974
He used to take us to yards,
and search for parts, you know?

104
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,715
He died in '98,

105
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:14,191
and now that April's getting married,
I just figured, why not finish it up,

106
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,454
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

107
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,961
Kind of like a present
from our dad, too, you know?

108
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,694
That's nice.

109
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,531
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

110
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,178
I used to think that

111
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,353
someday, when the last part went in,

112
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,723
I would just climb into that GTO
and start it up.

113
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,324
Just drive and drive and drive,
and just keep driving

114
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,695
until I got to the tip of South America.

115
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,670
- Cape Horn.
- Yeah.

116
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,637
- There's beautiful islands down there.
- Yeah?

117
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,505
Pirate islands.

118
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,781
Yeah, "someday."
That's a dangerous word.

119
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,384
Dangerous?

120
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,615
It's really just code for "never."

121
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,756
I think a lot about things I haven't done.

122
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,889
Dive in the Great Barrier Reef.
Ride the Orient Express.

123
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:32,067
Live on the Amalfi Coast with nothing
but a motorcycle and a backpack.

124
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,033
Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap.

125
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,205
Where is that?

126
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,144
South of France.

127
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,950
What about you? What's your list?

128
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,789
Well, yours sounds pretty good.

129
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,025
Wow.

130
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,200
Thanks.

131
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,268
It's no problem.

132
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,170
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

133
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,538
You know what?

134
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,673
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

135
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,043
- I'll help you.
- Thanks.

136
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,719
Lots of turbulence, huh?

137
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,536
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Sure

138
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,606
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap"?

139
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,310
I mean, what kind of a line is that?

140
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,957
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.

141
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,857
Ma'am? Ma'am?

142
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,173
Did you see his hands, by any chance?

143
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,075
They just, like, snatched that bag
right out of the air.

144
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,045
Lightning-fast reflexes.

145
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,847
Not cool.

146
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,485
Okay.

147
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,167
This will help.

148
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,461
Enough. It's over, Roy.

149
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,421
Yeah, I agree. Enough.

150
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,261
Where's the Zephyr?

151
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,449
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

152
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,320
Why did Fitz put her on the plane?

153
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,853
Don't move, Miller.

154
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,237
So what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

155
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,109
You're just gonna
let this opportunity pass you by?

156
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,181
No, of course you're not.

157
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,546
You're gonna walk right through that door,
you're gonna get it right.

158
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,948
It's not your first rodeo, woman.

159
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,588
Hey.

160
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,667
I decided to join you.

161
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,830
I'm sorry. I...

162
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,932
- No, no, don't... It's great.
- I'm sorry.

163
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,011
It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude
and everything.

164
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,408
There's something I've gotta tell you.

165
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,040
What? Oh, my God,
you're in a relationship. I'm so sorry.

166
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,641
No, no, no. That's not it.

167
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,653
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

168
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,218
Are we landing?

169
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,758
No, not yet.

170
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,658
No?

171
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,132
Listen, there's no need to panic. I have

172
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,904
contained the situation.

173
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,565
Situation?

174
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,675
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

175
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,772
- Where did they go?
- I mean, they're dead.

176
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,749
- The pilots are dead.
- Shot. It's...

177
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,342
Shot?

178
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,984
By who?

179
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,621
Well, me.

180
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,231
Actually, I shot the first pilot.

181
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,960
He shot the second pilot accidentally.
It's just

182
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,996
one of those things.

183
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,981
Seriously, this is great!

184
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,791
Really, I'm relieved
you are taking this so well.

185
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,559
Where are you going?

186
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,639
I'm just gonna go check on things
and think about landing.

187
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,969
Would you mind
putting your seatbelt on for me?

188
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,406
- That would be great.
- Yeah.

189
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,757
This is weird.

190
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,035
Mayday. Mayday.
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

191
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,772
What's happening?
Everybody's dead out there!

192
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,509
Come on in. Sit down.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

193
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,608
- Everybody's dead in here.
- I'm declaring an emergency.

194
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,086
- Oh, my God! Are we going down?
- I'm sorry?

195
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,281
Are we going down?

196
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,688
No, June, it's just a rapid descent.
Please, sit down.

197
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,453
<i>Please state your emergency, Midland 77.</i>

198
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,119
I'm sorry,
I think I've heard enough of this guy.

199
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,322
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

200
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,455
The shoulder straps.

201
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,093
You can put those over,
and it clicks in right down there.

202
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,694
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

203
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,797
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay...

204
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,035
Gear down, showdown.

205
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,442
Why can't we just land in an airport?

206
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,141
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

207
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,912
- They'll be waiting for us.
- What do you mean? Waiting for us?

208
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,682
- Who?
- I think the less you know, the better.

209
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,051
What?

210
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,123
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

211
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,457
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

212
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,734
- That's a truck. That's a truck!
- Yeah.

213
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,860
- That's a truck!
- Yup.

214
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,995
That's a truck!

215
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,037
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

216
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,577
- That's a curve. That's a curve!
- I see it. I see it.

217
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,290
Oh, my God!

218
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,462
Oh, God!

219
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,778
Okay, this is good.

220
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,371
What's good?

221
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,980
Take a sip of that.

222
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,054
It'll take the edge off.

223
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,189
- Are you shot?
- Yeah, how about that?

224
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,632
It's just a scrape. That's good news.

225
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,897
June, we have to

226
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,371
discuss what's gonna happen next.

227
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,138
You need to go to the hospital.
Prison, maybe?

228
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,544
Some people are gonna come
looking for you now. Bad people.

229
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,606
You know, I feel a little weird.

230
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,948
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep,
which should be in a couple of minutes.

231
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,817
- What?
- I need you to listen, June.

232
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,480
Did you drug me?

233
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,785
Yes.

234
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,156
- You drugged me.
- Yeah, it's for your own good.

235
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,592
Now, look. These bad people

236
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,995
who are going to come and see you,
they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

237
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,397
And you need to tell them
you don't know me.

238
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,833
- June? June?
- Okay.

239
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,995
You need to tell them
you don't remember anything.

240
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,006
And you need to avoid getting in
any vehicle with them at all costs.

241
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,076
Okay, who are "them"?

242
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,610
Well, they're serious people, June.

243
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,443
They'll probably identify themselves
as federal agents, and they'll DIP you.

244
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,780
Dip me? In what?

245
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,013
Dis-Information Protocol.
They'll tell you a story about me.

246
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,056
About how I'm mentally unstable,
paranoid.

247
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,392
How I'm violent and dangerous,
and it'll all sound very convincing.

248
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,827
I'm already convinced.

249
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,332
There's a few common DIP keywords
to listen for.

250
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,894
Reassuring words.
Words like, "stabilize," "secure," "safe."

251
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,236
If they say these words,
particularly with repetition...

252
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,569
Okay.

253
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,075
...it means they're going to kill you.

254
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,770
Oh, God!

255
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,211
Or intern you somewhere offshore
for a very long time.

256
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,748
- Okay?
- Okay.

257
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,750
Now, stay with me.
If they tell you you're safe...

258
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,082
If they tell me I'm safe,

259
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,212
they're gonna kill me.

260
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,587
- Don't get in what?
- Vehicles.

261
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,853
- Any vehicles.
- Okay, any vehicles.

262
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,553
- Just run.
- I'll run.

263
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,687
- Run.
- Run.

264
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,322
And if they ask you about me...

265
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,902
I don't know you. I don't know you at all.

266
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,940
Who are you, Roy?

267
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,944
<i>...a mi</i>x<i>ing of rain and snow,</i>
<i>good for ski country, but probably...</i>

268
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,618
<i>- Thanks, Andrea.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

269
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,589
<i>Now, back to our top news story</i>
<i>of the morning.</i>

270
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,456
<i>Here's Bradley Moss,</i>
<i>with an on-the-scene report.</i>

271
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,089
<i>According to FAA sources,</i>
<i>at appro</i>x<i>imately 7:30 last night,</i>

272
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,101
<i>all contact was lost with a</i>
<i>Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.</i>

273
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,297
<i>The plane was apparently passing through</i>
<i>an area of turbulence</i>

274
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,430
<i>and may have met up with wind shear</i>

275
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,804
<i>or a lightning storm</i>
<i>causing an electrical failure.</i>

276
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,343
<i>Now, this is all conjecture at this point,</i>

277
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,470
<i>as all that's le</i>ft <i>is a crater</i>
<i>in an Indiana cornfield.</i>

278
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,980
Coming!

279
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,155
Rodney?

280
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,825
Thank God.
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

281
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:36,951
Yeah, why?

282
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,290
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

283
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,262
- Yeah.
- I saw on the news about the crash.

284
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,798
What news? What crash?

285
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,630
- Anyway, you're alive.
- I'm alive, yeah.

286
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:50,367
Sure, that's cool.
Hey, but, June, you know...

287
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,137
I told myself that if I found you alive,

288
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,208
that I was gonna ask you to dinner.

289
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,215
How about I call you later, okay?

290
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,018
It's just another day.
It's just a normal day. Okay.

291
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,600
She's moving.

292
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,994
Wow!

293
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,999
And gotta love the boots.

294
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,007
Yeah, you know.

295
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,475
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.

296
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,478
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

297
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,945
So, this weekend,
I was thinking about Dad's GTO.

298
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,480
- Really?
- Yeah, it's just sitting there.

299
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,686
And I was wondering how you would feel
about maybe selling it.

300
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,828
You wanna sell Dad's GTO?

301
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,627
Ben and I, we really want our own place.

302
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,860
Excuse me?

303
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,768
Excuse me. Anyone here belong
to that blue truck parked outside?

304
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,033
- Yeah, why?
- You're about to get a ticket.

305
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,772
- Thought I put enough quarters in there.
- Yeah.

306
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,936
I hate getting tickets.

307
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,146
Excuse me.

308
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,812
Please step inside, miss.

309
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,120
Let me just go grab a few things.

310
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,457
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent-in-Charge, Fitzgerald.

311
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,531
Will you join us inside the car
for a moment?

312
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,663
We know you were on the flight
with him last night.

313
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,995
The one that crashed.

314
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:29,996
Who are you again?

315
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,940
FBI. You do know Mr. Miller.

316
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,740
No, I don't.

317
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,182
Well, we chatted a little bit
before security, but...

318
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:51,160
I see. And once you were on the flight,
what happened then? More chatting?

319
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,360
- Is this funny to you?
- No.

320
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,434
He's dangerous, Miss Havens,
and out of control.

321
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,637
He said that you'd say he was crazy.

322
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,175
So, you did talk to him.
And about me, no less.

323
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,939
No. No, not you, specifically.

324
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,775
About whom, then?

325
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,277
Simon Feck?

326
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,182
I don't know who that is.

327
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:21,089
Look, this is getting really twisted around,
and I think I should probably call a lawyer.

328
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:32,132
We're gonna take you to a secure location,
Miss Havens, until Miller is contained.

329
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,534
Someplace safe.

330
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,807
- With you?
- Yes, ma'am.

331
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,254
You wanna tell me where we're going?

332
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,951
- Fellas?
- Don't worry, miss, you're safe.

333
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,784
Excuse me?

334
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,858
You're safe with us.

335
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,363
I wanna know where we're going.

336
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,933
Just a shortcut
till the situation is stabilized.

337
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,599
We'll keep you safe.

338
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,137
You said that already.

339
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,370
Because I meant it.

340
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,610
What is Jackson doing?

341
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,913
Shooter! Shooter! Evade! Evade!
Shooter on the freeway.

342
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,212
The dot's on your back!

343
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,415
Follow me, now!

344
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,288
Are you insane?
I'm not going out that door!

345
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,601
Oh, my God!

346
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,294
Get your foot off...

347
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,180
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, June!

348
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,486
- I can't see!
- You are doing great.

349
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,925
- I can't see! Get out of the way!
- Open the door.

350
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,724
- I can't get his foot off the gas.
- Open the door, June.

351
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,731
Open the door, June.
That's a beautiful dress, by the way.

352
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,631
One second.

353
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,431
Oh, my God!

354
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:31,922
I totally know what you're talking about.
It's so boring, I can't even stand it. Totally.

355
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,115
Thank you.

356
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,821
Who are you?

357
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,061
Oh, God!

358
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,063
What are you doing?

359
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,571
- Hi, June.
- Move out of the way, I can't see!

360
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,270
Please unlock the door, June.

361
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,142
Unlock the door. That way, I can help you.

362
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,082
- I can't let go!
- You need to let go, June.

363
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,360
- June, door!
- Got it!

364
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,649
Just pull over! Oh, my God!

365
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,931
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yup, come over here.

366
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,027
Right over here.
Just stay down, you're doing good.

367
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,732
Here, hold this. Well, well, well.

368
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,364
Check this out.

369
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,276
Nice.

370
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,538
These guys are loaded for bear.

371
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,738
You're doing well, June.

372
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,873
Excellent driving.
Over a dead guy, no less.

373
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,178
You're a natural.

374
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,211
That's a beautiful dress.

375
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,578
Is that for April's wedding?

376
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,385
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

377
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,924
- Yeah, that will be nice.
- Yeah.

378
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,391
Please, stop shooting people, okay?

379
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,333
- Just stop shooting people.
- I understand.

380
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,064
You're in shock.

381
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,765
How about you stay here

382
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,570
while I go have a word
with the guys in the tunnel.

383
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,167
- Okay?
- Okay.

384
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,144
- Okay?
- Okay.

385
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,738
Actually, I'm just gonna go shoot them.
I'll be right back.

386
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,320
By the way,
your timing when you opened that door...

387
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,412
- Okay.
...was sublime.

388
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,150
You saved us, I hope you know that.

389
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,226
- You saved us.
- Okay.

390
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,050
Hey! Hey!

391
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,555
Oh, shoot.

392
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,855
Hey, wait!

393
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,060
Wait! Wait! Wait!

394
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,132
Oh, no.

395
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,139
Excuse me, sorry.

396
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,065
There you are.

397
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,443
June?

398
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,942
June?

399
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,784
- Rodney?
- He's in the gym. Over there.

400
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,695
- Hey!
- Hey!

401
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,455
What are you doing here?

402
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,232
Whoa! That's a...
Hey, guys, say hello to June.

403
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,463
- That's a dress.
- Thanks.

404
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,403
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

405
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,304
No, it's...

406
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,870
It's complicated.

407
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,344
You know what?
I've been feeling the same way.

408
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,908
You wanna talk?

409
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,710
Maybe over some pie?

410
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,485
My point is...

411
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,580
My point is,
that plane crash made me think

412
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,817
about our break-up.

413
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,353
You know, this bulb went off, bing!

414
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,759
"Rodney, why are you giving up?
You're being passive."

415
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,729
"Getting back at her
because she didn't want the ring."

416
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,027
"So June didn't want
to be engaged right now,

417
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,692
"and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!

418
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,237
"What about all the things you
and June wanted to do together, huh?"

419
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,499
Our list, you know?

420
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,371
Like camping in Vermont with my brother
and Sheila in their new Winnie.

421
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,307
Tickets to Blue Man Group,
the battlegrounds tour.

422
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,107
I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?

423
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,207
Sure, what about it?

424
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,115
I was on it. I mean, in it.

425
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,380
I mean, I was in it.

426
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,955
So you were in the plane crash?

427
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,853
I wasn't supposed to be on that plane,
but I was on it,

428
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:38,918
and there was this guy who was some sort
of secret agent or something, and he...

429
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,994
He killed everybody on board.

430
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,303
And then he landed the plane.
Next thing you know,

431
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,305
I wake up, I'm in my room.
I have no idea how I got there.

432
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,568
He must've drugged me or something.
Then I go to April's fitting,

433
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,701
because I have to wear
this ridiculous dress.

434
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,302
These other guys, these other agents
come, they snatch me up.

435
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,076
Next thing you know,
I'm in <i>Grand The</i>ft <i>Auto</i> on the l-93.

436
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,845
- Why are you touching my hand?
- Because I'm here for you.

437
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,217
- Jeez, you are so stressed out!
- Well, yeah!

438
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,914
- And I get it.
- Really?

439
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,286
I completely understand. I mean...

440
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,691
- Wow, June.
- I know.

441
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,262
- Your little sister's getting married...
- It's like...

442
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,422
...and that is stressful.
- What are you talking about, Rodney?

443
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,227
You didn't even listen
to what I was talking about.

444
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,428
No, I did. Look, I would probably be
the same way in that situation.

445
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,835
What can I do to help? Setting up?
We can bring the guys over...

446
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,408
No, no, no. Okay.

447
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,737
Oh, Christ.

448
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,936
Hi, June. Look, I...

449
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,981
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting anything, but...

450
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,276
I'm Roy Miller.

451
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,277
Rodney Burris.

452
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,752
Rodney, hi. How are you?

453
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,290
We're running out of time,
and maybe I didn't make it clear enough,

454
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,830
but we're gonna have to stick together
for a little bit, because of our...

455
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,523
You know, our situation.

456
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,934
In case you didn't notice,
Rodney is a fireman, okay?

457
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,597
So he's perfectly capable of handling
any situation that comes up.

458
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,504
Thank you very much,
you can leave us alone.

459
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,802
I have no doubt.

460
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,676
Ever since I was a little kid,
I have great respect for firemen.

461
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,748
- I appreciate it.
- Fact of the matter is,

462
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,646
- I don't think you guys get paid enough.
- Yeah, we don't.

463
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,775
You're in Engine 10.

464
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah, Engine 10.

465
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,047
Yeah. Have you taken
your lieutenant's exam yet?

466
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,989
- I'm working on it.
- Yeah? How's that going?

467
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,355
It's a bitch.

468
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,258
Did you ever do a tour in that hall,
what is it?

469
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,492
Grove Hall, that's where the action is.
It's the fastest way up the ladder.

470
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,625
- Rodney!
- House of Flames!

471
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,535
I often thought I...

472
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,067
I should have been a fireman.

473
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,805
Rodney, this is the guy.

474
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,106
What?

475
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,751
- This is the guy.
- What? "This is the guy"?

476
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm sorry, who are you?

477
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,922
I'm the guy?

478
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,717
- I'm the guy. This is the guy.
- This is the guy.

479
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,261
- This is the guy.
- I'm a guy.

480
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,830
- I'm the guy.
- You are a guy.

481
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,900
- I'm a guy.
- He's the guy! He's the guy!

482
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,697
- Rodney, whatever happens...
- God.

483
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,772
- Please, for your own safety...
- Rodney, whatever happens,

484
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,306
- you should know...
...please stay in the booth.

485
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,137
What are you talking about?

486
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,511
Wait!

487
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,842
Everybody! Everybody get down.

488
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,438
Get down, down, down! Everybody down.

489
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,280
Rodney, get down,
or I will blow her head off.

490
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,785
I'll blow her head off.

491
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,253
What did I say?

492
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,824
Rodney, what did I say?

493
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,688
- Just calm down, buddy.
- Answer!

494
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,288
Sorry, I thought you were making a move.

495
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,599
Sorry. It's all right,
I thought he was making a move.

496
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,397
Making a little pie.
Pies for everybody. Everybody.

497
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,734
Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream, à la mode.

498
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,105
Weakens the legs, people. Lincoln knew it.
It's why they got to him.

499
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,206
No one follows us,
or I kill myself and then her.

500
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,488
- Get in the car. Please.
- No.

501
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,683
Watch your head.

502
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,026
We're at 560 Harris.
They're getting into a blue Volvo.

503
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,292
- Rodney! Rodney!
- Rodney?

504
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,339
Oh, my God! Rodney!

505
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,909
It's okay. Look at me.

506
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,309
- Okay. Look at me, it's okay.
- Shit!

507
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,406
I shot you through and through. No bone,
nowhere near the femoral artery, okay?

508
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,506
All right?

509
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,280
This is gonna be better for you
than Grove Hall. It's all good.

510
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,651
Okay? You good?

511
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,814
- Good?
- Good.

512
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,152
Good?

513
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,609
There were four security cameras
in that restaurant, June.

514
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,809
Now there is proof you're my hostage.

515
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,045
So we've cleared your name,
with the locals, at least.

516
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,180
You know? It's a start.
Something to build on.

517
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,384
- You shot Rodney!
- Yeah, I did.

518
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,053
But I asked him to stay in the booth.

519
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,322
You shot Rodney!

520
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,456
It might be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

521
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,593
Yeah, right, because we all should
get shot every now and then!

522
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,797
Rodney... Rodney is a good guy, June.

523
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,307
But not really right for you.

524
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,401
I mean, you know, in my opinion.
But a good guy.

525
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,879
Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero.
Probably get a promotion.

526
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,711
- Stop the car. Stop the car.
- What?

527
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,217
Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car. Just stop the car!

528
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,481
June, I understand
you want off the carousel.

529
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,716
I do, I wanna get off the carousel.
Please, Roy.

530
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,655
Can you stop the car, please? Right now!

531
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,751
I'm not one of those
"I told you so" kind of guys,

532
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,524
but I did warn you
to stay off the plane last night.

533
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,623
When?

534
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,169
Well, when I said,
"Sometimes things happen for a reason."

535
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,873
That's not a warning.
That's not a warning, Roy!

536
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,343
That's like a needlepoint expression
or a bumper sticker.

537
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:59,610
Next time, try, "June, if you get
on this plane, you will fucking die!"

538
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,820
You know, Roy, maybe they meant it
when they said that I would be safe.

539
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,257
- You really mean that, June?
- Yeah!

540
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:12,958
- Did you feel safe with them?
- Safer than I do now!

541
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,828
Okay, okay. All right.

542
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,417
Just so you understand,

543
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:46,326
right now, out there, on your own,
your life expectancy is like here.

544
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,921
With me, it's here. Without me, here.

545
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,867
With me, without me.
With me, without me.

546
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,597
So...

547
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,072
I wouldn't advise going home.
But, you know, it's up to you.

548
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,870
So right now I need another car,
keep moving.

549
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,176
Someone else is depending on me.
Someone whose life is in danger.

550
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,910
Someone who trusts me.
Every second I waste chasing you,

551
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,817
I'm letting him down.

552
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,095
<i>Rodney, why did you make this brave call</i>
<i>to leap into action?</i>

553
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,228
<i>Well, I didn't think.</i>

554
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,603
<i>I just did what any man would do</i>
<i>in that situation, you know?</i>

555
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,403
<i>- I leapt into action.</i>
- Thanks.

556
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,535
<i>- Like you said, it's really the job.</i>
<i>- You should be so proud.</i>

557
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,772
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- Good job.</i>

558
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,508
<i>It really didn't even hurt.</i>
<i>It was kind of like a bee sting.</i>

559
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,810
<i>What a brave firefighter.</i>

560
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,820
<i>The doctors tell me Rodney is going</i>
<i>to be okay, just a flesh wound.</i>

561
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:22,222
<i>A true blue Boston hero. Back to you, Don.</i>

562
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:38,968
This is what it's all about.

563
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,008
That, right there,
is what everybody wants.

564
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,979
A Burger King toy?

565
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,279
Open it up.

566
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,318
It's warm. What is it?

567
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,496
A battery.

568
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,222
A battery?

569
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,997
It's code-named Zephyr.
Not your average Duracell.

570
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,440
It's high output. Never runs out.

571
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,975
What do you mean, "never"?

572
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:18,242
That little thing there is the first
perpetual energy source since the sun.

573
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,285
So, what, your flashlight
never runs out of juice?

574
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,877
It can power a lot more
than a flashlight, June.

575
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,253
Really? How much more?

576
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,384
Small city.

577
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,961
Large submarine.

578
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,155
It's big.

579
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,794
The guy who invented it

580
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,803
is barely out of high school.

581
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,430
Simon Feck.

582
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,568
I was assigned with another agent to
watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita.

583
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,808
And the other guy, the agent, is the guy
who picked you up this morning.

584
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,746
Fitzgerald.

585
00:40:56,086 --> 00:41:01,183
A couple of weeks ago, I found out
he was going to sell the battery

586
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,520
and kill Simon.

587
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,424
So I got Simon out of there,

588
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,193
put him someplace safe
and went back for the battery.

589
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,965
And Fitz set me up.
Made it look like I went rogue.

590
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,438
That's when I met you.

591
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,279
So...

592
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,527
So, what's next? I mean, what's the plan?

593
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,627
I think we get some rest,

594
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,427
pick up Simon, and get you back
for your sister's wedding.

595
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,334
I'm pretty good at what I do, June.

596
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,568
And tonight, we're safe.

597
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,173
Scout's honor.

598
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,473
Safe and secure?

599
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,124
Good night, Roy.

600
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,090
Were you really a Boy Scout?

601
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,432
Eagle Scout.

602
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,765
I was a Brownie.

603
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,397
That's cool.

604
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,447
Good night, Roy.

605
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,223
<i>Pies for everybody. Everybody.</i>

606
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,166
<i>Everybody gets pies, okay?</i>
<i>No ice-cream...</i>

607
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,765
So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?

608
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,640
We're looking at a pawn.
I talked to her, so did he.

609
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,009
She owns a garage, no passport,
gone nowhere, been nowhere.

610
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,740
She's a nobody.

611
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,683
You've been two steps behind
since this began, Fitz.

612
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,119
Are you sure someone
is not taking you to school?

613
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,746
Clean this shit up.

614
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,845
This is a safe-house?

615
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,747
Simon!

616
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,718
Simon?

617
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,620
Stay close.

618
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:59,832
Hey, Simon, this is no time to play.

619
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,251
What is all this?

620
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,151
Simon. It's what he does.

621
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,256
I'm late, and he's gone.

622
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,044
Simon.

623
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,764
"Made in Austria."

624
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,813
Who are these people?
Are they Fitzgerald's guys?

625
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,387
No, it's other guys.

626
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,286
Other bad guys?

627
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,052
Worse guys. Hold my mags.

628
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,856
Worse guys?

629
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,399
Now, I need you to listen carefully.
Do exactly as I say.

630
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,060
On three, I'm gonna lay down cover,

631
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,160
then we're gonna run
to those shelves over there.

632
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,238
Okay.

633
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,306
- Okay?
- Yeah.

634
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,703
- You ready?
- Yeah.

635
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,002
One...

636
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,045
Oh, my God!

637
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,540
Sorry. I panicked.

638
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,917
- What number would you like?
- Let's just stick with three, it's good.

639
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,081
Okay. One... Two...

640
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,351
Three.

641
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,670
These guys are fancy. Mags.

642
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:56,041
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
He's a Spanish arms dealer.

643
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,081
He also wants the battery.

644
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,150
Ready?

645
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,115
- Let's move.
- Okay.

646
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,650
June. June!

647
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,257
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

648
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,918
And where the hell is Simon?

649
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,394
I don't know yet, but he left a message.

650
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,362
- A message?
- Wait.

651
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,572
What I need you to do right now
is wait here.

652
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,644
- What?
- Yeah. I'm gonna find us a way out.

653
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,541
- I can't wait here!
- I'll be right back.

654
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,635
Wait! Roy!

655
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,543
Just take this.

656
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,319
Roy?

657
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,822
Shit.

658
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:51,957
June?

659
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,233
June! June! June! June!

660
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,941
June! June! June! June!

661
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,070
June!

662
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,546
Please stop saying my name.

663
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,412
You keep saying my name,
it's freaking me out.

664
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,649
- Okay. I understand.
- Okay.

665
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,216
- Drink this.
- What is it?

666
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,293
Brotine-zero.
They're gonna smoke us with D-5.

667
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,725
Oh, yeah.

668
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,764
Where's yours?

669
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,294
Oh, shit.

670
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,701
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

671
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,136
They're coming.

672
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:48,625
June.

673
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,895
I know this looks bad,

674
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,761
but we'll be out of here

675
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,836
in a couple of minutes.

676
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,029
I got this.

677
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,272
We gotta go, June. Here, I'll help you.

678
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,322
We've been hit!

679
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,620
But it's okay!

680
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,127
We get through this, we're home free!

681
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,754
Ready, set, go!

682
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,702
We're almost there.

683
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,057
Hey, there, sleepy head.

684
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,061
How long have I been out?

685
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,501
Eighteen hours.

686
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,240
Where am I?

687
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,146
My place.

688
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:52,937
We're off-grid.

689
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,484
No one's ever found me here.

690
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,954
Shame we can't stay longer.
We got a rendezvous with Simon.

691
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,957
He's fine. I figured out his code.

692
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,392
He's crazy about trains.

693
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,224
He used the passport I gave him
and went to Austria.

694
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,388
You drugged me again, Roy.

695
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,758
Yeah.

696
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,828
You can't do that.

697
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,236
Well, you weren't coping well.

698
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,276
I'm not sure, if you were awake,
if they would've even let you live.

699
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,134
What am I wearing?

700
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,081
A bikini. We're in the tropics.

701
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,280
How did I get in the bikini?

702
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:40,290
June, I've been trained
to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black

703
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,026
with nothing but a safety pin
and a Junior Mint.

704
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,695
I think I can get you in and out
of some clothes without

705
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:49,796
looking.

706
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,344
I'm not saying that's what I did, but...

707
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,438
Okay. Sorry. Reflex.

708
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,880
I deserved that. Hit me again.

709
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,783
I won't stop you.

710
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,579
June.

711
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,049
June?

712
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:14,689
June!

713
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,432
...paper clips and Junior Mints...

714
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,573
"Not that I'm saying that's what I did."

715
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,668
Shit!

716
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,411
Is this his phone?

717
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,322
Movement alert.

718
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,483
5826

719
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,389
Amapola.

720
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,232
That's a '67 Grand Prix.

721
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,372
I thought we were off the grid.

722
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,171
April.

723
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,906
April?

724
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:10,146
April! I know! No, I'm okay!
Listen, April... April? April?

725
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,512
April, can you hear me? April!

726
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,951
April, can you...

727
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,393
<i>I know! No, I'm okay!</i>
<i>Listen, April... April?</i>

728
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,734
<i>April, can you hear me? April!</i>

729
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,802
We don't know, Antonio.

730
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,310
We traced her phone to the Azores.
We're in range now.

731
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,411
Get to them before the agency.

732
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,660
Perfect timing. Lunch is ready.

733
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,857
You must be thirsty.

734
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,802
It's coconut. It's loaded with electrolytes.

735
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,503
Just... Whoa. Okay?

736
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:12,233
Okay. Just... Whoa.

737
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,404
Yeah?

738
00:54:15,482 --> 00:54:16,574
Yeah!

739
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:19,414
Hey. You got skills.

740
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,746
- My dad wanted boys.
- Yeah?

741
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:27,588
- Let me go.
- You can get out anytime you want.

742
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:29,184
I'll show you.

743
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:32,254
Hands like Houdini.

744
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:34,162
Turn your palms down,

745
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:36,126
and all at once,

746
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,833
throw your hands to the ground
and your hips back.

747
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,368
Nice.

748
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:46,811
That was good.

749
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:04,561
Who are you?

750
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:07,893
Really.

751
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:24,439
I don't understand.

752
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:28,147
Follow me.

753
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:45,694
I don't understand. I came in clean.

754
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:51,408
My phone is secure. It's secure.
Unless you made a call.

755
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:54,708
- And you didn't make a call.
- No, I didn't make a call.

756
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:56,304
I took a call.

757
00:55:58,585 --> 00:55:59,745
You took a call?

758
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:01,511
It was a quick one.

759
00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:03,081
You...

760
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:06,792
Come on.

761
00:56:07,894 --> 00:56:09,020
I thought we were off the grid,

762
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:10,323
- and then the phone rang.
- It's okay.

763
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,920
It was my sister and I had to take the call.

764
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:15,297
- You know? I didn't want her to worry.
- Watch your step.

765
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:20,167
No, no, no...

766
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:22,298
I can't get into that.
I just can't get into that thing.

767
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:23,906
I can't get into that.

768
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,740
- June.
- Roy...

769
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:30,075
Just, please, knock me out.
Use broton-seven or whatever.

770
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:32,615
- It's okay.
- You're grabbing my neck.

771
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,243
You asked me not to drug you.

772
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:36,055
Okay, good.

773
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:50,467
Hands like Houdini. Hands...

774
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:12,915
Roy?

775
00:57:20,066 --> 00:57:22,534
- I can't feel my face!
- Okay, time.

776
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:23,896
Okay, Simon...

777
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:27,332
Roy, the pull on this thing...

778
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,101
- We said 10 minutes.
- The traction on this thing.

779
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:32,337
- It can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!
- I get it.

780
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:35,939
It's a diesel hydraulic!

781
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:37,844
Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?

782
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:39,609
Yes.

783
00:57:55,235 --> 00:57:57,100
- Excuse me.
<i>- Guten Morgen,</i> miss.

784
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:58,192
Can you tell me where we are?

785
00:57:58,304 --> 00:57:59,771
Right now, miss? We are in Austria.

786
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:01,639
Austria, huh?

787
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:05,271
Would you like some breakfast, miss?

788
00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:07,778
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

789
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,681
Okay, I'm gonna have some pancakes,

790
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:12,979
scrambled eggs...

791
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:14,280
- Scrambled eggs.
...and...

792
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:15,649
With a glass of milk.

793
00:58:15,755 --> 00:58:16,779
And a glass of milk.

794
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,916
- Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger, please?
- Certainly, sir.

795
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:27,923
You know, statistically, you're a lot
more likely to die riding on a train

796
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:29,865
than any other form of transportation.

797
00:58:32,439 --> 00:58:35,033
10.3 times more likely
than dying on a plane.

798
00:58:36,843 --> 00:58:37,810
Simon?

799
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:41,180
Simon Feck?

800
00:58:41,715 --> 00:58:42,704
Yes.

801
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:47,219
My name is June.
I'm a friend of Roy Miller's.

802
00:58:48,788 --> 00:58:50,517
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?

803
00:58:50,623 --> 00:58:52,022
No, not yet.

804
00:58:52,992 --> 00:58:55,222
- Don't you wanna answer that?
- Yeah.

805
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:56,796
But I can't.

806
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:58,454
I'm not supposed to.

807
00:58:58,765 --> 00:58:59,857
It might be Roy.

808
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:04,369
Yeah, but he told me not to answer the
phone, because the signal can be tracked.

809
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,268
That's right. Of course.

810
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:17,377
Did Roy happen to tell you
about the plan here?

811
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:19,645
Are we supposed to meet him here, or...

812
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:21,810
What did you say that drink was?

813
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,253
- A Harvey...
- It's a Harvey Wallbanger.

814
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:26,287
Do you mind just
ordering me one of those?

815
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:28,155
Because it looks great.

816
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:30,286
I'll just be right back.
You just stay here for a second.

817
00:59:30,396 --> 00:59:32,057
I'll be right back.

818
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:35,899
Something is wrong.
It's getting hotter, Roy.

819
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:37,629
She didn't answer her phone.

820
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:39,864
- I told her not to. That's...
- We just got here.

821
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:42,271
- That's good news.
- I'm sure she'll turn up. Roy...

822
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:45,208
- I left a note posted right there.
- We may have an issue here.

823
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:48,644
- The temperature...
- She's hungry... She's hungry.

824
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:51,376
It's getting too hot.
We need to cool it down.

825
00:59:51,484 --> 00:59:53,418
Yeah, she went to get something to eat.

826
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,181
Good. Come on, Simon.

827
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,312
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

828
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,508
I'm feeling a little bit train-sick.

829
01:00:24,617 --> 01:00:26,084
Is it okay if I hang out here for a while?

830
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:28,780
Of course, I will get you some water.

831
01:00:30,924 --> 01:00:31,891
Here you go.

832
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,730
Antonio Quintana wants to know

833
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:44,770
where is the battery?

834
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,975
Where is the battery?

835
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:12,296
I'm sorry, I'm looking for ice.

836
01:01:12,765 --> 01:01:13,754
- Roy.
- Bernhard.

837
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:14,834
Miller.

838
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,562
- Wrong room.
- It's okay. It's okay.

839
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,570
- You know him?
- Yeah.

840
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:23,733
He's an assassin, platinum grade.
He's come to collect Simon.

841
01:01:23,843 --> 01:01:24,832
Oh, my God.

842
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:27,208
- And to kill you.
- That's Simon?

843
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:29,406
- Yeah, June, Simon. Simon, June.
- Hi.

844
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,911
Jeez! I'm okay. I got this.

845
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:47,365
Simon, please move.

846
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:04,016
You have quite some balls, <i>Fräulein.</i>

847
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:07,012
Hands like Houdini.

848
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:17,095
I'm so sorry.

849
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:21,963
But you were trying to kill me.

850
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:35,913
That's disgusting.

851
01:02:44,157 --> 01:02:46,648
Oh, my God. Just die!

852
01:02:49,996 --> 01:02:50,963
Oh, shit.

853
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:55,600
I got to get you guys someplace safe.

854
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:07,277
- They're not on the train.
- Oh, really?

855
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,109
Cameras at the last station show nothing.

856
01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:11,342
They must have gotten off
between stops.

857
01:03:11,451 --> 01:03:13,214
Locals haven't found anything.

858
01:03:44,183 --> 01:03:46,151
Always the classics, Roy.

859
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:02,963
Salzburg, Austria. Very nice.

860
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:17,375
Yes.

861
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,751
No, we just got in.

862
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,284
Well, we're talking now. No, I understand.

863
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,585
Well, it's good to hear your voice,
too, Naomi.

864
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,687
I'll meet you at the caprice.
As soon as you can be there.

865
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:43,800
It's a beautiful city, huh?

866
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,668
Yeah.

867
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,413
Never seen anything quite like it.

868
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:56,912
Neither have I.

869
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,786
I got to go out for a bit.

870
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:04,956
Okay.

871
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:08,291
I was thinking about ordering
some room service.

872
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:13,363
And I thought maybe we could
have dinner or something.

873
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,370
That sounds great.

874
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:17,576
9:00?

875
01:05:19,479 --> 01:05:20,946
9:00 sounds great.

876
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,374
June?

877
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:31,647
Could you do me a favor
and just stick around here? It's better.

878
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:35,583
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where else am I gonna go?

879
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:37,353
See you in a bit.

880
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:45,232
They're not gonna hurt you.
You're too valuable to them.

881
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:47,272
Now, just breathe, listen to your music.

882
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:49,341
Here, as a matter of fact,
I got that for you.

883
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:52,038
I know you like them.

884
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:53,237
Cool, thanks.

885
01:05:53,346 --> 01:05:57,908
Listen, order as much room service
as you like, but don't leave the room.

886
01:05:58,284 --> 01:05:59,478
Okay.

887
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:03,353
- We need to talk about the Zephyr later.
- And we will.

888
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:32,438
You seem different.

889
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:34,603
Do I?

890
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:39,847
So, who's your companion?

891
01:07:40,786 --> 01:07:43,016
She's beautiful. The blonde.

892
01:07:43,623 --> 01:07:45,250
She seems capable.

893
01:07:46,325 --> 01:07:47,724
I just met her.

894
01:07:48,828 --> 01:07:50,625
She's a nobody.

895
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,561
Just someone I picked up along the way.

896
01:07:55,468 --> 01:07:56,799
That's a shame.

897
01:07:58,604 --> 01:08:01,903
This is getting boring.
Are we gonna do a deal or not?

898
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,737
Don't speak to me like that.

899
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:11,781
I will speak to you any way I please, Tony.

900
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:13,611
We both know you're lucky I'm here.

901
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:19,190
I have the battery. I'm on a schedule.

902
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,091
The world is full of bad guys
and people are calling.

903
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:28,895
I understand.

904
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:31,933
What's your price?

905
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:35,368
I have a figure in mind.

906
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:37,439
What's it worth to you?

907
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,777
Are you angry about your island, Roy?

908
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,278
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.

909
01:08:56,462 --> 01:09:00,489
I'm Isabel George, Director
of Counter Espionage at the CIA.

910
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:03,095
I'm sure you are.

911
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:06,800
Forgive me, I just...

912
01:09:08,874 --> 01:09:11,138
I just don't know exactly what to believe.

913
01:09:13,346 --> 01:09:16,941
Well, that's understandable,
considering that the last five days

914
01:09:17,049 --> 01:09:20,246
you've been fed a steady diet
of misinformation and fantasy

915
01:09:20,353 --> 01:09:23,447
by an agent of ours
who's recently gone rogue.

916
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:27,486
Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the
one that wanted to steal the battery.

917
01:09:27,593 --> 01:09:29,117
Well, let's examine the facts.

918
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:33,992
Miller told you that he was protecting the
Zephyr from people wanting to misuse it.

919
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,363
But now he's trying to sell it
to an international arms dealer.

920
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,395
Antonio Quintana.

921
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:42,500
One of Europe's leading
weapons manufacturers.

922
01:09:43,476 --> 01:09:44,602
Ask yourself, Miss Havens,

923
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,972
has Roy Miller said anything to you
that's proven to be true?

924
01:09:53,185 --> 01:09:55,278
<i>- God, e</i>x<i>cuse me.</i>
<i>- No, I'm sorry.</i>

925
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:03,018
<i>Sorry, I was looking at my phone.</i>
<i>I hate it when people do that.</i>

926
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:07,726
<i>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.</i>

927
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:12,193
<i>- This is getting to be a habit.</i>
<i>- Yeah, it is.</i>

928
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:17,665
He used you as a mule to carry the battery
through security, Miss Havens.

929
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:20,242
He's been playing you.

930
01:10:21,046 --> 01:10:23,947
He's a spy, that's what he does.
He lies for a living.

931
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:27,212
Any love, empathy,
we train that right out of them.

932
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,887
What did you imagine?

933
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:32,285
The two of you would move
into a condo together, get a dog?

934
01:10:32,491 --> 01:10:35,517
You can't have a life with him.
That's fantasy.

935
01:10:36,228 --> 01:10:37,820
But you can have yours back.

936
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:39,494
She's been gone eight minutes.

937
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:42,633
We need you to get back to the hotel
before Miller.

938
01:10:45,004 --> 01:10:47,973
- What am I supposed to do?
- All right, then.

939
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:52,238
This pen is a transmitter.

940
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:55,338
Once you have confirmation
that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr,

941
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:58,542
that it's somewhere nearby,
or on his person,

942
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:02,821
you can confirm this
by simply clicking the top button.

943
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:13,993
I'm sorry I'm late.

944
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,062
Everything go okay?

945
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:21,304
Well enough.

946
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:27,271
It's getting hotter.

947
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:40,089
So, did you get your price?

948
01:11:44,597 --> 01:11:46,462
I followed you tonight.

949
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:52,864
You have nothing to say?

950
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:56,406
Here's to Wichita

951
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:00,405
where we first...

952
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,145
Bumped into each other.

953
01:12:06,752 --> 01:12:08,686
Do you think that was fate, Roy?

954
01:12:10,523 --> 01:12:12,457
I don't believe in fate.

955
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,290
But I believe in luck.

956
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:20,024
I don't know what to believe.

957
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:34,640
That hurt more than I thought it would.

958
01:12:39,385 --> 01:12:40,875
I'm going home.

959
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:56,398
They promised that if you turned
yourself in, they'd protect you.

960
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:00,500
I love your optimism.

961
01:13:01,874 --> 01:13:02,932
Never lose it.

962
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,781
Get her out of here.

963
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,728
He's not here, sir.

964
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:32,760
Did they tell you you're going home?

965
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:35,503
You've seen the inside
of the honeycomb, June!

966
01:13:36,141 --> 01:13:37,403
You can't go home.

967
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,769
<i>The suspect is on the roof.</i>

968
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:44,605
Oh, shit.

969
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:05,027
Director George!

970
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,232
Get her in the car.

971
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:59,348
He's heading toward the river.

972
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:15,532
Stand down! He has the battery!

973
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:26,147
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

974
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:27,375
Hold your fire!

975
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:28,644
Stand down!

976
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:29,821
He has the battery!

977
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:50,401
Did you secure the kid?

978
01:15:51,276 --> 01:15:52,243
Yeah.

979
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:02,579
Did they find Roy?

980
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:05,548
We'll find the body. We have to.

981
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:07,949
He went down with the Zephyr.

982
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,789
Thank you, guys.

983
01:17:12,724 --> 01:17:13,986
Fitz?

984
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:17,994
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn.
Ramstein is that way, west.

985
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,825
I think we're going south.

986
01:17:20,032 --> 01:17:21,829
You know what? You're right.

987
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:32,143
Tell him we're back on track.

988
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:35,404
I don't have the battery,
but no one's gonna get it now.

989
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:37,411
Yeah, I've got the next best thing.

990
01:17:37,683 --> 01:17:40,083
I'll see you in Spain in two days.

991
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:52,026
Hey, Wilmer.

992
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:55,229
- How was the party?
- It was nice.

993
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:58,033
- I see the goat is still out there.
- Yeah.

994
01:17:58,237 --> 01:17:59,898
I thought it was a wedding present.

995
01:18:00,105 --> 01:18:01,902
It was, but,

996
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:06,501
I think I wanted her to want it
more than she wanted it.

997
01:18:06,845 --> 01:18:07,834
Okay.

998
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:12,511
<i>...Boston's classic rock station.</i>
<i>Here are the Kingsmen.</i>

999
01:18:12,718 --> 01:18:13,844
This just come in?

1000
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:16,782
G-body Grand Prix.
Longest hood in history.

1001
01:18:17,723 --> 01:18:19,452
Gonna be a real beaut.

1002
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:31,794
Ru-pa... Fee-pa... No, it's...

1003
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:35,271
5826 Amapola.

1004
01:18:37,943 --> 01:18:39,911
That's like an hour from here.

1005
01:18:40,746 --> 01:18:42,543
Maybe it's a safe-house.

1006
01:19:17,582 --> 01:19:18,913
Here we go.

1007
01:20:12,034 --> 01:20:13,092
Shit!

1008
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:18,766
Who's out there?
I'm not afraid to use this.

1009
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:20,432
Oh, Frank, look at her!

1010
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:23,075
I want to know what she's doing
on my lawn in the middle of the night.

1011
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:24,870
I... I have the pistons you ordered.

1012
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,308
Pistons?

1013
01:20:26,515 --> 01:20:28,005
For the '67 Grand Prix.

1014
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,942
Molly, I didn't...

1015
01:20:30,586 --> 01:20:32,986
You are all wet. Please, come inside.

1016
01:20:40,696 --> 01:20:43,494
That Pontiac you have out there, Frank,
is a real classic.

1017
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,562
I really love pre-'70s Grand Prixs.

1018
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:50,964
So, you two lived here long?

1019
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:55,134
This old place?
It's been our home for 40 years.

1020
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:58,041
Sit down, honey. Have a cookie.

1021
01:20:59,147 --> 01:21:02,275
Frank thinks we should move,
but you know what? I am comfortable.

1022
01:21:02,517 --> 01:21:05,918
And we can afford to stay,
thanks to Publishers Clearing House.

1023
01:21:09,057 --> 01:21:10,581
You won Publishers Clearing House?

1024
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:14,093
- Twice.
- Plus, we won two lotto quick picks

1025
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:16,687
- Frank doesn't even remember buying.
- Because I didn't buy them.

1026
01:21:16,798 --> 01:21:19,824
Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons
off the Internet.

1027
01:21:20,269 --> 01:21:23,932
You don't know what you're typing
into that computer, Frank.

1028
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:27,333
Another couple of minutes
on your clothes, honey.

1029
01:21:28,877 --> 01:21:29,844
So,

1030
01:21:32,214 --> 01:21:33,545
Roy Miller.

1031
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:37,547
This was one of his safe-houses,
wasn't it?

1032
01:21:41,256 --> 01:21:42,621
What in the hell are you talking about?

1033
01:21:44,993 --> 01:21:46,290
Honey, what's this all about?

1034
01:21:49,431 --> 01:21:52,423
I'm sorry, I just thought, maybe...

1035
01:21:52,634 --> 01:21:54,465
I must've had this all wrong.

1036
01:21:54,836 --> 01:21:59,102
I was just looking for some information
about my friend, Roy.

1037
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:04,277
If you'd like to change,
there's a powder room right there.

1038
01:22:15,457 --> 01:22:17,288
That's our son, Matthew.

1039
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:20,484
We lost him in Kuwait.
There was a chopper crash.

1040
01:22:20,696 --> 01:22:23,824
He saved the lives
of two of his crewmen, and...

1041
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:26,860
He just always took care of everyone.

1042
01:22:27,069 --> 01:22:28,593
He was an Eagle Scout.

1043
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:32,003
This was taken the day
he got that swimming badge.

1044
01:22:32,207 --> 01:22:35,438
He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee

1045
01:22:35,644 --> 01:22:37,703
with practically one breath.

1046
01:22:40,082 --> 01:22:41,549
I just...

1047
01:22:42,684 --> 01:22:45,050
I've been terribly rude.

1048
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:47,450
I'm June Havens.

1049
01:22:47,823 --> 01:22:49,256
Molly Knight.

1050
01:22:50,225 --> 01:22:52,921
This is June Havens, and I'm leaving
a message on my own machine

1051
01:22:53,028 --> 01:22:55,690
for whoever is listening to this phone call.

1052
01:22:55,998 --> 01:22:57,625
I have the Zephyr.

1053
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,830
I have the Zephyr,
and I'm ready to make a deal.

1054
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:06,674
I'm sitting on Route 28,
right outside New Hampshire.

1055
01:23:07,376 --> 01:23:09,071
And if you want the Zephyr,

1056
01:23:09,344 --> 01:23:11,312
you better come and get it.

1057
01:23:46,982 --> 01:23:47,949
Hey, fellas.

1058
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:54,714
So,

1059
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,019
you want the Zephyr?

1060
01:23:57,726 --> 01:24:00,092
I got the Zephyr. It's right here.

1061
01:24:00,295 --> 01:24:01,660
Come and get it.

1062
01:24:19,047 --> 01:24:22,073
Come on. Let's go!

1063
01:24:22,851 --> 01:24:23,943
Welcome to <i>España.</i>

1064
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,824
Today is the festival of San Fermin.

1065
01:24:40,669 --> 01:24:43,536
Have you ever seen a bullfight,
Miss Havens?

1066
01:24:49,778 --> 01:24:51,507
My name is Antonio Quintana.

1067
01:24:52,581 --> 01:24:54,242
I know who you are.

1068
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:58,143
What did he give me?

1069
01:24:59,054 --> 01:25:01,249
It's something we're developing
at my company.

1070
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:03,187
A new kind of truth serum.

1071
01:25:03,525 --> 01:25:04,651
Really?

1072
01:25:06,928 --> 01:25:09,522
I have a few questions for you
about the battery,

1073
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:12,964
since we both know
what you gave to my men was a joke.

1074
01:25:17,038 --> 01:25:18,869
I don't like you very much.

1075
01:25:21,143 --> 01:25:22,167
The truth!

1076
01:25:24,846 --> 01:25:25,904
Good!

1077
01:25:28,617 --> 01:25:31,245
You know, I really like Miller, though.

1078
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:34,445
'Cause, you know, I was totally wrong
about him in Salzburg.

1079
01:25:34,656 --> 01:25:37,181
He wanted me to hear that phone call
so that I would follow him.

1080
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:39,760
I'd turn him in,
and then he could get me home safely.

1081
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:41,192
He was trying to protect me.

1082
01:25:41,296 --> 01:25:42,456
Shut up.

1083
01:25:42,797 --> 01:25:46,893
It's crazy that I could feel
so powerful and capable around him...

1084
01:25:47,002 --> 01:25:50,062
- Shut up.
...and yet he takes care of me.

1085
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:53,036
Shut up! Where is the battery?
Where is it?

1086
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:57,374
I bet you've never made a girl
an omelet, have you, Antonio?

1087
01:26:00,749 --> 01:26:01,943
Don't test me, June.

1088
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,550
Or got her to her sister's wedding
on time.

1089
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:06,644
It's really the little things, honestly.

1090
01:26:06,855 --> 01:26:08,846
- But they count so much.
- Enough!

1091
01:26:09,357 --> 01:26:10,381
Okay!

1092
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:13,160
Miller is dead!
Roy Miller is dead, he's out.

1093
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:15,687
No.

1094
01:26:15,997 --> 01:26:19,160
No, he's not. He can hold his breath
for a really long time.

1095
01:26:20,735 --> 01:26:21,793
He is dead!

1096
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:03,501
I'm not gonna ask you again. But if
you don't tell me what I need to know,

1097
01:27:04,913 --> 01:27:07,108
- you're gonna die!
- I don't know where the battery is.

1098
01:27:07,215 --> 01:27:09,012
Then why did you tell everyone
you had it? Why?

1099
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:11,085
Because I was trying to find Roy.

1100
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:18,992
Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys
like you around, Roy's not too far away.

1101
01:27:23,164 --> 01:27:24,722
You're gonna die.

1102
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:37,305
Finally!

1103
01:27:38,813 --> 01:27:41,247
Nice to meet you, John.

1104
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:42,473
Antonio.

1105
01:27:42,984 --> 01:27:44,576
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.

1106
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:48,622
Where is the boy?

1107
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:53,960
You didn't think
I'd just bring the package, did you?

1108
01:27:54,296 --> 01:27:55,593
Come on.

1109
01:27:56,598 --> 01:27:59,192
Why don't you follow me down
to the river and bring the money?

1110
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:00,359
Okay.

1111
01:28:33,668 --> 01:28:37,331
Is this thatching in here? Because I've
never seen anything like that before.

1112
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,102
We have really old architecture
in Boston, but nothing like this.

1113
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:43,439
You're really lucky, because this place is...

1114
01:28:43,878 --> 01:28:47,041
Let me tell you.
You're really lucky, it's beautiful here.

1115
01:28:47,682 --> 01:28:49,081
My thoughts are so clear.

1116
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:53,285
Is this all weapons money,
or is this family money?

1117
01:28:54,989 --> 01:28:57,753
Gardens! He likes gardens, huh?

1118
01:28:57,992 --> 01:28:59,926
Do you guys ever do any gardening?

1119
01:29:00,028 --> 01:29:02,861
It's really relaxing.
It's amazing how much you can just...

1120
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:06,491
This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers. They...

1121
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:08,364
Okay, Eduardo,
you don't have to pull me around.

1122
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,700
You can just tell me
where you want me to go, okay?

1123
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:13,569
- This way, blondie.
- See? Now we're communicating.

1124
01:29:15,143 --> 01:29:17,543
I bet you're taking me someplace
safe and secure.

1125
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:19,636
Someplace special.
Antonio's special place.

1126
01:29:19,781 --> 01:29:21,715
Antonio has a special place?
That's so nice.

1127
01:29:21,816 --> 01:29:23,374
Everyone should have a special place.

1128
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:35,524
- Luis?
- Is there a problem, Eduardo?

1129
01:29:42,103 --> 01:29:45,095
- Hi, Roy.
- Hi, June. You're supposed to be home.

1130
01:29:45,206 --> 01:29:47,367
- You're supposed to be dead.
- I can explain.

1131
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:49,272
- You don't have to.
- I came here to get Simon.

1132
01:29:49,377 --> 01:29:52,175
- I just, you know, caught up with him.
- That's cool.

1133
01:29:57,419 --> 01:29:59,546
His name is Eduardo. Eduardo.

1134
01:30:02,424 --> 01:30:04,119
I need you to listen,
because when you wake up,

1135
01:30:04,225 --> 01:30:06,159
you're gonna call your boss
and you're gonna tell him

1136
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:09,287
that Roy Miller, that's me,
has the battery and escaped with the girl.

1137
01:30:09,397 --> 01:30:10,955
- You have the battery?
- Yeah.

1138
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:13,959
You tell him I'm coming for him.

1139
01:30:15,003 --> 01:30:15,992
- Yes.
- Okay.

1140
01:30:17,071 --> 01:30:18,060
Let's go.

1141
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,507
I'm worried about Simon.
I haven't seen him.

1142
01:30:21,776 --> 01:30:23,744
My tracker has been spotty.

1143
01:30:23,845 --> 01:30:26,541
Life with you is so exciting.
You excite me, Miller.

1144
01:30:26,648 --> 01:30:27,808
I took too long to get here.

1145
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:29,178
- 7:00.
- What?

1146
01:30:29,284 --> 01:30:30,444
7:00.

1147
01:30:39,394 --> 01:30:41,658
I think I feel like having sex.

1148
01:30:43,698 --> 01:30:45,325
I think we'd have really great sex.

1149
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:47,968
Did they give you something?

1150
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,166
You should hydrate.

1151
01:30:52,474 --> 01:30:53,463
Roy?

1152
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:00,771
Roy.

1153
01:31:05,987 --> 01:31:06,954
Roy?

1154
01:31:07,422 --> 01:31:08,480
June.

1155
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:15,596
June?

1156
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:19,062
You don't seem
very happy to see me, Roy.

1157
01:31:21,703 --> 01:31:22,692
What?

1158
01:31:23,505 --> 01:31:24,699
Not really.

1159
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:45,554
I am happy.

1160
01:31:54,569 --> 01:31:56,537
- So the red dot is us?
- No, we're yellow.

1161
01:31:56,638 --> 01:31:58,003
The red dot is Simon.

1162
01:31:58,573 --> 01:32:01,201
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1163
01:32:15,757 --> 01:32:17,122
- Air time.
- Air time?

1164
01:32:36,411 --> 01:32:39,778
He says his name is Roy Miller.
He says he has the battery.

1165
01:32:45,987 --> 01:32:47,045
Miller is here.

1166
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:51,452
There he is!

1167
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,291
There he is!

1168
01:32:54,796 --> 01:32:56,559
This way. Follow me!

1169
01:33:08,943 --> 01:33:09,967
Bulls?

1170
01:33:26,527 --> 01:33:28,256
- There's Fitz!
- I see him.

1171
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:21,778
- Take the guns.
- Okay.

1172
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:24,841
Here.

1173
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:27,480
- What next?
- Let them have it.

1174
01:34:51,512 --> 01:34:54,242
June Havens, you've got skills.

1175
01:34:56,684 --> 01:34:57,878
Let's go!

1176
01:35:11,265 --> 01:35:12,254
Go.

1177
01:35:36,724 --> 01:35:38,248
- See you down there.
- Are you sure?

1178
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:39,451
No.

1179
01:35:44,332 --> 01:35:45,458
Sorry.

1180
01:35:48,836 --> 01:35:50,360
- Get up.
- Okay.

1181
01:36:00,047 --> 01:36:01,412
Freeze right there, Roy!

1182
01:36:01,516 --> 01:36:02,540
Hey, Simon.

1183
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:04,049
Get down on your knees, now!

1184
01:36:04,152 --> 01:36:05,642
- Roy!
- Now! Now!

1185
01:36:06,187 --> 01:36:07,518
Put them in the water. In the water.

1186
01:36:08,689 --> 01:36:10,054
I just want the kid, Fitz.

1187
01:36:11,793 --> 01:36:12,817
Okay.

1188
01:36:12,927 --> 01:36:15,555
Well, I hope you brought what I want,
otherwise I'm gonna have to kill him.

1189
01:36:15,663 --> 01:36:17,654
And I swear to you, I'll do it.

1190
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:20,832
I believe you. Just like Wichita.

1191
01:36:21,202 --> 01:36:23,170
- I understand.
- Okay.

1192
01:36:23,337 --> 01:36:24,668
I'm just gonna get the battery.

1193
01:36:24,972 --> 01:36:26,599
- It's right here.
- Don't give it to him, Roy.

1194
01:36:26,707 --> 01:36:28,174
Please don't give it to him. No, no.

1195
01:36:28,276 --> 01:36:29,436
Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him.

1196
01:36:30,812 --> 01:36:32,109
Put it on the deck.

1197
01:36:32,213 --> 01:36:34,374
- Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him!
- Easy, easy.

1198
01:36:34,482 --> 01:36:35,574
Simon, it's okay.

1199
01:36:35,683 --> 01:36:36,843
Roy, don't give it to him!

1200
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:39,681
- Shut it! Stop it! Shut it!
- Roy!

1201
01:36:46,661 --> 01:36:48,856
Okay. Okay, I'll make another one.

1202
01:36:48,963 --> 01:36:50,191
- You don't understand.
- Simon, don't talk.

1203
01:36:50,298 --> 01:36:53,358
- I'll just make another one.
- Make another one?

1204
01:37:10,918 --> 01:37:12,351
Am I dying?

1205
01:37:13,654 --> 01:37:14,985
No, you fainted.

1206
01:37:16,457 --> 01:37:18,618
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

1207
01:37:18,726 --> 01:37:20,785
No, no. I've been trying to tell you...

1208
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,067
Why is it hot?

1209
01:37:27,602 --> 01:37:29,797
Because it's filled with power.

1210
01:37:30,137 --> 01:37:32,867
The battery... I messed up.
It's deteriorating.

1211
01:37:32,974 --> 01:37:34,839
I know. It's unstable.

1212
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,047
You're a smart guy, Simon.
I know you'll figure it out.

1213
01:37:54,929 --> 01:37:55,918
Oh, my glasses. Thank you.

1214
01:37:57,632 --> 01:37:58,656
Roy,

1215
01:37:58,766 --> 01:38:00,097
you're shot.

1216
01:38:02,436 --> 01:38:03,698
Get help.

1217
01:38:12,647 --> 01:38:13,671
Roy.

1218
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,315
You're beautiful, June Havens.

1219
01:38:33,534 --> 01:38:36,435
Stay with me. Roy, look at me.

1220
01:38:37,705 --> 01:38:38,797
Stay with me.

1221
01:38:42,243 --> 01:38:45,474
We're here now, Miller.
We got you. We got you.

1222
01:38:48,249 --> 01:38:49,773
- Charge at 360.
- June.

1223
01:38:49,884 --> 01:38:51,010
Clear!

1224
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:19,070
It's been a spectacular
couple of weeks, Miller.

1225
01:39:21,882 --> 01:39:24,043
It's good to see you, Isabel.

1226
01:39:27,021 --> 01:39:27,988
Hi, guys.

1227
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:31,321
You cleaned house, Roy.

1228
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,121
I have to thank you for that.

1229
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:38,395
I trusted the wrong man.

1230
01:39:39,066 --> 01:39:40,397
It happens.

1231
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:46,301
Simon's happy. He's got a new lab.

1232
01:39:48,342 --> 01:39:49,309
Where is June?

1233
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:52,036
I sent her home.

1234
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:56,579
She gets it.

1235
01:39:58,386 --> 01:40:00,946
She knows you two lead different lives
and she's moving on.

1236
01:40:01,455 --> 01:40:02,888
As should you.

1237
01:40:06,127 --> 01:40:07,992
You gave up those things.

1238
01:40:08,095 --> 01:40:11,861
You let go of who you were.
Family, friends, that's the deal.

1239
01:40:13,134 --> 01:40:14,931
Why are we still talking about this?

1240
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:17,460
Because the agency invested a lot in you.

1241
01:40:17,772 --> 01:40:21,139
And you're an asset
only as long as you stay focused.

1242
01:40:30,117 --> 01:40:31,084
You look good.

1243
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:34,019
Get some rest.

1244
01:40:34,121 --> 01:40:38,353
We got to transfer you to a secure facility
tomorrow. For your safety.

1245
01:41:05,986 --> 01:41:08,648
Nurse? What... What did you give me?

1246
01:41:10,624 --> 01:41:11,886
Brotine-zero.

1247
01:41:24,772 --> 01:41:25,898
Stay under there, Roy.

1248
01:41:27,374 --> 01:41:28,432
You're dead.

1249
01:41:31,579 --> 01:41:33,103
Make way, please.

1250
01:41:33,747 --> 01:41:35,305
Going to the mortuary.

1251
01:41:40,855 --> 01:41:43,517
Don't worry, Roy. I got this.

1252
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,593
It's time for a vacation.

1253
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:51,762
<i>Ride like the wind</i>

1254
01:41:54,435 --> 01:41:55,868
<i>And I've got</i>

1255
01:41:57,638 --> 01:42:01,802
<i>Such a long way to go</i>
<i>To make it to the border of Me</i>x<i>ico</i>

1256
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,820
Hey, there, sleepy head.

1257
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:51,819
What day is it?

1258
01:42:52,993 --> 01:42:54,187
Someday.

1259
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:57,363
Someday, Roy.

1260
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,467
What am I wearing?

1261
01:43:11,011 --> 01:43:12,035
A pair of shorts.

1262
01:43:14,148 --> 01:43:15,843
How did I get into shorts?

1263
01:43:17,718 --> 01:43:20,346
Roy, I've been trained to rebuild
a six-speed transmission

1264
01:43:20,454 --> 01:43:23,287
with nothing but a pair of pliers
and a crescent wrench.

1265
01:43:24,225 --> 01:43:26,819
I think I can get you into a pair
of shorts without looking.

1266
01:43:28,729 --> 01:43:30,526
I'm not saying that's what I did.

1267
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:34,091
You're both the navigator and the DJ.

1268
01:43:34,201 --> 01:43:36,635
And we have a long way to go
to Cape Horn.

1269
01:43:38,906 --> 01:43:42,205
With me, without me. With me,

1270
01:43:44,144 --> 01:43:45,475
without me.

1271
01:43:46,313 --> 01:43:47,337
With you.

1272
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:49,939
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

1273
01:43:50,884 --> 01:43:51,873
Yes, ma'am.

1274
01:44:17,978 --> 01:44:19,275
Oh, my God, Frank.

1275
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,871
What is this envelope
with tickets to Cape Horn?

1276
01:44:21,982 --> 01:44:23,040
What are you talking about?

1277
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:25,618
Did you order tickets to South America?

1278
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:28,085
Molly, I didn't order tickets to anywhere.

1279
01:44:28,188 --> 01:44:30,679
You don't know what you're typing
on that computer, Frank.

1280
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:32,656
- Molly...
- Then, we must've won them!

1281
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,853
<i>- Molly...</i>
<i>- Well, we're going, aren't we?</i>

1282
01:49:28,855 --> 01:49:29,822
