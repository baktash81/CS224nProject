1
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:10,349
Excuse us.

2
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,382
Jeez, get a room or something.

3
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:15,361
All right!

4
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:17,863
They're getting charged
for those.

5
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:19,991
Those books aren't cheap,
either.

6
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,365
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

7
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,864
<i>Hey, Gerry,
isn't that your bus?</i>

8
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,637
<i>Great way
to start the summer.</i>

9
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:33,510
Wait! Stop the bus! Stop!

10
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:36,880
<i>Ha ha ha!
Go, fat boy, go!</i>

11
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:40,717
<i># Everybody wants to live,
and they want to live #</i>

12
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:45,555
<i># And everybody wants to love,
and they want to love #</i>

13
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:49,255
<i># Everybody wants to be #</i>

14
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:52,891
<i># Closer to free #</i>

15
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,561
<i># Yeah, and yeah, yeah #</i>

16
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,900
<i># Everybody wants respect #</i>

17
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,405
<i>Foul ball! Strike two!</i>

18
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,168
<i>Little help here, son.</i>

19
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,335
<i>Come on. Toss it over.</i>

20
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:05,140
<i># Once in a while #</i>

21
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,543
Unh!

22
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:10,708
Give it another try, son.

23
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,218
Right here!

24
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,555
Over the fence, son!

25
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:21,221
Here!

26
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,819
Unh!

27
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,605
<i># Everybody one,
everybody two #</i>

28
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:38,577
<i># Everybody three #</i>

29
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:42,878
<i># Everybody needs to touch,
you know, now and then #</i>

30
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:47,876
<i># And everybody wants
a good, good friend #</i>

31
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:51,755
<i># Everybody wants to be
closer to free #</i>

32
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,919
Lemonade, lemonade.

33
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,131
<i># Everybody wants to live #</i>

34
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:02,829
<i># And they want to live #</i>

35
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,169
<i>Mom!</i>

36
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:11,371
<i># Everybody wants to be #</i>

37
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:14,403
<i># Closer to free #</i>

38
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,020
Hello?

39
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,523
<i>We're in here, honey.</i>

40
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:25,889
<i>Come on, son.</i>

41
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:29,594
Why is everybody home?

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,723
Did someone die?

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,390
Who's this?

44
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,296
Hi, Gerry. Roger Johnson.

45
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,365
Islanders fan, huh?

46
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,536
Team of the future, I say.

47
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,547
Yeah.
Whatever, I'm out of here.

48
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,549
Hold those horses, cowboy.

49
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,210
Mr. Johnson is your guest...

50
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:55,711
and he's here to talk to you
about a special summer camp.

51
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,316
A camp designed
just for you, Gerry.

52
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,223
Summer camp? No way!

53
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,854
I have plans for the summer.
I'm gonna hang out!

54
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,558
Come on, honey.
He's got a videotape.

55
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,328
Why don't
we take a little peek?

56
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,232
Why don't we not?

57
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,266
<i>Greetings, future campers.</i>

58
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:20,370
I'm Alice Bushkin,
and this is Harvey...

59
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,847
and we've been
the owners and operators...

60
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:26,943
of Camp Hope
for 32 wonderful summers.

61
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:30,319
Won't you join us for number 33?

62
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,655
Whoa!

63
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,030
Hmm.

64
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:44,961
<i>What's that?</i>

65
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,835
This is called "the Blob."

66
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,602
"The Blob," huh?

67
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,042
<i>You can go
as high as 15 feet.</i>

68
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,705
Wow.

69
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,949
Wow, go-karts.

70
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:02,716
<i>How many times
can you go on the go-karts?</i>

71
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,655
<i>As much as you want, Gerry.</i>

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,955
But be careful.
They can be addicting.

73
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:11,853
I'm only kidding.

74
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,991
Hi, I'm Pat Finley!

75
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,001
I've been coming here
since I was 10 years old.

76
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,332
Want to know why?

77
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,838
Because Camp Hope
is the fun way to lose weight.

78
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,840
It's a fat camp!

79
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,310
Are you crazy? No way!

80
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,541
I'm not going to a camp
with a bunch of fat-loads!

81
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,550
- Gerry!
- That's not kind, Gerry.

82
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,552
We are doing this
for your own good.

83
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:35,417
We gotta nip this thing
in the bud.

84
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:40,050
I'm fine.
This is a joke, right?

85
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,151
You're fatter than I am.
Why don't you go?

86
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:45,130
You show your father
some respect.

87
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:47,530
I think we should have
a little powwow...

88
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:51,731
and we will call you
with our decision later.

89
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,296
I'll give you my decision
right now.

90
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,001
I'm not going.

91
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:03,306
<i>This is
Captain Harris speaking...</i>

92
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,818
<i>...cruising altitude
of 29,000 feet.</i>

93
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,118
<i>Those of you on the left side
of the aircraft...</i>

94
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:12,147
<i>have a nice view of
the Blue Ridge Mountains.</i>

95
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:14,216
Hey, there, Mr. Rainy Day.

96
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,558
I've got a little surprise
for you.

97
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:18,461
Hmm?

98
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,794
Huh?

99
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,231
<i>...but in your seats...</i>

100
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,827
<i>we request that you keep
your seat belts fastened.</i>

101
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,701
Cutie.

102
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:28,138
Great.

103
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,342
Headed to fat camp?

104
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:39,317
No. Why do you say that?

105
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:42,321
Because you're fat.
Is that your dad?

106
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:46,223
No. Why do you say that?

107
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,319
Because he's fat, too.

108
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,023
Well, so are you.

109
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,860
I know. That's why
I'm going to fat camp.

110
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,766
- I'm Roy.
- I'm Gerry.

111
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,832
I guess I'm going.

112
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,031
I knew it!

113
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,630
And that's your dad, too,
isn't it?

114
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:04,302
- Hell no!
- You'll love camp, man.

115
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,503
Camp is awesome.

116
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:08,479
No one picks on you because
you're not the fat kid.

117
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,948
Everybody's the fat kid.

118
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:14,248
Stick with me, Gerry,
because I'm the man.

119
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,815
Mr. Bushkin tells the scariest
ghost stories you ever heard.

120
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,821
Yes, have no fear,
I have returned.

121
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,990
I got a rookie here,
and his name's Gerry...

122
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,023
so show him
the same amount of respect...

123
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,592
that you show me--none.

124
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,179
Excuse me!

125
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,184
I'm looking for
several portly adolescents.

126
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,311
That's us.
You're looking good, Pat.

127
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:50,845
Tell me something
I don't know.

128
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,324
Let's load her up!

129
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,452
Hey, hey!
How you doing, guys?

130
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,190
- Phillip, how are you?
- This is Gerry.

131
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,027
Hey, Gerry.
I'm Pat Finley.

132
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,795
I'm sure you recognize me
from my work...

133
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,632
in the Camp Hope
promotional video.

134
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,331
We have
a little tradition, Gerry.

135
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,306
The new guy drives to camp.
Right, guys?

136
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:11,367
Keep it under 70.
We got some weird local cops.

137
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,843
You drive a stick, right?

138
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:14,846
No, but I can try.

139
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,814
No, no, no.
Sorry, cannot risk it.

140
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,818
Come here a second.
I gotta ask you something.

141
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:21,683
Something very serious.

142
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:26,150
Are you ready for the best
damn summer of your life?

143
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:28,092
Yeah!

144
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,322
<i>Is everybody gonna
behave themselves this summer?</i>

145
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,594
<i>- No!
- Good! That's what I expect!</i>

146
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:37,329
<i>Can't do it.
Gotta get back to the camp!</i>

147
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,497
<i>- Pull over, please!
- Don't bug me!</i>

148
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:42,371
<i>- All right!
- Yeah!</i>

149
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,672
<i>Ha ha!
Psyched you out!</i>

150
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,042
<i>- You stink, Pat!
- That's not funny!</i>

151
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,070
<i>I thought that was
pretty amusing, myself.</i>

152
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,346
<i>Garner, where you from?</i>

153
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,411
<i>- Long Island.
- Never heard of it.</i>

154
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:02,622
<i>Sam, don't lean
your head out the window.</i>

155
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,629
<i>We lost six kids
like that last summer.</i>

156
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,460
<i>I'm not going
to pick up your head.</i>

157
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,467
<i>I don't need it anyway!</i>

158
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:12,801
<i>Camp Hope, everybody!
Best place on earth!</i>

159
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:18,708
<i>Camp Hope!
Camp Hope! Camp Hope!</i>

160
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:21,372
Camp Hope!
Camp Hope! Camp Hope!

161
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,092
Mm-hmm.

162
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:45,297
All right, now in
a nice, orderly fashion...

163
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,634
get off my bus!

164
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:49,604
<i>It's stuck!</i>

165
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:52,338
<i>I don't know what to do!
It's stuck!</i>

166
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:03,849
- Heads up!
- Unh!

167
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:05,447
<i>Here's another one!</i>

168
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,788
Hey, bony butt.

169
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,850
How was your year,
chicken legs?

170
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,486
It's not funny, guys.

171
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,928
Why are they teasing him?

172
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,795
That's a counselor named Tim.

173
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,959
He used to be one of us,
but then he lost weight...

174
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,628
so we give him
a hard time about it.

175
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,195
- He's cool, though.
- Let's hear it.

176
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,969
Tim, what happened,
did you have a baby?

177
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:25,499
<i>That's funny.</i>

178
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:28,741
Just because I got these
great, skinny buns of steel.

179
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,373
Whoo! Look at that--
all tight and toned.

180
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,043
Bet you wish they were yours.

181
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,881
Don't you?
Take a look, boys!

182
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,716
The envy of the entire camp--

183
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:39,918
Up there is the bald eagle,
which is a single breed...

184
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:45,226
- Hi.
- Hi.

185
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,858
I'm Julie, the new nurse.

186
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,232
Pat.

187
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,134
Pat, I'm a little lost.

188
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,038
Can you tell me
where the infirmary is?

189
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:01,646
<i>Well, let's see...</i>

190
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,411
Uh...No.

191
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:09,979
Oh, well...I'll find it.

192
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,421
Nice to meet you.

193
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,653
Pat, you've been coming here
since you were ten...

194
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,360
and you don't know
where the infirmary is?

195
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,892
I panicked.

196
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:27,030
What are we gonna do
with you, man?

197
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,199
Help me with these bags,
all right?

198
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,708
- Garner.
- Yeah?

199
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:32,370
Let's get working
on this trunk.

200
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:33,708
OK.

201
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,214
- You got a girlfriend?
- Oh, no.

202
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:39,046
So you broke up with her
before the summer...

203
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:40,881
so you could be free
to play the field, huh?

204
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,547
Yeah,
you gotta play the field.

205
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,387
Yeah, I break up with
my girlfriend every summer.

206
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,858
You gotta be free, you know?

207
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,383
All right, put it down.

208
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,986
This is it, Gerry.

209
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,692
I've been the counselor
in here for 10 years.

210
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,063
I hope you're ready.

211
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,898
You'll be hanging with
some pretty cool cats.

212
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:01,804
Josh, how you doing, man?

213
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,171
Roy.

214
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:07,702
I just saw the new nurse,
and she's very attractive.

215
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,545
This pleases me.

216
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,082
<i>Here it is!</i>

217
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:18,112
Ah, Chez Chipmunk--
my summer home.

218
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,624
What do we got here?

219
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:23,560
Gerry, this is Josh,
camp legend.

220
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,620
Aye-aye, Captain, sir.

221
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:27,427
All present and accounted for,
Captain, sir.

222
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,957
What's the matter?
You're not a captain?

223
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,526
No.

224
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,504
Then maybe you
should lose the wings.

225
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:37,475
Welcome to
the Chipmunk bunk, Captain--

226
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,443
the best bunk
in the entire camp.

227
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:40,877
<i>Yep! Sure is.</i>

228
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:44,280
You guys aren't gonna call me
Captain all summer, are you?

229
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:46,079
Yes, sir, Captain!

230
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,018
Captain, looks like
you're all set here.

231
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,486
I gotta take care of
some other stuff.

232
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,352
You're the best, Pat.

233
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,153
All right, take it easy.

234
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:56,389
All right, Gerry, over here
is your brand-new bunk.

235
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:57,895
Don't tell anybody...

236
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,833
but I snuck in some Oreos
for emergencies.

237
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:05,336
That was very sneaky of you.

238
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,136
Chipmunks!
Download, now!

239
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,318
<i>New kid! Yo!</i>

240
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,653
Come on over here!

241
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:28,854
Get these salamis off my back.
They really hurt.

242
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,859
Phillip, look at this.

243
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,528
That's pretty nice, Nicholas...

244
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:40,561
but look at this.

245
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,271
Yes!

246
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:54,049
Crikey!

247
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:56,850
I knew it was too hot
in that bus.

248
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,821
This is definitely not sanitary.

249
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:05,921
Everyone!
Grab a taste of England, guys!

250
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:02,314
You'll love the Bushkins.

251
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:03,820
Every year
they surprise us...

252
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,322
with something cool
for the camp.

253
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:06,823
Last year
they got us the Blob...

254
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,554
and this year I hear
they're getting us jet skis.

255
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:12,358
- Jet skis!
- Here they come.

256
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,332
- You'll love these people.
- Really?

257
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,342
Greetings, campers.

258
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:29,540
Hi! Hi! Hiya!

259
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,844
You'll get it.

260
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:35,341
That's the greatest sound
I've heard in a long time.

261
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:40,517
Harvey and I are saddened
and dismayed to announce...

262
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:44,358
that we are no longer
the owners of Camp Hope.

263
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,420
- What?
- What's going on?

264
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:47,863
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,265
Sometimes in life...

266
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,828
things don't work out
the way you planned...

267
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,363
and in those situations,
sometimes...

268
00:15:57,408 --> 00:16:01,504
you file Chapter 9
bankruptcy--Jesus!

269
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:05,915
We worked our whole life,
and what do we have to show?

270
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,817
Nothing! Nothing!

271
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:10,548
Harvey, please stop.

272
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,385
What?

273
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:17,793
OK, kids, out with the old,
and in with the new.

274
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:21,059
<i>It won't be the same
without them.</i>

275
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:24,898
Your new owner will introduce
himself in a minute.

276
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:27,268
But you know what I would like?

277
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:31,071
Please, could you give us
just one more...

278
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:36,205
Camp Hope "Hi, hi, hiya"?

279
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,977
Hiya.

280
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,042
God bless all of you.

281
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,423
<i>We love you, Harvey!</i>

282
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,860
<i>He's kidding, guys.
He's gotta be.</i>

283
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,955
One word of advice.

284
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:57,490
Never let anyone
sign your checks!

285
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:58,934
Harvey, please.

286
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,939
<i>You can't leave.
We need you.</i>

287
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:04,567
<i>Come back.</i>

288
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,975
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,996
<i>Now, it's time to meet
your new owner and operator.</i>

290
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,726
<i>Tony Perkis is a man
who believes in you.</i>

291
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,234
<i>His life is dedicated
to saying things like...</i>

292
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:33,396
<i>"Yes!" and
"You better believe it!"</i>

293
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,804
<i>Entrepreneur, a motivator,
and a new friend...</i>

294
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:41,039
<i>may I introduce
Tony Perkis!</i>

295
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:48,340
Mm. Can you smell it?

296
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,648
<i>What? No.</i>

297
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:52,815
There's a life force
in here tonight.

298
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:55,121
Do you feel it? Hmm?

299
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,219
<i>I look around this room...</i>

300
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:01,698
and I see potential.

301
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:07,737
I see the future chairman
of a Fortune 500 company.

302
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,433
I see a famous rap artist.

303
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:17,110
I see the president of
the United States of America.

304
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,082
He's from England.

305
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:21,084
Being an only child...

306
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:24,087
educated entirely by
private tutors my whole life...

307
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,884
I'm looking forward
to interacting...

308
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:27,686
with children
for the first time.

309
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,556
I'm going to teach you...

310
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,426
and I bet you might teach me
a little something, also.

311
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,162
Now, those of you from
western Pennsylvania...

312
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,691
probably know my father,
Tony Perkis Senior...

313
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:40,499
the Lighting Fixture King.

314
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,472
All the lights you'll see
around this camp...

315
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,440
have been donated by him.

316
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,349
But I'm gonna do
old Dad one better.

317
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:54,908
I'm not gonna give you a light.

318
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,921
I'm gonna show you the light!

319
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:59,889
And to help me do it...

320
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:02,154
let's meet the new staff
of Camp Hope.

321
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:04,423
Team Perkis!

322
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:07,795
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

323
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,626
Ha! Ha! Ha!

324
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,865
<i>All right!
Stand proud, boys!</i>

325
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,965
Hey, who wants to be
on TV, huh?

326
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,737
That's Kenny the cameraman.

327
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,301
Hey, there, Kenny!

328
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,245
If all goes
according to plan...

329
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,475
we're gonna turn this summer
into the number-one...

330
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,814
weight-loss infomercial
in the country!

331
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,149
You're kidding.

332
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:31,381
Kids, at age 12...

333
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,823
I weighed 319 pounds.

334
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,590
I had bad skin,
low self-esteem...

335
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,893
and no self-respect.

336
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:46,062
Now...I eat success
for breakfast!

337
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,163
- With skim milk.
- Ugh.

338
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,673
Pounds are gonna fly...

339
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,838
and fat is
outta here, mister!

340
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,746
And we are gonna do it together!

341
00:19:57,782 --> 00:19:59,716
Oh, my God.

342
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,810
Ha! Haaa...

343
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,445
Aah!

344
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:08,415
<i>I want to go home!</i>

345
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,661
The Bushkins always put me
in the Chipmunk bunk.

346
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,132
I've been here for 10 years.

347
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,635
According
to my information...

348
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,466
you have been reassigned
to the big house.

349
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:22,734
I don't think Tony would mind
if we switched back.

350
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:26,470
That would make me
feel very uncomfortable.

351
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,774
I'm gonna talk to Tony.

352
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,908
Please do.
Let me get your bag.

353
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,118
Unh!

354
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,156
Good-bye now.

355
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,664
Enjoy your summer.

356
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,396
Hello!

357
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:55,098
I am your new friend
and counselor!

358
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:59,098
Please enjoy your new
Perkis system uniforms.

359
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:01,668
Your families will be
billed automatically.

360
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,839
Now, let's play the fun game...

361
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,974
that helps us learn
each other's names.

362
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,813
We already know
each other's names.

363
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,614
Silence!

364
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:15,823
You--please announce
everyone's name.

365
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:20,159
OK. That's Roy.
That's Josh.

366
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,166
Sam. That's Cody.
That's Nicholas.

367
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,792
That's Michael. That's Phil.

368
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:27,463
And I am Lars.

369
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,940
"Lars"?
What kind of name is that?

370
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:32,602
Where are you from?

371
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:38,381
Far away.

372
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:45,283
I must inform you I have
a severely deviated septum.

373
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,755
When I sleep at night...

374
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,883
I make
a very disturbing sound.

375
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:51,224
Don't be alarmed.
I am fine.

376
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:54,197
Now, go to sleep.

377
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:18,853
Oh, no. I'm dead.

378
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,618
I'm in Heaven.

379
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,853
Roy? Roy.

380
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,690
What's going on?

381
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:26,525
<i>Wake up, campers.</i>

382
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:28,428
<i>It's a glorious morning.</i>

383
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,524
<i>Today is Evaluation Day.</i>

384
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,865
<i>The key word here
is "value."</i>

385
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:34,871
<i>Do you have any? Not yet.</i>

386
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:36,372
<i>But by the end of the summer...</i>

387
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:38,967
<i>this camp will be
filled with skinny winners!</i>

388
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,944
"Skinny weiners"?
You hear that, guys?

389
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,378
Do you think I'm crazy?

390
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:45,882
I'm not crazy.
I just believe in you.

391
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,374
And I believe in you.
Call and order now.

392
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,151
All right,
let's go get our hands dirty.

393
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,657
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

394
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:59,894
Glide! Stride!

395
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,160
<i>Get your butt off the ground!</i>

396
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:05,532
<i>Concentrate!
Find your center.</i>

397
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:06,763
<i># Freak out! #</i>

398
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,832
<i>Stride! Glide!</i>

399
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:17,677
<i># Listen to us,
I'm sure you'll be amazed #</i>

400
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,706
Stride!

401
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,310
I'm feeling skinny, Tony.

402
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:24,321
<i>So am I!</i>

403
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,653
Aah!

404
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,521
We keep this up,
I see no reason...

405
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,084
why we can't beat Camp MVP
in the Apache Relay.

406
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:33,358
What's an Apache Relay?

407
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:36,992
It's a dumb inter-camp event
where those jocks at MVP...

408
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:40,026
come over here and kick
our butts every year.

409
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,595
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

410
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:45,870
Only film the ones
that are standing, Kenneth.

411
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:47,638
Glide!

412
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,882
141 pounds, Gerry Garner.

413
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,044
Weight-loss goal, 17 pounds.

414
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,850
Please step down. Next!

415
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:05,056
Very fat, I see. 160 pounds.

416
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,154
Weight-loss goal, 23 pounds.

417
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,962
Ooh. Oh, my!

418
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:14,300
Congratulations, Mr. Simms.

419
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,499
You are the fattest boy in camp.

420
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,338
All right,
let's hear it for Simms.

421
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,341
Get down!

422
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,848
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

423
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,647
<i># All that pressure
got you down #</i>

424
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:30,277
Five and a quarter.

425
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,346
<i># Has your head
spinning all around #</i>

426
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,051
<i># Feel the rhythm #</i>

427
00:24:35,092 --> 00:24:37,617
<i># Chant the rhyme,
come on along #</i>

428
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:38,855
<i>Big smile.</i>

429
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,454
<i># And have a real good time #</i>

430
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:42,863
<i>Turn around to your side.</i>

431
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,891
Please put your fat finger down!

432
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,129
<i># Freak out! #</i>

433
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,365
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

434
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,670
You've broken my camera!

435
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,676
No, no, no,
you listen to me.

436
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,008
If I don't get a 50,000 unit
pre-sale on this video...

437
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,877
my ass is wheat grass!

438
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,780
Just hang on a second.

439
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:02,285
Attention campers,
tonight's lecture is...

440
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,914
"Liposuction:
Option or Obsession."

441
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:09,221
Watch out for Salami Sam!

442
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,592
<i>Whoa!</i>

443
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:15,120
Hey, don't pee in the water!

444
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:18,157
Don't drink the water.
He peed in it!

445
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:26,873
- Nurse Julie!
- Whoa!

446
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,572
Excuse me, Nurse Julie.

447
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,343
I'm having a problem
with my sciatic nerve.

448
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:35,977
Perhaps later you could give me
a deep-tissue massage.

449
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:38,146
I'll pencil you in.

450
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,486
Lars, shouldn't you be
watching the kids?

451
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,152
Don't worry, I have them
on the body system.

452
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:44,490
"Body system"?

453
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:46,359
Yeah, have a look.

454
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,969
Body!

455
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:59,538
- Body!
- Body!

456
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,806
"Buddy." Heh heh.

457
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:06,680
You're obviously
a very powerful man, Lars.

458
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:08,207
Would you excuse me?

459
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:14,189
Yes, but with much difficulty!

460
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:21,493
Buddy!

461
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:24,330
All right, Gerry, it's your bat.

462
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,302
Nicholas, you know what to do.

463
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,997
Is this kind of like cricket?

464
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,505
It's not kind of like cricket.

465
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,338
It is cricket.
Just with a different name.

466
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:34,674
MVPers are almost here.
Are the boys ready?

467
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:37,509
Yeah. Tony, I really need
to talk to you about this.

468
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,345
Our kids will get
their butts handed to them.

469
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,873
Why don't we hold off on this?

470
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:44,012
Thank you for telling me
how to run my camp.

471
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:45,521
That I bought.

472
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:49,287
This won't help those kids
get any better at sports!

473
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:51,021
We're not teaching them
about sports!

474
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,995
We're teaching them about life!

475
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,793
Life.

476
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:00,501
<i>Look!</i>

477
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:03,472
<i>Come on, let's go!
Let's do it!</i>

478
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:07,204
Go, go, go!

479
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:09,007
I'm not so good at sports.

480
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,105
Oh, yeah,
and I'm Deion Sanders.

481
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:13,343
<i>We're dead, guys.</i>

482
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,944
All right, I want to see
some hustle out there!

483
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:19,319
- Hey, Chris.
- Pat, how you doing?

484
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:21,153
See you got a promotion.

485
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:24,319
Yeah. Listen, Chris,
over the years...

486
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,828
you guys have whooped us
pretty good.

487
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,887
How about taking it easy
on my guys this year?

488
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,991
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

489
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,661
MVP campers
are trained to compete...

490
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,330
at the highest level
at all times.

491
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:36,635
We wouldn't
want to confuse them.

492
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,368
Looking good, Pat.

493
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,205
All right,
let's work it around!

494
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:41,505
Come on, men!

495
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:43,274
Let's hit the field
and let the fates decide.

496
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,746
There we go--
good plan, all right!

497
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,510
There you go!
Eye of the tiger!

498
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,017
Did you eat your
Wheaties today, Phillip?

499
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:49,678
I hope to God
you ate your Wheaties.

500
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,017
Simms, way to hustle.

501
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:52,544
Like a rocket--
there you go.

502
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,051
<i>Pat Finley, please report...</i>

503
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,857
<i>to the men's toilet
immediately.</i>

504
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:02,854
<i>Bring a mop
and a plunger...now!</i>

505
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,665
<i>All right,
who's up first? Let's go!</i>

506
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:11,874
Ohh, my arm!

507
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:14,173
Oh, my knee!

508
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,179
Ohh, my--

509
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:24,015
<i># Even the best gets beat
sometimes, baby #</i>

510
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:25,646
<i>Come on, lardo!</i>

511
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:29,216
Tim, take me out, please!

512
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,057
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

513
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:34,393
- Ohh!
- Out!

514
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:35,921
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

515
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,526
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

516
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:40,559
<i>Beautiful!</i>

517
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,595
Can I go to the nurse?

518
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,869
Yeah, OK, Phillip.

519
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:48,571
Just wait till
someone comes back, OK?

520
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:52,248
Ow, my arm.

521
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,214
Cody, what on earth
is going on out there?

522
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:59,552
We're Perkisizing.

523
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:04,924
Strike!

524
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:07,054
<i>Hey, batter, batter, batter.</i>

525
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:10,964
<i># Even the experts miss
sometimes #</i>

526
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,559
Strike!

527
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:14,001
Strike three!

528
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:16,800
Strike!

529
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,502
Nice swing,
you fat towboat. Ha!

530
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:21,534
Is that all you've got?

531
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:22,738
Uhh!

532
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:25,513
<i>That's foul!</i>

533
00:29:27,718 --> 00:29:30,118
Doh!

534
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:34,814
<i>All right, next batter.
Let's go, son.</i>

535
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,617
- Uhh!
- Look out!

536
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:41,130
- Ow!
- Sorry!

537
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,358
You can do it.

538
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,923
Keep your eyes on the bat...

539
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,730
put it in the pocket...

540
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:46,929
swing harder...

541
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,904
I have no idea
what I'm saying.

542
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:51,100
Ohh!

543
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,802
You OK?

544
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,978
There goes your perfect game.
Come on!

545
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,947
Calm down.

546
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:00,779
Let's go!
Take your base, you big baby!

547
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:01,977
You're holding up the game!

548
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:05,010
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

549
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,546
<i>He ain't hurt.
Suck it up, Gerry!</i>

550
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:10,151
Aww, look,
the poor baby's gonna cry.

551
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:12,161
Don't blubber, chubber!
Ha ha.

552
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,389
Uhh!

553
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:19,702
Don't mess with us.

554
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,269
<i>No, man, that's my bed!</i>

555
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,702
I don't enjoy
this part of the job.

556
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:32,305
But it's vital to the success
of the Perkis system...

557
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,410
that we remove all temptation...

558
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,413
<i>Ohh!</i>

559
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:41,981
...from your lives. Here.

560
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,821
<i>Dispose of that, Lars.</i>

561
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:46,992
What?

562
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,894
I'm still your friend.

563
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,523
Come on, give me a hug.

564
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,499
Hmm?

565
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,832
Hmm.

566
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:57,566
Come on.

567
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:05,674
Tony believes in you.

568
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:12,218
Looks like my man's packing.

569
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,158
Drop back, son.

570
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,894
<i>Oh, Tony.</i>

571
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,336
Sir!
I was a Chipmunk last year.

572
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:31,932
Look.

573
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,134
Dawson,
what are you doing, man?

574
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:37,439
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

575
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,914
Who would like to own up
to this treasure trove?

576
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:42,474
Whose wonderful candies
are these?

577
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:45,043
Oh, look. A deli meat.

578
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:48,948
You...come here.

579
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,824
Yes, you. Come here.

580
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,590
Don't be frightened.
Just come here.

581
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,756
- I.D. cards.
- Yes, Tony.

582
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:57,459
Let's see.

583
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,533
"Garner, Gerald.
141 pounds. Age 11."

584
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:09,976
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

585
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,572
Well...

586
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,743
But I bet you might be able
to tell me who did?

587
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:20,287
Anyone who brings candy
into this camp...

588
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:21,914
is not your friend.

589
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:25,051
He is a destroyer.

590
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:28,996
Do you understand that,
Gerald Garner?

591
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,363
Do you?

592
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,336
I'm sure your father...

593
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,862
Maury Garner,
wouldn't want to hear...

594
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:41,399
that his son is a destroyer,
would he?

595
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:42,672
I don't think so.

596
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,203
Enough. All right.

597
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,374
I'll tell you
whose candy it is.

598
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,941
- Don't do it, Josh!
- Shh! Let the man speak.

599
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,476
The candy belongs
to Seymour Butts.

600
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:57,515
Seymour Butts?
Who's Seymour Butts?

601
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,221
Who's Seymour Butts?!

602
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:01,957
Nobody's seen more butts
than you, Uncle Tony!

603
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:10,397
You picked the wrong man
to mess with.

604
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:13,135
<i>Ooh.</i>

605
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,268
I didn't know
I was messing with a man!

606
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:21,642
Ha ha ha ha ha!
We have a comedian!

607
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,487
Hey, I like comedians.

608
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:29,423
Perhaps I can book you
on a tour.

609
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,221
<i>You the man, Josh!</i>

610
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,901
<i>Good morning, campers.</i>

611
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,305
<i>Joshua Birnbaum
is no longer with us.</i>

612
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:47,707
<i>His bed is now available.</i>

613
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:50,211
Josh is all right,
isn't he?

614
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:53,807
Man, I hope so...
wherever he is.

615
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,950
Sam, did you hear about Josh?

616
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:02,446
Sorry to hear about
your little friend Josh.

617
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,891
Hey, Gerry. I found out
the truth about Josh.

618
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:06,588
I heard that
they kicked him out...

619
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,223
and his parents were so mad,
they wouldn't let him come home.

620
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,393
They left him at a bus stop
all alone at midnight.

621
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:15,494
Well, he's dead.

622
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:16,732
He pulled a knife on Tony...

623
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,570
and he's locked up in
a juvenile delinquent center.

624
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,269
Now he's living
in the park in New York...

625
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,335
with a guy who has no legs.

626
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,539
No way.

627
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,810
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

628
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,950
<i>Dear Grandma...</i>

629
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,921
<i>someone once said
"War is hell."</i>

630
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:36,424
<i>They've never been
to fat camp.</i>

631
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,154
<i>I knew
the food would be bad...</i>

632
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,788
<i>but even worse...</i>

633
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:46,262
<i>today he killed the Blob.</i>

634
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:49,567
<i>As for the go-karts...</i>

635
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:52,267
<i>may they rest in pieces.</i>

636
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,673
<i>I'm writing you...</i>

637
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,700
<i>because nobody else
seemed to care.</i>

638
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:58,645
I did not send you
to go-kart camp.

639
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:02,044
Attention, campers...

640
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:05,850
lunch has been canceled today
due to lack of hustle.

641
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:07,219
Deal with it.

642
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:09,451
<i>Tony Perkis
tries to lead by example.</i>

643
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:12,460
This is the eighteenth level
of the Perkis system.

644
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:14,792
You'll all be doing this
by Labor Day!

645
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,162
All right, do it to it, Lars!

646
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,962
It's my honor, Tony!

647
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,998
- Ohh!
- Crazy!

648
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,734
<i>But we're afraid to follow.</i>

649
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,971
I know each and every one of you
because I was you.

650
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:35,882
<i>Once a day, the kids
from Camp MVP drive by...</i>

651
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,249
<i>and make fun of us.</i>

652
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:41,222
You stink! You stink!
You stink!

653
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,792
Good one!

654
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:49,127
<i>At night,
they vandalize our camp.</i>

655
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,567
<i>At least Josh got out...</i>

656
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:02,304
<i>where there's food.</i>

657
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:05,575
<i>We have to resort
to more desperate measures.</i>

658
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:07,707
Let's get 'em!

659
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,247
I want meat!

660
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:14,984
I'll save something for you!

661
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:17,254
<i>Tony's arranged a dance
with the girls' camp...</i>

662
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:21,320
<i>so he can humiliate us
into losing weight.</i>

663
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:23,092
<i>Pray for me, Grandma.</i>

664
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:24,622
<i>Love, Gerry.</i>

665
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:31,302
<i># S-a-t-u-r-d-a-y
night #</i>

666
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:41,911
<i># S-a-t-u-r-d-a-y,
night #</i>

667
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,944
<i># Gonna keep on dancin'
to the rock 'n' roll #</i>

668
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:47,512
<i># On Saturday night #</i>

669
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:49,717
<i># Saturday night #</i>

670
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:52,454
<i># Dancin' to the rhythm

671
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:55,122
<i># On Saturday night... #</i>

672
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:57,394
Let's just get out of here.

673
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:00,300
We can't, man.
They're guarding the door.

674
00:37:00,336 --> 00:37:02,930
<i># I--I--I--I got a date #</i>

675
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,462
Rock 'n' roll.

676
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,736
<i># At the good old
rock 'n' roll road show #</i>

677
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:10,973
Sugar-free punch.
This bites.

678
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:14,505
How much more
are they gonna subject us to?

679
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,415
Why don't those guys
just lose weight?

680
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:19,012
Why don't you show them
how to throw up after meals?

681
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:20,851
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

682
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,117
You guys, stop it.

683
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,121
Team Jerkis strikes again, huh?

684
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:31,293
Do you think he could've
possibly planned...

685
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,324
for it to be this bad?

686
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:34,996
<i>Yes.</i>

687
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,505
I have some friends
in Child Welfare.

688
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,134
Tony must be doing something
illegal around here.

689
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,474
Maybe I should give them a call.

690
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,039
- Great.
- This really bites!

691
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:51,678
Would you like to have
some of this...punch?

692
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,449
Yeah, thanks.

693
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:57,189
<i># I believe in miracles #</i>

694
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:59,524
Did you catch Lars's outfit?

695
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:00,994
<i># Since you came along #</i>

Yo, check this out.

698
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:14,369
Jeez, she's coming over!

699
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,139
I think she's looking at me.

700
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,047
Do you know
where the bathroom is?

701
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,696
Ouch.

702
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,927
That was brutal.

703
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,026
They're young, you know?

704
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,038
Still afraid of girls.

705
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,596
Poor guys.

706
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,632
So, do you want to dance?

707
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:49,667
Um, uh...

708
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:53,044
No, I have
a bad...sprained...

709
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,175
Excuse me. Tim?

710
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:56,445
<i># You sexy thing #</i>

711
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:58,680
OK.

712
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,657
This is really boring.

713
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:07,389
This has got to end.

714
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:13,426
<i># Oh-oh-oh, yeah #</i>

715
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:15,937
Excuse me, guys.

716
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:18,201
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

717
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,300
<i># And I won't work
for nobody but you #</i>

718
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:22,503
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

719
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:25,069
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

720
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:28,846
Tim's blown a microchip!

721
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,722
Tim! Tim!
What are you doing?

722
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:36,485
Saving the dance. Come on.

723
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:39,358
The girls will see
how much fun we're having...

724
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:41,157
and then everyone will join in!

725
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,424
That's weird, Tim.

726
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,056
Maybe it is,
Reverend No-Fun...

727
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,589
but I am saving the dance.

728
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,660
Stand back and watch the magic!
Whoo!

729
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:51,867
<i># I-I-I'm just
a love machine #</i>

730
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,341
<i># And I won't work
for nobody but you #</i>

731
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,071
<i># Ohh, yeah #</i>

732
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:58,608
Yeah!

733
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,706
Oh, yeah!
Get down to the funk!

734
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,977
Don't you see how much fun
we're having?

735
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,147
Join in!
It'll be contagious!

736
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:08,713
It's called boogie fever!

737
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:11,123
<i>- Whoo!
- That's it!</i>

738
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,094
Nicholas, dance with me.

739
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,323
Oh, yes!

740
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:18,265
Shake a leg!
Let's go!

741
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,861
<i># And I won't work
for nobody but you #</i>

742
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:25,101
Maybe we should go out there.
It's just dancing.

743
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,665
OK. I guess
I can stand this song.

744
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,233
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

745
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:31,610
<i># A huggin' kissin' fiend #</i>

746
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,209
Yes.

747
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:35,841
Yes!

748
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:37,977
Excuse me.

749
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,250
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

750
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:42,223
Yes, you may.

751
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:45,249
<i># That you have got to use #</i>

752
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:48,593
<i># If you look into my file #</i>

753
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,827
<i># I am sure
you can find out how #</i>

754
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,359
<i># To turn me on,
just set my dial #</i>

755
00:40:55,404 --> 00:40:57,838
<i># And let me love you
for a little while #</i>

756
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:01,809
<i># Ooh-ooh, I-I-I'm just
a love machine #</i>

757
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:04,835
<i># And I won't work
for nobody but you #</i>

758
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,177
<i># Ooh, yeah #</i>

759
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,739
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

760
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,546
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

761
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,815
<i># A huggin' kissin' fiend #</i>

762
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,549
<i># La la-la-la-la #</i>

763
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,285
<i># La-la-la-la #</i>

764
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:17,519

00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,958

00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,791
<i># La la-la-la-la #</i>

767
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,194
<i># La-la-la-la #</i>

768
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,102
All right, dance is over!

769
00:41:29,137 --> 00:41:31,002
Everybody go home!

770
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,529
Thank you for coming,
ladies.

771
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:33,836
<i>You ruin everything!</i>

772
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,775
Buses are waiting
over there.

773
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,473
Thank you.
I appreciate your efforts.

774
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,572
I know this hasn't been easy.

775
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:47,211
<i>He was nice, too.</i>

776
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:51,117
Put the fruit trays away.

777
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,491
The insects will be out soon.

778
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,945
Hey.

779
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:15,711
How about a ride out of here?

780
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:21,922
Did this place
always stink this much?

781
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,589
No, Gerry.

782
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,892
This place used to stink
very little.

783
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,899
In fact...

784
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,798
it didn't stink at all.

785
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,826
Well, it does now.

786
00:42:38,073 --> 00:42:43,807
I thought at least I'd be able
to ride the go-karts.

787
00:42:43,845 --> 00:42:46,336
I've never ridden one.

788
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:50,784
You really like them?

789
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:55,488
I'm so slow.

790
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:57,788
It would've been cool
to go fast.

791
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:03,631
Really fly, you know?

792
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,498
I thought I'd be good at it.

793
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,432
Really?

794
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,272
That's interesting.

795
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,444
Think you'd be able to handle
those hairpin turns?

796
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:22,473
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

797
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,849
Think you'd be able to handle
That powerful engine?

798
00:43:24,886 --> 00:43:26,786
Let's see what you got, Garner.
Come on!

799
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:28,289
Whoo!

800
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:30,450
Lean into it!
That's right!

801
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,187
So, how did you learn
how to drive go-karts?

802
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:38,722
Mowed a lot of lawns, Gerry!

803
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:41,065
Avoid the obstacles!
Excellent! Sharp turn!

804
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,502
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

805
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,107
Come on, faster!

806
00:43:47,142 --> 00:43:49,804
Faster, faster, yeah.

807
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,279
No problem.

808
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:54,077
How are you
on your jumps, huh?

809
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:57,051
- These things jump?
- They fly, buddy!

810
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:58,950
Watch out for that oil slick!

811
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:01,285
Aaah!

812
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,620
Aah! Aaaah!

813
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:11,799
That was fun.
Let's do it again.

814
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:15,235
- OK.
- Yes!

815
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,636
As soon as I catch my breath.

816
00:44:17,672 --> 00:44:19,139
Maybe next summer.

817
00:44:19,174 --> 00:44:21,165
Come on, Pat.

818
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:51,528
Josh?

819
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,042
Josh? It's Josh.

820
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:58,443
<i>- Josh is back!
- Josh!</i>

821
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,505
Josh!

822
00:45:00,548 --> 00:45:03,676
<i>- Man, good to see you!
- I knew you were OK!</i>

823
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:06,846
Josh, what's wrong?
What'd they do to you?

824
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:09,789
Josh...speak to me.

825
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:12,725
Were you in jail?
The nut house?

826
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:15,457
Josh, it's me--Gerry.

827
00:45:15,497 --> 00:45:19,661
Gerry. Pbbbbt.

828
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:21,965
Heh heh. Funny, Josh.

829
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:23,732
What happened, man?
Talk to us.

830
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:28,841
Josh was bad.

831
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:31,209
<i>What's he mean?</i>

832
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:34,443
Oh, man. Oh, jeez.

833
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:40,148
Josh now good.

834
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:43,419
Good? What do you mean?

835
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,155
Must be...
good to see my big ass again!

836
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:51,661
I liked you better
with the lobotomy.

837
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,258
What really happened, man?

838
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:54,996
Perkis sent me home
without a refund.

839
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:57,004
However, my dad's a lawyer.

840
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:59,403
He threatened to sue
and Perkis caved...

841
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,807
like the Buffalo Bills
in the Super Bowl.

842
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,978
Hey, Josh, how long
have you been shaving?

843
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,351
A couple of years.

844
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,454
What was it like on the outside?

845
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:23,426
It was incredible.
First, I went to the Sizzler!

846
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:26,366
Got that all-you-can-eat meal.
I closed the place.

847
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,699
How are we fixed
for supplies on this end?

848
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:30,364
Perkis wiped us out.

849
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:33,340
There isn't a Gummi Bear
left in this entire camp.

850
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,903
Whew. I am doggin' it
this morning.

851
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,779
Ahh. Come on, T.

852
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:46,309
Now let's do it up.

853
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:47,616
Whew!

854
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,548
<i>Start me up.</i>

855
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,294
Come on.

856
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,730
Hurry up, guys.
We don't have all day.

857
00:46:57,766 --> 00:47:00,166
Lift those legs.

858
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,203
Looks pretty sturdy, guys.

859
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:09,274
- Hurry up, man.
- I'm trying.

860
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:13,710
Roy, you're up first.
Give it a shot.

861
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,739
Simms,
you're my lookout man.

862
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:18,753
Give me a boost. Up, up.

863
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:19,981
Uhh!

864
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:22,683
<i>Aah!</i>

865
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,162
All right.
Gerry, check this room out.

866
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:35,726
Roy, Nicholas,
you guys come with me...

867
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,998
and be quiet about it.

868
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:39,336
That candy's gotta be
in here somewhere.

869
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:42,434
<i>I'll find the candy.</i>

870
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:44,570
Where's the sweets?

871
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:49,547
- Over here.
- What do you got?

872
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,818
Come on, you devil log!

873
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,850
Uhh!

874
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:04,558
Oh!

875
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,362
- Hurry up.
- All right, all right.

876
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:10,931
"Perkisize with Tony"?

877
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,872
That's me!

878
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,632
I'm skinny.

879
00:48:19,013 --> 00:48:21,311
- Come on, Josh!
- I'm trying!

880
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:22,816
If you can't get it,
we need to leave.

881
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,479
Yeah!

882
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,955
Uhh!

883
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,723
Thanks, Captain.

884
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,298
I'm doggin' it, Pat!

885
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,233
<i>Letters?</i>

886
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:48,671
You guys,
these are our letters home.

887
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,044
No way. This guy is sick!

888
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,447
This is the letter
I wrote my grandma!

889
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,154
Oh!

890
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,098
Pack it up, guys.
Let's move!

891
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:17,468
Oh, no. We're dead!

892
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:26,138
He's coming! He's coming!

893
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,114
He's coming!

894
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:32,651
Roy, the picture!

895
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:34,518
Josh, the drawers!

896
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,090
Put the whites away, Gerry.
Help me!

897
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,293
- Whites right here.
- Just throw it in!

898
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,359
Oooooo-ahhhh!

899
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,632
Wait a sec!
Where's Nicholas?

900
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,711
You guys go. I'll get him.

901
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,406
Let's move it, Roy.

902
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:01,972
Nickie! Nicholas!

903
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:06,782
Mmm!

904
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:09,255
What are you doing?
He's coming!

905
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,589
Get down.

906
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:17,726
Gerry, come on!

907
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:32,105
- Oh, my. I didn't mean to.
- Just go!

908
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:34,877
Uhh!

909
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:47,555
Oh!

910
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,431
Uhh!

911
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:59,400
Scatter!

912
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:31,998
Coast clear?

913
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,530
- That was close.
- Clear!

914
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:36,099
- Whoo!
- We did it.

915
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:39,113
You really showed
some guts out there, Cappy.

916
00:51:39,147 --> 00:51:41,672
One of those fish and chips
farts there, Nickie?

917
00:51:41,716 --> 00:51:43,240
I extend my deepest apologies--

918
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:46,412
Wait! Wrapper.

919
00:51:46,454 --> 00:51:49,582
- What?
- Food wrapper.

920
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:50,955
Come on!

921
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:55,990
Who's in there?
What have you got?

922
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,227
Nothing! No one!
Just go away!

923
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:05,105
Where'd you get that?!

924
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:06,333
I found it?

925
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,467
You found it.
Come here, you little punk!

926
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:10,477
- Tell us!
- Yeah, tell us!

927
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:12,536
All right!
OK! I'll tell you!

928
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,310
You gotta keep it a secret.

929
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,288
<i># I know a guy
who's tough but sweet #</i>

930
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,724
<i># He's so fine,
he can't be beat #</i>

931
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:31,060
<i># He's got everything
that I desire #</i>

932
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:35,396
<i># Sets the summer sun
on fire #</i>

933
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,338
<i># I want candy #</i>

934
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:46,273
<i># Go to see him
when the sun goes down #</i>

935
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:50,745
<i># Ain't no finer boy
in town #</i>

936
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,979
<i># I want candy #</i>

937
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:59,156
<i># I want candy #</i>

938
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,489
<i># Hey! #</i>

939
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,727
<i>OK, everyone.
Here we go.</i>

940
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,702
Hey, I'm not rolling yet.

941
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:14,374
Are you rolling now, Kenneth?

942
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,876
- Speed.
- Does that mean rolling?

943
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:18,936
Yes, it does.

944
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,944
<i>OK, everyone.
Clap your hands!</i>

945
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:29,988
We've reached the midpoint
of our great experiment.

946
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:32,083
Parents' Day
is just around the corner...

947
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,492
and I think they're gonna be
very, very pleased.

948
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:36,019
Remember to wear
your name tags.

949
00:53:36,063 --> 00:53:39,590
I don't think
they'll recognize you.

950
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,033
Now it's time to see...

951
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:43,832
what the Perkis system means
in pure loss of poundage.

952
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:46,863
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

953
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:49,308
Phillip Rubinoff,
step up, son.

954
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,242
All right,
let's see how you're doing...

955
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:55,215
you little whippersnapper.

956
00:53:58,419 --> 00:54:02,185
You're two pounds heavier
than when you came to camp...

957
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:03,713
but we can fix that.
All we have to do...

958
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:05,316
is decrease his food intake...

959
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,520
and increase
his metabolic output.

960
00:54:07,562 --> 00:54:09,553
All right!
Step off the scale, son.

961
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:12,225
Muscle weighs more than fat!

962
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:14,894
<i>All right! OK!</i>

963
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:19,032
Gerald Garner.
Step on up, Gerald.

964
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,376
- Good luck.
- Go get 'em, Captain.

965
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:27,378
Hello, Gerald.
Moment of truth.

966
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:32,017
Hmm?

967
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,088
You've gained nine pounds.

968
00:54:42,129 --> 00:54:44,620
Have you been cheating?

969
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:46,394
Turn off the camera.

970
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:48,402
Let me make something
very clear.

971
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:50,631
The Perkis system
does not work...

972
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:54,437
with cheaters
like Gerald Garner, OK?

973
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:57,876
How can I sell an infomercial
about fat kids...

974
00:54:57,979 --> 00:55:01,471
who can't keep their
piggy little snouts shut?

975
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,313
Who's gonna buy that?
Step off the scale.

976
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,987
OK. Turn on the camera.

977
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:13,687
Josh Birnbaum, step on up!

978
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,992
Get on the scale, son!
All right!

979
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:19,025
- Get off the scale.
- OK, then.

980
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,058
Turn off the camera.
All right.

981
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:25,095
All right, fine.
I blame myself.

982
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,468
You know what?

983
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:30,602
I don't blame myself.
No, not this time, Tony.

984
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:32,636
Excuse me one second.

985
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:39,453
How you doin', little Tony?

986
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:40,784
Bad.

987
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:42,379
Why do you feel bad?

988
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,152
Because everything's
falling apart...

989
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:45,886
and I can't do anything
about it.

990
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:48,361
It's not your fault.

991
00:55:48,396 --> 00:55:50,330
I know it's not my fault,
but whose fault is it...

992
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:51,626
if it's not my fault?

993
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:53,964
It's their fault.
That's right.

994
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:55,559
It's their fault!

995
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,231
You have failed,
and you will pay!

996
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,933
Tomorrow morning at 0600...

997
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:02,067
everyone who has not met
their weight loss goal...

998
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,838
will join me
on a 20-mile hike.

999
00:56:03,878 --> 00:56:07,041
Pack light, boys.
The party's over.

1000
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:10,050
Twenty miles? Tony!

1001
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:12,552
Tony, sir,
with all due respect...

1002
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:14,884
I don't think it's healthy
to subject the--

1003
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,617
Healthy? Oh, healthy!

1004
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:19,751
The fat man is gonna tell me
what's healthy!

1005
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,853
I'm just saying that--

1006
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:23,454
You just--You--I--

1007
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:25,488
I think if--
To subject the kids--

1008
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:26,864
Know what? It's funny.

1009
00:56:26,901 --> 00:56:30,564
Nobody really cares
what you have to say.

1010
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,731
You're a negativity-spreader.

1011
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:35,264
You're contaminating my well,
Finley...

1012
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,573
and I won't have it.

1013
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,945
Let's make the best
of this afternoon.

1014
00:56:46,954 --> 00:56:48,444
<i>It's OK, man.</i>

1015
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,457
<i>Forget it, Pat.</i>

1016
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:11,372
Hey.

1017
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,113
They're having a barbecue
over at Camp MVP tonight.

1018
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,084
Carolina ribs.

1019
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,782
The pork, not the beef.

1020
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:25,848
I wonder what it would feel like
to be one of those guys.

1021
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:29,851
Just once I want to score
a winning touchdown.

1022
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,090
In my entire life...

1023
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:33,964
I've never scored a point
in anything.

1024
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:38,630
Gerry.

1025
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,676
I'm just so tired
of being the fat guy.

1026
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,308
I know, Pat...

1027
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:50,009
but you don't want to be
one of those guys.

1028
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,076
They're jerks.

1029
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,082
Forget them.

1030
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,953
Yeah, forget them.

1031
00:57:57,991 --> 00:58:00,016
Yeah.

1032
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,925
Forget you!

1033
00:58:01,962 --> 00:58:04,954
Keep your washboard stomachs
and your oily muscles!

1034
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:07,023
I don't want them!

1035
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,129
I'm still tired
of being the fat guy.

1036
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,730
Come on, Pat.
You're cool.

1037
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:15,206
Everybody knows that.

1038
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,733
I feel cool.

1039
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:21,338
Being humiliated by that psycho
today was pretty cool.

1040
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:23,042
Oh, yeah.

1041
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,381
I've been
a lot of help to you guys.

1042
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,155
At least you stood up to him.

1043
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,861
Nobody else had the guts to.

1044
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,327
We should've backed you up.

1045
00:58:41,034 --> 00:58:44,834
When are we going to start
sticking up for ourselves?

1046
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:52,371
Now, Gerry.
How about right now?

1047
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:55,813
Yeah. Let's go get everybody
and kick his ass!

1048
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:58,511
Yeah! Hold it. Whoa, whoa.

1049
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:00,178
We got to be smart here.

1050
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,881
There's some proper channels
to go through...

1051
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:04,651
but you get those guys
through the hike tomorrow.

1052
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:06,386
I'll do everything
I can back here.

1053
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:07,984
You be the leader now, Captain.

1054
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:10,724
He is one, we are many.

1055
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,026
His days are numbered.

1056
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,829
- He's not so tough.
- Yeah!

1057
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:21,337
This is the day we separate
the men from the boys.

1058
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,211
Hightail it back to camp, Lars.
It'll be a rough one.

1059
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:29,738
I don't want to see any slackers
or hear any whiners.

1060
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:33,014
There'll be no food.
This is a cleansing hike.

1061
00:59:33,053 --> 00:59:36,853
Just Father Sky, Mother Earth...

1062
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,915
and your dear old Uncle Tony.

1063
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,364
Use the swatting motion
as an isometric exercise.

1064
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,774
My dogs are killing me.

1065
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,300
Gosh, somebody
going to die today.

1066
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,710
Call 911.

1067
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:02,044
Did you ever hear
the story of Icarus...

1068
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:05,210
who continually rolled
the ball up the hill?

1069
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:07,185
But when he got too close...

1070
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,485
the ball melted
in the heat of the sun.

1071
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,855
You're all like Icarus.

1072
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:19,487
Aah! Aah!

1073
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:28,100
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1074
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:30,109
Thank you, Gerry.

1075
01:00:42,422 --> 01:00:44,822
Uhh!

1076
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,289
Get up, Cody.

1077
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:51,024
Leave him.
He's a straggler.

1078
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,591
Stragglers must be left
to fend for themselves.

1079
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:56,124
I was.

1080
01:00:56,169 --> 01:00:58,069
Get up, Cody.
We need to go.

1081
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:02,102
Did you talk to Child Welfare?

1082
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:04,975
They'd be glad to
come out and investigate...

1083
01:01:05,011 --> 01:01:07,445
but they can't come
for two weeks.

1084
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,210
That's too long.
What did your lawyer buddy say?

1085
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,014
It's dicey. We don't
have any hard evidence.

1086
01:01:13,052 --> 01:01:15,486
Tony's the hard evidence.
Just look at him.

1087
01:01:15,522 --> 01:01:17,285
That's what the lawyer said.

1088
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:21,259
- So we have nothing.
- Basically.

1089
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:24,889
You guys seen Tony?

1090
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:29,197
That moron owes me 600 bucks.
I'll kill that guy.

1091
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:32,102
<i>Busting my ass
around here for nothing.</i>

1092
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,614
Feel the chi.

1093
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:53,624
Repulse the monkey.

1094
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:04,002
<i>Part the wild horse's mane.</i>

1095
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:05,231
I say we push him.

1096
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,069
No jury in the world
could convict us.

1097
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:10,842
<i>Strike the chi.</i>

1098
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:15,007
No. Too messy.
We can do better.

1099
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,921
Great.

1100
01:02:22,956 --> 01:02:25,948
You've all done
much better than expected...

1101
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,085
so I've got
a little surprise for you.

1102
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:30,459
I've decided to extend
the hike indefinitely.

1103
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,124
- What?
- That's right.

1104
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,359
You won't return to camp...

1105
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:34,923
Until you're
in the leanest, meanest...

1106
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:37,459
bestest shape
of your short lives...

1107
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,267
with one goal in mind--

1108
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:43,571
to defeat Camp MVP
in the Apache Relay.

1109
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:45,874
Quite the ending to
a late-night infomercial, hmm?

1110
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:48,745
We don't want to play MVP.
We want to have fun.

1111
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:50,942
<i>Yeah!</i>

1112
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,248
Cody wants to have fun.

1113
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:56,278
All right, Cody,
let's have some fun.

1114
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,489
Whee-ha!

1115
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,359
- Oh, my--
- Whoa!

1116
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:05,990
I'm on the top of the world!

1117
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:10,969
Yeah!
How's this for fun, Cody?

1118
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:14,132
Sam? Why don't you
come out and join me?

1119
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:16,266
I'm on my way.

1120
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:17,970
He's going to get us killed.

1121
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:20,673
- We got to do something.
- Yeah, but what?

1122
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,613
What's that? I missed it.

1123
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:28,485
I was just saying
we need a little rest.

1124
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:30,011
Good idea.

1125
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,956
Let's take an hour
meditation break.

1126
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,925
Then we're going to climb
that 1,000-foot rock face...

1127
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,588
over there with
our bare hands and feet.

1128
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:38,597
I know you can do it.

1129
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:42,089
Until then, observe
the silence of the chi.

1130
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,473
- Shoot.
- Let's do something.

1131
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:50,135
I don't know.

1132
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:52,872
Ohmmmm...

1133
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,938
<i>- You're lying.
- I don't believe in you.</i>

1134
01:03:56,983 --> 01:04:00,982
<i>You can't do it!</i>

1135
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,853
Hahh! Cripes.

1136
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:07,519
What is all the commotion?

1137
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,724
We realize we've been lazy,
and we want to change.

1138
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,733
It's time we all got
our acts together, buddy.

1139
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,201
Good! Good!

1140
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:19,136
It's amazing what
a little food deprivation...

1141
01:04:19,172 --> 01:04:20,969
can do to adjust
your attitude, huh?

1142
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:22,201
Can I ask you a question?

1143
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:24,732
Go ahead, Roy. Ask away.

1144
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,644
Is it possible to do a sit-up
if you can't see or hear?

1145
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,513
Yes, Roy, it is possible.

1146
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:33,713
Gerry says it's impossible.

1147
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:36,483
Why don't we rock Gerry's world?

1148
01:04:36,522 --> 01:04:38,786
Come on.

1149
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:41,555
Uncle Tony's going
to do a little demo.

1150
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,958
There are so many myths
about the abdominal muscles.

1151
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:48,092
I am happy to put
this one to rest.

1152
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,160
See, Gerry? I told you.

1153
01:04:51,204 --> 01:04:53,434
Now, remember, Uncle Tony...

1154
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,872
don't get up till
the count of three.

1155
01:04:54,907 --> 01:04:58,502
- I know the rules.
- OK, good.

1156
01:04:58,544 --> 01:05:00,011
All right, everyone.
Ready?

1157
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:03,174
One, two, three!

1158
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:04,547
Kiss my butt!

1159
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:08,918
Oh, my! Oh, my! Haah!

1160
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:10,445
Uhh! Uhh!

1161
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,424
Pretty impressive stuff,
huh, Tony?

1162
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,085
You disgust me.

1163
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:15,788
Come here!

1164
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,319
Come here!
Get out of my way!

1165
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:19,524
What are we waiting for?

1166
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:20,964
Come on!

1167
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,695
<i>Run, Josh!</i>

1168
01:05:25,238 --> 01:05:27,365
Halt!

1169
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:30,069
Run! Run! Go!

1170
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:33,135
Ow! Ooh! Hamstring!

1171
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,477
Well, congratulations.

1172
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,449
You've just joined
the 76% of Americans...

1173
01:05:37,483 --> 01:05:39,417
who forget to stretch
before physical activity.

1174
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:41,443
Aah!

1175
01:05:46,459 --> 01:05:48,051
<i>Let me see.</i>

1176
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:50,119
<i>Ohh...</i>

1177
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:53,724
Uhh. Uhh.

1178
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,791
Gentlemen...

1179
01:05:55,835 --> 01:06:00,329
we've reached
the point of no return.

1180
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,931
Yeah!

1181
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:08,939
The only problem is,
Kenny wants a lot of money.

1182
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:10,243
How much?

1183
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:12,273
Much more than
they pay camp counselors.

1184
01:06:12,317 --> 01:06:13,750
Great. Why don't
we have a bake sale?

1185
01:06:13,785 --> 01:06:16,049
What are you doing back
already?

1186
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:18,249
Where's the other guys?
You OK?

1187
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,621
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1188
01:06:19,658 --> 01:06:23,458
Good. We're still working on
a plan to get rid of Tony.

1189
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:24,689
Wait till
you hear what we got.

1190
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,924
That's great, guys...

1191
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:28,364
but we came up
with a plan of our own.

1192
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,698
That is so cute.

1193
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,796
Whatever. Come with me.

1194
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,740
I have got a bad feeling.

1195
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:45,579
Just try to stay open-minded.

1196
01:06:49,254 --> 01:06:52,519
- Password, please?
- Yankee doodles.

1197
01:06:57,129 --> 01:06:58,892
Oh, good God.

1198
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,456
Ooh! Uhh!

1199
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,127
This is unbelievable.

1200
01:07:03,168 --> 01:07:05,033
So, what was your plan?

1201
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,095
What do you think
you're doing?

1202
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:08,731
Taking over the camp.

1203
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,470
<i>- Oh, good God!
- This is insane!</i>

1204
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,875
This is great.

1205
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:14,879
Pat, you know what?
He snapped.

1206
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:16,540
He was swinging
from a branch.

1207
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:19,278
He was going to make us
climb a mountain.

1208
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:21,115
Guys, you can't kidnap
the owner of a camp.

1209
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:23,314
They give people
the chair for this.

1210
01:07:23,355 --> 01:07:25,220
It was self-defense.
You got to believe us.

1211
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:26,849
I believe you.

1212
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:29,360
This ends right now.

1213
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,862
Get out of my way, Simms.

1214
01:07:31,897 --> 01:07:34,127
Yankee doodles.

1215
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,927
Tony, I'm so sorry.
I'll untie you right away.

1216
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,838
Uhh! Thank you.

1217
01:07:41,873 --> 01:07:45,240
When this is all over,
I'm going to deliver...

1218
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:46,767
one well-placed kick
to your groin...

1219
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,404
that'll stop you from
ever having children...

1220
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:49,778
you worthless piece of--

1221
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:53,717
Are these ropes tight enough?
We can get more.

1222
01:07:53,752 --> 01:07:57,518
I was going to help you out,
but now...

1223
01:07:57,556 --> 01:07:59,353
I have to take you down.

1224
01:07:59,391 --> 01:08:01,382
- All right!
- Yeah! Go!

1225
01:08:01,426 --> 01:08:04,520
I always wanted
to say that to somebody.

1226
01:08:04,563 --> 01:08:07,327
Guys, it looks like
we have to play this out.

1227
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:09,926
I think there might be
a way out of this...

1228
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:11,230
but if we're going
to succeed...

1229
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:13,999
we have to stick together
and work as a team.

1230
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:15,700
<i>Uhh!</i>

1231
01:08:17,643 --> 01:08:19,474
I'll see you all in hell!

1232
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,308
Oh!

1233
01:08:21,346 --> 01:08:23,576
With all the bears
in these woods, Lars...

1234
01:08:23,615 --> 01:08:27,073
I doubt that you'll be
seeing much of anything.

1235
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,112
- Bears love honey.
- Honey?

1236
01:08:31,156 --> 01:08:33,624
Chipmunks, move out.

1237
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:36,924
Lars, have a nice summer.

1238
01:08:36,962 --> 01:08:40,329
- I didn't mean it.
- Heh heh heh!

1239
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:41,889
I'm sorry. I...

1240
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:44,060
Ow!

1241
01:08:44,102 --> 01:08:46,070
Aah! I hate you!

1242
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:48,197
You're awful!

1243
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,367
Please help me!

1244
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:51,967
I have candy.

1245
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,274
Candy.

1246
01:08:54,312 --> 01:08:57,543
Good boy.
You've come to free me.

1247
01:08:57,582 --> 01:08:59,106
Ohh!

1248
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:03,719
Think we're going
a little too far here, guys?

1249
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:07,282
No, man. There are no bears
in these woods.

1250
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:11,193
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

1251
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,527
No bears, huh?

1252
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:16,591
<i>Aah!</i>

1253
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:21,596
Help me!

1254
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,167
Don't you have any decency?
Help me!

1255
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:30,880
Look at the little deer.

1256
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,511
Mr. Deer,
I am a vegetarian.

1257
01:10:01,179 --> 01:10:05,047
Yeah!

1258
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,287
<i>Wake up, Tony.</i>

1259
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:12,381
<i>Tonight is Evaluation Night.</i>

1260
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:14,517
<i>The key word here is "value."</i>

1261
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:16,220
<i>Do you have any?</i>

1262
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:18,559
<i>No way,
because you're a loser--</i>

1263
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:20,792
<i>a loser
with a skinny wiener.</i>

1264
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:24,063
<i>So, relax...
and repeat after me.</i>

1265
01:10:24,102 --> 01:10:25,899
<i>I am a loser.</i>

1266
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:27,666
<i>I smell.</i>

1267
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:30,106
<i>I have no friends.</i>

1268
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:31,336
<i>Now breathe and relax.</i>

1269
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:34,812
Please, shut that off!

1270
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:39,449
Ohh!

1271
01:10:39,484 --> 01:10:42,009
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1272
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:44,112
Wow!

1273
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,795
All right!

1274
01:11:04,242 --> 01:11:06,267
Thank you very much
for stopping on by.

1275
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:08,802
Pass it on by.
I'll take one of those.

1276
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,315
Party! Yeah!

1277
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:15,217
Oh, my gosh. Is that Tim?

1278
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:17,084
Whoo-hoo!

1279
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,720
He looks like a human s'more.

1280
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,753
Look at that food.
I should get down there.

1281
01:11:25,797 --> 01:11:28,095
No, Pat, don't go.

1282
01:11:30,969 --> 01:11:33,335
Stay here with me.

1283
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:37,830
- Aah!
- Shut up.

1284
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,674
Hey, Lars, guess what?
We're in charge now.

1285
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:42,145
Know what we found out?

1286
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,741
If you don't have a job,
you get deported...

1287
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:48,446
so, Lars, buddy, pal...

1288
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:51,387
you with us,
or are you against us?

1289
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:54,620
I am with you.

1290
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,559
I love you.

1291
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:03,963
I thought they were
supposed to be on diets.

1292
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:05,162
I think they're cheating.

1293
01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:40,861
Good God!
Can anybody hear me?

1294
01:13:10,835 --> 01:13:13,827
Excuse me.

1295
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:32,555
Time to wake up, children.

1296
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,955
Good morning!

1297
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:36,756
Huh? Huh?

1298
01:13:39,831 --> 01:13:42,459
Who wants to tell us
the lesson we learned here?

1299
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,060
Don't put Twinkies
on your pizza.

1300
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:47,901
No. I think
what we learned here...

1301
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:51,431
is something about
personal responsibility.

1302
01:13:51,476 --> 01:13:53,467
From now on, each of us...

1303
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:55,945
is in charge of
their own diets.

1304
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:58,211
We have to learn
some self-control.

1305
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:01,412
Isn't that right, Tim?

1306
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,487
You got it.
I'm ashamed of all of you.

1307
01:14:05,523 --> 01:14:07,115
Come on!

1308
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,718
We got to get healthy
for ourselves.

1309
01:14:09,761 --> 01:14:11,729
If we'd start
respecting ourselves...

1310
01:14:11,763 --> 01:14:13,424
no one can touch us.

1311
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:16,127
That's right.
You heard me.

1312
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,600
We're as good as anybody...

1313
01:14:17,635 --> 01:14:20,160
and it's about time
we started acting that way.

1314
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,365
We got to take control
of ourselves...

1315
01:14:21,406 --> 01:14:23,431
before we take control
of this camp.

1316
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:24,942
Who's with me?

1317
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:27,137
Who wants to do
this thing right?

1318
01:14:28,179 --> 01:14:29,578
It's up to you.

1319
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:38,983
<i>I will.</i>

1320
01:14:55,807 --> 01:14:58,469
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

1321
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,035
OK, let's go!

1322
01:15:07,018 --> 01:15:10,112
Is a tomato
a fruit or a vegetable?

1323
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:12,123
- Fruit.
- That's right.

1324
01:15:12,157 --> 01:15:16,457
Today, we're going to make
pasta primavera.

1325
01:15:41,553 --> 01:15:43,919
Hey, how you doing?

1326
01:15:48,626 --> 01:15:51,595
- There he is.
- Hey, I'm over here!

1327
01:15:51,629 --> 01:15:54,393
Gerry! Oh!

1328
01:15:54,432 --> 01:15:58,493
Hey, big guy. Look at you.

1329
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:01,004
- You look the same.
- I feel good.

1330
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:04,372
That's important, too.

1331
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:05,808
So?

1332
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:08,642
Come with me.
I'll take you around.

1333
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,672
- He hasn't lost a pound.
- Oh, Maury.

1334
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:20,891
Don't be frightened, Nicholas.

1335
01:16:20,925 --> 01:16:22,916
I'm a beaten man.

1336
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:46,577
Good afternoon, everyone.

1337
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:49,314
Good afternoon.
I'm Pat Finley.

1338
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,753
You probably recognize me...

1339
01:16:50,788 --> 01:16:52,949
from my work in the Camp Hope
promotional video.

1340
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,757
Right now, I'd like to play
another video...

1341
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:59,228
to show you people
just what it's been like...

1342
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:01,061
so far this summer.

1343
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:03,499
<i>This'll be great.</i>

1344
01:17:03,534 --> 01:17:06,094
<i>Enjoy.</i>

1345
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,302
Aah!

1346
01:17:14,779 --> 01:17:17,304
Die! Yaah!

1347
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:20,550
As a health care
professional...

1348
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:22,416
I would like to take
this opportunity...

1349
01:17:22,453 --> 01:17:24,580
to warn you that
Tony Perkis's program...

1350
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:28,991
is not only ineffective,
it's downright dangerous.

1351
01:17:31,696 --> 01:17:36,097
<i># Everywhere I go,
I'm late #</i>

1352
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:37,829
My grandma
runs faster than you...

1353
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:39,962
and she's only got one leg!

1354
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:41,835
<i>Say it one more time,
because it'll multiply.</i>

1355
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:44,205
- 40 push-ups?
- 60! Down! Now!

1356
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:45,709
- 80!
- I can't--

1357
01:17:45,743 --> 01:17:48,473
He is strict.

1358
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:02,859
Kiss the ground, joker boy.

1359
01:18:02,894 --> 01:18:05,863
Would you get
your foot off my back?

1360
01:18:05,897 --> 01:18:08,161
Now you see what
we've been dealing with.

1361
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:11,134
Why didn't you tell us
about this?

1362
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,575
You've been
a good guard, Nicholas--

1363
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:29,643
strong and fair.

1364
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:33,987
Your queen would be proud.

1365
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:39,122
I'd like to reward you
with this chocolate kiss.

1366
01:18:45,703 --> 01:18:47,227
<i>Oh!</i>

1367
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:48,602
Yeah!

1368
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:51,699
Where have you been
all my life?

1369
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:53,711
I'm going to love this.

1370
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:55,872
Oh, my God.
I'm going to be sick.

1371
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:57,073
Nice touch.

1372
01:18:57,115 --> 01:18:59,379
I thought
I'd spice it up a little.

1373
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:02,352
It gives you
that warm feeling inside?

1374
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:04,184
Throw it over.

1375
01:19:04,222 --> 01:19:06,417
But it would smush.

1376
01:19:06,457 --> 01:19:08,618
That wouldn't be good.

1377
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:13,629
No dinner, no lunch,
no breakfast.

1378
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:16,064
How's that grab you?

1379
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,898
Take the candy.

1380
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:23,898
Nice and chocolatey.

1381
01:19:23,941 --> 01:19:26,876
Chocolicious.

1382
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:29,539
Whoops.

1383
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,275
Butterfingers.

1384
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:36,515
Aah!

1385
01:19:36,554 --> 01:19:38,181
Well, well...

1386
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:41,157
looks like London bridge
is falling down, huh?

1387
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:42,420
Help!

1388
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,688
How do you like the food
here at Camp Hope?

1389
01:19:43,728 --> 01:19:44,922
It's good stuff.

1390
01:19:44,962 --> 01:19:46,987
Wait till I finish
asking you the question.

1391
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:48,555
Just say,
"I love the food."

1392
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:50,226
- I love the food.
- Good. Here we go.

1393
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,860
So, Josh, how do you
like the food here?

1394
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:53,097
I love the food.

1395
01:19:53,137 --> 01:19:54,798
Wait until
I finish the question!

1396
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:56,932
<i>Damn! Forget it!</i>

1397
01:19:56,974 --> 01:19:59,101
If he isn't stopped
right away...

1398
01:19:59,143 --> 01:20:03,170
somebody's child--
maybe yours--

1399
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:05,148
will be hurt.

1400
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:07,583
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho! Yes!</i>

1401
01:20:07,618 --> 01:20:11,850
That was wonderful!

1402
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:13,823
Whoo!

1403
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:16,691
So entertaining.

1404
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:20,663
The cinematography,
the editing techniques.

1405
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:22,495
Though I must say...

1406
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:27,470
the villain
was a bit over the top.

1407
01:20:30,842 --> 01:20:34,505
Ouch.
Everyone having fun?

1408
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:36,604
Parents!

1409
01:20:36,647 --> 01:20:40,481
You're the cause of
all my--their problems!

1410
01:20:40,518 --> 01:20:41,951
He escaped!

1411
01:20:41,986 --> 01:20:44,045
You little
British butterball...

1412
01:20:44,088 --> 01:20:45,953
I ought to show you what
it means to be an American!

1413
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,981
Now you realize what
we've been dealing with.

1414
01:20:48,025 --> 01:20:49,458
He has to be stopped!

1415
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:52,588
Ho ho! Stop me, hmm?

1416
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:59,596
Uhh! I'm too strong!

1417
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,798
Uhh! Ah!

1418
01:21:01,839 --> 01:21:05,070
I'm too motivated!

1419
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:08,408
And you're too weak!

1420
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:11,574
Aah! Uhh!

1421
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,914
Especially you,
Garner, Gerald...

1422
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:17,387
age 11, 141 pounds!

1423
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:19,514
So, come on!
You want a piece of me, Pops?

1424
01:21:19,557 --> 01:21:22,355
No one's taking
this camp away from me!

1425
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:25,157
Ooh!

1426
01:21:25,196 --> 01:21:28,996
I'm afraid you're wrong.
You are through here.

1427
01:21:29,033 --> 01:21:31,900
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

1428
01:21:31,936 --> 01:21:33,528
You have to take a stand.

1429
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:36,438
Uhh! Guhh!

1430
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:38,869
<i>Oh!</i>

1431
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:44,643
Uhh! Ahh!

1432
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:56,057
<i>- We did it, Roy.
- Yes, we did.</i>

1433
01:21:58,396 --> 01:22:01,559
Sorry to ask you to deal
with this, Mr. Perkis.

1434
01:22:01,599 --> 01:22:03,362
That kid was always
a little off.

1435
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:04,698
My parents didn't hug me.

1436
01:22:04,735 --> 01:22:07,203
You don't see me freaking out
like a little baby.

1437
01:22:09,006 --> 01:22:10,974
I'm going to take a bath
on this.

1438
01:22:11,008 --> 01:22:12,441
Listen, everybody...

1439
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:14,842
don't freak out,
don't call your lawyers.

1440
01:22:14,879 --> 01:22:16,141
We'll get you your money back.

1441
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,909
We make nice,
everybody's happy,

1442
01:22:17,949 --> 01:22:19,780
But for now,
we close down the camp.

1443
01:22:19,817 --> 01:22:21,250
Everybody go home.

1444
01:22:21,285 --> 01:22:22,980
Have a nice summer.
I got to get out of here.

1445
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,649
I'd love to chat.
Good luck to all of you.

1446
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:28,659
- Say something.
- Mr. Perkis, sir.

1447
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,058
Papa.

1448
01:22:30,094 --> 01:22:33,723
Papa, we don't want to go home.

1449
01:22:33,764 --> 01:22:34,958
Wait a minute.

1450
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:36,398
If you kids
want to stick it out...

1451
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:38,561
all I need to do is
put an adult in charge--

1452
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:43,063
put it on the responsibility
clause for the insurance.

1453
01:22:43,107 --> 01:22:45,439
Who's been here the longest?

1454
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:49,139
- Four years.
- One year.

1455
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,374
- Two.
- Four years.

1456
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:51,972
- Three.
- Five.

1457
01:22:52,016 --> 01:22:54,416
Eighteen years.

1458
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:56,181
Eighteen?

1459
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,415
- Whoa.
- 18 years.

1460
01:22:58,456 --> 01:23:00,788
What the hell have you
been doing with yourself?

1461
01:23:00,825 --> 01:23:03,487
Are you up to it?

1462
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:07,754
Pat. Pat.

1463
01:23:07,798 --> 01:23:11,199
Pat! Pat! Pat!

1464
01:23:18,075 --> 01:23:19,269
I'll sure try.

1465
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,471
Hooray.
Ooh, yeah, OK.

1466
01:23:21,512 --> 01:23:22,877
Congratulations.
Here you go.

1467
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:26,007
Do the hokey-pokey
and knock yourself out.

1468
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:31,915
All right, Pat.

1469
01:23:31,956 --> 01:23:33,753
Enjoy yourselves.
You deserve it.

1470
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:36,121
I'm proud of you.

1471
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:43,724
<i>Dear Grandma...</i>

1472
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:45,735
<i>things have really
turned around at camp.</i>

1473
01:23:45,836 --> 01:23:48,202
<i>We're finally having
a great time.</i>

1474
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:50,399
Uhh!

1475
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:52,636
Whoo!

1476
01:23:52,676 --> 01:23:55,907
Yee-haw!

1477
01:23:58,349 --> 01:24:01,250
<i>We're in control,
and we like it.</i>

1478
01:24:01,285 --> 01:24:04,083
<i>We're putting things back
to the way they were...</i>

1479
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,555
<i>and no one is going
to mess it up again.</i>

1480
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,720
Hey, Chris.

1481
01:24:12,763 --> 01:24:15,163
Where's the motor, man?

1482
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,791
<i>With Pat in charge...</i>

1483
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:19,098
<i>we are united,
and we are strong.</i>

1484
01:24:19,136 --> 01:24:20,364
Can I get that wrench,
Phillip?

1485
01:24:20,404 --> 01:24:22,804
Thank you.
Josh, how we doing?

1486
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,001
Got a bent axle over here.

1487
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:26,509
<i>We can do anything...</i>

1488
01:24:26,543 --> 01:24:30,604
<i>even take on Camp MVP
in the Apache Relay.</i>

1489
01:24:30,647 --> 01:24:33,582
<i>And we can win--I think.</i>

1490
01:24:33,617 --> 01:24:35,380
<i>Welcome, everybody...</i>

1491
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:38,320
<i>to the 33rd Annual
Apache Relay games--</i>

1492
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:40,721
<i>the favorites, Camp MVP...</i>

1493
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:43,659
<i>versus the perennial losers,
Camp Hope.</i>

1494
01:24:43,694 --> 01:24:46,527
<i>This relay today
will consist of three parts--</i>

1495
01:24:46,563 --> 01:24:49,930
<i>an obstacle course,
the Hall of Intelligence...</i>

1496
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,958
<i>and the Grand Prix.</i>

1497
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:54,300
May the best team win.

1498
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,397
All right, Cody,
give it your best shot.

1499
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,135
<i>Put a little pizzazz in it.</i>

1500
01:24:58,175 --> 01:25:01,144
<i>On your mark, get set...</i>

1501
01:25:11,155 --> 01:25:12,986
Get up, get up!

1502
01:25:17,094 --> 01:25:18,493
Uhh!

1503
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:20,588
<i>Looks like
an MVP romp again, folks.</i>

1504
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:23,895
Uhh!

1505
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:28,463
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1506
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,582
Here, take it!

1507
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:54,586
Whoa!

1508
01:25:54,631 --> 01:25:57,498
<i>Keep going.
You got it, man. Yeah.</i>

1509
01:25:57,534 --> 01:25:59,695
<i>It's just a couple more.</i>

1510
01:25:59,736 --> 01:26:01,101
<i>Come on.</i>

1511
01:26:02,673 --> 01:26:04,140
Up. All right, here.

1512
01:26:04,174 --> 01:26:06,369
OK. All right. Ready?

1513
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:07,775
Uhh!

1514
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:15,014
<i>Yeah!</i>

1515
01:26:17,387 --> 01:26:20,845
- Aww.
- Give me the balloon.

1516
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:25,624
<i>All right.
You can do it. It's easy.</i>

1517
01:26:25,662 --> 01:26:27,994
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1518
01:26:34,371 --> 01:26:35,736
I know you thought
we'd get creamed...

1519
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:39,868
but I don't think
you'll get creamed riding this.

1520
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,468
Whoa!

1521
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:43,776
Did a little work on the motor.

1522
01:26:43,814 --> 01:26:44,974
Whoa.

1523
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:47,540
You better
take that feather off.

1524
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:50,747
I don't think
it'll fit under this.

1525
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:55,684
<i>Camp MVP is
setting a course record...</i>

1526
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:58,160
<i>as they move into
the Hall of Intelligence.</i>

1527
01:27:05,402 --> 01:27:06,835
Solve the equation.

1528
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,394
- 55.
- No.

1529
01:27:08,438 --> 01:27:10,338
- 17?
- Nein.

1530
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:11,534
Nine is the answer?

1531
01:27:11,575 --> 01:27:13,600
"Nein" is German for "no."

1532
01:27:17,214 --> 01:27:19,079
Artist and title, please.

1533
01:27:19,116 --> 01:27:20,515
Cher?

1534
01:27:22,186 --> 01:27:23,414
No.

1535
01:27:23,453 --> 01:27:26,013
<i>Solve the equation.</i>

1536
01:27:27,824 --> 01:27:29,018
Eleven.

1537
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:32,085
Wunderbar. You may advance.

1538
01:27:32,129 --> 01:27:35,360
You must now name
five American vice presidents.

1539
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:37,458
Quayle.

1540
01:27:37,501 --> 01:27:39,628
- George Washington.
- No.

1541
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:43,071
- Quayle.
- You said that already.

1542
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:44,971
Cher?

1543
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:46,771
Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa."

1544
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:49,574
Van Gogh's
"Houses at Auvers."

1545
01:27:49,613 --> 01:27:53,208
Botticelli's "La Primavera."

1546
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,512
<i>Over at
the Hall of Intelligence...</i>

1547
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:56,917
<i>Camp Hope has almost
caught up to Camp MVP.</i>

1548
01:27:56,954 --> 01:27:58,285
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1549
01:27:58,322 --> 01:28:00,222
<i>This is going to be
quite some finish, folks.</i>

1550
01:28:00,257 --> 01:28:02,122
Right is gas,
left is brake.

1551
01:28:03,961 --> 01:28:06,293
- Alexander Haig?
- Sorry.

1552
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:09,527
- Caught you.
- Shut up.

1553
01:28:09,566 --> 01:28:12,626
Nicholas, name five
American vice presidents.

1554
01:28:12,669 --> 01:28:15,467
Levi P. Morton,
John Calhoun...

1555
01:28:15,505 --> 01:28:18,235
Hubert Humphrey,
Spiro Agnew...

1556
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:19,799
Walter Mondale.

1557
01:28:19,843 --> 01:28:22,004
That's perfect.
You may advance.

1558
01:28:22,045 --> 01:28:25,242
You Americans
have no sense of history.

1559
01:28:25,282 --> 01:28:27,614
<i>Home stretch! Go, go!</i>

1560
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:29,676
Accelerate into the turns.
Don't forget.

1561
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,017
Use your weight.
Lean into them.

1562
01:28:31,054 --> 01:28:33,989
Be careful.
This guy drives dirty.

1563
01:28:34,024 --> 01:28:36,322
<i>- Thanks, Pat.
- Go get 'em.</i>

1564
01:28:40,497 --> 01:28:42,829
Nicholas!

1565
01:28:44,968 --> 01:28:46,765
Come on!

1566
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,972
I don't want to put
any pressure on you, Big Al...

1567
01:28:52,009 --> 01:28:55,342
but we have never lost
this race, all right?

1568
01:28:57,247 --> 01:28:59,408
Don't forget your wings, man.

1569
01:29:02,019 --> 01:29:04,078
Take 'em down, Captain.

1570
01:29:39,756 --> 01:29:42,020
Yeah! Ah ha!

1571
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:48,893
Hey! Back off!

1572
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:52,334
Whoa!

1573
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:54,303
<i>Ha ha!
So long, sucker!</i>

1574
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:56,329
Whoa! Aah!

1575
01:29:58,608 --> 01:30:00,439
Uhh!

1576
01:30:02,446 --> 01:30:04,778
Oh, shoot!

1577
01:30:04,815 --> 01:30:06,612
Come on!

1578
01:30:18,562 --> 01:30:20,587
Oh, no! Oh!

1579
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:37,275
Go, Gerry.
They're coming!

1580
01:30:37,314 --> 01:30:39,111
<i>All right, all right.</i>

1581
01:30:41,852 --> 01:30:43,717
Go! Go, Gerry!

1582
01:30:48,959 --> 01:30:51,427
Hey! Come on!

1583
01:30:51,461 --> 01:30:55,056
- Come on!
- No!

1584
01:31:05,442 --> 01:31:06,670
Unh!

1585
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:10,673
He's still behind!

1586
01:31:12,983 --> 01:31:14,450
He can't pass!

1587
01:31:17,487 --> 01:31:18,954
Come on! Unh!

1588
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,752
No way!

1589
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,021
Come on, Captain!
Come on, baby!

1590
01:31:39,943 --> 01:31:41,137
Ohhh.

1591
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:50,543
Oooooooh!

1592
01:31:55,492 --> 01:31:57,687
Aah! Yeah!

1593
01:31:57,727 --> 01:31:59,024
Oh!

1594
01:32:08,705 --> 01:32:10,730
All right, Gerry!

1595
01:32:10,774 --> 01:32:14,369
- I flew, Pat!
- I know!

1596
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,935
Hip-hip hooray!

1597
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:19,642
Hip-hip hooray!
Hip-hip hooray!

1598
01:32:25,889 --> 01:32:28,289
- Yeah!
- All right!

1599
01:32:30,961 --> 01:32:34,829
You'll be happy to know that
we're filing a formal protest.

1600
01:32:34,865 --> 01:32:36,332
That cup belongs to us.

1601
01:32:36,366 --> 01:32:39,028
Oh, the cup?
This is what you want?

1602
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:41,333
This is what your life
is all about, Chris?

1603
01:32:41,371 --> 01:32:44,238
I tell you what,
I'll airmail it...

1604
01:32:44,274 --> 01:32:45,639
back to camp for you,
all right?

1605
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:47,836
Take care of that, Simms?

1606
01:32:55,118 --> 01:32:57,450
You're crazy!

1607
01:32:57,487 --> 01:32:58,715
You bet I'm crazy.

1608
01:32:58,755 --> 01:33:00,723
<i>Come on! Get that cup!</i>

1609
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:03,248
- Oh!
- Crazy about my gal.

1610
01:33:03,293 --> 01:33:06,387
Whoo!

1611
01:33:14,004 --> 01:33:15,369
Whoo!

1612
01:33:19,476 --> 01:33:21,068
Hey, Pat...

1613
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:23,443
thanks for the best
damn summer of my life!

1614
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,243
Same here, Captain.

1615
01:33:26,683 --> 01:33:28,173
Whoo!

1616
01:33:36,759 --> 01:33:37,919
All right, guys!

1617
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,485
Let's sing the inspiring
Camp Hope song!

1618
01:33:41,797 --> 01:33:43,560
Aw, come on! Here we go!

1619
01:33:43,599 --> 01:33:46,329
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,
we sing to thee #</i>

1620
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:47,529
Come on, guys, sing!

1621
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:49,162
<i># The greatest camp
in history #</i>

1622
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:50,365
<i># A place for boys-- #</i>

1623
01:33:50,406 --> 01:33:52,772
Come on, Tim,
that song's boring.

1624
01:33:52,808 --> 01:33:53,968
Sing something cool.

1625
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,773
You want to hear
something cool?

1626
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:58,075
OK, cats, let's rock it.

1627
01:34:01,951 --> 01:34:04,181
Yow...huh!

1628
01:34:06,055 --> 01:34:08,615
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,
the place for boys #</i>

1629

1630

1631

a snake crawled in my cot #</i>

1632
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,991
<i># Make sure
the shower door is shut #</i>

1633
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:18,933
<i># Or else the 'squitos

1634
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:21,129

1635
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:22,933
<i># A warm spot in the lake #</i>

1636
01:34:22,972 --> 01:34:25,133
All right, guys,
you're getting the hang of it!

1637
01:34:25,174 --> 01:34:26,436
Come on!

1638
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:28,443
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,
please give us food #</i>

1639

1640
01:34:30,546 --> 01:34:32,571

1641
01:34:32,615 --> 01:34:35,413
<i># So we hope
summer never ends #</i>

1642
01:34:35,451 --> 01:34:38,750
All right!
Sounds good! Here we go!

1643
01:34:38,788 --> 01:34:42,588
<i># Here's a tip

1653
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:12,053
Stop!
Stop that stupid song!

1654
01:35:12,088 --> 01:35:13,350
You call that music?

1655
01:35:13,389 --> 01:35:16,950
<i># I know you think

1656

<i># About my favorite
Camp Hope job #</i>

1658
01:35:22,865 --> 01:35:25,527
<i># The day that
I harpooned the Blob #</i>

1659
01:35:25,568 --> 01:35:28,264
<i># And just
to make it very clear #</i>

1660
01:35:28,304 --> 01:35:31,171
<i># I was not scared of

1661

<i># I still enjoy Camp Hope #</i>

1663
01:35:36,345 --> 01:35:38,438
Thanks, Lars.
That's great.

1664
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:40,415
All right, guys,
you ready to take it home?

1665
01:35:40,449 --> 01:35:42,314
- Yeah!
- Let's rock!

1666

All right, guys,
that sounds great, yeah!

1676
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:11,742
We got a bunch of
heavyweights here?

1677
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:13,146
Are you guys heavyweights?

1678
01:36:13,182 --> 01:36:16,049
I said, are you
guys heavyweights?

1679
01:36:16,085 --> 01:36:17,279
Gerry,
are you a heavyweight?

1680
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:18,946
- Yeah!
- All right, Gerry!

1681
01:36:18,988 --> 01:36:20,979
Now the rest of you guys!
Are you all heavyweights?

1682
01:36:21,023 --> 01:36:22,183
Yeah!

1683
01:36:22,224 --> 01:36:24,454
Counselors,
are we all heavyweights?

1684
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:25,960
Yeah!
We're heavyweights!

1685
01:36:25,995 --> 01:36:28,020
- Pat, are you heavyweight?
- I'm a heavyweight!

1686
01:36:28,063 --> 01:36:29,530
Nurse Julie,
are you a heavyweight?

1687
01:36:29,565 --> 01:36:30,827
I'm a heavyweight!

1688
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:33,892
- Lars, are you a heavyweight?
- I'm a heavyweight, Tim!

1689
01:36:33,936 --> 01:36:35,995
Kenny the cameraman,
are you a heavyweight?

1690
01:36:36,038 --> 01:36:39,565
- Yes, I'm a heavyweight.
- We're all heavyweights!

1691
01:36:39,608 --> 01:36:42,577
So, Lars, you think
you're coming back next year?

1692
01:36:42,611 --> 01:36:44,806
I don't know, Tim.
I live very far away.

1693
01:36:44,847 --> 01:36:46,280
We'll fly you in.

1694
01:36:46,315 --> 01:36:48,510
Kenny the cameraman,
think you can make it back?

1695
01:36:48,551 --> 01:36:50,246
I might be able
to work something out.

1696
01:36:50,286 --> 01:36:52,516
That'd be very nice.

1697
01:36:52,555 --> 01:36:54,648
What do you say, guys?
Does Camp Hope rule?

1698
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:58,456
Pat, did you hurt
yourself on the Blob?

1699
01:36:58,494 --> 01:37:00,587
Yeah.
I tore my rotator cuff.

1700
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,834
Good afternoon.

1701
01:37:06,869 --> 01:37:08,063
I know what you're thinking.

1702
01:37:08,103 --> 01:37:10,731
"Another guy hawking healing
crystals door-to-door."

1703
01:37:10,773 --> 01:37:12,263
I don't like
to call them crystals.

1704
01:37:12,308 --> 01:37:14,833
I like to call them
"transformational facilitators."

1705
01:37:14,877 --> 01:37:16,572
Perhaps--
