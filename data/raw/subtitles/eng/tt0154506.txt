1
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,600
The following is my explanation.

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,061
Well...

3
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,233
more of an account
of what happened.

4
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,278
I'd been on my own
for a while...

5
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,197
and getting kind of...

6
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,492
lonely and bored.

7
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,577
Nothing to do all day.

8
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,623
And that's when
I started shadowing.

9
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,959
"Shadowing"?

10
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,421
Shadowing. Following.
I started to follow people.

11
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,674
- Who?
- Anyone at first. Um...

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,176
I mean, that was the whole point.
Somebody at random.

13
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,262
Somebody who didn't know
who I was.

14
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,682
And then?

15
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,977
- And then... nothing.
- "Nothing"?

16
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,563
Nothing. I'd just see...

17
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,940
where they went, what they did...

18
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,152
and go home afterwards.

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,821
Why'd you do it?

20
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,949
Um, to see where they went.

21
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,076
Anyone... I mean...

22
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,539
How can I explain?
You ever, um...

23
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,169
been to a football match,
just let your eyes...

24
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,214
go over, drift across
a crowd of people...

25
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,218
and they slowly stop
and fix on one person...

26
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:01,014
and all of a sudden that person
isn't part of the crowd anymore?

27
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,267
They've become an individual,
just like that.

28
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,312
It just became irresistible.

29
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,357
- So you followed women?
- No, I didn't follow women.

30
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,400
It wasn't a sex thing.
I followed anybody.

31
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,236
I just wanted to see
where they went and what they did.

32
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,906
You were playing secret agent?

33
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,908
No, I'm a writer.

34
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,077
Well, I want to be a writer, anyway.

35
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,997
I was gathering material
for my characters.

36
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,041
Well, to begin with.

37
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,044
After a while,
I spotted the dangers.

38
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,047
I'd become hooked.
I had to start making up rules...

39
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,175
to just try
and keep it under control.

40
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,803
"Never follow people for too long."

41
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,472
"Don't follow women
down dark alleys after dark."

42
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,350
You know, stuff like that.

43
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,311
It was supposed
to just be completely random.

44
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,315
And when it stopped being random...

45
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,901
that's when it started to go wrong.

46
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,073
When I started to follow people...

47
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,410
specific people, when I selected...

48
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,579
a person to follow...

49
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,331
that was when the trouble started.

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,756
Other people are interesting to me.
Have you never...

51
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,634
listened to other people's
conversations on the bus...

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
or on the Tube, seen people,
somebody on the street...

53
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,808
that looks interesting
or is behaving...

54
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,562
slightly... oddly or something
like that and wondered...

55
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,564
what their lives involved,
what they do...

56
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,442
where they come from,
where they go to?

57
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,592
You watch somebody's behavior,
and it raises...

58
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,635
a hundred thousand questions...

59
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:07,182
and I wanted to ask
those questions...

60
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,643
and I wanted to know
what the answers were.

61
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,646
And so I'd follow people
to try and find out.

62
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,651
The most important rule was...

63
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,739
that even if I found out where
somebody worked or where they lived...

64
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,325
then you would never follow
the same person twice.

65
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,994
That was the most important rule.

66
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,413
That was the one that I broke first.

67
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,897
Yes?

68
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,525
- Uh, coffee, please.
- Come on. It's lunch.

69
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,902
Uh, toasted cheese sandwich as well.

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,559
Mind if I join you?

71
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,231
Who and why?

72
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,737
Hi. Yeah, um, I'll have
a black coffee please, and...

73
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,155
What's that?

74
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,949
Another coffee, black.

75
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,414
You're obviously not a policeman, so
who are you and why are you following me?

76
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,499
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

77
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,793
Don't piss me about.
Who the fuck are you?

78
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,339
Oh, thank you very much.

79
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,133
Sugar?

80
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,069
No, I wasn't...
I wasn't following you.

81
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,488
I... I...
I saw you with your bag.

82
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,615
I just thought
you looked interesting.

83
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,034
- What are you, a faggot?
- No, no.

84
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,205
Okay, to tell you the truth,
I thought you were this guy...

85
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,290
that I was at school with.

86
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,794
I saw you walk in here, so I followed
you in just to see if it was him.

87
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,171
- But it wasn't.
- Why didn't you ask me when you saw me?

88
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,800
'Cause I'd have been embarrassed
if it wasn't the person.

89
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,177
Not as embarrassed
as you are now.

90
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,596
- No, I suppose not.
- What's your name?

91
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,473
Bill.

92
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,934
Well, Bill, what do you do?

93
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,895
- Actually, I'm kind of...
- Between jobs right now. Yeah.

94
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,147
- Yeah. That's right.
- What would you do?

95
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,817
- Don't know.
- Oh, come on, Bill.

96
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,654
Don't be coy. There's some burning
ambition inside you, isn't there?

97
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,864
There's something
of the starving artist in you, no?

98
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,825
- No. No.
- No?

99
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,535
- You're a painter.
- No. - Photos.

100
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,620
- No.
- Writer. - No.

101
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,080
- Writer, eh?
- No.

102
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,332
- But you write.
- Not much.

103
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,501
- But sometimes.
- Sometimes. Who doesn't?

104
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,253
Me.

105
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:14,470
- So you're a writer.
- I didn't say that.

106
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,472
What makes you think
I'm a writer, anyway?

107
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,891
An unemployed 20-something...

108
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,311
who fancies himself a writer...
a real leap into the unknown.

109
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:25,565
- Well, I'm not a writer.
- But you're interested in people.

110
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,483
- Yeah.
- This person.

111
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,651
Perhaps.

112
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,653
You haven't even
asked me my name yet...

113
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,197
- What's your name?
- or what's in my bag.

114
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,491
- What bag?
- My bag.

115
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,744
The one you've been
looking at all morning.

116
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,707
What's your name,
and what's in your bag?

117
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,043
My name's Cobb.

118
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,255
Take a look for yourself.

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,554
What were you expecting?
Drugs?

120
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,099
Why would you nick their old CDs?

121
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,895
Easy to grab a load. Easy to sell.
Totally untraceable.

122
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,938
The other stuff's a bit more tricky.

123
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,943
You don't look like a burglar.

124
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,738
Sounds like a compliment.

125
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,782
Are you interested now?

126
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,573
Gloves.

127
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,956
- People don't really do that, do they?
- You'd be surprised.

128
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,679
Does that really work?

129
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,514
Wait and see.

130
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,355
Beginner's luck.

131
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,531
See? Nobody home.

132
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,201
Okay, first things first.
We need a bag.

133
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,411
A bag?

134
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,496
To carry the stuff in.
Why are you whispering?

135
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,857
Don't you have one of your own?

136
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:49,250
Yeah, it's a big bag with
"swag" written right across it.

137
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,043
Ah, bingo.

138
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,213
Okay. What do you fancy?

139
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,894
- Nothing here of any value.
- You don't seem that concerned.

140
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,896
- I don't do it for the money.
- Why do you do it?

141
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,482
For the adrenaline. And because,
like you, I'm interested in people.

142
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,484
You can tell a lot about people
from their stuff.

143
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,237
- How old would you say these people are?
- Don't know.

144
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,574
You can tell a lot from the futon, for
a start. Young people have futons.

145
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,160
Most people wouldn't be
anywhere near 40 with a futon.

146
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,579
And they've got one laundry bag,
which means...

147
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,497
they're probably very used
to each other.

148
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,168
- Probably about 25, over. - They could be
20 and have been living together for years.

149
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,463
Nah. No, look at the books.
They're college-educated.

150
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,215
Probably graduated
when they were 21 or 22.

151
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,343
Moved in together in the last year.

152
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,220
You can tell more from the music.

153
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,139
And here is the box.

154
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,892
- What box?
- Everyone has a box.

155
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,894
With men, it's usually a shoebox.

156
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,939
- Are there valuables in it?
- No. More interesting, more personal.

157
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,941
Things like snapshots, letters...

158
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,652
or trinkets from a Christmas cracker.

159
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,862
See?

160
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,615
Envelope, photo...

161
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,784
little calling cards, notes.

162
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,079
A sort of unconscious collection.
A display.

163
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,915
- What do you mean, "display"?
- Well, display.

164
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,001
Each thing tells something
very intimate about the people.

165
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,295
We're very privileged to see it.
It's very rare.

166
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,842
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the...

167
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,595
What the hell'd you do that for?

168
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,263
It's like a diary.

169
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,642
They hide it, but actually they want
someone to see it. That's what I do.

170
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,852
Concealment, display...
flip sides of the same coin.

171
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,980
This way they know
that someone's seen it.

172
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,191
That's what it's all about...
interrupting someone's life...

173
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,777
making them see all the things
they took for granted.

174
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,530
Like when they go back and buy
all this stuff from the shelves...

175
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,615
with the insurance money,
they'll have to think...

176
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,701
for the first time in a long time...

177
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,870
why they wanted all this stuff,
what it's for.

178
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,872
You take it away...

179
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,083
and show them what they had.

180
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,216
Saucy, eh?
Found these in the last flat.

181
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,053
Think I'll just give them
something to chat about.

182
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,999
Why would you do that?

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,682
She'll find them in his trousers
and ask him what he's been doing.

184
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,893
Yeah, but why would you want
to fuck up their relationship?

185
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,480
Don't you listen?
You take it away...

186
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,025
and show them what they had.

187
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,160
- Fancy a drink?
- You've gotta be joking.

188
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,620
Oh, don't be fooled
by the supermarket label.

189
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,166
I seem to remember I've had this before,
and it was actually quite good.

190
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,754
You'd have had a bit of difficulty
doing this with your gloves on.

191
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,469
- So we actually gonna take anything?
- Anything your heart desires.

192
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,431
Although that's not really the point,
is it? I mean, it's just work.

193
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,892
I thought the whole point of burglary
was taking things.

194
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,562
No, this is the point... breaking in,
entering someone's life...

195
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,606
finding out who they really are.

196
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,150
I mean, don't you just feel it?
Standing here...

197
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,236
drinking their wine...
people we'll never even meet.

198
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,284
Would you like a drink?
I've got some wine.

199
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,496
- Holy f...
- Shh!

200
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,249
You startled us! Are you from the
agency, or are you viewing like us?

201
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,542
What are you doing in my flat?

202
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,295
- Didn't the agent tell you we'd be here
this afternoon? - But we're not moving.

203
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,924
You must be the man of the house.
Congratulations. You have a very nice home.

204
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,597
- But we're not moving.
- Really?

205
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,682
Oh, then I should check
with the agent then, love.

206
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,684
Bye.

207
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,620
Shit. We shouldn't have come up here.
We're gonna have to wait ages to get down.

208
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,455
There's a way up here.

209
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,544
Jesus Christ!
Do you think they believed you?

210
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,796
Of course they didn't
fucking believe me.

211
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,881
What the hell
do you think you were doing?

212
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,676
- I caught them on the hop. We surprised
them. - How do you mean?

213
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,178
That bloke wasn't her boyfriend.
Why do you think he didn't say anything?

214
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,265
No, she was up to no good, and she was
probably glad we weren't her boyfriend.

215
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,059
- You reckon?
- Definitely. Why else would she be home...

216
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,853
in the middle of the afternoon?

217
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,021
No, you just can't plan
for that kind of fucking shit.

218
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,066
We were unlucky. Don't worry about it.
It won't happen again.

219
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,485
- Yeah, well, I'm not so sure.
- Oh, yeah?

220
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, next time you can do
the fucking prep work.

221
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,823
- No, no, I didn't mean...
- No, I mean it.

222
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,700
Take your mark, check it out...

223
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,286
for days, months, years, whatever.

224
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,622
- It'll be the next place we hit.
- Yeah, all right.

225
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,666
- Tell you what.
- What?

226
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,294
I feel bad about pulling
the panty routine on that bloke.

227
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,921
She's gonna give him loads of shit,
and she's the one fooling around.

228
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,485
A beer, please.

229
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,425
- Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

230
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,470
- But you can't sleep with me.
- Why is that?

231
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,639
'Cause I'm with the guy over there.

232
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,892
Not that bald one.

233
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,187
He'll let you buy me a drink,
but sex is completely out of the question.

234
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,942
- Still want to buy me that drink?
- No.

235
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,909
- So what's a nice girl like you...
- Doing in a place like this.

236
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,494
doing with a bald old cunt like that?

237
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,247
It's a long story. And keep your voice
down, 'cause he does own this place.

238
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,124
I was trying to get your attention.

239
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,298
My name's Daniel Lloyd.
My friends call me Danny.

240
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,258
So?

241
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,221
So you've obviously had a bad day...

242
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,308
the kind that makes you feel like
everybody's out for their pound of flesh.

243
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,312
Yeah.

244
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,315
I've been having
quite a lot of days like that.

245
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,322
- Say something to me.
- Like what?

246
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,035
I'll see you outside in ten minutes.

247
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,522
- Oh, I'm sorry. It just...
- Just came apart in your hands.

248
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,484
- It did, actually.
- Yeah, I know. It was broken already.

249
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,319
It's all right.
Somebody dropped it.

250
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,988
I've been meaning to fix it...

251
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,699
but, uh...

252
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,243
I'll probably never get around to it.

253
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,038
So take a seat.
Make yourself at home.

254
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,087
- So about you and this bald guy, then.
- What about him?

255
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,048
- Going out with him?
- Not exactly.

256
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,884
But you and him have
something going.

257
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,012
We used to go out with each other,
but that's been over for a long time.

258
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,014
So why did you tell me
you were with him?

259
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,725
To get rid of you.

260
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,813
So why, when you agreed to have
a drink with me, did we have to come here?

261
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,440
He still gets jealous, and, uh...

262
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,692
- I didn't feel like going back
to my place. - Why not?

263
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,986
I got burgled yesterday.

264
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,408
What's it feel like, being broken into?

265
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,410
Most people ask,
"What did they take?"

266
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,703
I'm curious about the way people feel.

267
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,249
I'm a writer.

268
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,584
Gosh.

269
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,294
- So?
- So?

270
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,714
- So how'd it feel?
- Great.

271
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,591
Sorry.

272
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,928
So this bald guy...
he's dangerous, is he?

273
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,764
- Christ, you are a nosy bastard.
- Dangerous like how?

274
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,767
Dangerous like
criminal-type dangerous.

275
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,270
Dangerous like
"involved in bad things" type dangerous.

276
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,313
- What sort of bad things?
- The usual.

277
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,525
- Girls, drugs, magazines.
- Magazines?

278
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,278
And films. Pornography.
And he owns a couple of clubs.

279
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,739
- Wealthy type?
- Yes.

280
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,033
And refined.

281
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,954
Took me a long time to realize
the kind of things he was capable of.

282
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,623
And what sort of things are they?

283
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,294
Perhaps another time.

284
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,963
I really think I should be going.

285
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,020
Yeah?

286
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,482
- It's me... Bill.
- What the fuck do you want?

287
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,485
- Advice.
- On what?

288
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,571
- On a job.
- What fucking job?

289
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,116
- The job that I told you about.
- Not interested.

290
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,161
Yeah, I know that.
I'm gonna do it myself.

291
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,455
Wanna know something
about protection.

292
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,707
- "Protection"?
- Yeah. You know...

293
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,793
self-defense, weapons,
stuff like that.

294
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,172
Surprisingly enough, I thought
you might be able to give me some advice.

295
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,052
Steel whip.
Nunchucks, they're all right.

296
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,888
Tools are good... sharpened
screwdriver, hammer, chisel...

297
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,974
- "Hammer"?
- Yeah. Medium size. Good rubber grip.

298
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,603
It's very nasty. If you get a claw hammer,
you can pry doors with it.

299
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,314
Slip it into the back
of your waistband, you're set.

300
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,527
You still there?

301
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,713
Why don't you get some of these,
for chrissake?

302
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,716
- Where did you get them?
- Stole them from Middlesex Hospital.

303
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,510
You can't buy them.

304
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,683
Bin-fucking-go.

305
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,399
Okay. You get the bag.
I'll check out the stuff.

306
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,089
- I got one.
- Oh, that's good.

307
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,592
- May not need it, though. There's
fuck-all here. - Really?

308
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:51,054
- Well, what about the telly?
- It's fucking useless.

309
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,141
What are we, burglars or vandals?

310
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,476
Well, if you're a burglar,
why don't you start burgling?

311
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,103
Uh, what about the tapes?

312
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,609
- Not much of a collection, and it's a
bit personal. - What do you mean?

313
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,821
Not the stuff you'd play to your dinner party
guests to fill in gaps in conversation.

314
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:08,960
What sort of music's that?

315
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,491
I don't know. Simply Red,
Fleetwood Mac, that kind of shit.

316
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,744
- He's got taste.
- Each to his own...

317
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,580
but he's a sad fucker
with no social life.

318
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,252
- Ooh. Nice machine.
- Maybe he's a writer.

319
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,504
Nah. If he was a writer,
he'd have a word processor.

320
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,300
This guy wants to be a writer,
and those are two totally separate things.

321
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,764
- You checked this out?
- Uh-huh.

322
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,891
- You watched him go to work?
You saw his routine? - Yeah.

323
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,143
- What's his job?
- He works in a bank.

324
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,771
This guy's unemployed.

325
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,690
- No, he's not.
- Look at the desk. He's unemployed.

326
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,026
People who have jobs don't have
this fucking shit in their homes.

327
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,070
He's either unemployed
or is a student...

328
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:51,198
which means he could be back
any fucking second. What the fuck is that?

329
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,826
I mean, you should recognize
the dole, boy. His fucking UB40!

330
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,954
You fucking asshole! You didn't
check this out at all. We're going now.

331
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,750
We're not gonna take anything?

332
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,752
No, we're not.
I don't feel like scrounging off...

333
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,004
some poor dole-head fucker...
no offense.

334
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,007
None taken.

335
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,595
Let's go to someplace
I've checked out.

336
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,548
Hi. Make yourself at home.
I'll be down in just a minute.

337
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,607
- Nice place.
- Thanks.

338
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,942
Feel a bit funny about it,
you know, since...

339
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,528
someone's been going through my stuff.
It's sort of creepy.

340
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,113
What'd they take?

341
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,283
Books, my camera, CDs.

342
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,578
They even took a bag
from my cupboard to take it away in.

343
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,790
- Apparently that's pretty standard.
- Must be terrible, losing all that stuff.

344
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,376
Insurance will cover most of it.
It's personal stuff that's worse.

345
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,253
"Personal stuff"? Like what?

346
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,964
They, um,
rifled through my underwear.

347
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,383
Shit. Why would they do that?

348
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,262
Come on. You know the kind of kinky,
voyeuristic shit men get into.

349
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,015
No, I'm sorry.
I'm not into any of that.

350
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,645
One other thing they did was
they took one of my earrings.

351
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,523
The didn't take the pair, they just
took one, just to really fuck me off.

352
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,942
You probably misplaced
the other one or something.

353
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,861
Oh, no. I mean,
I had them on my dresser.

354
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,988
I came back,
and there was just one.

355
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,325
- So you just wear the other one now.
- Gives me something to talk about.

356
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,995
I'll, uh...
I'll go and get some clothes on.

357
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,863
Bill?

358
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,214
Saucy, eh?

359
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,217
You haven't found a bag yet?

360
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,429
- Is this her flat?
- Yeah. She's a fox.

361
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,514
She's got pictures
of herself everywhere.

362
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,683
Yeah. She looks good.

363
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,977
Look at this stuff.

364
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,449
- You should take some of this stuff.
- No way.

365
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,576
Suit yourself.
I'm gonna take some, though.

366
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,661
Look at her. She's a babe.

367
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,801
Bingo.

368
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,096
Why does she have
so many pictures of herself?

369
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,974
I think she's a model.
She's certainly vain.

370
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,646
Is that about it?

371
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,650
Yeah, I guess
that covers the useful stuff.

372
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,489
Stereo's too big.

373
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,659
Piano definitely too big.
I think...

374
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,495
I'll just misplace this for her.

375
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,640
- What is this place?
- Used to be offices.

376
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,226
- How'd you get the keys?
- Broke in, changed the locks.

377
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,561
It's owned by one of those
management places, you know?

378
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,731
They never come around, and if they do, they'll
just think they've mixed up their keys.

379
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,944
Eventually they'll break in and change
the locks, but I'll be long gone by then.

380
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,863
London's full of these dead spaces.

381
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,907
Above restaurants or shops.
Whole buildings.

382
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,826
- Do we leave the stuff here?
- No, that's your job.

383
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,621
You hang on to it till I let you know
we're ready to fence it.

384
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,623
- Okay.
- Unless...

385
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,709
you want to try to sell it yourself
and give me half of what you get.

386
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,670
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

387
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,923
Look, I was hard on you
on that last place...

388
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,842
but you've got to understand:
I won't let anybody put me at risk.

389
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,427
- It's dangerous enough already.
- Sure.

390
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,098
- An early supper, I think.
- I really can't afford it.

391
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,433
- It's covered.
- Yeah?

392
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,269
Okay.

393
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,109
Authentic, I don't know,
but I like it.

394
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,695
So you keep on coming in here?

395
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,530
- I know. I like it, but...
- Why, I don't know.

396
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,074
No, I do know why.

397
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,076
- Why?
- Well, because there's no windows...

398
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,371
and because it's dark, and nobody
can see you in the alcoves...

399
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,791
and so perhaps the bald guy
wouldn't come past.

400
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,460
- Maybe.
- Maybe. Maybe this is where you bring

401
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,964
all the guys you go out with,
because you know that he's...

402
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,550
not just gonna be walking by,
popping in.

403
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,929
- Maybe.
- Maybe, yeah.

404
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,432
I thought it was over
between you two.

405
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,934
It is.

406
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,146
So how come you still go
to basement bars, then...

407
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,148
so that you can't be seen by him?

408
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:53,526
- Because, as I've told you before...
- Because you're afraid of him, 'cause he's...

409
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,445
- Because he's dangerous.
- Dangerous.

410
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,573
Dangerous... How-How dangerous?
You keep on saying he's dangerous.

411
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,950
You never explain to me...

412
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,119
why you're so afraid of him.

413
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,455
Okay.

414
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,457
He came around to my flat...

415
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,835
with a couple of his associates...

416
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:14,797
and... I didn't really know
what all this was about...

417
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,842
until this other guy arrived...

418
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,261
who apparently owed them
some money.

419
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,764
They didn't like this very much,
so they got a hammer.

420
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,144
They held him down, and they smashed
every single one of his fingers.

421
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:37,612
And then they smashed his skull.

422
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,533
Someone get me
a tea towel or something.

423
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,832
You're joking with me.

424
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,459
No.

425
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,756
- You're not joking with me.
- Uh-uh.

426
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:03,137
This is why you don't
go out with him anymore.

427
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,016
No. No, no. That's because
he made a mess on my carpet.

428
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,853
That's not funny.

429
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,647
I know.

430
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,116
How on earth did you get
to fall in with somebody like this?

431
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,530
Let's just change the subject, all right?

432
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:26,953
He's not the sort of bloke I'd have
thought you'd normally associate with.

433
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,539
- Come on.
- What were you doing? Were you...

434
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,916
"working" for him at the time?

435
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:39,424
That is none of your business.

436
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,969
I think you better find someone else
to start telling you little stories.

437
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,054
Oh, come on.
I was just joking.

438
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,390
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

439
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,268
Think, think, think, think, think, think.

440
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,588
You're developing a taste for it.

441
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,424
The violating, the voyeurism...
oh, it's definitely you.

442
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,635
- I think not.
- I think so.

443
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,929
And before long you'll have developed a taste
for all the things that go with the proceeds.

444
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,973
- Such as?
- Well, all this.

445
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,435
Do you make all your money
through burglary?

446
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,228
No, not all of it.

447
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,482
- In fact, you're gonna pay for this.
- I told you: I can't afford to.

448
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,902
Don't worry. It won't really be you.
It'll be D. Lloyd that pays for this.

449
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,488
I thought I'd give you the pleasure
of pretending to pay.

450
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,366
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Sign it.

451
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,117
- "Sign it"?
- Sign it.

452
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,454
In your own handwriting.
Then you can do anything you want with it.

453
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,373
"D. Lloyd."

454
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,057
Don't you ever worry
about being caught?

455
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,352
Why else would I do it?
Besides, I'm not gonna get caught.

456
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,855
- What, you've thought it all through?
- I've thought it all through.

457
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,860
This is only the tip of the iceberg.

458
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,987
I will do things
that you don't even believe.

459
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,240
- Such as...
- Example:

460
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,450
Sometimes when I'm watching a flat,
I'll see that the owners...

461
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,494
are about to go on holiday.

462
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,872
I'll wait till they're gone,
then move in for a week or two.

463
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,165
You've got to be joking.

464
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,292
No. Happens a lot more
than you'd believe.

465
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,002
How do you know
when they're gonna be back?

466
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,004
It's almost always marked
on the kitchen calendar.

467
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:31,048
Christ.

468
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,887
Jesus fucking Christ!

469
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,723
- What's wrong?
- The woman... from the first flat.

470
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,183
- The one we broke into. She
just walked in. - Are you sure?

471
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,310
- Yes, I am fucking sure.
- Is she with the same bloke?

472
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:44,729
- No.
- It's all right, then.

473
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:47,273
- What if she sees us? - She's with
her partner. She can't do anything.

474
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,525
I think that's
one hell of a chance to take.

475
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,319
What's she gonna say? We stole half a
bottle of indifferent red wine? Calm down.

476
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:55,072
- Do you mind if we skip dessert?
- Yes, I fucking mind.

477
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,533
- She's coming this way.
- She's going to the loo.

478
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,410
- She saw me.
- Oh, yeah?

479
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,329
She saw me. She recognizes us.
I think we should leave.

480
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,039
Okay.

481
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,543
We'll leave. Not that we've got
anything to worry about...

482
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,588
except for you making
a fucking twat out of yourself.

483
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,178
I really hate it when I don't get to finish
a good meal with a cup of coffee.

484
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:19,263
- Yeah, but...
- Don't fucking say it.

485
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,390
She got a second look at me.
She recognized me.

486
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,309
That sort of thing makes me nervous.

487
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,728
If you're so worried about your appearance,
why don't you change it?

488
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,730
You know, new haircut,
new set of clothes.

489
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,816
Your mother won't recognize you. Just
because you break into people's homes...

490
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,778
doesn't mean you have to look
like a fucking burglar.

491
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,023
"Everybody has a box."

492
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,715
- Yeah?
- Hello. It's Bill.

493
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,717
Oh, hello, Bill.
What can I do for you?

494
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,011
Not much. It's about the stuff.

495
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,596
What about the stuff?

496
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:33,267
I've, uh, met this guy.
Said he would fence most of it.

497
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,853
I thought I'd have a go myself,
like you said.

498
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:39,690
I don't reckon
I'll get as much as you could...

499
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:43,819
but, um, you'll have half
of whatever I get.

500
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,404
How does that sound?

501
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,406
Well, that sounds fine.
Anything else?

502
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,533
- Yeah, I took your advice.
- What advice?

503
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,453
About changing my appearance.
Got my hair cut. I'm all dressed up.

504
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,204
With no place to go.

505
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,665
God, Bill, I wasn't being
entirely serious about that, you know?

506
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,834
Yeah.

507
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,378
I just feel better this way.

508
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,880
- Safer, huh?
- Safer.

509
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,215
I'll give you a ring
when I get the money.

510
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,051
Right.

511
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,057
What was all that about?

512
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,059
You.

513
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:18,520
Your stuff, anyway.
He's gonna deal with it himself.

514
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,606
Meaning?

515
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:22,900
Meaning he took the bait,
and he's hooked.

516
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:26,737
He's gonna hang on to the stuff,
pretend to sell it, give me some money.

517
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,281
You may even get most of it back,
if you're lucky.

518
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,034
God, it's perfect.
The photos worked.

519
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,787
I even got him to cut his hair
and change his clothes.

520
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:38,457
So does that mean you'll tell me
where you hid my earring?

521
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,917
No.

522
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,044
And I wouldn't wait
for your panties either.

523
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,046
He's too embarrassed
to give those back to you.

524
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,423
Shit. And did you have
to break my window?

525
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,675
Couldn't you have found
a key or something?

526
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:51,011
No, that would've been
three spare keys in a row.

527
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,639
Even Bill's not going to fall for that.

528
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,433
God, it was so embarrassing
when we went to his place.

529
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,436
Right under the mat, just like I told him.
It's totally pathetic.

530
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,522
It was a new mat as well,
and I seriously think...

531
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,066
he bought this mat just so
he could put the key under it.

532
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,815
Fuck off.

533
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,651
How did you know it was me?

534
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,946
That could've been your mother
you just told to fuck off.

535
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,739
I meant it.

536
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,243
Oh, come on. Let me in.
I've come to apologize.

537
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,594
- So apologize.
- I haven't been entirely honest with you.

538
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,598
I'm doing a piece about burglaries.

539
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,267
What?

540
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,063
I'm writing about burglaries,
about a friend of mine...

541
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,232
who breaks into people's houses.

542
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,944
That's why I asked you
so many questions about your break-in.

543
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,947
I didn't tell you at the time 'cause
I didn't want to upset you too much.

544
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:00,325
He's been breaking in, and I've been...
I haven't stolen anything.

545
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,746
I just go along and...
see what happens.

546
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,207
Is that it?

547
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,751
Yes.

548
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,795
What's that got to do with anything?

549
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,757
Now I've been honest with you.
I want you to return the favor.

550
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,011
- I have been honest with you.
- You're still seeing the bald guy.

551
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,638
I was early the other day,
and I saw him leave.

552
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,683
- You said it was over.
- It is.

553
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,602
Then why are you still seeing him?

554
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,231
He's blackmailing me.

555
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,610
- He's rich. Why on earth would he...
- I didn't say anything about money.

556
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,613
- What's he blackmailing you with?
- Photos.

557
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,115
Of?

558
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,159
Of me.

559
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,976
Don't ask me anything else. I'm not
feeding your seedy little fantasies.

560
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:46,413
You've got me all wrong, you know.

561
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,332
- Have I?
- Yes.

562
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,461
- Where are these pictures?
- In his office. Why?

563
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,547
- I could take them.
- How?

564
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,467
I could break in.
Me and this guy could do it.

565
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,219
There's got to be some valuable stuff
in his office, right?

566
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,556
- He sometimes keeps some money in
his safe. - We can't get into his safe.

567
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,017
- That's where the photos are.
- What?

568
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:10,020
They're in an envelope...
the negatives and some of the prints.

569
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,148
- We can't do that.
- I know the combination.

570
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,816
How?

571
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,526
I've seen him open it
loads of times.

572
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,653
I thought I might be able
to lift them myself.

573
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,199
That's what we'll do, then.

574
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:31,208
No one in their right minds
would steal from him.

575
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,336
If we don't get caught, it's not gonna
matter who it was we stole from...

576
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,546
and we're not going to get caught.

577
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,135
If you get them,
you won't look at the photos...

578
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,221
and you won't even look
in the envelope.

579
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,265
- Of course not.
- I've got your word on that?

580
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,393
You have my word.

581
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,875
- You're late.
- Sorry.

582
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,420
I thought you said
you were gonna fence it yourself.

583
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,505
I got rid of most of it.

584
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,938
It'll take me a couple days
to get rid of all this.

585
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,982
That's what I thought.

586
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,655
Is there something else
on your mind?

587
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,283
Yeah. I want to hit a place.

588
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,368
I've been scouting out
a couple places.

589
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,329
- A particular place. For some photos.
- "Photos"?

590
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,707
Yeah, for a friend.

591
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:57,669
- What's the place? - The photos are in
a safe, but I've got the combination.

592
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,172
Well, if it's for a friend,
where's the money in it?

593
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:03,175
Money's in the safe... probably.

594
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:06,428
"Probably." Whose office?

595
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,389
- A club owner. Pornographer type.
- Heavy?

596
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,224
Yeah, looks like it.

597
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,691
What the fuck's going on?

598
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:25,113
- I'm seeing someone.
- Who?

599
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,825
- The owner of that bag.
- What?

600
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,870
The woman whose house we hit,
the one with the pictures of herself.

601
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,039
Tell me you're fucking joking.

602
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,665
No.

603
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:39,961
I thought she looked interesting,
I followed her...

604
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:44,090
- we had a drink, and... now we're involved.
- Have you slept with her?

605
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:48,094
Yeah. We're gettin' on really well.

606
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:51,515
I wanted to give some of her stuff back
to her, but I thought that would mean...

607
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,266
You thought that would mean telling her
that you fucking robbed her!

608
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,520
How shrewd! I mean, how fucking
prudent of you not to tell her that!

609
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,773
That's a nice haircut, though.

610
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,483
Nice suit as well.

611
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,360
- Pity about the bloodstains on it.
- What blood...

612
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,104
You're on your own now.

613
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,898
Here.
Here's a present for you...

614
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:45,318
to get you started
on your new solo career.

615
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:01,144
- Did you have to beat him?
- Did you have to sleep with him?

616
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,521
- You told me to.
- I said you should if you had to...

617
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:06,066
but that's not really the same
as telling you to.

618
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:12,030
- Did you enjoy it?
- Did you enjoy beating him up?

619
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,658
Of course.

620
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:21,122
Look, I'm in deep shit.
This is going to work.

621
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,124
Do they really think
you're involved?

622
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,168
They've already had me in
for questioning, haven't they?

623
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,755
It's not gonna be long before they find
the guy who saw me leave and pull me in.

624
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,715
- Did he get a good look at you?
- No.

625
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,801
Which is why I think
this is gonna work.

626
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,011
All we need is someone
of roughly the same appearance...

627
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,889
roughly the same way of working,
and we should be fine.

628
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,350
Just tell them what really happened,
that you found her like that.

629
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,519
No, you wouldn't say that
if you saw what I saw.

630
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,562
No, I mean, this is horrible.

631
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:47,440
There's blood everywhere.

632
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,694
I mean, her head has been beaten.
She doesn't even look human anymore.

633
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,862
I mean, I'd been there a while.

634
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:56,199
I may have left traces, prints,
forensic shit. I don't know.

635
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,452
The point is, the body's fresh.
It hasn't been dead long.

636
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,330
Any witness might put me there
close enough to the time of death.

637
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,499
You just said the witness
didn't get a good look at you.

638
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,501
No, but that's not the point, is it?

639
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,878
A crime that brutal...
an old lady beaten to death.

640
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,965
If they even think it's me, they're gonna
try and pin it on me, aren't they?

641
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,759
No, we've got to have someone else.
I've even told them there's someone else.

642
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,304
- And if he's got an alibi?
- Well, he's a loner.

643
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,973
He's perfect.

644
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,600
Even strangers that have seen him before
aren't gonna recognize him...

645
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,061
because he's had his hair cut.

646
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,230
No, he's our man.

647
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:52,922
I've got it.

648
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:56,718
I've got to drop off
the fucking money first.

649
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,346
Money. Bundles of fucking money.

650
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,725
Ow!

651
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,727
Nothing. Nothing.

652
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:10,899
"Okay"?

653
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,567
"Okay"?

654
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,781
I'll... I'll be around soon.

655
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,035
You promised me
you wouldn't open the envelope.

656
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,620
It wasn't sealed. They fell out.

657
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,832
- "They fell out."
- So are you gonna explain?

658
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,836
I mean, what was it? Was it all
just bullshit to get hold of the money?

659
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,796
There isn't usually any in there.

660
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,673
Well, what, then?

661
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,179
It was for a friend.

662
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,849
The police think he did something,
and he didn't...

663
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:29,811
so he needs a decoy,
another likely suspect.

664
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:33,857
Someone caught robbing a place using
the same way he does it, his methods.

665
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:35,692
"His methods"?

666
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,778
Who is the friend?

667
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:41,823
Cobb.

668
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,868
Broke into a place
a couple of weeks ago.

669
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:47,161
He found an old lady
bashed to death.

670
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:49,789
He ran off. Someone saw him.

671
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,001
Couple of days later, the police called him in
for questioning. They think he killed her.

672
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,336
He probably did.

673
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,714
No, he's a thief.
He's not a murderer.

674
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,425
So he told them
that they'd got him confused...

675
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,595
with another burglar he knew,
one who used the same MO.

676
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:06,097
Why me?

677
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,142
You set yourself up for it.

678
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:13,271
Cobb noticed you following him
days before he actually approached you.

679
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,356
Well, initially he thought
you were police...

680
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,734
- and then he followed you.
- He followed me?

681
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:22,196
He followed you
and realized you were just...

682
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,908
this sad little fucker
waiting to be used.

683
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:27,785
So you and Cobb just went for it.

684
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:30,747
How could you do this to me?

685
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:33,041
To anybody?

686
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:36,169
It's not that serious.

687
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:38,796
You've got the money.
You didn't kill the old lady.

688
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:42,133
You're just there to plant doubt
in the minds of the police.

689
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,427
They'll never charge you.

690
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,763
You were supposed to get caught
tonight breaking in.

691
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:50,058
They'd pull you in, ask you about the old
lady, and you wouldn't know anything.

692
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,727
They could still have charged me
for breaking and entering.

693
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,396
But you did break and enter.

694
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,774
And for whatever reason,
you didn't get caught red-handed.

695
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,863
He came in. He went down.

696
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,825
I didn't hang around long enough
to find out whether he could get up.

697
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,870
It's his blood on my hammer.

698
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:14,290
How could you do this to me?

699
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,876
It's nothing personal.

700
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,545
When I began this,
I didn't even know you.

701
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:29,222
- I'm going to the police in the morning.
- You can't.

702
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,809
I'm going,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

703
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:34,811
You can't,
'cause they won't believe you.

704
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:37,105
I'm gonna tell them everything.
They'll believe me because it's the truth.

705
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,316
- Not if you haven't got someone
to back up your story. - You could.

706
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,944
I won't.

707
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:46,531
They'll make you, because your lies
won't stand up to the truth.

708
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,665
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

709
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,338
That's it.

710
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,718
I mean, if you've got
any questions, then...

711
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,387
One or two.

712
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,473
You see, we don't actually have
any unsolved murders of old ladies...

713
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,226
- at the present.
- You must have.

714
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,564
There's no such ongoing investigation.

715
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,191
And we don't know
this Mr. Cobb of yours.

716
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,362
I warned you
he'd look in the envelope.

717
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,532
He gave me his word.
I believed him.

718
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,909
It's nothing personal.
He couldn't help it.

719
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:34,037
I mean, he's a born peeper.

720
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,877
Anyway, down to business.

721
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,212
"Business"?

722
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,216
Perhaps there's...

723
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,386
something else
you'd like to tell me, hmm?

724
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,973
Anything.

725
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:58,394
- Where's the hammer?
- It's in that bag.

726
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,648
What are you gonna do with it?

727
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,737
The old man was very specific
about how I should do things.

728
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,866
What's the old man
got to say about it?

729
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:15,161
Well, he is letting me keep
all the money from his safe.

730
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,706
Anything at all.

731
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,541
Your side of things.

732
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,671
He says your demands
have become too unreasonable.

733
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:28,091
You've become too greedy
in your blackmail.

734
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,927
He said something
about you being a witness...

735
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,429
to an incident
that happened in this very room.

736
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:37,475
He was very precise about exactly
how and where I should take care of things.

737
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,936
Something about
a bloodstained carpet...

738
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,688
that you've got stashed away
to back up your story...

739
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:44,941
should it ever be told.

740
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,277
Did you talk to her?

741
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,613
We found her this morning.

742
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:54,992
What do you mean, "found her"?

743
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,911
Her body.

744
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:01,541
We also found a hammer
with two types of blood on it.

745
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,336
One type I assume will match
the bloke you put in hospital.

746
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,381
All her fingers were smashed.

747
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,800
You must have tortured her
to get the combination.

748
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,969
I didn't touch her!

749
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,931
We also found
some interesting items in your flat...

750
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,767
in this shoebox under your bed.

751
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:24,021
Among various items reported missing
by the deceased last week, we found...

752
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:27,150
these pairs of ladies' underwear.

753
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:29,193
Are they hers?

754
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,363
I assume so,
since we found them stashed...

755
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,324
with these passport-style
photographs of the deceased.

756
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,621
We also found this pearl earring...

757
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:43,166
which exactly matched...

758
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,043
the one worn by the deceased
at the time of her death.

759
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,713
- A little trophy?
- No.

760
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,341
It was Cobb who planted it
when we turned over her place.

761
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:55,136
Go and collar him.
I gave you his address.

762
01:06:56,763 --> 01:07:00,183
We checked the address you gave us.
There's no Cobb there.

763
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:02,852
The flat belongs to a Mr...

764
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:06,355
D. Lloyd.

765
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,984
He's just returned from holiday...

766
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:13,696
and he told us that while he was away,
his flat had been burgled.

767
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:15,948
Not much was missing...

768
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:19,493
but his new credit card
hasn't yet arrived.

769
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,913
Well, that was Cobb.
We used it to...

770
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,540
pay for a meal in a restaurant.

771
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,043
We found this at your flat.

772
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,671
It was Cobb...

773
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,591
who stole it.

774
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,927
Is that your handwriting?

775
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,223
Yes.
