2
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,120
And we were born on September 15...

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,663
1989.

4
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,540
- And...
- And she's the older... Older twin.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,000
- I'm older by 10 minutes.
- She's... Ten minutes.

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,295
'Cause she had an umbilical cord
wrapped around her neck.

7
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,630
And she, like,
shoved me in there and wouldn't let me out.

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,215
I was, like, kicking her in,

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,134
shoving her more in my mom,

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,720
- so that's why she came out, like, later.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,513
- And...
- She came out the bigger twin, too.

12
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,808
Well, I came out a pound heavier than Kara,

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,977
so that's why I'm an inch taller now.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,271
She's always been, like, a pound heavier.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,564
No.

16
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,942
So, yeah, it's...
You know, I love being twins, man. It's...

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,278
It's basically
like you have a bag of spare parts.

18
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,363
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

19
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,906
It's, like, I need a kidney down the road,

20
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,991
I know he's got one, so I'm always like,

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,618
"Hey, stay healthy, dude. Eat right."

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,579
When we were kids,
we had our own secret language

23
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,248
that only me and my brother understood.

24
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,759
I guess, when we were kids,
we thought we were whales.

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,344
Like, when things are bad,

26
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,929
we don't really got to say anything
to each other.

27
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,682
We just make these sounds. It's like...

28
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,396
So, I just graduated from Harvard,
and I'm starting a new job

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,191
at a law firm in Southern California,
so I'm really happy about that.

30
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,278
And I got a job at Hooters. I'm happy, too.

31
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,530
Hooters!

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,534
Being a twin is like being a married
couple, and you can't divorce her.

33
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,787
Even, like...
I mean, I love her when we're together

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,580
Well, actually, more so when we're distant.

35
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,332
She loves nature, like me.

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,711
She loves donating her time to charities.

37
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,005
And she loves eating healthy,
so that's awesome.

38
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,965
She's my best friend.

39
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,384
My best friend is my boyfriend.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,086
Pepto-Bismol, take 43.

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,671
And action!

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,550
Please, why do I have
to have such diarrhea?

43
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,553
You need to drink the pink.

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,098
- Hold it. Cut! Cut! Jack!
- What is he doing?

45
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,432
Jack, are you watching this?

46
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,393
What do you mean, "Cut," man?

47
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,353
I... I got to be at Sesame
{y:i}Street by 1:00.

48
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,563
Hey, hey, hey, Reeg,
do you really have diarrhea?

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,690
'Cause you lost weight or something.

50
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,901
Why does the stomach
have all the good lines?

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,319
"Drink the pink." That's funny.

52
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,445
I'm sorry, Jack.

53
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,406
The Dunkin' Donut people
want to talk to us.

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,740
Okay, well, I got to...

55
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,950
Regis, it's going to be fine.

56
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
Yeah, and you'll take care of that, and...

57
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,745
Thank you very much.
I didn't need that, but cool.

58
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,330
I got some bad news.

59
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,124
We may lose Dunkin' Donuts.

60
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,543
What do you mean "lose"?
They didn't like our pitches?

61
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,003
They want Al Pacino.

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,256
Al Pacino to do a commercial?

63
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,632
{y:i}The Godfather Al {y:i}Pacino?

64
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,135
They got this new coffee drink,
the Dunkaccino.

65
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,346
Dunkaccino, Al Pacino, they sound alike.

66
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,348
- Yes.
- Well, they think it'll be a home run.

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,641
Of course it would be a home run,

68
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,226
if he would ever do it, which he won't.

69
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,477
Yeah, well, never say never.

70
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,854
Remember, you didn't think
we could get Brad Pitt

71
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
to do that RadioShack commercial.

72
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,773
I was right.

73
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,692
Well, you can't be right all the time.

74
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,444
Look, bottom line,

75
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,196
they're going to give us one month
to make this whole Pacino thing happen,

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,322
or they're going to go elsewhere.

77
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,951
We can't lose Dunkin' Donuts.
They're our biggest client.

78
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,162
Damn it. We're going to go bankrupt, buddy.

79
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
And we have 200 employees relying on us.

80
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,626
Try to have a good Thanksgiving, okay?

81
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,298
What do you think? Would Al Pacino
ever do a Dunkin' Donuts commercial?

83
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,425
What?

84
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,718
Yeah.

85
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,470
Shut up.

86
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,929
- Did my wife call?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,349
You're all set for the cruise.
You guys leave a week after Hanukkah.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,142
Okay, all right. There's some good news.

89
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,312
Yeah. She converted, right? That's so cool.
She doesn't look Jewish at all.

90
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,315
Wow. That was anti-Semitic.

91
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,900
What? No, I just...

92
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,277
See, I can say that, you can't.
You're not Jewish.

93
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,862
No, but I'm close.

94
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,197
What... What does that mean?

95
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,531
I'm an atheist.

96
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,201
- You're two for two right there.
- What? No...

97
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,412
Anyways, did my sister say
what time she's flying in tomorrow?

98
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,747
Yeah, I was supposed to
pick her up at noon,

99
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,998
but she switched the flight to earlier,

100
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,375
so now she gets in at 4:00 in the morning.

101
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,459
Why?

102
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,752
Something about jet lag

103
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,797
She never listens. She gains three hours.

104
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,091
Every year, she acts like
she's flying to New Zealand.

105
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,342
She's a freak, man.

106
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,427
Yeah, again, you can't say that.

107
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,762
No, I...

108
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,355
- Honey...
- Yeah?

109
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,648
Try complimenting her.

110
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,274
Yeah. What?

111
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,818
To avoid fighting.

112
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,194
Just focus on something positive.

113
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,531
Tell Jill that she has nice shoes.

114
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,992
Nice shoes. That's good. That'll work.

115
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,328
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, too.

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,830
And I love my sister.

117
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,582
And I can keep my cool.
It's only four days.

118
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,963
I love my sister. I love her shoes.

119
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,888
Well, I just...

120
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,057
I can't find him anywhere.

121
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,351
Does he know what terminal it is?

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,145
I...

123
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,063
Okay, okay, I see him.

124
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,356
All right, I'm hanging up.

125
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,400
How are we doing?

126
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,360
Where were you?

127
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,237
I've been waiting forever for you.

128
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,864
This place is creeping me out.

129
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,991
Why so many bags?
Are the Knicks traveling with you?

130
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,367
- What is with this?
- Mom always said,

131
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,454
"it's better to have it and not need it
than to need it and not have it."

132
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,789
Yeah, she did say that.
I remember that. That was cool.

133
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,916
Are you going bald?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,586
No, no, no, no. You're getting fatter,
and your hair doesn't realize

135
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,962
that it needs to cover more face.

136
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,339
- Okay.
- Where'd you put the car?

137
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,091
You really had to bring your bird?

138
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,634
Yeah, she's my best friend.

139
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,471
- Anyways, Jill, I was thinking...
- Yeah?

140
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,097
The house is going to be very crowded

141
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,183
'cause we got the kids, and all the guests

142
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,934
are coming by, and blah, blah, blah.

143
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,937
So, there's this new hotel,
a Hilton that they just built down...

144
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,231
But I want to spend time
with Sofie and Gary.

145
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,359
Why, do you not want me to stay with you?

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,402
No, no, no, no.
Of course I want you to stay with us.

147
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,695
I was just... I was just saying.

148
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,572
Okay, I'll stay with you, then.

149
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,533
It's too bad,
'cause the hotel was starting to sound fun.

150
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,079
Why are you doing that?
Why do you sigh so loud?

151
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,332
I just really, really love your shoes.

152
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,625
You are so weird.

153
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,335
Isn't he weird, Poopsie?

154
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,212
Where were you?

155
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,255
Poopsie gets it.

156
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,008
Yeah. Poopsie really gets it.

157
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,135
She always did get it. I... It's just...

158
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,388
She always loved getting it.

159
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,307
And then your dad and I
went to the soup kitchen,

160
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,019
and they gave us Otto
to bring to Thanksgiving dinner this year.

161
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,064
Thanks again for having me. It's very nice.

162
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,066
Are you going to eat
dinner with us tonight?

163
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,401
Yes, he is, honey.

164
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,902
And what about tomorrow night?

165
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,655
Tomorrow, Otto's going to go back home...

166
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,781
Less.

167
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,075
Sorry.

168
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,538
Sofia, show Otto your karate moves.

169
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,334
You know, why don't...
Why don't you go wake up Jill?

170
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,086
- What?
- It's 5330.

171
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,214
She's here. That's the important thing.
It counts as a day.

172
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,299
- So what? She's sleeping.
- Jackâ.

173
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,011
- All right, I'll go check on Jill.
- Thank you.

174
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,100
It's okay, Otto. It's just her

175
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,025
Jill.

176
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,902
Wake up.

177
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,489
Okay, stay sleeping...

178
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,741
Jet lag.

179
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,784
- I have a gun!
- Oh, my God!

180
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,374
You see, I live alone.
Poopsie's trained to watch out for me.

181
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,501
Don't sneak up like that, all right?

182
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,003
Where were you?

183
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,629
I don't...

184
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,215
Come downstairs. The food's ready.

185
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,593
Can you just lay down with me
for five minutes?

186
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,595
I'm not laying down with you. No.

187
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,097
Come on. I just want some twin time.

188
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,516
I'm a grown man.
I'm not laying next to you.

189
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,894
Just have Poopsie lay with you.
I... I don't know.

190
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,771
All right.

191
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,566
I'll take a bath,
and I'll meet you downstairs in an hour.

192
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,363
Good looking out, Poopsie.

193
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,324
Don't forget your sweat shadow.

194
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,034
What?

195
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,495
All right,
just take your bath and all that stuff,

196
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,663
and then burn those sheets.

197
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,834
Hey, guys.

198
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,088
Jill! You look amazing.

199
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,839
Macy's, Marshalls.

200
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,592
Hey, where am I sitting?

201
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,718
What do you mean?

202
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,929
'Cause, usually, I sit next to you.

203
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,764
So all of a sudden, I'm...
I'm not going to sit here?

204
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,100
Would you...

205
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,434
I thought you could sit down here.

206
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,602
I always sit next to Jack.

207
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,146
- Is there a reason I'm moving?
- No.

208
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,315
Jill, if you'd like, you could sit here.
I'd be happy to move.

209
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,693
That's okay. You're fine.

210
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,820
If you want to... If you...
Do you want to sit here?

211
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,114
I don't know.

212
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,075
Okay, you just sit in my chair. How's that?

213
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,243
- There you go.
- All right, thank you.

214
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,329
- Gary, is that you?
- Yes, it is.

215
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,498
- Look how handsome you are.
- Thank you.

216
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,791
It's so nice to see you.

217
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,751
Look at this leaf. Look at this.

218
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,169
You have it taped on you?

219
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,379
- That's so cute.
- Yes.

220
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,505
Why did he do that?

221
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,840
He likes tape.

222
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,300
Hey. Sofie, is that you, or is that you?

223
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,554
Good to see you, Erin.

224
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,180
Good to see you, Jill.

225
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,640
- How was your flight?
- The house looks amazing.

226
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,267
You got a new chandelier?

227
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,727
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,562
I loved the old one.

229
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,983
So, how's every bodyâs Gobble-Gobble Day?

230
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,818
- Great.
- Excellent.

231
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,738
By the way, Jill, this is Otto. Otto.

232
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,156
Nice to meet you.

233
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,575
Nice to meet you.

234
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,619
He's homeless, right?

235
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,873
He seems clean, but you should put

236
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,334
one of those toilet seat protectors
underneath him

237
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,128
to make sure he doesn't ruin the chair.

238
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,256
Are you whispering
with a bullhorn or something?

239
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,758
Everybody hears you.

240
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,011
No, they can't, Mr. Hearing Expert.

241
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,307
- So...
- Pass that down, Daddy.

242
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,851
I'm allowed out here once a year,
so I tend to miss things.

243
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,519
What's going on? Anything new?

244
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,440
Well, Sofie just got her
green belt in karate

245
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,693
How come I didn't know about this?

246
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,613
I didn't even know she did karate.
What... I mean,

247
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,115
{y:i}I feel like I'm in the
Twilight Zone right now.

248
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,868
I'm like Jimmy Stewart
at the end of that movie,

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,537
the one where...
They... They're in Pottersville.

250
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,581
What... What is that... That movie called?

251
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,124
{y:i}It's a Wonderful Life?

252
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,668
No, no, with Jimmy Stewart.

253
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,545
The... The one where he meets the angel
and he's mad.

254
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,506
{y:i}It's a Wonderful Life.

255
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,091
Why do you keep saying that?

256
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,385
No, the one where he falls in the pool

257
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,221
{y:i}and he sings Buffalo Gals.

258
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,889
He gets all the money at the end,

259
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,934
and he finds out
that his life really is wonderful.

260
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,019
Star Wars.

261
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,522
They play it every Christmas.

262
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,191
You must have saw it
before Jack made you convert.

263
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,609
What? What are you doing right now?

264
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,153
Your brother didn't
make me do anything, Jill.

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,406
Everyone has to be like Jack over here.

266
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,824
Even poor Gary.

267
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,076
What? What does that mean?

268
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,286
You made him switch from being Indian.

269
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,705
What is wrong with you?

270
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,540
We adopted him when he was 10 days old.

271
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,958
This is all he knows.

272
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,378
Did you ever think maybe he tapes things
to himself

273
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,755
'cause he doesn't feel connected?

274
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,841
You know, to his real parents?

275
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,010
That was very smart.
I just thought of that.

276
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,594
Isn't it? That was interesting.

277
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,471
- Aunt Jill?
- Yes, sweetheart.

278
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,639
Yes, Sofie.

279
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,891
Do you and Daddy have twin powers?

280
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,602
What's this? What is twin powers?

281
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,271
{y:i}It's this thing we
saw on 60 Minutes.

282
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,442
Some twins have strange powers, and they
can feel when the other one's hurt.

283
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,402
Jack and I can do that.

284
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,947
What? Why are you making a face?

285
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,034
When we were kids,
you felt it when I broke my ankle.

286
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,911
I felt it 'cause you fell on my head.

287
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,913
- You like that one?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,874
- All right, good, good.
- Please!

289
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,043
Tell me you don't feel this.

290
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,337
I didn't feel it.
Maybe if you did it harder.

291
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,548
Little harder.

292
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,092
No, Jill. Stop it.

293
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,053
- He's kidding.
- What?

294
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,890
Donkey fight!

295
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,892
- Jill, are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

296
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,852
Gary, that was... He didn't 100% connect.

297
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,228
Feel that, Daddy?

298
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,606
I... I actually did feel something there.

299
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,815
Pride in my son.

300
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,609
Will you stop it already?

301
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,195
These sweet potatoes need salt.

302
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,572
I'm so sick of that.

303
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,992
Why are you so afraid
to admit that we are connected?

304
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,202
Face it.

305
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,204
We shared Mom's womb.

306
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,830
We were womb-mates.

307
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,083
That is just disgusting.

308
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,250
I have an idea.

309
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,460
On the show, there were these twins,

310
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,920
and they finished each other's sentences

311
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,338
Jack, maybe you could start a sentence,

312
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,423
- and Jill, you could finish it.
- No. No.

313
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,133
- Come on, Daddy, please!
- Please, Daddy, please!

314
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,218
- Please.
- Oh, my God.

315
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,595
Ready to receive mental images.

316
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,265
All right, will you stop?
You're scaring him.

317
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,142
That's just noises she's making.

318
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,019
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

319
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,733
I'm very tired, so I'm going to...

320
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,860
Go to the supermarket.

321
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,321
No, I'm going to sleep.

322
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,824
What is... Why would I go to a supermarket
if I was tired?

323
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,117
That's what I would do.

324
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,535
The cold air always wakes you up.

325
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,371
Isn't it nice when it's...
You go over there in the frozen food section?

326
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,666
- God bless...
- You! God bless you!

327
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,876
I finished your sentence. Got you, Pagogo.

328
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,379
What's Pagogo?

329
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,799
Oh, it's... It's a name that Aunt Jill used
to call your dad when they were growing up.

330
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,219
I was Pokee, and your father was Pagogo.

331
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,346
We had our own secret language.

332
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,474
Ook maga do do, Pagogo.

333
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,060
I have no idea what those words mean,

334
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,479
nor have I ever known
what those words meant.

335
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,690
You do know what they mean,
and you're lying right now.

336
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,775
"Ook maga do do" means "I love you."

337
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,652
"Bongi" means "thank you."

338
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,862
"Klapa" means "left."

339
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,448
Hey, do you remember what
"Locky mocky koko" means?

340
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,616
What does it mean again?

341
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,868
Jack, don't.

342
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,955
It means, "I can't stand you being here!"

343
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,418
This is really awkward. I'm going to go.

344
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,628
Dessert is coming.

345
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,880
I'm full.

346
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,923
Okay.

347
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,343
I love how nice we are
to this homeless man,

348
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,677
a person we don't even know,

349
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,763
who probably is pretending to be homeless!

350
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,849
You don't look homeless to me!
You're fat! You're al-Qaeda!

351
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,519
Sofia, why don't you go upstairs?

352
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,189
No, Mom,
this is my favorite part of Thanksgiving.

353
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,940
You know what? I'm leaving.

354
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,861
I'm leaving. That's it. That's it. I'm going.
I am going! I hope you're happy!

355
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,781
I'm sleeping out here in the woods!

356
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,866
At least the animals will be nice.

357
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,204
- Jill!
- He's even turning the kids against me!

358
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,747
- Are you okay?
- Jill, are you all right?

359
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,791
No. See, the kids love you.

360
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:02,295
And I love them. And that's the only reason
that I come back here every year.

361
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,214
Jack, apologize.

362
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,385
I'm sorry that you make
everybody uncomfortable. I really am.

363
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,636
Jack.

364
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,138
All right.
I'm sorry about what I said back there.

365
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,140
I didn't mean it. I... I love you.

366
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,851
I just feel abandoned.
I'm all alone in the Bronx.

367
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,978
I don't have any family with me any more.

368
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,105
We didn't abandon you.

369
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,649
I told you,
you can Skype us any time you want.

370
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,983
I don't even know what that means.

371
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,569
What is Skype? It sounds anti-Semitic.

372
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,738
- What is it?
- It's just this Internet thing.

373
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,490
I don't get that!

374
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,118
You know I don't have a calculator.

375
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,703
- Okay.
- Do you know what?

376
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,413
Our home is your home.

377
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,957
So let's go back. I have some ice cream.

378
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,875
I don't know, Erin. I'm too upset.

379
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,210
I can't eat right now.

380
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,170
- What flavor?
- Chocolate.

381
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,840
No. You have maple walnut?
I don't like chocolate.

382
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,591
I... I didn't know you liked maple walnut.

383
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,759
Hang in there, brother.

384
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,595
She's only here till Sunday.

385
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,767
{y:i}What is done cannot now be amended!

386
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,145
Yeah, Ted, I'm looking at it right now.

387
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,938
So, this was two nights ago?

388
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,399
{y:i}If I did take the kingdom

389
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,819
{y:i}from your sons, to make amends,

390
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,781
{y:i}I give it to your daughter.

391
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,619
{y:i}Will you get that?

392
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,038
Whoa.

393
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,373
{y:i}You have a phone in your hand!

394
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:26,004
{y:i}You are told before the play
starts not to have it ring!

395
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,048
{y:i}Shut all cell phones off!

396
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,674
{y:i}This is what the man said!

397
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,969
Yeah, this guy's going to do
a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.

398
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,763
{y:i}This has got to stop.

399
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,306
{y:i}I'm losing my mind.

400
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,099
{y:i}Help me.

401
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,351
{y:i}Where am I?

402
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,020
{y:i}Thank you. Thank you all for coming.

403
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,563
Yeah.

404
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,648
How do you know Pacino's going
to a Laker game?

405
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,442
Well, yeah, get the tickets,

406
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,194
but how am I even going
to get near the guy?

407
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,154
He's going to have security or something.

408
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,114
I'm not telling my wife
to wear something trashy

409
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,366
just 'cause it would save our company.

410
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,909
Unless she wants to.
I mean, that's her thing.

411
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,871
No... I'm hanging up the phone. Goodbye.

412
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,670
Excuse me, Mrs. Erin, the magnolia branch
in the backyard could fall off any time.

413
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,505
I mean, I don't want anyone to get hurt.

414
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,631
Should I take it down now?

415
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,175
Yeah, sure, sure.
Whatever... Whatever you think, Felipe.

416
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,259
Okay.

417
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,719
Did you have a nice Thanksgiving?

418
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,930
Yeah, I had the whole family come over.

419
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,557
Even my Aunt Rosa snuck across the border.

420
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,686
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

421
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,106
Who are you?
Are you a gardener or something?

422
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,734
No, I... I don't just do gardening
I do impressions, too.

423
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,780
When Immigration shows up,
I do a great impression of a tree.

424
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,201
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

425
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,913
Strong. All right.
Jay Leno better watch his back.

426
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,248
You know it.

427
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,041
{y:i}Nice to meet you, seÃ±orita.

428
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,584
Okay, nice to meet you.

429
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,462
What is he doing?

430
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,548
What is his problem?

431
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,717
Jack, Jack, Jack!

432
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:58,013
I put a little list together of things
I want to do before I leave, so...

433
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,974
Oh, my God. I got to touch that?

434
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,225
Yeah.

435
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,269
"Studio tour, beach,"

436
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,688
"horseback riding, get on a game show."

437
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,899
You can't get through all this stuff.
You're leaving Sunday.

438
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,901
I don't know.

439
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,029
What do you mean, you don't know?
You know.

440
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,614
I just wanted to have fun out here,

441
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,533
and, you know, we fought last night.

442
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,369
I just... I feel really
weird leaving like that.

443
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,996
What do you mean? It was a great night.

444
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,915
We... We ate food,
we ran in the woods. It was fun.

445
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,210
I just...
Maybe I should stay out through Hanukkah.

446
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,129
Mom's gone now,

447
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,131
so there's really nothing
for me to go back to.

448
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,257
- Stay, then!
- Stay!

449
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,843
She can't stay.
Because of your airline ticket.

450
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,512
It's, like, the busiest time of year.
We'll never get you a return flight.

451
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,557
That's why I used my twin hunch

452
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,142
in knowing that we would fight,

453
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,894
and I have an open-ended ticket.

454
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,939
Hanukkah! Hanukkah! Hanukkah! Hanukkah!

455
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,653
He's going to be mad.

456
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:59,032
I don't know where we parked the car.
I don't know.

457
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,201
I just want to go on with them
because they look soared.

458
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,036
I know if I was riding
with them, they would...

459
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,747
I know you say I weigh too much,
but I don't think I do.

460
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,209
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

461
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,711
Okay, I'm ready! Let's go!

462
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,338
Oh, my God!

463
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,007
Oh, God! Look, I'm so sorry.

464
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,551
I weigh too much. You were right!

465
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,223
Gary...

466
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,600
At least put a helmet on that thing.

467
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,866
What are you doing?

468
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,662
Why can't I just lay with you?

469
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,956
You're a weirdo!

470
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,668
{y:i}All right, welcome back to The Price ls Right.
Let's find out who's next.

471
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,422
{y:i}Jill Sadelstein, come on down!

472
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,842
{y:i}You're the next contestant
on The Price ls Right.

473
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,468
All right, Jill, go ahead
and spin the wheel,

474
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,220
- whenever you're ready.
- You are the best, Drew.

475
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,014
This is awesome, guys!

476
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,391
- Go ahead and...
- Are you married or not?

477
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,184
No. Go ahead and...

478
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,563
Jill, go ahead and spin the wheel.

479
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,900
No, because I know once I spin it,
I don't get to be near you any more.

480
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,610
- All right.
- All right.

481
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,280
Hey, Gary, Sofie.
Come on, guys, one dollar!

482
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,990
- One dollar.
- One dollar's the winner!

483
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,742
Good luck to you.

484
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,456
I never saw that before.
Hey, just give her a bunch of prizes.

485
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,541
We'll be right back right after this.
Don't go away.

486
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,543
Call an ambulance.

487
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,629
It banged me good.

488
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,966
Then, when I hit the floor,
that's when I really went out.

489
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,511
But when I came to, it was good.
They had prizes for me.

490
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,889
{y:i}Say hello to my little friend!

491
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,728
{y:i}Do you want to play rough? Okay.

492
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,981
What is she doing now?

493
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,153
I don't know...

494
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,155
Whoa! It's hard to hold on.

495
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,157
Please don't destroy my pool.

496
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,034
I've got it now. I...

497
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,584
My head!

498
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,013
{y:i}But it's such a waste.

499
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,640
{y:i}A full moon, an empty yacht.

500
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,766
{y:i}I'll throw up.

501
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,184
{y:i}I'll be.

502
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,980
{y:i}About the roadhouse...

503
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,192
{y:i}They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

504
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,113
{y:i}Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra,
and tango till dawn.

505
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,365
{y:i}- Do you know something, Mr. Fielding?
- What?

506
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,449
{y:i}You're dynamite.

507
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,535
Daddy.

508
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,662
You and Jill are so alike.

509
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,582
We are nothing alike, I promise you.

510
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,053
{y:i}Well?

511
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,057
{y:i}I'm not quite sure.

512
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,059
{y:i}Would you try it again?

513
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,278
Just watch the movie.

514
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,699
{y:i}I got a funny sensation in my toes.

515
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,827
{y:i}Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

516
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,252
{y:i}I think you're on the right track.

517
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,254
{y:i}I must be.

518
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,049
{y:i}Your glasses are
beginning to steam up.

519
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,019
Hello?

520
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,729
Mrs. Applebaum.

521
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,647
Hi. Yeah, no...

522
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,358
- What are you doing?
- It wasn't an emergency.

523
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,568
I just wanted to see
how my plants were doing.

524
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,028
Please stop talking!

525
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,447
- Okay, and you turned the heat off?
- Turn off the phone.

526
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,990
All the way off, though?

527
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,200
Jill, Jill!

528
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,202
Yeah, I can't hear her. I'm trying to...

529
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,330
- I'm on the phone.
- Well, get off the phone, you psycho!

530
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,293
- No, don't cry.
- You know what?

531
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,753
- Don't run away.
- You just...

532
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,797
- Don't go in the woods. Jill!
- I can't believe it.

533
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,590
Hey!

534
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,134
It's the last night of Hanukkah!

535
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,470
Come on, already! It's happy time!

536
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,889
Dude, way to yell at a chick.
That's awesome.

537
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,140
That was a chick?

538
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,559
- Yeah, that was a chick.
- Really.

539
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,939
Hey! The brake.

540
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,148
Hey, hey, I can do it!

541
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,858
- It's all right! I got it!
- I can do it!

542
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:44,984
It's all right!

543
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,152
Hey, I can do it.

544
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,237
It's okay.

545
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,114
It goes fast.

546
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,448
I'm getting it on him.

547
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,033
She's crazy.

548
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,910
She's crazy. She's never leaving.

549
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,788
Well, she was going to leave
until you called her "psycho."

550
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,332
She's forwarding her mail to us now!

551
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,459
{y:i}Highlights magazine.

552
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,837
Birdy magazine addressed to Poopsie!

553
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,338
Okay, okay.

554
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,340
Did you ever think that maybe she's lonely

555
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,884
and she needs someone
to get her through the holidays?

556
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,012
She needs a guy.

557
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,180
- She needs a guy!
- No, no, no, no.

558
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,390
If we don't get her a guy by New Year's,

559
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,100
she's gonna come on the
cruise ship with us.

560
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,686
We'll be locked on a boat for seven days!
I'll kill myself!

561
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,604
Do not get involved in her love life.

562
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,607
Aunt Jill, why don't you have any kids?

563
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,693
Gary, did you make your bed this morning?

564
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,529
It's okay, Erin.
You don't have to... I can tell him.

565
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,656
Gary, I have all the equipment

566
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,200
and it seems to be functioning well.

567
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,536
I get a little reminder
every 30 days or so.

568
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,957
But the point is, Gary,
I was never married.

569
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,375
Why?

570
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,878
Well, everyone loved your father.

571
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,463
He was more of a gadfly.

572
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,214
Me, I kept to myself,

573
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,508
made sure Grandma and Grandpa were okay.

574
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,553
But everybody loves Aunt Jill
just as much as Daddy.

575
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,679
Or more.

576
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,348
Don't say that.

577
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,851
Your father,
he might act tough, but he has thin skin.

578
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,102
You'd hurt his feelings.

579
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,271
Aunt Jill, did you date boys?

580
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,814
I liked boys.

581
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,734
They just, they...
They never liked me back.

582
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:11,071
My friend Mimi's mom dates boys
she meets on the computer.

583
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,406
I've heard of this. Yeah, I would do that.

584
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,951
It's just, I don't know
how to use a computer or a radar.

585
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,203
Or a robot or whatever.

586
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,329
Well, let's show her!

587
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,164
- Jack.
- No, no, no.

588
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,209
Sofie's the one who brought it up.
It's her. She did it.

589
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,545
I would do it. I mean, what the heck?
It's no biggie. Let's go for it.

590
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,506
I need a man.

591
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,716
So many to choose from.

592
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,926
Match.c: om

593
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,219
That's a good one.

594
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,097
EHarmony, I've heard of.
They have commercials.

595
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,140
MySoul-Mate.net.

596
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,810
I like that because I got a little soul.

597
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:46,398
Okay, so it says to press here to register

598
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,692
for your perfect soul mate.

599
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,903
Not like that.

600
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,405
No. Like this.

601
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,949
What are you, a computer whiz?

602
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,660
You would think he'd be the genius,
being from India.

603
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,829
Now, India's,

604
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,247
really amazing lately.

605
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,373
They're just leading the pack.

606
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,459
I read in Time magazine, they're number one.
China's number two.

607
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,294
- The Jews, we're back to number three.
- Okay.

608
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,588
Four is Germany,
so let's watch out, everyone.

609
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,841
All right, all right, listen,
you got to pick a username, Jill,

610
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:13,925
so just do that.

611
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,301
A username?

612
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,928
How about Manilow?

613
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,473
'Cause he can use me anytime he wants to.

614
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,600
Just kidding.
I hope you didn't understand that.

615
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,477
It's a little risquÃ© for your age.

616
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,272
Okay, now you load your profile picture
that Sofie took of you.

617
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,982
Can't wait to see this.

618
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,943
My picture is embarrassing. Put it up.

619
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,615
Is it too va-va-voomish?

620
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,826
No, it's very natural.

621
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,162
Maybe I should have gone
with peanut butter and jelly.

622
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,247
This... I like it, I like it.

623
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,082
Forget it. I'm committing to it. So, what?

624
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,918
If somebody likes me,
the little envelope thing will be blinking?

625
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,254
I just, I love this so much.

626
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,215
I crave this, family time.

627
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,719
It's why you have a family.

628
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,974
{y:i}A ham this good
only comes once a generation.

629
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,517
{y:i}Like me.

630
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,479
{y:i}I give this ham four rings.

631
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,939
{y:i}That's a hell of a
good ham right there.

632
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,733
Whose idea was the wig?

633
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,860
That was his choice.

634
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,863
I think it's great
that Shaq doesn't look like Shaq at all,

635
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,990
that he looks like Al Sharpton on HGH.

636
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:22,911
Turn the TV off.

637
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,871
So, how long does it take

638
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,706
to get a response
on one of those computer dating things?

639
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,999
I'm... I'm new to this.

640
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,877
I mean, it can take...
It can take a day, it can take a week.

641
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,171
You know what I mean?
For someone like her...

642
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,341
What was that? What was...
Why'd you say, "like her"?

643
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:40,220
Someone like her.
Like, in her 40s, still single.

644
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,138
You know what I mean? Incredibly homely.

645
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,683
Wow, you hate your job, don't you?

646
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,726
No. I only said that
'cause you said that one time.

647
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,353
I can say that 'cause I'm her twin.

648
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,188
Hey, Jack, Laker game tomorrow night.

649
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,065
We got to make that Pacino thing happen.

650
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,733
Every body's really nervous around here.

651
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,110
Yeah, I know, I know.

652
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,736
What's this about a twin?

653
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,238
Jack. He has a twin sister.

654
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,366
Are you kidding me?
You never told me you had a twin sister.

655
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,867
No, no, I mean, she's...

656
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,411
Identical or fraternal?

657
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,371
Nocturnal, like a bat.

658
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,332
Really?

659
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,668
I'll pack my stuff up, man.

660
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,635
How we doing in here?

661
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,394
Hey, what happened?

662
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,105
Aunt Jill checked to see
if any boys liked her.

663
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,441
The blinking thing never blinked.

664
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,443
That's awful.

665
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:40,530
If people could only see
how good she can open a pickle jar...

666
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,241
Yeah, I know. You're right.

667
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,160
Okay, see you guys...

668
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,086
Okay, where do I find desperate guys?

669
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,797
{y:i}Twitter, Maxim,

670
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,591
Craigslist.

671
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:02,761
Yeah.

672
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,929
Casual Encounters.

673
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,098
All right, savages, get ready.

674
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,226
Anyone wanting to meet a nice...

675
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,936
No, I need someone immediately.

676
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,522
Not "nice."

677
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,108
Anyone wanting to meet

678
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,988
a sexy gymnast model...

679
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,075
No, I can't lie so much.

680
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,870
A hot...

681
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,040
Hi, Poopsie.

682
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,335
Yeah, "hot" works.

683
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:36,711
Crazy...

684
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,633
Hey!

685
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,678
Personal masseuse...

686
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,471
I pull really hard.

687
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,724
Watch your mother.
She's going to have relief.

688
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,226
What happened?
Is she sleeping or something?

689
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,478
.âKnockout

690
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,230
- One dollar.
- One dollar's the winner!

691
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:56,398
Good luck to you.

692
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,362
For the night of your life,

693
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,989
go to Manilow

694
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,993
at mySoul-Mate.net.

695
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:14,207
Man, I'm really throwing her to the wolves.

696
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,042
But it has to be done.

697
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,421
Wow.

698
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,673
We're not going to tell anyone about this,
are we?

699
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,883
Where were you?

700
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,803
I trust you can keep a secret, kid!

701
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,888
You guys!

702
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,807
You guys! Are you sitting down?

703
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,852
I got over 100 responses on the computer!

704
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,523
Look at Miss Popular, all of a sudden.

705
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:41,651
I mean, some of them are weirdoes,
but some of them are so nice!

706
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:46,072
I wrote one guy back,
and we're going out tonight! Oh, my God!

707
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,615
I love it!

708
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,992
Oh, my God!

709
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,660
Yeah.

710
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,746
I'm so scared.
I don't know what I'm going to wear.

711
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,081
- I'll help you. I'll help you.
- I'm freaking out.

712
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:56,875
I feel like Julia Roberts in that movie.

713
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,084
{y:i}Pretty Woman.

714
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,711
No, no, no, the one where she's a hooker.

715
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,087
What's the name of that one?

716
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,422
{y:i}- Pretty Woman?
- No, no, no!

717
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,966
Why are you saying that? No, the other one.

718
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,343
What's the matter with you?

719
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,845
What's she going to wear?

720
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,348
What are you going to wear, Daddy?

721
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,016
In Hell.

722
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,394
Shut up.

723
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,355
This is like waiting for the queen.

724
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,065
Yeah, yeah.
Well, let's see what's taking her so long.

725
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,859
Go up there, speed her along.
Come on, go, go, go.

726
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,945
I'm answering it!

727
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,782
- Funbucket's here!
- Funbucket?

728
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,116
Oh, tell him I'm not ready!

729
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,077
- Tell him I'm not home!
- She'll be right down.

730
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,246
No! No, it won't zip! It won't zip!

731
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,457
- Hey.
- Hey.

732
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,292
Are you Funbucket?

733
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:40,627
Yeah, that's me.

734
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,462
You don't look like a Funbucket.

735
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:45,674
I was picturing someone more fun
or buckety.

736
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,677
You're not the crazy,
hot masseuse, are you?

737
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,969
I want you to tell me right up front,

738
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,721
'cause if you are, I'm
not paying for dinner.

739
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:53,390
Come here.

740
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,975
If you mention Craigslist to her
or do anything

741
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,435
that hurts her, I will stick my foot...

742
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,770
Funbucket?

743
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,647
Manilow?

744
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,014
So, yeah, you know what?
I'll be up-front with you.

745
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,143
I live in the Bronx
and I don't have any children.

746
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,186
In all honesty, the clock's ticking,

747
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,356
so if dinner works,
we got to get to work. I'm kidding you.

748
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,442
I just said that
'cause I'm very nervous right now

749
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,694
and I just keep talking so much.

750
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,655
My mouth is moving.
I don't even realize how much it's moving.

751
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:54,367
It's... I'm not even feeling it.
It's cottony.

752
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,995
So, is this your first date
on mySoul-Mate.net?

753
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,329
Yes.

754
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:04,294
Assuming it's really happening
and not some sort of terrifying nightmare.

755
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,379
I know. What do you do for a living?

756
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,505
Don't tell me. I don't want...

757
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,466
I want to play 20 Questions.
Remember that game?

758
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,217
{y:i}When we were little? 20 Questions?

759
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,969
Okay, first question. Animal, mineral...

760
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,347
- I'm going to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

761
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,266
See you.

762
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,732
Should I take away your salads?

763
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:30,570
I think he's just waiting
for his to cool off.

764
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,406
So, we'll just... Just a few more minutes.

765
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,824
Thank you.

766
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:41,998
Hello? Hello?

767
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,004
Funbucket? Funbucket?

768
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,175
Hello?

769
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,604
He must have gone out to get some air.

770
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,866
Good job.

771
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,160
You're alive!

772
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,245
How did it go?

773
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,415
It was... It was fine.

774
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,125
He didn't try anything funny
with you, did he?

775
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,751
No, no.

776
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,128
Does he want to go out again?

777
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,380
- Is he your prince?
- Are you his princess?

778
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:31,798
Did he ask for your number?

779
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,008
Did he kiss you good night?

780
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,385
Will you kids stop it already?

781
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:36,845
It was just a date!

782
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,306
Why do you put so much pressure on me?

783
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,351
Why are there so many stairs?

784
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,312
I miss your old chandelier!

785
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,314
No one's ever going to love me!

786
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,191
I'm a loser!

787
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,569
Oh, my God, I'm an idiot.

788
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,320
Why?

789
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,031
Why are you an idiot?

790
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:01,661
Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted.

791
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,125
Hi, Jill.

792
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,918
It's okay, it's...

793
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,671
We've all had bad dates.

794
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,174
Whatever. He was such a...

795
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,760
I thought he was cool for a second.

796
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:20,221
Jack feels like you deserve to go out
with a guy who treats you right.

797
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,767
So guess who is taking you
to the Lakers game tomorrow night.

798
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,978
Hairfingers23 from the computer?

799
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,023
No, actually, I'm your date.

800
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,109
I love that, Pagogo!

801
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,694
Ook maga do do!

802
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,029
That sounds great.

803
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,031
Finally some twin time.

804
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:41,451
Oh, pali wali, zoom gali gali.

805
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:44,329
That means,
"I want to choke on my own vomit."

806
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:48,458
Does it? I... I'm a little rusty.
I don't remember everything.

807
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,970
Oh, my God, look at these guys.
They're huge.

808
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,305
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They're too big.

809
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,556
- It's freaky.
- Will you stop?

810
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,933
- It's weird.
- Stop it.

811
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:08,436
- No, it's... Where do they buy pants?
- Just please keep walking. I'm sorry.

812
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,273
It's like nuclear-power-plant big.
That's... That's big.

813
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,110
John, we're so close here.

814
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,278
- Hey.
- You got us in the game.

815
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,697
What's...

816
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,907
What's going on with the beard, man?

817
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,576
I'm doing research.
I don't want to be recognized, okay?

818
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,095
- Who is that?
- Hey, Jill, don't go nuts,

819
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,097
but I'm gonna try and talk to Al Pacino.

820
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,265
It's Pacino!

821
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,058
Al Pacino, the movie actor?

822
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,227
Yes, yes, stay calm.

823
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,230
What do you think people are thinking here,
that I'm sitting with my rabbi?

824
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:54,190
Hey, guys, big game tonight.

825
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:55,859
- Yeah.
- How you doing, Johnny?

826
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:56,985
- How are you?
- Huge fan.

827
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,404
- Good to see you. Thank you.
- And, Mr. Pacino,

828
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,157
I actually met you one time
at a movie premiere.

829
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:07,620
He's thirsty.

830
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:08,913
Okay.

831
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,792
It was Cats & {y:i}Dogs 3,
and we were sitting in the same row.

832
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:16,087
One of your kids knocked over your popcorn,
and I gave you mine.

833
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,548
And you called me "Popcorn"
the rest of the night.

834
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,091
- Popcorn.
- Yes.

835
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,010
Yeah, nice to see you again.

836
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,303
Hey, what's with the beard?

837
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,138
You look a little like Bin Laden.

838
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,807
- I was kind of thinking Castro, myself.
- Yeah.

839
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,353
No, no, it's like the cough drops guy,
the Smith Brothers.

840
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,480
Who is that? Is that your wife?

841
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,191
No, no, no, that's my sister Jill.
She's in from the Bronx.

842
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,943
- Hey, Al, do you think you'd ever...
- Dulcinea.

843
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,070
What's that?

844
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,237
You're from the Bronx?

845
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,656
Yeah, born and bred.
Throggs Neck, the nice part.

846
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,116
Al, I got a question for you,

847
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,452
- and I know it's a long shot.
- Well, I'm from the Bronx.

848
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,536
- Okay.
- Did you know that?

849
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,330
Yeah, to be honest,
I don't know much about you.

850
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,416
I haven't seen a lot of your movies,
but I hear you're very serious.

851
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,293
- Well, you know...
- Okay.

852
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,171
Hey, is Ryan Seacrest here?
Have you seen him? Do you know him?

853
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,547
I'm sorry, who-crest?

854
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,549
Al, would you ever consider doing a...

855
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,511
Who is your friend? Was he in Duran Duran?
Were you in Duran Duran?

856
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,555
Yes. Yes, I was.

857
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,432
So, tell me,
how long are you gonna be in L.A.?

858
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,768
- Oh, my God. Is that John Stamos?
- Who?

859
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,020
Pagogo, Pagogo,
let's go before he gets away!

860
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,480
I want to see him up close! Please!

861
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,441
So, Al, I'm gonna get a hold
of your agent, if that's cool.

862
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,984
{y:i}Time to play ball.

863
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,572
When's the marching band come out?

864
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,700
- That's not going to happen.
- No?

865
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:29,119
Here we go. Here we go.

866
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,664
{y:i}Kobe Bryant!

867
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,598
Compliments of Mr. Pacino.

868
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,100
What's this?

869
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,275
I can't believe this.

870
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,110
This is insane, man!

871
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,112
- You got to call him!
- Cool your buns.

872
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:07,157
You know I'm still hurting
from the whole Funbucket fiasco.

873
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,910
No, but Pacino liked you!
I swear to God, he really liked you!

874
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,412
Will you stop already?

875
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:15,290
You know all he wants to do
is play Twister with your sister.

876
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,459
Jill, will you just do this for me?

877
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,920
You know, maybe I'll be ready
to date again in a few weeks.

878
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,006
We'll sit and talk about it on New Year's.

879
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,554
New Year's?

880
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,724
But you're not gonna be here on New Year's,
'cause that's after our birthday.

881
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,351
Which is when you're leaving.

882
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:36,811
Yeah. I guess so.

883
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,814
So, if New Year's comes up,

884
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:43,485
just tell Jill that one more passenger
on the cruise ship, it'll sink.

885
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,111
I'm not telling her that.

886
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,031
Tell her... You got to tell her something.
I'm not having her come to Europe.

887
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,324
It's the kids' first trip.

888
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:50,825
Hey, how are we doing in here?

889
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,535
It's 6132.

890
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,955
Forty-three years ago
at this very time, you were born.

891
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,791
Happy birthday, Number One.

892
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,293
- Okay, thank you.
- Happy birthday, you guys.

893
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,462
- Okay.
- No, no, no, not yet, not yet!

894
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,255
I wasn't born yet. I'm 6:33.

895
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,049
- I'm still 42, Erin.
- God.

896
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:09,844
So how does it feel, old man?
Getting rickety in the bones?

897
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,306
I'm so bummed that you're leaving tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.

898
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,308
Yeah. God.

899
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,144
I'm going to miss...
I'm going to miss you guys, too.

900
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,396
Especially on New Year's.

901
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,439
Get the violins going, yeah.

902
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,651
It's just, every year,
I'd go with Mom to Valentino's.

903
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,278
It's the restaurant, Erin,
where my mother met my father.

904
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,073
I knew that was going to be big.

905
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,702
Don't throw it out.
We can make a birthday candle with it.

906
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,998
Hey, we're only 40 minutes late, guys.

907
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,959
{y:i}I hope they sing Happy
Birthday to us.

908
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,961
Yeah, I hope we still have
our table there, Slick.

909
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,797
Why is it so dark in here?
Are we going to get killed or something?

910
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,215
Surprise!

911
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:48,675
Oh, my God.

912
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:50,260
Jack, we got you.

913
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:52,679
You are having a party for us?

914
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:53,930
Coolness!

915
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,724
Every body's here.

916
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,601
And I just had to meet your twin sister.

917
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,270
Very nice to see you.

918
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,981
I mean, you guys really do look alike.

919
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:05,900
I say that all the time. He says no.

920
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:07,902
Jill, I want to introduce you around.

921
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,405
This is going to be a bad night.

922
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:13,158
This is going to be an awful, awful night.

923
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:16,369
Really, it's fascinating.
So, how does it work, Mr. Subway Sandwich?

924
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,662
Just, well, just tell me more.

925
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:18,788
Just Jared's fine.

926
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,373
Call you Jared? Okay, sure.

927
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,500
It's just, 10 sandwiches a day.

928
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,378
To me, that seems too much,
almost like a job. I couldn't do that.

929
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:26,921
- I don't eat that many.
- No?

930
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,673
Okay, okay, here's the situation.

931
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,051
You're here, there's not a Subway in sight.

932
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,595
You're at a steakhouse like this.
What do you eat? What do you eat?

933
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,347
- I eat other things.
- You do?

934
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,600
You do? I knew you were cheating.
That's why there's so much goo left on you.

935
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:41,144
- What?
- I miss the old Jared,

936
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,646
the 400-pound Jared that scared us.

937
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,856
I don't miss that one at all.

938
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,400
Well, I'm sure you don't.
But if he was around, he'd be with me

939
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:48,902
and not with the two hookers.

940
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,783
Well, yeah, we love musicals.
You know what?

941
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:56,242
You're the Sham-Wow man, right?

942
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,952
- Yeah.
- Funny story.

943
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:00,789
- Jack used to be a bed-wetter.
- No!

944
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:02,749
He could have used one
of these Sham-Wow things

945
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,418
20 years ago for his pee puddles.

946
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:08,296
There's Mr. Yellow Sheets!

947
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:11,424
Where you going, Puddles?

948
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,844
All right, nice to meet you all.

949
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:17,472
Am I crazy or is she hot?

950
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,265
You're crazy.

951
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,226
It's Jack with boobs.

952
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,894
Jack with boobs. That's right.

953
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:24,312
There he is!

954
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,940
Dude, did you set this whole thing up?

955
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:28,942
Yeah, we got through it, man.
It came out pretty dope, I think.

956
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,236
It's amazing. Hey, Jill.

957
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:33,571
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Come here for a sec.

958
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:36,324
Okay, nice to see you. What's going on?

959
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,785
Did I ever tell you Todd is an atheist?

960
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,954
- A what?
- God.

961
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:42,455
Have a great time, guys.

962
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,666
No. How could there be a Grand Canyon

963
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:46,126
if God didn't exist?

964
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,379
Right. That's a very good point.
I'm just saying, you know, maybe...

965
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:52,882
Maybe God wouldn't have given you
a rat face if you believed in him.

966
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,050
I don't have a rat face.

967
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,011
Yes, you do have a rat face! It's scary.

968
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

969
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,264
- This guy doesn't believe in God?
- No!

970
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,308
No, no, I'm just saying
that there's not real proof.

971
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:05,895
Idiots like you really make me mad!

972
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,480
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight him!

973
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,773
Fight! Fight! Fight!

974
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,483
Because I'm about to US Open your skull!

975
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,028
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

976
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,781
{y:i}Happy birthday to you

977
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:20,952
{y:i}Happy birthday to you

978
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:26,166
{y:i}Happy birthday, dear Jack...

979
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,335
{y:i}And Jill

980
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:33,298
{y:i}Happy birthday to you

981
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:34,799
Come on, make a wish, you twins.

982
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,676
- Okay, let's do it.
- Where's the other cake?

983
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,636
- There's not enough candles for both of us.
- All right, Jill.

984
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,847
One cake's enough. Make the wish.

985
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,850
Mom and Dad always got us two cakes.

986
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,311
Made us both feel special.

987
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:48,146
I don't think Mom and Dad would like this.

988
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:50,190
Make the wish already! I'm hungry!

989
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,692
Will you stop already?
Blow out the candles.

990
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,749
Whoa!

991
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,918
Funny meeting you here.

992
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,963
Don't be startled. It's only me.

993
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:17,884
It's always the same thing.

994
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,094
It's L.A.

995
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,721
I never know where I am.
It's a wilderness here.

996
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,765
I mean, in the Bronx,

997
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:25,433
you got the streets, you got the numbers.

998
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:27,811
YOU go'[ 187th, 188th.

999
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,396
- Yeah, right, in order.
- It follows in sequence.

1000
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,981
Here, you got the palm trees,
and they all look alike.

1001
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,653
I have no idea where we are.

1002
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,697
- You really don't?
- I don't.

1003
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,282
Lucky... Lucky for us, I
got the panic button.

1004
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,492
You have a panic button?

1005
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:45,662
Yeah, and we'll soon find out
where we are, huh?

1006
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:50,625
- There we go.
- That's a house.

1007
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:51,835
That's not a bakery.

1008
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,379
Whether we go in a bakery, a house,
what difference does it make?

1009
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:55,588
It makes a difference!

1010
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,882
- What do you mean?
- There's a bakery in the house.

1011
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,426
- Get out of town!
- Come on.

1012
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:00,927
I'm not going to your house.

1013
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,762
I want to see a birthday cake soon

1014
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,764
or I'm taking pepper spray out.
I'm not kidding.

1015
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,642
O ye of little faith.

1016
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,352
What is that, a Shakespeare?

1017
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,104
No, that was Jesus.

1018
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:12,981
Okay, birthday girl.

1019
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,691
- Oh, my God.
- Here it is.

1020
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:15,942
You name it,

1021
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,778
Xavier, my guy, will bake it.

1022
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:21,364
Oh, my God!

1023
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,742
- Look, I made her happy.
- I love this!

1024
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:24,909
{y:i}L made you happy...

1025
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:31,291
{y:i}Nutcracker.

1026
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:34,210
{y:i}No. That? That's Man of La Mancha.

1027
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,880
They offered me the part
of Don Quixote on Broadway.

1028
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,131
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Yeah.

1029
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:40,091
But, you know, I'm just, I'm not there yet,

1030
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:41,343
so I'm mulling it over, you know?

1031
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:45,055
I love that. That's where
the man's in the tower ringing the bell?

1032
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:48,433
{y:i}That's Quasimodo.
That's Hunchback of Notre-Dame.

1033
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,935
See, this is Don Quixote.

1034
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:54,314
Don Quixote meets this fallen woman

1035
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:57,192
who he thinks is his lost love Dulcinea.

1036
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:59,652
Right. And he can't straighten his back,

1037
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:01,279
so he keeps ringing the bell.

1038
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:03,698
And he has a sidekick. It was a mouse.

1039
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,700
Okay, moving on.

1040
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:09,037
Listen, Bronx,
I got a birthday surprise for you.

1041
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,081
- Another one?
- Yeah.

1042
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:14,292
It's my

1043
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,045
original stickball stick.

1044
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,798
- Come with me a second.
- Let me just eat some cake.

1045
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:22,008
- This is so good.
- Leave it. You've been eating enough.

1046
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:24,260
- We really have to stop now?
- Xavier!

1047
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,307
- Nice.
- He's going to throw the ball,

1048
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:32,018
and you are going to take this stick
with two hands, right?

1049
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,186
And you're going to hit it.

1050
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,021
Do I have to play this weird game?

1051
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,565
It's not weird. Jill, it's in you.

1052
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,360
It's in your DNA. Just think Bronx.

1053
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:41,611
Let it just float.

1054
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,029
Okay, okay, Okay...

1055
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:45,198
Can you do me a favor
and not hold me like this?

1056
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,449
All right. I'm just trying to show you.

1057
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,786
Okay, all you got to do is
make contact, that's all.

1058
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,539
I feel like this is your game
and it's not my game.

1059
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:55,208
If you want to play my game,
Hungry Hungry {y:i}Hippos, Sabaday.

1060
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,252
- Do you have that here?
- That's coming.

1061
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,754
Goobledy gibble globbity!

1062
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,965
What language are you speaking?

1063
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,341
Just throw it.

1064
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,511
Okay. Come on, no batter here, pitcher!
No batter!

1065
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,138
I just don't know why we're doing this.

1066
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:09,973
Whoa!

1067
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,601
Ch, my God! Oh, my God!

1068
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,186
I am so sorry!

1069
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:17,939
I'm sure you have others, though.

1070
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:21,901
You'd think it, but oddly enough, I don't.

1071
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,069
But I have you.

1072
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,280
- You don't have me. I...
- I'd rather have you.

1073
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:26,614
I'm sorry. I'm going to go.

1074
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:29,534
I just... I had fun, but I'm so tired.

1075
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,578
It's 8:30 in the morning, my time.

1076
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,204
Do you know what time it is for me?

1077
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:35,790
It is time for my salvation.

1078
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:39,836
Because finally, I found the one woman,

1079
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,839
with all her rough-hewn charm,

1080
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:45,091
who will lead me back

1081
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,511
to sanity.

1082
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:52,557
You're sick.

1083
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,683
You're a sweetie.

1084
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,770
I saw what you were doing with the stick,
and it was gross.

1085
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:58,355
- Thank you, Sabaday.
- Wait a minute,

1086
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,939
where do you think you're going?

1087
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,525
I'm not your wham-bam-eggs-and-ham type.

1088
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,194
But you don't have a car.

1089
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,034
Why are you ignoring me?

1090
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,539
What happened to me?

1091
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:18,500
What's this?

1092
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,460
Help me!

1093
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,796
Where were you?

1094
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:24,547
What do you mean?

1095
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:26,925
I was here, bird.

1096
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:30,220
Felipe.

1097
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,889
Miss Jill? What you doing out here?

1098
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:35,642
I stayed out here
because I didn't want to go in the house.

1099
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:37,644
And Erin tried to make me come back in
and I wouldn't.

1100
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:40,730
He yelled at me 'cause
I rejected Al Pacino.

1101
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:44,234
Well, if you need something to do,
I'm just fixing the timer

1102
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:46,486
and heading off to a big family picnic.

1103
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,988
We play soccer, eat,

1104
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:51,074
steal white people's wallets...

1105
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,367
What did you say?

1106
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:54,244
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

1107
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,538
We don't eat.

1108
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,416
Stop it. Why won't you help me?

1109
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,710
What are you doing? Put Poopsie down!

1110
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,878
It flew in my bread.

1111
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,429
Hey, Rosa!

1112
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,431
This is my friend, Jill.

1113
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:16,057
- Hi.
- That's my father,

1114
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,561
my mama, my brother Juan,
my other brother Juan,

1115
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,021
Juan Jr.,

1116
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,274
my sister Juanita, my grandma Juangelina,

1117
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:26,609
and that... I'm kidding!

1118
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,113
I was going to say, that's a lot of Juans!

1119
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,614
We're not all named Juan.

1120
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,825
Hey, {y:i}niÃ±os! Look, these are my kids.

1121
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:36,578
JosÃ©, JosÃ© Jr. {y:i}Y Josefina

1122
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:39,706
They are beautiful. Hi. Hi.

1123
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:41,624
They all look like my wife, thank God.

1124
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,586
Your wife? I need to meet her.
Where is she?

1125
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:47,172
Well, she passed away four years ago.

1126
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,965
I'm so sorry.

1127
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,009
- I lost my mother recently.
- No, that's all right.

1128
00:50:51,092 --> 00:50:53,303
I love talking about my wife.

1129
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:56,389
And I know she's up there

1130
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,308
sneaking into Heaven right now.

1131
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:02,145
It's a joke! It's a joke!

1132
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:03,605
Your father's bad.

1133
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,066
He's bad! He's very bad!

1134
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,526
Ready for the best Mexican food
you ever had?

1135
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,279
- I never had Mexican food.
- What?

1136
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:14,908
I'm sorry. It's not my fault.
They don't serve it at my deli.

1137
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:17,660
- Well, today is your lucky day.
- Okay.

1138
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,037
- Taste.
- Cool.

1139
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:20,955
Wow!

1140
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,540
{y:i}That's chile relleno.

1141
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,501
It looks like a knish.

1142
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,921
Never had Mexican food.

1143
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,340
It's very, very good.

1144
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,804
I'm kidding. Are you okay?

1145
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:38,181
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Heads up.

1146
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:39,599
What is this thing?

1147
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,393
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1148
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,853
It's too hot. Just like you.

1149
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,231
Felipe, easy.

1150
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,819
Come on, Jill!

1151
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:52,070
Come on!

1152
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:06,459
Get Jill out there!

1153
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:39,576
Come on, Jill, run!

1154
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:40,785
Run!

1155
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:47,917
JalapeÃ±os. JalapeÃ±os.

1156
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,211
Okay, this is yours.

1157
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:58,511
What happened?

1158
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,472
- JalapeÃ±os! JalapeÃ±os!
- JalapeÃ±os?

1159
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:02,265
Did I get it?

1160
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:04,684
JalapeÃ±os.

1161
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:06,686
Go! Run!

1162
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:16,154
Shoot that! Shoot that!

1163
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:21,743
Goal!

1164
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,037
Whoa!

1165
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,087
It's not a guy.

1166
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:34,339
Felipe, I love it!

1167
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:38,385
Hey, hey, hey...

1168
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,136
{y:i}Hey, Mr. Popcorn.

1169
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,640
Is that Al Pacino?
Are you kidding me? How you doing?

1170
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:47,477
Listen, I got a little something here
for Ms. Sadelstein.

1171
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,688
My God, she's not here right now.

1172
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,564
{y:i}That's our loss, isn't it?

1173
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:55,068
Have you any idea
when she might be coming home?

1174
00:53:55,151 --> 00:53:56,277
Hopefully soon.

1175
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:58,446
{y:i}You know what, I hope so.
I'm waiting on her, too.

1176
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:00,073
And I wanted to tell you, Al,

1177
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:02,492
if she wasn't receptive the other night...

1178
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:05,412
- Oh, my God!
- I know she's in here, Popcorn.

1179
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,747
- How'd you get over the fence?
- Jill, come on!

1180
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,624
You want me to get you
something to eat or...

1181
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,335
All I want to do is make you happy!

1182
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:15,797
I want to see you.
I want to know that you exist.

1183
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,091
That I'm not just imagining you!

1184
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:20,760
Al, she really isn't here. For real.

1185
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,679
- This it?
- Yeah.

1186
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,055
She sleeps here?

1187
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,473
She does. She sleeps there.

1188
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,853
God, sorry you have to see that.

1189
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,521
She sleeps with someone?

1190
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,189
No, no, no, no, that's a bird.

1191
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:34,983
That's not a human. No problems.

1192
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:36,943
Look at this.

1193
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,903
- Isn't that something?
- Yeah.

1194
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:40,363
How does this happen?

1195
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,240
Al, I wouldn't lay there.

1196
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:43,700
That's not...

1197
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:49,956
She leaves an after-scent.

1198
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,125
Hey, Popcorn, you know,

1199
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,669
you're not really giving me
any confidence here.

1200
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,046
- About what?
- Where is she?

1201
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,423
- Al, I don't know where...
- Where you hiding her?

1202
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:00,216
She's coming back,
she just is not here right...

1203
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,468
Hey, Jill!

1204
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,386
Lot of places to hide. Hey, Jill!

1205
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:05,889
Al, she's coming back, I swear to you.

1206
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,350
- She got an 8:00 flight tonight, so I promise.
- What?

1207
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,517
She's leaving?

1208
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,688
Come here.

1209
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:16,900
- Come to you?
- Yeah, come, come. We gotta talk.

1210
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:18,860
Yeah.

1211
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:21,696
You want to turn my name into

1212
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,282
some coffee-drink
chocolate-doughnut thing?

1213
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:26,659
Well, yeah. Tastefully, though. I think...

1214
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:28,411
Then you get me the girl.

1215
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,038
Get you the girl?

1216
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,998
Get me the girl.

1217
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:36,670
"Get" is a strong word.
'Cause this is my sister we're talking about.

1218
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,129
You don't understand!

1219
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,256
- Well, I want to understand.
- You don't understand!

1220
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,842
Go ahead, go ahead.
Tell me what I need to know.

1221
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,594
- Your sister and I...
- Yeah?

1222
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:46,763
We grew up on the same streets.

1223
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,515
We breathed the same Bronx air.

1224
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:53,103
- Yes, yes, yes.
- When I look at her, I see me.

1225
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,730
When I look at her, I see me, too. Just...

1226
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,023
I know what you mean.

1227
00:55:57,107 --> 00:55:59,109
I see what I was.

1228
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:04,739
I'm lost, Popcorn.

1229
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,783
I am.

1230
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,119
I go visit my kids,

1231
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:11,413
I can't find them.

1232
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,957
I end up talking to lemon trees.

1233
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,793
You know what? I'm lost now. What does...

1234
00:56:16,918 --> 00:56:17,961
- Jill...
- Yes?

1235
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,087
Is going to get me there.

1236
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,006
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:22,674
I just want a shot.

1238
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:24,509
- You understand?
- Let's get you a shot.

1239
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,136
- Right.
- Only way to get you a shot

1240
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,181
is to have my sister stay
even longer out here,

1241
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,767
which is amazing news for me.

1242
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,521
It's so warm to be the holiday season.

1243
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:40,108
But thank you.
I really had an amazing time.

1244
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:41,735
Too bad you're taking off tonight.

1245
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:44,404
L... Well, I have to. He's abusive to me.

1246
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,032
Not physically,
'cause I would hurt him, but mentally.

1247
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,409
- And, it's time to go.
- I know.

1248
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,786
Maybe next time you're...

1249
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:57,167
Maybe next time you're here, if you ever...

1250
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,337
Yes? That's... What? If I ever what?

1251
00:57:00,628 --> 00:57:03,673
Well, maybe next time you're here, if...

1252
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:07,552
Your engine... Your engine seems to be...

1253
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:10,180
- It's a diesel truck, I'm guessing, right?
- No.

1254
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,640
If you ever want to see a movie
or something...

1255
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:15,810
Oh, my God. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just hold the thought.

1256
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:17,604
I have... I have to go!

1257
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:19,230
- I have to really go!
- What did I say?

1258
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:23,026
No, it's not you, it's the chimichangas!

1259
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:25,195
They're making a run for the border!

1260
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,573
You're throwing chimichanga bombs?

1261
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,867
Oh! Oh, God!

1262
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,244
Jill, where were you?

1263
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,706
She's not talking to us still, I guess.

1264
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,168
I am not talking to you!
Lam talking to Erin!

1265
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,921
Erin, I got to go make
some chocolate squirties!

1266
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:44,214
Oh, God!

1267
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:47,884
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Please get there. Yes.

1268
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:51,471
Hey, Jill, can I talk to you for a second?

1269
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:55,100
No! My bags are packed
and there's nothing left to...

1270
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,435
say.

1271
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:02,065
I spent the day at Felipe's picnic,
where I finally felt welcome.

1272
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:04,776
BY everybody.

1273
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,904
I tried this new food for
the very first time.

1274
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,827
I'm guessing Mexican?

1275
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,664
Yes, Mexican, Mr. Food Detective!

1276
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:19,749
And Felipe treated me like a...

1277
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:24,921
What, is Evel Knievel
doing wheelies in there?

1278
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:30,343
Hey, so I just wanted to talk to you
about last night and everything, and...

1279
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:32,721
Oh, my God.

1280
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,432
Wow, I...

1281
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,896
I was thinking about last night

1282
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,898
and all that stuff you were saying, and...

1283
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,234
Are you hot or something?

1284
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,236
I just have to...

1285
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:50,488
God Almighty!

1286
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:53,491
I would love for you to
stay a few extra days.

1287
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,701
No, I'm going home.

1288
00:58:54,784 --> 00:58:57,162
I already told them
to turn my electricity back on.

1289
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,914
You can't be alone on...

1290
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,416
You can't be alone on New Year's.

1291
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:03,209
Come on, that's just not right.

1292
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,878
You want me to stay that long?

1293
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,963
I thought you were going
on your big cruise.

1294
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:12,010
Jill, I want you to come

1295
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,097
on the cruise with us.

1296
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,476
Pagogo, I can't believe it.
Of course I'll come with you.

1297
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:23,021
Thank you!
Yes! I mean, of... You want... Yes!

1298
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:25,857
Yes! Oh, my G()d!

1299
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,027
Poopsie, Poopsie,
we're cruising through Europe!

1300
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,994
Welcome to Royal Caribbean International.

1301
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:49,798
Poopsie, we're not in the Bronx any more.

1302
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,175
This boat has everything! Oh, my God!

1303
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,052
- Hello?
- What took you so long to pick up?

1304
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:56,221
Jack, Pacino's called here three times.

1305
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,515
What do you want me to
tell the Dunkin' Donuts people, all right?

1306
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:00,809
We got five days, Jack,
to get Scarface or they move on.

1307
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:02,268
I know, I know.

1308
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:05,230
Oh, my God! There's a pool on a boat?

1309
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:07,190
Do you want me
to get Al Pacino on the phone now?

1310
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:10,276
Tell Pacino I'll call him
tonight at 5:30, okay?

1311
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,028
- And just one more thing.
- Yeah, what?

1312
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,698
God told me your feet were on my desk,
so get them off!

1313
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:24,624
All you can eat.

1314
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,418
Go for it, Poopsie.

1315
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:27,794
Have a chocolate bath.

1316
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:29,170
Where were you?

1317
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:30,797
All right, it's 5:30.

1318
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,632
- I got to make a call.
- To who?

1319
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:37,887
I got one last business call to make and
then that's it for me. I love you. Be back.

1320
01:00:41,057 --> 01:00:44,436
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,

1321
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,062
by false intelligence...

1322
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:50,525
Hold me a foe

1323
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:52,569
if I unwittingly

1324
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:58,658
or in my rage,
committed aught that is hardly borne

1325
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:02,746
by any in this princely presence,
I do reconcile

1326
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,416
myself to his friendly peace.

1327
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,795
'Tis death to me to be at enmity,

1328
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,798
and desire all good men's love.

1329
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:15,258
Where were you, Popcorn?

1330
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:16,885
What do you mean? It's 5:30.

1331
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:20,680
No, no, it's 9:30 my time.
I was waiting for you at 5:30.

1332
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,515
It's four hours the other way.

1333
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:24,351
I just... I got confused. I...

1334
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:26,019
Okay, whatever, whatever, whatever.

1335
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:27,520
What's going on? How's she doing?

1336
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,398
We're... We're... We're coming along.
That's how we're doing.

1337
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,150
Coming along?
What does that mean, "coming along"?

1338
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:35,070
- What does that mean?
- Come on, wrap it up!

1339
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,239
It means we're getting there.
We just need a little more time.

1340
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,700
Put her on the phone.
I want to hear her voice.

1341
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,035
She's not here right now.

1342
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:44,704
This reminds me of that boat movie
with Leonardo.

1343
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:47,499
{y:i}- Titanic?
- No, the one with the iceberg.

1344
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:49,918
- Who is that?
- That was Poopsie.

1345
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,461
Why won't you let me talk...

1346
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,672
Hey, can you...
You got to be quiet. I can't hear him!

1347
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,715
All right? Please. Please!

1348
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,967
Yeah, listen, you get me this girl,

1349
01:01:58,301 --> 01:02:01,137
{y:i}or you don't get that
Dunkaccino commercial, you understand?

1350
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:03,014
Don't you know me?

1351
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:05,934
Don't you know I would use all my power,

1352
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:07,268
all the power I have,

1353
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:09,312
to keep a commercial like that
from happening?

1354
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:10,730
Don't you know that?

1355
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,233
Is he seriously breaking out The Godfather?

1356
01:02:13,983 --> 01:02:15,485
I swear to God, I'm going to cry.

1357
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:16,986
Put her on!

1358
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:19,197
Put her on!

1359
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:20,824
Pacino!

1360
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:24,369
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
Hang on for a second. I'll put her on.

1361
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:27,080
Hello?

1362
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,458
Jill, my darling, just to hear your voice.

1363
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,211
What are they doing?
Why are they trying to keep us apart?

1364
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:35,255
Nobody's keeping me apart from anybody.

1365
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:36,965
I'm my own person. You remember that.

1366
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:38,508
{y:i}I know you're your own person.

1367
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,093
Nobody's like you.

1368
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,723
Would you like a little privacy?
I could finish up for you.

1369
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:45,807
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

1370
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,392
Nobody wants to see you.

1371
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,519
But thanks, anyway.

1372
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:50,729
Jill,

1373
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:53,189
can you meet me when you dock in Spain?

1374
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,525
But what about your Shakespeare show?

1375
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:56,818
Don't you have that to do?

1376
01:02:57,068 --> 01:02:58,361
You kidding? This is L.A.

1377
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,196
They got Bruce Jenner playing Lord Rivers.

1378
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:04,034
Yeah, I don't think so.

1379
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:05,660
Darling, put your brother on.

1380
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,037
{y:i}Okay. Here he is.

1381
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:08,580
Hello. Jack's back.

1382
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,708
Popcorn, we did it! We did it!

1383
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,418
I'm coming, I'm coming to get her!

1384
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,087
You're coming to get her?
She just said, "I don't think so," I thought

1385
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:18,423
I can smell horny across an ocean.

1386
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:21,176
Here's how it's going to go down.

1387
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:24,721
9:00 p.m. tomorrow, top deck, portside.

1388
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,139
I'll be there.

1389
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:29,768
Audience, could you tell me where I was?

1390
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:30,977
But he, poor soul

1391
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:33,646
But he, poor soul

1392
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,982
by your first order died.

1393
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,234
{y:i}Good afternoon, passengers.

1394
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,945
{y:i}Hope you all are enjoying
our Royal Caribbean activities.

1395
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:42,781
{y:i}And for those of you
going ashore later,

1396
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:45,575
{y:i}we will be arriving
in beautiful Majorca by sunset.

1397
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:47,744
Come on, sweetie. Go!

1398
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:49,412
Jump! Jump!

1399
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,998
No, no, she's good.

1400
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:54,000
Pagogo, why don't these guys know
how to jump rope?

1401
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:55,168
Why didn't you teach them?

1402
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:57,420
We were the double dutch kings
in our neighborhood,

1403
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,255
and these guys can't do a single wing-ding.

1404
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:00,757
Daddy, you know how to jump rope?

1405
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:02,425
No, I don't know how to jump rope.

1406
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:05,679
Your father likes to pretend
his life started in California.

1407
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:07,722
We were champs.
Everyone loved us in the neighborhood.

1408
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,099
Come on, Daddy, please.

1409
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:10,600
- No. No, no.
- Bring it over here!

1410
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:12,477
CiCi, Rodney, kick it!

1411
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:14,938
- Get up here. Get up here.
- I...

1412
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,232
Do it, do it. Yes!

1413
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,193
Let's go! Come on!

1414
01:04:20,276 --> 01:04:22,028
Here's the twin power. Bring it!

1415
01:04:22,112 --> 01:04:23,571
Oh, my God. Okay.

1416
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,035
Wow!

1417
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,328
Do "The Mummy."

1418
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:34,791
Come on, turn up the heat.

1419
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:39,170
Oh, my God.

1420
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:49,055
That was all your father.

1421
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,558
That was you! You were great, Pokee.

1422
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:52,726
Now she's Pokee?

1423
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:53,935
She's always been Pokee.

1424
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,896
I was thinking, tonight, portside,

1425
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,899
you could go on that deck,
check out the stars,

1426
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,860
put on something gorgeous,
'cause there might be

1427
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,695
a handsome surprise waiting for you.

1428
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:06,239
Really?
You going to introduce me to my Mr. Right?

1429
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:08,324
Maybe.

1430
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:10,076
Oh, really?

1431
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,370
It's not Al Pacino, is it?

1432
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:14,914
Why, is it Al Pacino?

1433
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,332
No, no, it's not.

1434
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,084
'Cause that would just
hurt me at this point.

1435
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,461
But it's not, so...

1436
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:22,589
Treating me like some sort
of prosti-twin, that's bad.

1437
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:25,425
It's not. It's not. It's not.
It's not, all right?

1438
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,344
All right!
Then why are you getting so angry?

1439
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:28,887
Why are you so annoying?

1440
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:29,971
- What?
- Jack!

1441
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,349
Why would you say that?
We were just having fun!

1442
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:34,934
We never have fun when you're around!
I'm sorry!

1443
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:37,395
- No, no! You... This is you, man!
- Go, go!

1444
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:38,772
This is on you! You're out of your mind!

1445
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:40,440
- You're out of your mind!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1446
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:47,322
Let's see. Pit stain.

1447
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,075
Pit stain.

1448
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:53,286
I don't know what that is.

1449
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:55,705
Okay, clean.

1450
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:04,631
You tell anybody,
I will fry you up and eat you.

1451
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:06,966
Yeah.

1452
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,170
All right, where is he, man?
He said portside, I'm portside.

1453
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:27,255
Where am I supposed to be?

1454
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,675
Cheesecake!

1455
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,137
Holy crap!

1456
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:37,140
Just climb on the ladder, there!

1457
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:40,393
Don't you think maybe
you should land that thing?

1458
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,187
That would be easier for me!

1459
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,898
It's safer to hover!

1460
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,483
Wow!

1461
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:49,944
Yeah! Whoa!

1462
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,405
Xavier, look at her go!

1463
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,791
I am back!

1464
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:04,626
SeÃ±orita, I was gone too long?

1465
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:08,338
No, not at all.
It's really good to see you again.

1466
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:11,508
So, what is different about
you tonight? I don't know.

1467
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:13,718
- Nothing.
- No, no, no, no.

1468
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:15,720
There's something...
Did you drop some weight?

1469
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:17,639
- Maybe that's it. Yeah, I'm looking thinner.
- Yeah,

1470
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:19,140
- I think so.
- That's probably what you're seeing.

1471
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,434
I think you're more feminine or something.

1472
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:23,520
A little more... Less muscular.

1473
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,606
I don't agree, but okay.

1474
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,901
Gloobledy globble bibbly blop.

1475
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:32,570
Blobbledobble... gibbledy blip.

1476
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,823
Hibbledy globb, shoelace

1477
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:40,954
This is the heavy, hard stuff
or how are we doing here?

1478
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,205
What is this?

1479
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,166
{y:i}One for the lady. QuÃ© lindo!

1480
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,459
That's enough for me.

1481
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:47,585
Who's Poopsie?

1482
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,337
I keep hearing, "Poopsie, Poopsie."

1483
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:51,256
Poopsie is my bird.

1484
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,217
I used to raise pigeons.

1485
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:55,844
- Really?
- Yeah.

1486
01:08:56,052 --> 01:08:57,679
No, I'm sorry. That was Brando.

1487
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,560
- Are you ticklish?
- No.

1488
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,562
I said I'm not, so...

1489
01:09:05,645 --> 01:09:06,855
No, no, it's just that

1490
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:10,233
Stella Adler, the great acting teacher,
once wrote in a book,

1491
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:14,487
the only way you can
really get to know somebody is if you,

1492
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:17,157
watch their behavior
when they're being tickled.

1493
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,408
Would you do me the honor

1494
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:20,535
and just lift up those girlie arms?

1495
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:24,289
I just haven't shaved under there
in many, many years.

1496
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:27,167
- You don't want to see that.
- We're in Europe. It doesn't matter.

1497
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,502
I think even here,
they might be, like, "What is that?"

1498
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:32,630
No, no, not here. Give me a try.

1499
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:33,923
Okay, so, here we go.

1500
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,800
Oh, my God.

1501
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,093
Look at us.

1502
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:46,770
- All right! Stop it!
- What?

1503
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:51,316
What was that?

1504
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:54,652
Just... I don't really...
I didn't like that.

1505
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:56,029
- I'm sorry.
- That was powerful.

1506
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:58,281
And it just came out of you like, "Boom!"

1507
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:04,162
You know, what? We're better with just...

1508
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:06,164
VVhoa.VVhoa!

1509
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:09,250
I don't even know where Jack is right now.

1510
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:12,253
He's avoiding me. That's where he is.

1511
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:13,630
Can I work in with you guys?

1512
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,799
- Sure.
- Knock yourself out.

1513
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,718
I think he hates 'cause I talk so much.

1514
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,637
It bothers him, you know?

1515
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:22,430
But when I'm in the Bronx,

1516
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,891
I have no one else to talk to but Poopsie,

1517
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:28,645
so when I'm around other humans,
I... I tend to blab a lot.

1518
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:30,897
- No, you don't.
- I do, I do.

1519
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,233
Will you throw a couple more 45s on?

1520
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:35,110
Erin, he was being so nice to me,

1521
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:37,028
and then I had to bring
up the Pacino thing,

1522
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:38,321
because... I don't know.

1523
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:41,366
I do that. It's just 'cause
I'm insecure, you know?

1524
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,994
I feel like the only reason
he brought me on this cruise

1525
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,497
is for some Pacino-related shenanigans

1526
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,165
and it just gets in my head.

1527
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,959
He told me he wanted you
to come on this cruise

1528
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:53,128
because he didn't
want you to spend your first New Year's Eve

1529
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:54,462
without your mom alone.

1530
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:56,339
He said that?

1531
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,841
Yeah.

1532
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:01,928
Oh, my God, that means so much to me.

1533
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:05,306
Why didn't I use
my twin powers to know that?

1534
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,934
Do they not work
when you're out of the country?

1535
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:09,227
Maybe they don't.

1536
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:11,312
That's why he was mad!

1537
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:14,190
'Cause he was being good to me, and I...
I did what I did

1538
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:16,109
and I'm a jerk, and I have to call him.

1539
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:18,611
And I'm gonna
straighten the whole family vacation out,

1540
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:20,363
- I promise. This is so cool!
- Push!

1541
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,201
Push! Push harder!

1542
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,620
I was pushing it!

1543
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,001
- Hey!
- Hey!

1544
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:36,880
All right! Al Pacino! Al, Al Pacino!

1545
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,507
- Al Pacino!
- Now you got it!

1546
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:41,843
All right, let's have... Here you go!

1547
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,845
Boom! Yeah!

1548
01:11:43,928 --> 01:11:46,014
- I always come on the short end of that.
- I'm getting a call.

1549
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:50,101
- Hello.
- Hello?

1550
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,269
Hello?

1551
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:52,979
I don't understand.

1552
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:54,939
Are you mocking my voice right now?

1553
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:56,316
No, no, no, I'm not.

1554
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,984
I... I can't talk right now.

1555
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,904
Okay, don't talk, then. Just listen.

1556
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,366
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.

1557
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:07,494
I'm... I'm the reason
we're fighting right now.

1558
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:09,662
And... And I never thank you enough

1559
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:12,415
for doing all you do for me, so thank you.

1560
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:13,750
- Who is that, your brother?
- Yeah.

1561
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:15,502
Who is that, Jack?

1562
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,379
That's... It's... It's nobody!

1563
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:21,341
Hey, Popcorn, we're having fun here!

1564
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:23,677
Are you with Al Pacino?

1565
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,054
No, no, I'm not! I just...

1566
01:12:26,137 --> 01:12:28,014
I said I can't talk right now, weirdo!

1567
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,267
Please tell me you're not doing
what I think you're doing.

1568
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:34,270
I said I can't talk, so I'm hanging up!

1569
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,649
Jack, speak in your regular voice
or I'll know the real reason

1570
01:12:37,732 --> 01:12:39,442
why you brought me on this cruise.

1571
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:42,278
I can't always do what you want
when you want it! Bye!

1572
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:19,566
I mean, come on!

1573
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,028
Hey, what's Popcorn's problem?

1574
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:26,114
Mayor Mc: Cheesy doesn't
like his new script?

1575
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,450
Get over yourself.

1576
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,827
My brother's very good at what he does.

1577
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:33,329
He's going to write a book
one day, you'll see.

1578
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:35,707
Yes, he's an author.
I forgot, that's right.

1579
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,710
He's got a whole novel in him
about Desenex foot powder.

1580
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,421
So funny.

1581
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:42,589
Okay.

1582
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:43,840
Yes.

1583
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:47,510
That's the Bronx girl coming back.

1584
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:51,348
Now, you take back
what you said about Pagogo!

1585
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:53,183
Go ahead, do it.

1586
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,601
Defend the honor

1587
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:58,313
of that self-deluded,
sycophantic, bitter hack.

1588
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,779
- Are you okay?
- Get off of me.

1589
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:07,322
- Okay.
- It's not okay.

1590
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,782
I'm sorry.

1591
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:09,949
I know... What could I do?

1592
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,534
You know, you had that...

1593
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:13,161
You had a broken bottle
and were coming at me.

1594
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:14,454
Yeah, yeah, well, get away from me.

1595
01:14:14,537 --> 01:14:15,914
- All right.
- Just let me breathe for a second.

1596
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:17,957
- I just...
- I need my own space.

1597
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:19,501
- Back up.
- Okay, all right, I'm backing up.

1598
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:20,877
- Back up!
- All right!

1599
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,420
- Oh, geez. Hey...
- You don't hit a girl

1600
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,047
with a chair on the first date!

1601
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:29,177
It's amazing the way you stick up
for your brother. It's just...

1602
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,305
Well, I got to do that.
Don't I at least owe him that?

1603
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:35,308
'Cause all I ever do is take things
from him and ruin things and...

1604
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:36,726
Well, that's his point of view, you know.

1605
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,688
I mean, that's the way
he makes you see yourself.

1606
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,731
You want to know what I see?

1607
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,191
Yes, I want to know what you see.

1608
01:14:43,274 --> 01:14:44,693
You can get any girl in the world,

1609
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:45,860
and why would you want me?

1610
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,362
Answer that. It makes no sense.

1611
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:52,534
Well, I see an angel with a broken wing.

1612
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:57,163
I see a brother who all he got all his life
was everything.

1613
01:14:57,414 --> 01:14:59,791
All the glory, all the accolades,

1614
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,002
everything since they were two.

1615
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:08,425
I... I see a girl who wants recognition

1616
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:10,885
but just never gets it,

1617
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,430
yet she has a heart so big,

1618
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:16,057
she finds happiness

1619
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,144
in seeing her brother receive it all.

1620
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,815
Yeah, yeah, but come on,
aren't I a pain in the butt?

1621
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:26,568
I mean, don't I annoy everybody?

1622
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:29,029
You got so much love in you, Jill,

1623
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,448
so much to give.

1624
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,617
You just need someone to give it to.

1625
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:41,291
{y:i}To dream

1626
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,296
{y:i}The impossible dream

1627
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:50,467
{y:i}To fight

1628
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:54,804
{y:i}The unbeatable foe

1629
01:15:55,430 --> 01:16:01,394
{y:i}To bear with unbearable sorrow

1630
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,021
Dulcinea.

1631
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,148
Dulci-what-a?

1632
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:08,777
You are Dulcinea
from the Broadway play they offered me

1633
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:13,323
and I am the Man of La Mancha.

1634
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:15,992
You got me there.

1635
01:16:16,242 --> 01:16:18,036
I'm taking the part!

1636
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:19,454
What about my brother?

1637
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:21,873
What do I do? What do I say?

1638
01:16:21,998 --> 01:16:23,249
Your brother.

1639
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,752
I don't know
there's much you can do about him.

1640
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:26,961
I mean, not that he doesn't love you.

1641
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,256
He loves you, I'm sure,
but it's a kind of deathbed love,

1642
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:33,510
the kind of love
he'll look back on when it's too late.

1643
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,596
- Hey, listen, I'm gonna do Man of La Mancha.
- No, no, no, I got to fix it.

1644
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,432
I got to fix it now, now I got to fix it.

1645
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:40,558
Hey, where are you going?

1646
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:41,851
Back to the ship.

1647
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:44,771
Would you stay if I did
your brother's commercial?

1648
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:46,398
The heck with that commercial.

1649
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:48,441
I'm going to see my womb-mate.

1650
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:54,447
{y:i}- Come on, come on, pick up the phone.
- You have reached the voice mailbox of...

1651
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:56,491
{y:i}What is this? How do you...

1652
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:58,326
{y:i}To leave a voice message, press one.

1653
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,661
Oh, God.

1654
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:01,996
Jill!

1655
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:05,291
Jill, open up!

1656
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,876
Jack?

1657
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,253
What are you wearing?

1658
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:11,548
You were with Al Pacino, weren't you?

1659
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:14,884
Wow, you're good.

1660
01:17:15,218 --> 01:17:16,469
Jill was right.

1661
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,054
You are a weirdo.

1662
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:19,556
I know I am.

1663
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:21,307
Where is she? Where's Jill?

1664
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,644
She went home, and now I know why.

1665
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,272
She went home?

1666
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:31,818
God, what am I going to do?

1667
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:58,219
Happy New Year!

1668
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:20,158
Going in alone is fine, Mom,
and I'm not alone. I'm with you.

1669
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:36,257
Hey, well, guess what, I'm not
wearing underwear. It's New Year's Eve.

1670
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,969
Let's have some fun.

1671
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,976
Yo, you guys. Is that Jill Sadelstein?

1672
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:51,272
She was absolutely
the biggest loser in our high school.

1673
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:54,984
I mean, didn't she marry that
bird and move to the jungle?

1674
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:58,405
OMG, she's here alone tonight.

1675
01:18:58,488 --> 01:19:00,657
The loserness continues.

1676
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:04,577
Hey, Jill.

1677
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,414
Hey! Happy New Year, guys.

1678
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:08,998
Where you been hiding, hon?

1679
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:13,003
I was visiting my brother
for Thanksgiving, and he...

1680
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,797
I just decided to stay out there
with him for a while.

1681
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:18,216
Yeah, he must have loved that.

1682
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:22,512
For your information, Carol,
he begged me to stay,

1683
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:25,390
but I'm just too exhausted
from being on game shows

1684
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:27,642
and dating movie stars.

1685
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:30,520
Oh, who'd you hook up
with, Rob Schneider?

1686
01:19:31,354 --> 01:19:32,564
I like him.

1687
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:34,357
God, you're hot.

1688
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:36,609
You know, I don't like to kiss and tell,

1689
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:40,405
but I was with Sir Al Pacino
for a whole night.

1690
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,909
Honey, it must not have worked out
since you're all alone tonight.

1691
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:46,161
- Yeah.
- Aren't you?

1692
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:47,954
She's not alone.

1693
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,914
She's with her family.

1694
01:19:50,248 --> 01:19:52,042
- Jack?
- Jill.

1695
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,710
What are you doing here?

1696
01:19:53,793 --> 01:19:55,128
That's Jack.

1697
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:57,339
I just... I realized

1698
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:00,592
there's something
that I want to tell you so much.

1699
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:03,386
I just... I don't know how to say...

1700
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,097
What?

1701
01:20:07,223 --> 01:20:10,643
Ook maga do do, Pokee.

1702
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:12,020
Oh, my God.

01:20:12,103 --> 01:20:16,399
Ook maga do do blarda, blarda, blarda.

1705
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,656

01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:25,742

Bongi

1710
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:38,171
Bongi que Mahjongee.

1711
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:41,758
Of course, I love those guys.

1712
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:45,720
Bongi para rumpernickel pumpernickel.

1713
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:48,348
That's freaking beautiful.

1714
01:20:48,431 --> 01:20:50,475
It's just... Just beautiful.

1715
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,102
Para Kaya!

1716
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:55,772

Coodlee me, coodlee me.

01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:05,365
I'm so happy, so happy.

1719
01:21:05,448 --> 01:21:06,616
Thank you.

1720
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,790
So, what, are you, like, his wife?

1721
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:15,375
Is that Monica?

1722
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:17,711
Yeah. Hi, I'm Erin. Nice to meet you.

1723
01:21:18,503 --> 01:21:20,922
Well, I guess he settled for second best.

1724
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:24,843
Because I dumped
his sorry butt in high school.

1725
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,220
Yes, I did.

1726
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,513
Don't worry, Erin.

1727
01:21:28,596 --> 01:21:30,515
They used to call her "The Cheese Tray"

1728
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:32,726
'cause she got
passed around at all the parties.

1729
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:37,814
- Oh, we're getting busy.
- I'm right here.

1730
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:40,358
What are you doing?

1731
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:44,112
What did I do?

1732
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:45,739
Don't you touch my sister-in-law.

1733
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,615
Knock her out, Jill, knock her out!

1734
01:21:48,908 --> 01:21:50,326
Ch, my God! You okay?

1735
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:56,833
Muleteers!

1736
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:00,337
Prepare to do battle.

1737
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,424
Oh, my God, is that Colonel Sanders?

1738
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,927
Al, what is this?
Why do you look like that?

1739
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:09,971
He's doing Man of La Mancha now,

1740
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:11,598
so he always stays in character.

1741
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:13,099
Milady.

1742
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:15,602
Al, I'm so sorry.

1743
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:18,396
I thought I made it clear,
we're not meant to be.

1744
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:20,357
Pokee, Klapa!

1745
01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:24,694
It's not you, it's me.

1746
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:26,571
- Dulcinea.
- Yes?

1747
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:30,909
Your purity befits a knight
more worthy than I.

1748
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:34,913
Go to him. He waits for you.

1749
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,291
Pagogo, where's the knight?

1750
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,293
You'll just have to see, Jill, come on.

1751
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:42,087
There's a knight?
Oh, my God, there's a knight?

1752
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,464
- Yeah, yeah.
- There's a knight! There's a knight!

1753
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:47,759
It's a foul monster!

1754
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,512
Al, that's a ceiling fan.

1755
01:22:50,595 --> 01:22:55,100
No, it's a whirling, five-arm beast.

1756
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:58,812
What is this? What?

1757
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:04,901
- She's going to show up.
- What the...

1758
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:07,237
Felipe, what is this?

1759
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:10,156
I don't understand. What is going on here?

1760
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,034
What is happening? What...

1761
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:15,370
Felipe, how did you do this?

1762
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:17,914
- What? This is...
- Jill.

1763
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:19,416
Hi, guys, hi.

1764
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:21,251
What are you doing here?

1765
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:23,420
Jill, before you left,

1766
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:27,340
what I was trying to tell you,

1767
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:30,260
while you were dropping
chimichanga bombs...

1768
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:32,595
That was awful, I'm sorry.

1769
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,515
Is that you make me feel like,

1770
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:38,727
like I just climbed out
of the trunk of my cousin's car

1771
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:42,897
after driving 1,100 miles
across the border.

1772
01:23:43,898 --> 01:23:44,941
Huh?

1773
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:46,901
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1774
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:49,988
I was going to say,
"He's ruining the mood," but...

1775
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:51,072
Yeah.

1776
01:23:51,656 --> 01:23:52,949
But not about you.

1777
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:55,452
What?

1778
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:59,122
I love you, Jill. I love you.

1779
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,792
- You love me?
- Yeah, I love you.

1780
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:04,210
Somebody loves me.

1781
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,004
I love you, Jill.

1782
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:08,757
Will you convert to Judaism for me?

1783
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:12,344
- What?
- I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

1784
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:13,887
Oh, Felipe!

1785
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,221
I love you, Jill.

1786
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:16,973
All right, all right, he said he loved you.

1787
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:18,975
Don't kill him! Come on!

1788
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,226
I love you.

1789
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:22,312
What are you doing?

1790
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,065
Jack, jump in here and lay with me.

1791
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:27,400
- Lay with me.
- Oh, just lay with Felipe.

1792
01:24:27,484 --> 01:24:28,777
Can't you do that?

1793
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:31,321
{y:i}Something's brewing at D'in' D.

1794
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:34,324
Wow!

1795
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:35,533
Al Pacino!

1796
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:38,161
It's not Al any more, it's Dunk.

1797
01:24:38,578 --> 01:24:39,954
Dunk Accino?

1798
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:41,581
Don't mind if I do.

1799
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:44,084
{y:i}- What's my name?
- Dunkaccino

1800
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,670
{y:i}- It's a whole new game
- Dunkaccino

1801
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:49,047
{y:i}You want creamy goodness
I'm your friend

1802
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,216
{y:i}Say hello to my chocolate blend

1803
01:24:51,549 --> 01:24:53,593
{y:i}Attica, hoo-wah, latte lite

1804
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:55,929
{y:i}This whole trial is out of sight

1805
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,431
{y:i}They pulled me back in
with hazelnut, too

1806
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:00,809
{y:i}Caramel swirl...
I know it was you

1807
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:03,478
{y:i}Everyone wants my Dunkaccino

1808
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:05,689
{y:i}Can't get enough of my Dunkaccino

1809
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,274
{y:i}Kids from seven to seventeen-0

1810
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:10,610
{y:i}Lining up for my Dunkaccino

1811
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:12,946
{y:i}- What's my name?
- Dunkaccino

1812
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:15,407
{y:i}A-Dunka-Dunka
Dunka-Dunka-Dunkaccino

1813
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:21,162
And, boom, there you have it.
It's actually 32 seconds,

1814
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,330
so I got to lose two seconds.

1815
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:24,124
Maybe you can tell me what,
what part you would lose,

1816
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:26,543
but I think we are getting there.

1817
01:25:27,877 --> 01:25:29,045
Burn this.

1818
01:25:30,338 --> 01:25:31,548
I'm sorry?

1819
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:36,928
This must never be seen by anyone.

1820
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:39,931
If you didn't like all those close-ups,
we can...

1821
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,267
This is not the final cut.
There's no doubt, we can...

1822
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,727
All copies.

1823
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,022
Destroy them.

1824
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:48,690
- You want me to play it again?
- Has anybody seen this?

1825
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:50,150
Nobody has seen this.

1826
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,193
They have to be found and talked to.

1827
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,779
All right, to be honest, I showed my wife.

1828
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:57,741
- She couldn't believe...
- No good, no good.

1829
01:25:58,658 --> 01:26:00,785
So I used to be fatter,
and so what he would do...

1830
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,620
Picture him way bigger, like...

1831
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:04,998
So what would happen is
we'd get together on Thanksgiving.

1832
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:06,541
He'd kind of gather the family around,

1833
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:08,918
and so I would have to go,

1834
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,796
"This is me before Ultra Slim Fast."

1835
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,548
"And this is me now!"

1836
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,967
And everybody would laugh at him
and he'd go cry in the other room.

1837
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,511
I'm Larry, this is my brother Dave.

1838
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,765
We used to be triplets,
but he ate the other one.

1839
01:26:22,724 --> 01:26:24,142
Let me tell you, I don't
really like getting

1840
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:25,685
into fights with him because I really...

1841
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:28,605
I don't like closing my fist on him,
so when we get into fights,

1842
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:30,190
we look like sissies
when we fight each other.

1843
01:26:30,273 --> 01:26:32,067
You know, 'cause I don't really like...

1844
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:34,986
It's kind of that...
The schoolyard fight when you see two girls.

1845
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:44,204
She's my baby girl, she knows that.

1846
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:45,872
We're like a husband-and-wife relationship.

1847
01:26:45,955 --> 01:26:47,540
- We fight and then we come together.
- That's sick, okay?

1848
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,084
- I mean, not in a sick way.
- You shouldn't say that

1849
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,794
- like that, that's sick.
- Not in a sick way.

1850
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:52,921
I don't like my brother.

1851
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:55,757
I have a deep, intense
dislike for my brother.

1852
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,008
He's a bad guy.

1853
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,510
I know what the problem is.

1854
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:01,054
He didn't say anything about it, did he?

1855
01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:04,808
He don't like the mustache
'cause he can't grow one.

1856
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:08,061
Well, usually, when we celebrate a
birthday, usually it's more than one cake.

1857
01:27:08,144 --> 01:27:09,104
- It's four cakes.
- It's usually four.

1858
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:10,397
- Yeah.
- It's usually four cakes.

1859
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,691
There's right hand,
left hand, right hand, left hand.

1860
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:15,360
Or one for me and one for him
and two for his girlfriend.

1861
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:16,486
Yeah, yeah.

1862
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:17,696
She was actually living in L.A.

1863
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,073
And I was in Kentucky
doing the race at that moment.

1864
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:21,408
- I was tired.
- Yeah.

1865
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:22,575
'Cause I did not train properly.

1866
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:23,868
And I started feeling, like, these pains

1867
01:27:23,952 --> 01:27:25,745
or something like that,
and it was, like, weird, so...

1868
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,247
- So, yeah.
- I mean, that's my part of,

1869
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,165
like, ESPN or ESP.

1870
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:30,375
- Whatever it's called.
- It's ESP.

1871
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:32,460
- Okay, whatever.
- ESPN is the network for sports.

1872
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,009
You figure it out.

1873
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,927
Well, you know, I'm married, so...

1874
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:42,095
Yeah, we don't have girl issues.

1875
01:27:42,178 --> 01:27:45,015
Yeah, well, I... Sometimes, though,
I do try to hook him up with someone.

1876
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:46,182
I mean, if they come up to me

1877
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,601
and they're like, they like me,
I'm like, "Oh, sorry,"

1878
01:27:48,685 --> 01:27:50,937
and then I'm like,
"Hey, look at this guy, though."

1879
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:54,482
And so, I mean,
he's kind of like the backup twin.

1880
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:55,859
I don't care, I take it.

1881
01:27:55,942 --> 01:27:58,903
I said, "Look, dude, I don't think I can...
I don't think I can go on this date,"

1882
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,905
"but I can't, can't break the date."

1883
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:04,534
"'Cause, you know, it's got to happen,
it's got to happen tonight."

1884
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:06,828
- I said, "Well, Rog, you know..."
- You said... What'd you tell me?

1885
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:08,621
"How does the girl look?
How does she look?"

1886
01:28:08,705 --> 01:28:10,081
I said, "Dude, she's a 10, she's hot."

1887
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:11,624
- "She's hot?"
- "She's hot."

1888
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,376
I said, "Well, you know, send me."

1889
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,921
"I'll put her on ice for
the night, you know."

1890
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,257
"Send me out, I'll make sure
everything's good for you,"

1891
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:21,343
"you know, and you'll be
good to go next week."

1892
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:22,927
- So I did.
- He went out with the girl.

1893
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:24,054
It was smooth, right?

1894
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:26,014
I think she fell in love
with him on the first date.

1895
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:28,350
What's funny is,
my brother ended up dating this girl

1896
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:29,851
for, like, four...
What, like three and a half years?

1897
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:30,977
Yeah, it was like three and a half years.

1898
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:33,730
She never knew we switched
on the very first date.

1899
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:35,940
She said, "The best time of
my life was the first date."

1900
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:38,276
- There you go.
- I was like, "Oh, come on."

1901
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:40,987
Growing up with long hair, full Afros.

1902
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:43,990
Oh, yeah, fine, with some platform shoes,

1903
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:47,077
something you'd remember.
You stole my good pair.

1904
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:50,580
All right, let's move, let's move.

1905
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:20,068
The best thing about
being twins is, when I fall,

1906
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:23,363
when I feel sad,
Elijah just picks me right back up

1907
01:29:23,446 --> 01:29:25,657
and that's just helpful to me.

1908
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,368
- Love my twin.
- Love my twin.

1909
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:32,372
- Love you, sis.
- Love you.

1910
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,001
I love us.

1911
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:41,548
You smell.

1912
01:29:42,298 --> 01:29:44,509
- I love this guy.
- I can't imagine life without my brother.

1913
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:48,346
- But we love each other.
- Yeah, but we love each other, right, okay.

1914
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:50,306
You're my only friend.

1915
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:52,767
That's so sad.

1916
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:54,185
- It was cool, man.
- I love my brother.

1917
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:55,603
I love you, man.

1918
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:57,981
No matter how bad he is,
no matter what he does wrong,

1919
01:29:58,064 --> 01:29:59,691
he's still my brother
and he's still number one.

1920
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,322
Without a twin

1921
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:07,490
you're useless.

1922
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:08,908
- We're good to go.
- Triplets? No.

1923
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:10,660
- No.
- Nasty, ugly.

1924
01:30:12,328 --> 01:30:13,580
- No, done.
- No, we're done.

1925
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:14,664
- Twins.
- Yes.

1926
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:16,082
- Keep 'em.
- Let's go.

1927
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,351
I got to get this pin...

1928
