I mean, Charlie said that it wasn't true.

Well, I believe that.

You know, but I also think
that there's a big part of her that's right here.

358

No. I mean, I see her when I look at you.

You know, she had that way of looking
at the world, right in the face.

Oh, you are in trouble.

You see, I could arrest you
for a lot of things.

380
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,960
That would require a lot of paperwork,
and a lot of my time.

381
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,680
And they'd probably
call me down somewhere to testify.

382
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,760
On my day off.

383
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
And I imagine that would be
your day at the gym.

And then knowing the system the way I do,

385
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,320

one night behind bars.

Hello, Murray.

867
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,280
Why, Rena.

868
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,240
What a pleasant surprise.

869
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,720

-Murray? Murray?

-Is she your girlfriend?
-No, no, no. She's not...

Hey, Anabel, check it out.
He's got a girlfriend.

873

-She is not my girlfriend.
-Then who is she?

874

Um, hi, my name is Anabel.
This is my brother, Charlie.

880

And we came here
'cause Murray thought you could help.

You see, he's trying to grant me a wish and...

And nothing really. It's just...

883
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,800

What have you been doing with our wand?

886

Get to work, Rena.

887
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,280
For what we're up against,
it's going to need a quick fix.

888
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,520
I'm sorry. "For what we're up against."
What would that mean, dear?

Nothing, I just said
that we'd get the wands back.

Absolutely not.

915

I don't even know where she lives.

917
