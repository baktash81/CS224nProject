1
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:47,046
LET THE RIGHT ONE IN

2
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,253
Squeal like a pig.

3
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,463
So, squeal!

4
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,175
Squeal!

5
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,385
Squeal like a pig!

6
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,027
The police have ways
to determine foul play...

7
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,195
Do you remember that fire
in Ängby?

8
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,116
A house burned down

9
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,953
and a body was found inside.

10
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,457
We knew that the fire
had been set

11
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,084
to conceal the fact

12
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,295
that the person had been
murdered beforehand.

13
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,715
So, how could they know that?

14
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,633
Well... Go ahead.

15
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,180
There was no smoke in the lungs
of the person who died.

16
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,474
That's correct.

17
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,185
Did you figure that out
right now?

18
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,064
No, I read a lot...

19
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,483
What kind of books
would that be?

20
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,528
Just books.

21
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,783
Okay... I'm going to talk to you
about drugs.

22
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,828
What do you think are the most common
types of drugs...

23
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,335
Hey, Oskar...

24
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,131
What are you staring at?

25
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,426
Are you looking at me?

26
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,097
Well, fuck off!

27
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,188
Oink!

28
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,690
What a good piggy you are.

29
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,618
- Come on, it's time for PE.
- I'm not going...

30
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,594
Here's the weather forecast...

31
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,797
Excuse me...

32
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,549
Do you have the time?

33
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,219
I don't have a watch.

34
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,804
What's that?

35
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,308
This?
It's called halothane.

36
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,089
Ricky...

37
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,055
Ricky!

38
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,354
Beat it!

39
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,664
Stupid dog!

40
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,736
What are you staring at?

41
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,071
Well?

42
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,408
Are you looking at me?

43
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,245
Well, fuck off!

44
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,249
What's your problem?

45
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,378
Are you scared?

46
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,799
So, scream.

47
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,843
Squeal!

48
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,440
What are you doing?

49
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,151
Nothing.

50
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,904
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

51
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,825
- Do you live here?
- Yeah...

52
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,244
I live right here,
in the jungle gym.

53
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,790
Seriously, where do you live?

54
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,960
Next door to you.

55
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,964
How do you know where I live?

56
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,849
Just so you know,
I can't be your friend.

57
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,353
What do you mean?

58
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,272
Does there have to be a reason?

59
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,608
That's just the way it is.

60
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,995
Are you so sure
that I want to be your friend?

61
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,359
You're supposed to help me!

62
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,453
Do I really have to
take care of this myself?

63
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,468
Say something!

64
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,721
Forgive me.

65
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,268
They don't know why
the boy was killed.

66
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,731
I realize that many of you
may be worried.

67
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,525
The counselor
will be here all day

68
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,778
so go talk to her
if you feel the need.

69
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,947
Any questions?

70
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,409
Is it all right to kill the killer
if you happen to meet him?

71
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,204
That wasn't very nice, Conny.

72
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,208
Oskar...

73
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,435
Where are you, Piggy?

74
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,815
- Where are you, Piggy?
- Piggy!

75
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,169
Now go straight home
after school.

76
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,923
And don't leave the courtyard
until I get home.

77
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,050
It was way over in Vällingby.

78
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,345
A person who kills children...

79
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,640
...is certainly capable of taking
the subway two stations.

80
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,977
Or walking a mile.

81
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,409
No, Oskar will be staying
with his dad next week.

82
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,543
KILLER TAPS BLOOD

83
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:10,319
VICTIM'S BLOOD WAS TAPPED

84
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,396
- Hi.
- If it isn't my little honey bunny...

85
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,943
The death penalty

86
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,613
has no justification

87
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,335
- in a society based on the rule of law.
- Based on the rule of law?

88
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,245
The government wants us
to believe in that crap,

89
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,499
just like the Russians...

90
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,044
Are you saying
there aren't any Russians?

91
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,463
Of course there are...

92
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,548
Never seen the guy before.

93
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,219
But take vipers...

94
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,554
Does anyone actually get bitten?

95
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,307
That guy over there
just moved into my neighborhood.

96
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,601
He has a kid.

97
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,729
They're in Janne's old place.

98
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,483
- Should I ask him to join us?
- Sure...

99
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,654
He might pay for a round.

100
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,406
In that case, he's welcome
even if he has cancer.

101
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,251
Bad news?

102
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,714
Yeah, life stinks...

103
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,680
You just moved into number 15, right?

104
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,353
You don't have to sit here all alone,
join us and have a laugh.

105
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,816
No thanks, I'm in a hurry.

106
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,033
Mom...

107
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,035
I'm going out.

108
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,539
Aren't you going
to watch the show?

109
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,791
No, it's no good.

110
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,294
Stay in the courtyard, okay?

111
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,757
I'll just watch this
on my own, then.

112
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,473
So you're back...

113
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,516
So you're back.

114
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,062
I want to be left alone.

115
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,939
So do I.

116
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,107
Then go home.

117
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,402
You go home, I've lived here
way longer than you.

118
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,994
What's that?

119
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,041
This?
It's a Rubik's cube.

120
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,710
Is it some kind of puzzle?

121
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,754
Yeah...

122
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,471
Want to try?

123
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,516
You can give it back tomorrow.

124
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,935
I might not be here tomorrow.

125
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,854
The day after, then.
But that's it.

126
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,956
How do you do it?

127
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,293
You want each side
to be a solid color.

128
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,753
Like this...

129
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,116
You smell funny.

130
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,418
Aren't you cold?

131
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,421
- No.
- Why not?

132
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,757
I guess I've forgotten how.

133
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,848
See you tomorrow.

134
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,728
Thanks for yet another evening
steeped in friendship and merriment.

135
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,730
Good night, old buddy.

136
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,360
See you tomorrow.

137
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,404
You're the best, Jocke!

138
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,800
Help...

139
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,977
Hello?

140
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,523
Please help me.

141
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,736
Is something wrong?

142
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,955
Are you all right?

143
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,627
- Can you get up?
- No...

144
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,891
Oh... I'll carry you,
and take you to a phone.

145
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,392
Careful.

146
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,311
You don't weigh a thing.

147
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,485
Bloody hell!

148
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,349
Never again...

149
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,986
Gösta?

150
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,115
Christ, it's been ages.
I haven't seen you all year.

151
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,909
Jocke...

152
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,495
Jocke!

153
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:09,126
I was out on the balcony
and I saw...

154
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,671
I saw Jocke and this kid...

155
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,676
How big was this kid?

156
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,513
It was around here somewhere.

157
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,268
Move it.

158
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,732
What the hell is this?

159
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,319
Christ!

160
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,988
It's blood!

161
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,032
Who the hell did this?

162
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,586
How did you do it?

163
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,135
I just twisted it.

164
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,850
Do I smell better now?

165
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,150
Um, what's your name?

166
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,153
Eli.

167
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,822
What's yours?

168
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,909
Eli?

169
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,871
I'm Oskar.

170
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,832
How old are you?

171
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,335
12... more or less.

172
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,047
What about you?

173
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,508
12 years, 8 months, and 9 days.

174
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,677
What do you mean,
"more or less"?

175
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,975
When's your birthday?

176
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,019
I don't know.

177
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,857
Don't you celebrate
your birthday?

178
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,235
Your parents...
they've got to know.

179
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,120
Then you don't get
any birthday presents, do you?

180
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,248
No.

181
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,214
You can have this, if you want.

182
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,967
It's yours.

183
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,349
I don't get how you did this...

184
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,435
Want me to show you?

185
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,527
- Here. Go ahead.
- Start with the corners.

186
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,822
Then this part.
And you put...

187
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,576
Like this...

188
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,038
No, like this.

189
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,333
Then this...

190
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,297
"...slipping in and out
of the shadows,"

191
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,592
"running quick and quiet
and keeping out of the sun."

192
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,972
"So soon they went back,"

193
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:58,350
"grumbling and cursing,
to guard the door."

194
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,145
"Bilbo had escaped."

195
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,778
Right...
That's all for today.

196
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,990
Has everyone handed in their slips
for the field trip on Thursday?

197
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,244
Well then, class dismissed.

198
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,879
- Oskar, aren't you...?
- No, I have stuff to do.

199
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,471
Hurry up, Conny.

200
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,198
What were you writing down?

201
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,119
What do you mean?

202
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,455
Show it to me.

203
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,631
No.

204
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,175
What do you mean, no?
Hand it over.

205
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,736
Crap, who's going
to talk to his mom?

206
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,072
Wait for me!

207
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,826
Oskar...

208
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,251
Piggy!

209
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,631
I fell down during recess.

210
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,219
I tripped on this rock.

211
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,931
Oh, honey...

212
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,726
You've got to watch your step.

213
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:41,990
Short, long,
long, short, long...

214
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,536
Short, long, long, short, long.

215
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,080
Exactly.

216
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,083
Here...

217
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,715
What happened to you?

218
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,177
There...

219
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,142
Some classmates...

220
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,982
Where do you go to school?

221
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,485
Oskar, listen...

222
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,406
Hit back.

223
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,787
You've never hit back...

224
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,624
Have you?

225
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,043
So do it.

226
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,506
Hit back. Hard.

227
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,218
There are three of them.

228
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,679
Hit back even harder.

229
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,765
Hit harder than you dare,

230
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,684
then they'll stop.

231
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,562
- What if...?
- Then I'll help you.

232
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,317
I can do that.

233
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,872
Come on.

234
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,227
Hey...

235
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,688
Move.

236
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,732
You're in the way.

237
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,028
Go on.

238
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,710
Let's see,

239
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,046
short, short...

240
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,444
S... W... E... E... T...

241
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,191
D... R...

242
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,443
Keep proper distance.

243
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,612
Not too close, not too far.

244
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,781
Keep distance.

245
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,872
Nice and steady.

246
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,377
Yes?

247
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,552
The after school
weight-lifting program...

248
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,931
Could I sign up for it?

249
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,684
You don't have to sign up,
just be there at seven.

250
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,478
Are you thinking of doing it?

251
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,815
Good.

252
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,068
If you practice,
you can make strong.

253
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,950
See you.

254
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,830
Wait a sec...

255
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,208
Mixed candy.

256
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,344
Here.

257
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,851
No.

258
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,523
Too bad.

259
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,903
I can... try one.

260
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,945
Sorry...

261
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,425
Oskar...

262
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,677
Do you like me?

263
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,515
Yeah, a lot.

264
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,767
If I wasn't a girl...

265
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,354
...would you like me anyway?

266
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,732
I suppose so.

267
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,363
Why do you ask?

268
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,566
Oskar! Hello!
Hello, son.

269
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,612
- You're early.
- Hi, Dad.

270
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,165
There are people who know my face

271
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,043
who know that I live here
with you.

272
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:38,424
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- What else am I good for?

273
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:46,057
Could you do one thing for me?

274
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,894
Could you not see
that boy tonight?

275
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,938
Please?

276
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,703
What the...?

277
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,331
What's taking Matte so long?

278
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,846
Hey, Matte...

279
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,891
You can jerk off at home.

280
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,896
Matte, hurry up.

281
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,109
What are you up to?

282
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,114
Matte!

283
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,867
Let me down.

284
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,122
Let me down...

285
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,435
Help!

286
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,017
Matte!

287
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,727
Help!

288
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,146
Open the goddamn door!

289
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,400
Help!

290
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,028
Help!!

291
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,782
Help!!!

292
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,641
- Get me down!
- What are you doing up there?

293
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,862
Eli...

294
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,082
...according to Communist Party
Chairman Brezhnev.

295
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:07,336
An unidentified man
was arrested yesterday,

296
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,424
charged with murder
and attempted murder

297
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,385
in Vällingby, near Stockholm.

298
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,971
The man's self-inflicted
facial wounds

299
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,349
make it hard
to determine his identity.

300
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,560
And now, sports...

301
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,858
Come on in.
Through those doors.

302
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,711
Yes?

303
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,713
Excuse me,

304
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,507
I'm looking for my dad.

305
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,093
Has he been admitted
to this hospital?

306
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,888
What's his name?

307
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,058
He's sick.

308
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,310
The police brought him in.

309
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,354
Do you know where he is?

310
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,901
He's up on the seventh floor.

311
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,779
Only that's a restricted ward.

312
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,906
I could call them...

313
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,617
That's all right.

314
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,955
Oh, you poor thing...

315
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,616
May I come in?

316
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,468
- A kid...
- What kid?

317
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,554
Why would a kid kill Jocke?

318
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,640
I don't know.

319
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:33,143
Jocke was the sweetest guy
there ever was.

320
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,816
I'd like to tear that damn kid
limb from limb.

321
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,613
Oskar!

322
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,867
May I come in?

323
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,789
Don't look at me.

324
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,168
But you have to say
that I can come in.

325
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,172
You can come in...

326
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,974
Close your eyes.

327
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,446
How did you get in?

328
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,324
I flew.

329
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,035
Yeah, sure...

330
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,412
You're not wearing anything.

331
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:37,166
You're as cold as ice.

332
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,711
Sorry...

333
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,964
Is that gross?

334
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,385
No...

335
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,015
Higgledy-piggledy shout.

336
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:57,227
How many fingers are out?

337
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,651
Eli...

338
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,114
Want to go steady?

339
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,288
What do you mean?

340
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,791
Well...

341
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,753
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

342
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,926
Oskar... I'm not a girl.

343
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,930
Oh...

344
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,100
But do you want
to go steady or not?

345
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,770
Couldn't we just keep things
the way they are?

346
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,569
I guess...

347
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,447
Do you do anything special
when you go steady?

348
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,951
No.

349
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:58,288
So everything's the same?

350
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,377
Yes.

351
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,800
Then we'll go steady.

352
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,803
It'll be you and me.

353
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,391
Really?

354
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,647
Good.

355
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,020
Listen up!

356
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:31,441
Lower school, skate with me.

357
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:36,321
Middle school, free skating.

358
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,994
Watch out for holy, over there.

359
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,582
- Understood?
- Avila...

360
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,750
it's "a hole in the ice".

361
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,420
Oh...

362
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,172
I meant "hole in the ice".

363
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:58,218
- Fancy a swim?
- Beware of holy in ice.

364
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,780
So, do you want to go swimming?

365
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,370
No.

366
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:12,501
Mr. Avila,
I have to pee.

367
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,338
- Go behind tree.
- On the ice?

368
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,675
What does it matter?
You make new ice, yellow ice.

369
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,846
What's that stick for?

370
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:28,016
To hit you with,
if you try anything.

371
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,812
Are you a brave pig,
all of a sudden?

372
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,904
I'm going to push you,

373
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,989
and you aren't
going to do a thing.

374
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,033
Isn't that so?

375
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:49,830
Little piggy watch your step,

376
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,164
or I'll get you...

377
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,671
Look!

378
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,050
Come on.

379
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:06,555
Mr. Avila will freak out...

380
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,099
Are we supposed
to just let him stand there?

381
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,995
What's going on?!

382
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,915
What are you up to?

383
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:35,644
Oh yes, they will blame us!

384
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,939
Am I supposed to tell them
my son doesn't have a father?

385
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,735
Yes, it is!
Here he comes.

386
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,114
They called from school.

387
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,617
And you'd better talk to your father,
because I...

388
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,330
Hello.

389
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,916
I'm fine.

390
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,335
I don't know.

391
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,798
Is the bike working?

392
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,591
We'll see.

393
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:47,090
Hello, Oskar.

394
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,595
So you did go swimming after all?

395
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,557
I'm only kidding.

396
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,247
We're not really allowed
to be in here.

397
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,003
But some of the bigger kids
hang out here anyway.

398
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,926
And you know what?
Today...

399
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:35,347
They tried to push me
into a hole in the ice, but I...

400
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,101
I had this stick,

401
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,187
and I hit Conny so hard

402
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,397
that he had to go to the ER.

403
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,775
Oskar...

404
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,904
Yeah?

405
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:54,324
Bravo!

406
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,878
What did you want us to do?

407
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,416
We're going to mix...

408
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,627
It doesn't hurt.

409
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,840
All you need to do
is poke your finger.

410
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,362
Eli?

411
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,829
Go!

412
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,917
Go away!

413
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,501
They had to use a chainsaw
to get him out.

414
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,546
Go tell the cops your story.

415
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,464
What's your problem, Gösta?

416
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,591
They'll ask me questions...

417
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,385
What do you mean?

418
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,263
They might shut me
into one of those rooms...

419
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,266
...and shine bright lights
in my eyes...

420
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,646
- Jocke and I were this close.
- I'm sorry, but I can't...

421
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,690
It's your duty,

422
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:18,027
you witnessed a crime.

423
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,071
Christ...

424
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:25,034
You go on about
what a great guy he was...

425
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,039
But now that he's gone,
I have nothing left.

426
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,877
Nothing...

427
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,754
- Oh, Lacke...
- Stop it!

428
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,215
Don't you "oh, Lacke" me!

429
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,469
You don't get it,

430
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,264
you're so damn cold.

431
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,602
No one gets it...

432
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,280
Smooth, Lacke.

433
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,825
Ginia, please...

434
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,119
Wait up!

435
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,962
Could we at least talk about it?

436
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,059
Come on...

437
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,043
Get off her!

438
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,061
Wait up...

439
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,562
You took my lighter.

440
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:20,108
I didn't mean it, Ginia...
I love you.

441
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:24,297
What the hell...?

442
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:25,608
No...

443
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:36,452
- I didn't see that coming.
- You never do.

444
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,872
But this time I'll get you.

445
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,916
Dream on.

446
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,210
You go first.

447
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,848
- Well, look who's here!
- Good evening to you all.

448
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,859
You look like you're having
a grand old time.

449
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,652
That's right.

450
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,948
And Oskar's here...

451
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,752
Right...

452
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:33,176
Dad...
It's your turn.

453
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,387
We have guests.

454
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,849
It's nice and cozy in here.

455
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,024
So you had
a little something, then?

456
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:28,356
"I must be gone and live,
or stay and die."

457
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,776
Yours, Eli.

458
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,038
It ended up all wrong.

459
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:34,081
It was supposed to be great,
but their calculations were all wrong.

460
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,508
It was all wrong from the start.

461
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:42,888
And it just got worse.
So when you pass these buildings...

462
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,308
Pretty damn busy
around here tonight.

463
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,186
Come on in.

464
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,997
Ginia?
Where the hell have you been?

465
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,502
What's going on?

466
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:16,922
I've been so damn worried.

467
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:20,176
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone!

468
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,474
No...

469
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,353
What the hell's wrong with the cats?!

470
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,275
- Open the fucking door!
- Let go! No...

471
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,566
Oskar, is that you?

472
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,902
Yeah.

473
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,133
Are you a vampire?

474
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,432
I live off blood...

475
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,225
Yes.

476
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,521
Are you...

477
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,066
...dead?

478
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:44,695
No.

479
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,739
Can't you tell?

480
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:53,621
But...

481
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:57,166
Are you old?

482
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,337
I'm twelve.

483
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:04,131
But I've been twelve
for a long time.

484
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,493
Are you like, poor?

485
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,915
See that egg over there?

486
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,336
If you sold it, you could buy
a whole nuclear power plant.

487
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,004
For real.

488
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:48,342
Yeah, sure...

489
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,265
Put your finger on it.

490
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:15,786
Where do those rings come from?

491
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,127
I'm going home.

492
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:25,588
I have flyers
to distribute tomorrow.

493
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:30,301
To make money?

494
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:34,638
I can give you money.

495
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,647
Here.

496
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,442
Take it if you like.

497
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:54,325
You stole this...

498
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:58,203
...from the people you killed, right?

499
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,040
- It was given to me.
- By who?

500
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,667
By different people.

501
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,465
I want to go home now.

502
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:15,804
If you'll let me.

503
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,069
It's time to sell it...

504
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,113
Dad's stamp collection.

505
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:37,326
What a guy, one stamp...

506
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,792
80,000.

507
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:48,128
Eighty grand.

508
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:51,131
If you find the right buyer.

509
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:53,759
I won't accept any less...

510
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:59,556
Then we'll buy that nice cottage.

511
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,685
The countryside is so beautiful.

512
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,728
The two of us can live there.

513
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:10,192
Listen to the birds sing
and grow our own vegetables...

514
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,114
Lacke, you've got to help me.

515
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,951
Sure...

516
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,371
That kid...

517
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,749
She must have infected me
somehow.

518
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:30,337
I don't want to live.

519
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,520
Good morning!

520
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,898
Things are looking up.

521
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,233
You can probably go home today.

522
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,360
Won't that be nice?

523
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:40,449
I'll just unlock this.

524
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,243
And take a blood sample.

525
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,287
There...

526
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:48,957
Listen...

527
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:54,088
Could you open the blinds?

528
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,633
Sure...
No problem.

529
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:13,190
Hand over your cap.

530
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:17,111
Do it! What's your problem?
Give it to me.

531
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:20,114
What are you, some kind of moron?
Give it to me.

532
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:22,324
Go for it, Conny!

533
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:25,702
Put up a fight...

534
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,412
Are you blind as well as deaf?

535
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:31,542
- Hey...
- What's up?

536
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,794
Could I borrow your keys?

537
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,213
I want to go home.

538
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,674
Sure.
Here you go.

539
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,717
Thanks.
See you later.

540
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,970
Who's the boss at your house?

541
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:45,556
- Well, well...
- What are you laughing at?

542
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,142
Are you hard of hearing, Conny?

543
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:13,041
- Hey.
- Hi.

544
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:24,511
You have to invite me in.

545
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,598
What happens if I don't?

546
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:32,019
What happens
if you walk in anyway?

547
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,440
Is there something in the way?

548
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,464
No!

549
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:44,466
You can come in!

550
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,647
Who are you?

551
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,902
I'm like you.

552
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,446
What do you mean?

553
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,657
What are you staring at?

554
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,242
Well?

555
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,203
Are you looking at me?

556
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,497
So scream!

557
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,791
Squeal!

558
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:22,504
Those were the first words
I heard you say.

559
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,052
I don't kill people.

560
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,432
But you'd like to,

561
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,225
if you could...

562
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,270
To get revenge.

563
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,480
Right?

564
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:42,232
Yes.

565
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,985
I do it because I have to.

566
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:51,199
Be me, for a little while.

567
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:17,517
Please...

568
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,562
be me, for a little while.

569
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,034
You can borrow
one of my mom's dresses.

570
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,656
Oskar... Let me in.

571
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,581
What are you up to?

572
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,584
I'm in the bathroom, I'm coming.

573
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:09,337
Let me in, Oskar...

574
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:40,971
Hi, I'm in the bathroom.
Please don't go in.

575
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:44,057
Want to hang out tonight?

576
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,143
I really like you. Yours, Eli

577
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,331
I can't see a thing...

578
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,833
No!

579
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,806
Let go of me!

580
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:42,981
Thank you.

581
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:49,654
Oskar...

582
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,536
I've got to go away.

583
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:22,246
WHO KILLED THE MAN IN THE ICE?

584
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:29,499
Hello?

585
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:32,251
Is that you, Oskar?

586
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:34,378
It's me, Martin.

587
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:38,049
Mr. Avila wanted to know
if you're coming tonight.

588
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,219
Why?

589
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:44,263
I guess he just wanted to know.

590
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,976
Maybe he wants you to be there.

591
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:51,604
I'm not sure...

592
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,356
It was good, by the way...

593
01:41:53,398 --> 01:41:56,400
What you did to Conny.

594
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:58,861
He had it coming.

595
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,739
What an actor...

596
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,117
Do you think so?

597
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,661
So, are you coming tonight?

598
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:12,625
BATHHOUSE

599
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,188
Good, Oskar.

600
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,525
Hi...

601
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:44,407
Hello, Oskar.

602
01:42:49,204 --> 01:42:51,831
Hello.

603
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,083
Come, we'll start
with aqua aerobics.

604
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,724
Hurry up!

605
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,530
Come on, Oskar!

606
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:29,243
Move your body...

607
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:41,797
What? Christ...!

608
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,943
Call the fire department! Fire!

609
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,967
Beat it!

610
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:28,970
Clear out!

611
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,342
Do you know who I am?

612
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:11,637
- Yes...
- Good.

613
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,597
Then you get it.

614
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,433
We're going to have
a little contest.

615
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:19,812
You stay under water...

616
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,649
...for three minutes.

617
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:26,527
If you can do it,
I'll just nick you.

618
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:30,406
But if you can't

619
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:33,326
I'll poke one of your eyes out.

620
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:35,453
An eye for an ear, right?

621
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:40,875
But that's impossible.

622
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:43,252
That's your problem.

623
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,642
Three minutes.

624
01:45:59,644 --> 01:46:01,312
Better take a deep breath.

625
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:05,983
Five,

626
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:07,777
four,

627
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:08,944
three...

628
01:46:08,987 --> 01:46:11,447
...two, one.

629
01:46:49,694 --> 01:46:52,029
- Jimmy...
- Shut up!

630
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,949
- Let's go, Conny.
- I told you to shut up!

631
01:53:56,955 --> 01:53:58,155
LET THE RIGHT ONE IN
