1
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,701
<i> Take a deep breath</i> <i>
and start at the beginning.</i>

2
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,739
<i> Tell them how we first met.</i>

3
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,307
Hi.
Hi.

4
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,482
<i> Tell them that</i>

5
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,818
<i> ever since</i>
<i> we shared our dreams...</i>

6
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:55,788
Yeah!
Yeah!

7
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,292
I had a dream
last night.

8
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,594
<i> ...even Alex's weirdest ones.</i>

9
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,630
You know a rowing boat?

10
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,566
That little curvy bit
the oar sits in?

11
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,170
It's called
a rollock by the way.
A what?

12
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,173
Rollock, like "bollock"
with an "R."

13
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,443
That was me.
I was that thing.

14
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,316
<i> No. Keep that as our secret.</i>

15
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,619
Rosie?
Rosie, it's time.

16
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,856
<i> Tell them that this is,</i>

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,358
<i> that this has to be...</i>

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,760
Everybody!

19
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,863
<i> ...one of the happiest</i>
<i> days of my life.</i>

20
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,765
Please!

21
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:48,540
For those I haven't
had the chance to say
hi to properly,

22
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,210
I'm Rosie.

23
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,581
And this has got to be

24
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,683
one of the happiest
days of my life.

25
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,403
Shots!

26
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,611
Yeah! Beyonce!

27
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,612
Yeah!

28
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,750
Whoa!

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,668
- Hi, Alex.
- How's it going, mate?

30
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,569
All right.

31
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,971
It's Alex!

32
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,275
It was totally my fault,
the whole thing.

33
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,377
Oh, I'd love to
believe you, Alex,
I really would.

34
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,246
I just happen to know
my own daughter.

35
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,514
A fine doctor
you're gonna make

36
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,216
if this is how
you carry on.

37
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,984
Why is everybody
shouting?

38
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,225
I'm so embarrassed
about last night.

39
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,893
No, no, you don't
have to be.

40
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,631
Ugh,
I behaved so badly!

41
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,438
Yeah, but bad
can be good, too.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,908
Good? It was awful.
Oh, I feel sick even
thinking about it.

43
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,679
About which part?

44
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,915
All of it.
It never happened.

45
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,783
Alex, okay?
You can't tell anyone!

46
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,820
Right.

47
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,792
Go, go, go!

48
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,862
How did we get home
from the hospital?

49
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,865
Uh, Mom picked us up.

50
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,333
They needed
a parent's name,

51
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,968
so, I obviously didn't
want to give yours.

52
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,570
And she thinks
it's my fault anyway,

53
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,038
I'm a terrible influence.
Blah, blah, blah.

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,540
Oh, well, you are.

55
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,909
So, now,
I have to spend two hours

56
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,512
in the library every day
for a fortnight.

57
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,581
Nightmare.
Well, it could be worse.

58
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,786
Bethany Williams
has just got
a part time job there.

59
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,920
Yeah, right.

60
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,722
What?

61
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,658
Bethany Williams?
Mmm.

62
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,527
Forget it, even I want
to sleep with her.

63
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,831
For your information,
she has been
giving me the eye.

64
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,335
why you haven't
squeezed that zit
on your forehead.

65
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,804
Fuck off!
No. Come here.
I can do it for you.

66
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,839
Don't touch me!
Don't you dare!

67
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,919
Ow!

68
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,571
Just look
at Greg right now.
What a bimbo.

69
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,343
He invited me to
the school dance.

70
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,349
Uh, what did you say?

71
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,584
No, obviously.
I'm going with you.

72
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,654
Hey, Alex.

73
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,855
I missed you
in the library today.

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,395
Yeah, uh, I had nothing...

75
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,031
Uh, I mean, yeah.
I was a bit...
A bit of busy...

76
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,400
Don't be a stranger.
Yeah.

77
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,901
Yeah, absolutely not.

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,505
I'll see you there.

79
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,840
- Hey, girls!
- What did he say to you?

80
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,108
Pathetic.

81
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,677
She's mine for the taking.

82
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,712
You're lucky she didn't
trip over your tongue

83
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,847
dragging halfway
across the ground.

84
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,617
Whoa. Okay. All right.

85
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,553
Well, give me
some tips then,
if you are so clever.

86
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,055
How do I go about
seducing a woman

87
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,123
who is apparently
out of my league?

88
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,526
Is that a serious question?
Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,497
Mmm, well,
you're at a disadvantage

90
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,465
being a, you know,
virgin.

91
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,101
No, no, no,
all right?

92
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,870
We can work with that.

93
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,105
First you have to be cool.
Ignore her.

94
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,740
Act like you could
take it or leave it.

95
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,542
You see, that I've
had practice at.
Hmm.

96
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,811
Uh, second, you have
to make her feel like

97
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,913
you've seen something
in her no one else has.

98
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,416
Like her soul.

99
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,417
While also ignoring her?

100
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,951
Yes.

101
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,721
Okay,
and what happened
to the sex?

102
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,623
This is about the sex!

103
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,858
God! You're so fucked up.

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,427
Mmm. You have no idea.

105
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,101
She wants me to
take her to the dance.

106
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,703
Really?

107
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,106
Yeah, imagine.

108
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,111
Take her, if it means
that much to you.

109
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,184
Come on. You'd have
no one to go with.

110
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,786
Uh...

111
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,755
I got asked
by the fittest guy
in our year, Alex.

112
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,591
I think I'm fine.

113
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:43,728
What, so actually
this is quite
convenient for you.

114
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,597
Yeah.

115
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,903
All right. Well, yeah,
I'll go ask her then.

116
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,005
Go for it.

117
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,109
Okay. Fine, I will.

118
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,481
- Bethany? Bethany, hi.
- Hey.

119
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,650
Yeah!

120
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,073
Come on.

121
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,944
<i> Me, too.</i>

122
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,613
<i> I need to concentrate</i>
<i> so I can pass my exams</i>

123
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,114
<i> and get a life.</i>

124
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,310
Not Bethany!

125
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,848
Fuck!

126
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,150
Right, Rosie Dunne,
get yourself down to
the headmaster's office.

127
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,954
No, no, no,
it was my fault,
Mr. Simpson.

128
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,789
I had something
I needed to tell her.

129
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,292
So I see, Alex.
Congratulations.

130
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,664
Yes, Alex!

131
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,331
I know we're not
officially talking,

132
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,999
but I need help
with my tie.

133
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,938
For a minute there,
I thought you might be

134
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,273
in love with me
or something.

135
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,375
Alex, you will
forever be the boy

136
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,010
who wiped bogeys
on my favorite

137
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,645
party dress, okay?

138
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,779
Don't flatter yourself.

139
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,348
Good.

140
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,183
I know boy-girl
friendships

141
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,051
can be quite
complicated sometimes,

142
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,754
but you know
I'm always here
if you need to talk.

143
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,325
What do you think?

144
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,795
Boobs <i> au naturel</i>
or pushed up?

145
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,199
In? Or out?

146
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,072
Well, uh, I mean,
it depends.

147
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,775
Is it for dancing,
or is it, um...

148
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,876
Hmm.

149
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,079
Who knows?

150
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,784
So, where is this tool
meant to be meeting you?

151
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,720
You're so rude!
Um, I think at the front.

152
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,821
Uh, yes...

153
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,258
Hey, gorgeous.

154
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,894
Oh.

155
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,665
See ya!

156
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,268
Wanker.

157
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,856
Okay.

158
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,728
Fuck!

159
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,135
Oh, just...

160
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,775
You have done
this before?
Yeah. Haven't you?

161
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,110
It's like brushing
my teeth.

162
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,145
Ahhh! Bollocks!

163
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,350
That's... Look,
let me help you...
No, leave it!

164
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,018
Okay, I've got it.
Fuck! Ouch.

165
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,322
Okay, quick!
Quick, okay.

166
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,157
Here we go!
Okay, quick!

167
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,534
Sweet Jesus!

168
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,142
Oh.

169
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,411
Wow.

170
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,781
I know. I know.

171
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,288
Mmm.

172
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,191
Okay.

173
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,093
Where is it?
What?

174
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,164
The thing.
I don't know.

175
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,033
Seriously, Greg,
where is it?

176
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,536
You had it!

177
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,437
Look, it can't have
just disappeared!

178
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,510
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

179
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,598
Rosie?
Have you found it?

180
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,534
Do you want me
to have a look for you?

181
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,904
Really?
Yeah, go on all fours.

182
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,439
Bugger off!

183
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,915
<i> Rosie!</i>
Alex! Thank God!
Where are you?

184
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,317
<i> I'm on my way out!</i>

185
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,284
No, wait,
you've got to help me,

186
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,519
there's been an accident!

187
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,387
<i> Christ, what?</i>

188
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,956
No, no, no, sorry,
no, that's what I meant.
Everything's fine.

189
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,424
<i> Jesus, you scared me!</i>

190
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,925
I mean, there was
an accident,
um, with the thingy

191
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,393
with Greg, you know?

192
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,496
<i> Well, that happens, Rosie!</i>
No, no, Alex.

193
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,098
Something that
I need to figure out
right now, Alex.

194
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,167
I need to get rid of it.

195
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,869
It got lost
and I can't find it
and I don't know what to do.

196
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,871
You're not making
any sense, Rosie!

197
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,272
Can we just talk
about this later?

198
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,441
<i> No, Alex, please!</i>

199
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,344
Okay, you need
to be really clear
and really precise!

200
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,445
Okay!

201
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,514
The condom came off
inside my vagina

202
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,283
and at present
I'm unable to locate it!

203
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,291
That's way more
information than I needed.

204
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,097
Hi. I'm Dick.

205
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,200
Of course, you are.

206
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,971
Okay.

207
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,079
Is it, um, front
bottom or back?

208
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,916
What do you think I am?

209
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,418
Sorry. I wasn't suggesting
you're a slag or anything.

210
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,496
Isn't there a female nurse?

211
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,933
I'm afraid
I'm all you've got.

212
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,467
Huh.

213
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,452
That was one of
the most embarrassing

214
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,687
moments of my entire
pathetic existence.

215
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,692
Oh.

216
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,127
Oh.

217
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,533
You know what?

218
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,136
Let's get out of here.

219
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,038
Dino's should
still be open.

220
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,476
I was thinking more Boston,
Massachusetts.

221
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,612
Oh, you think I should
flee the country?

222
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,448
I'm serious.

223
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,050
This place is a dead end,

224
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,285
we've been
saying it for years.

225
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:34,625
And, uh, my dad
wants me to try for
a scholarship at Harvard.

226
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,629
You are serious.

227
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,102
It's one of the best
medical schools
in the world.

228
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,307
And Boston College
happens to have

229
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,142
a really great
hotel management course.

230
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,381
That is what you
want to do, isn't it?

231
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,220
You can't!

232
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,390
I mean, who'll do
your washing?

233
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,492
You'll never eat!
It's ridiculous!

234
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,060
They have food
in America, Mom,

235
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,428
and I'm guessing
washing machines.

236
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,497
It's so far away!

237
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,232
I mean,
talk to her, Dennis!

238
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,303
It works for me. I mean,
this is as far as I got.

239
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,372
I know, but Mom's
just being Mom.

240
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,306
It would be so much fun,
and it would be...

241
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,244
<i> Did you ever</i>
<i> want more, Dad?</i>

242
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,349
Do you know
what your Gran's
favorite phrase was?

243
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,550
"Not for the likes of us."

244
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,653
When you told us
of your plan,

245
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,422
it was the first thing
that popped into my head.

246
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,357
I could hear her voice
in the room saying it.

247
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,528
I don't want that voice
in your head, ever.

248
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,531
Here, let me.

249
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,640
I want my own hotel one day.

250
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,674
Is it crazy
to think like that?

251
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,579
I've been winging it
with you for 18 years,

252
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,713
pretending I was
the one in charge.

253
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,350
You're amazing, Rosie.

254
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,585
There's nothing
you can't do,

255
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,520
if you put
your mind to it.

256
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,355
But if I go to Boston,
Mom will never
speak to me again.

257
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,358
Well, if you
don't go, I won't.

258
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,328
The choice is yours.

259
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,765
Dennis!

260
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,838
And do me a favor.

261
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,673
Come back and take
that prick's job.

262
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,781
Good evening!

263
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,347
"Dear Miss Dunne,
congratulations!

264
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,616
"We are pleased to
offer you a seat
at Boston University!"

265
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,351
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! No way!
Oh, my God!

266
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,802
Oh, hey, Clare,
is Alex in?

267
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,737
He's tied up.

268
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,772
I can come back.

269
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,874
He'll be down
in about three minutes?

270
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,178
Cup of tea?

271
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,893
Baby! Oh, baby!

272
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,461
Oh, yeah.

273
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,401
Yeah, baby, show me,
come on, baby!

274
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,936
Yeah, yeah...

275
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,504
Oh, my God, is...

276
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,540
Is that?
Bethany.

277
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,641
So, when you said
he was...

278
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,611
Tied up.
You actually meant...

279
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,413
Tied up.

280
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,816
Um, I should go.
Any second now.

281
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,255
Oh, Alex.
"Oh, Alex.

282
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,756
Where did you learn
"Where did you learn

283
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,625
to do that?
"to do that?"

284
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,865
I know. It's so gross.

285
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,345
Hello?

286
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,948
Fuck! I'm coming!

287
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,325
Are you supposed
to smoke in here?

288
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,528
My parents own the place.
They want me to help out?
I'll set the terms.

289
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,631
What's up?

290
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, right.
Um, I've been feeling
sick like, every day.

291
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,368
Maybe you could
just give me
a pill or something...

292
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,271
Any diarrhea?
No.

293
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,405
Fever?
No.

294
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,906
Stomach cramps?
No.

295
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,341
Well, have you
missed a period?

296
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,048
Yeah.

297
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,857
Uh, no.
Virgin?

298
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:33,858
No, but I took
the morning-after pill!

299
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,594
90% safe.
10% is the catch.

300
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,367
There's a loo here
if you want to use it.

301
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,507
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

302
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,353
Bollocks.

303
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,002
<i> I'd love to,</i>
<i> but Bethany's parents</i>

304
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,970
<i> are taking us out to</i>
<i> dinner at the Hazel.</i>

305
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,039
<i> How posh is that?</i>

306
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,194
Okay. I'm sorry.

307
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,430
Um, I... I...

308
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,165
I've got news.

309
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Me, too.
Read it.

310
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,746
Scholarship to Harvard!

311
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,151
Alex, that's so great.
Congratulations.

312
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,455
It's unbelievable, right?

313
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,222
Have you heard back
from Boston College, yet?

314
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,092
No.

315
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,863
Yeah, you'll get in.

316
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,465
Yeah, what about Bethany?
Have you told her?

317
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,100
She'll be fine.

318
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,237
She's got this...
Oh, God, she's got this
thing about my hair.

319
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,606
Yeah.
But she literally yanks it.

320
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,074
And she pulls
this funny face
during sex like this...

321
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,977
Enough. Enough...
I think she likes it.

322
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,581
Don't you care
what she's gonna think

323
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,015
about you rushing
off like this?

324
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:45,983
All right, what is it?

325
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,985
What?

326
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,087
Well, you're
defending Bethany.
What's wrong?

327
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,622
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

328
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,194
I thought you'd be
happier.

329
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,130
We're on our way
to Boston!
Come on! Hey?

330
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,532
It's great.
It's great, really.

331
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,168
Well done.

332
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,269
What, come on,
you're coming, too!

333
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,005
My flight's
in three days,

334
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,209
which gives me time
to get settled in
before term starts.

335
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,844
You need to go ahead
and book your ticket.

336
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,079
Sure.

337
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,016
I have got some
stuff to sort first,

338
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,986
but I'll be there.

339
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't get blown
up by terrorists.
Okay.

340
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,929
Or lose cabin pressure
and fall out of the sky.

341
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,764
Rosie, wait, wait, wait...
Or fly into a flock
of birds. I mean it!

342
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,566
I can delay,
if you need me to.

343
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,037
No. You're getting
on that plane.

344
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,774
I've got you something.
Close your eyes.

345
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,744
Close your eyes.

346
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,814
Give me your finger.
Okay. Keep it there.

347
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,791
North America.

348
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,278
Keep in touch, okay?

349
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,382
Okay.

350
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,953
See you in two weeks, so...

351
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,929
Boston.

352
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,000
This way?

353
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,662
<i> If I'd told him,</i>
<i> he'd never have left</i>

354
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,829
and his whole life
would have been ruined, too.

355
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,364
I mean, what's the point?

356
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,067
How noble.
I'd have forced  the bastard to stay.

357
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,935
Oh, no, no.
He's not the dad.

358
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,937
That's just
some other loser.

359
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,806
You are
turning out to be

360
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,075
a lot more interesting
than you look.

361
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:00,144
Why don't you just
get rid of the thing?

362
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:04,281
My parents are Catholic.
I don't believe
in all that, but I can't!

363
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,218
Oh, I had it all sussed!

364
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,721
Move to Boston,
study, get a great job,

365
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,023
at 27, come back
and open a hotel.

366
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,692
Then get married
and have kids.

367
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,293
Wow. A whole life
in bullet points.

368
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,861
Yeah, well now,
it's pregnant,

369
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,130
have sprog,
full-time mother,

370
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,867
wave goodbye to career,
live off benefits,
grow fat, lose hair.

371
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,170
Yeah. You might as well
just kill yourself now.

372
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,705
I can sort the drugs.

373
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,177
Look. There's loads of people
out there that want a kid
that can't have one.

374
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,712
Give it away.

375
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,349
I could still move
to Boston.

376
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,321
I can apply to college again,
or get a job. I don't care.

377
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,457
So it would
all be the same,
just six months later.

378
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,925
I don't even need
to tell Alex,

379
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,793
I could just
think of an excuse.

380
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,095
Whoa.
That's major denial, babe.

381
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,430
Yeah.

382
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,865
I just happen to think
it's the way to go.

383
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,411
Who's that?
Alex.

384
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,046
Have you
told him yet?

385
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,914
I'm sending him
my arrival time in Boston.

386
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,382
That's all
he needs to know.

387
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,818
Oh. All this fibbing
is gonna catch
up with you, girl.

388
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,021
Whoa!

389
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,890
The way that thing
burst out of her.

390
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,259
That might happen to you!
It might.

391
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,428
Her whole belly
will erupt.

392
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,964
Blood and guts.

393
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:30,134
And this freakish
alien will leap out
and bite your head off!

394
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,035
Stop it,
the pair of you!

395
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,971
Pregnancy
is a sacred thing!

396
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,939
It can't hear us.
Yes, it can!

397
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,441
And don't refer
to it as "it."

398
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,009
It's a girl
if you must know.

399
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:39,877
You found out?

400
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,781
I asked at the last scan.

401
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,349
I thought I should
tell the social worker
so he can start his plans.

402
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,119
A girl!
What about names?

403
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,956
No, um, I'll let
the new parents decide.

404
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,160
- Give us a peek.
- Hey!

405
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,996
A woman's body doesn't
become public property
just because she is pregnant.

406
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,130
Be my guest.

407
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,371
Look at that!

408
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,308
Oh, my God!

409
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,279
She's got hiccups!

410
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,513
Little thing's got hiccups!

411
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,349
Oh, bless!

412
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,020
Whatever.

413
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,900
Baby, can you hear me?

414
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,475
Try holding your
breath like this.

415
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,453
There you are,
Katie girl!

416
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,128
That's probably not
going to be
your name, okay?

417
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,372
It's coming!
Towels! Hot water!

418
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,441
- Where's the midwife?
- I don't know!

419
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,110
Come in now!

420
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,078
Come on!

421
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,981
Come on!
Midwife's here!

422
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,549
Let's go!
As quick as you like!

423
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,050
She's just right
down the hallway.

424
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,386
All right, okay,
breathe, breathe!

425
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,954
Get out!

426
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,425
Breathe, breathe,
everything is going
to be all right!

427
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,327
Being a girl sucks!
Yeah.

428
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,099
Oh.

429
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,034
Hello.

430
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,105
That'll be
the social worker.

431
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,477
Would you
like to hold her?

432
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,579
Or should I bring her
straight downstairs?

433
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,545
Katie.

434
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,116
Sweet little Katie.

435
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,281
I promise, Katie,

436
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,049
I'm going to be
a good Mommy.

437
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,400
Katie.

438
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,603
Katie. Shh...

439
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,582
It's gonna be okay.

440
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,354
Please. Katie,
it's gonna be okay!

441
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,355
Shh...

442
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,795
My life's over, Dad!

443
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,530
Wait 'til you become
a grandparent.

444
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,101
Katie, Katie. Shh.

445
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,504
Shh.

446
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,677
You know, I still
remember the drive back

447
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,347
from the hospital
when you were born.

448
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,450
You screamed blue murder,
the whole bloody journey.

449
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,521
I was so scared,
I jumped three red lights.

450
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,189
Lost my license.

451
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,057
You never
told me that before.

452
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,759
You weren't
part of the club.

453
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,635
Ugh.

454
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,806
<i> In battle</i>
<i> to preserve sanity,</i>

455
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,175
<i> must remember</i>
<i> following rules.</i>

456
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,544
<i> Number one,</i>
<i> never breast feed</i>
<i> in a public place.</i>

457
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:46,149
<i> Two, never bounce</i>
<i> Katie on knee</i>
<i> after feeding.</i>

458
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,618
Ugh.

459
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,121
<i> Three, try not to</i>
<i> cry when she cries.</i>

460
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,459
<i> And four,</i>
<i> the most important of all,</i>

461
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,427
<i> never assume trouble</i>
<i> isn't around the next corner.</i>

462
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,796
- Laters, girls.
- Bye.

463
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,220
Rosie?
Oh, no.

464
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,556
Tragic. Are you okay?

465
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,227
Tell me
that's not yours!

466
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,162
No!

467
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,133
What, you're a nanny now?

468
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:39,336
Yeah! You know,
at least it's good money.

469
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,837
Uh, I thought you were
going to Boston with Alex.

470
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,407
Oh, no, no, no,

471
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,409
I realized children
are the only
education you need.

472
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,612
So, who's the dad?

473
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,282
Ah!
Oh!

474
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,917
Get it off! Get it off!

475
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,287
I've got to go!

476
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,588
Bye, then!

477
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,608
Alex.

478
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,245
What are you doing here?

479
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,215
Just back for the weekend.
Thought I'd surprise you.

480
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,418
Great! Uh, yeah.
Let's go
for a coffee then.

481
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,453
Ah! No, no.
Let's stay here.

482
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:31,354
Why don't you
put the kettle on?

483
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,965
So, what
have you been up to?

484
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,867
Oh, just this
and that, you know?

485
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,202
Nice haircut by the way.

486
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,937
Yeah, thanks.

487
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,271
You okay?
You seem stressed.

488
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,506
No! No!

489
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,675
Uh, so, how's medicine?

490
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,910
Fascinating. Yeah.

491
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,480
We've just been doing
obstetrics, in fact.

492
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,848
Really?
Mm-hmm.

493
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,851
So much to learn.

494
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,486
How do you find
these breast pumps,
by the way?

495
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,688
Some women
don't like them.

496
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,755
Oh, total nightmare.

497
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,260
Oh, God.

498
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,295
How did you...

499
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,263
Bethany.

500
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,700
Fast work.

501
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,740
I was gonna tell you,
Alex, I promise.

502
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,945
I didn't want
to hold you back.

503
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,884
She's had
colic for months.

504
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,489
My whole life is feeding,
winding and nappies.

505
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,659
All I can think
about is poo.

506
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,729
How much, when,
what color.

507
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,331
I hope you mean hers.

508
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,406
What happened to Greg?

509
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,578
He miraculously
got a job in Ibiza
the minute he heard.

510
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,490
Can I be godfather?

511
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,729
I'd love nothing more.

512
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,346
I think not telling you

513
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,616
was a way to keep the dream
alive, you know?

514
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,621
So there was at least
someone out there

515
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,423
who still saw me as Rosie.

516
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,962
And not this strange,
new person I've become.

517
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:09,139
So, the last time
I looked that depressed,

518
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,141
I tried to hang myself
with my favorite tie.

519
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,880
Hi, I'm Phil.

520
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,550
Alex.

521
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,552
I've been sent to
play fairy godmother.

522
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,622
You don't look
the part, mate.

523
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,125
My sister's been
driving me crazy.

524
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,860
She wants to know,
would you buy her a drink?

525
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,464
Which one is she?

526
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,139
The hot girl from class?
Sally.

527
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,742
The bright sunflower
in the family window box.

528
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,548
Hey!
Hey!

529
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,217
Everybody has been
wondering why the cute
British guy looks so sad.

530
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,187
Sorry.

531
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,890
It's time to realize
you're here with us.

532
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,160
And that we might
be fun to be with.

533
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,801
Katie!
It's your first Christmas!

534
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,204
I hope you got my present!

535
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,839
<i> Thanks</i>
<i> for the book, Alex.</i>

536
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:16,973
<i> I know</i>
<i> she'll love it one day.</i>

537
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,508
What is it?

538
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,076
This is my new apartment.

539
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,179
What's this
you're doing here, darling?

540
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,815
Um, handmade hearts.

541
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,117
And here,
we have my favorite
<i> Back to the Future</i> poster.

542
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,720
It would look so special
in the bathroom.

543
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,588
Walk to Mommy.

544
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,824
Come to me. Good girl!

545
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,960
Katie, darling, it's your
fourth Christmas.

546
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,664
<i> Did, uh, Mommy</i>
<i> get my Christmas card?</i>

547
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,771
Really?

548
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:53,009
<i> She wants me to tell you</i>
<i> she can cycle</i>
<i> and count to five.</i>

549
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,678
...three, four, five!

550
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,818
<i> Me, I've got a job</i>
<i> and finally moved</i>
<i> out of Mom and Dad's.</i>

551
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,521
Miss Dunne!
Welcome back to the hotel!

552
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,523
I believe it's
the penthouse suite for you?

553
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,957
That's right, thanks.

554
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,038
Mommy, Mommy!

555
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,205
It's the first day
of school!

556
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,308
Um...

557
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,346
I heard some beds

558
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,582
were being stolen
recently.

559
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:06,883
Isn't that strange?

560
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,685
Yes, Mommy.

561
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,120
This way, no one can
come in and steal ours.

562
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,355
Mm-hmm.

563
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,658
Are you my daddy?

564
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,262
No! No, he's just
a nice man

565
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,196
that's helping Mommy
out a bit, that's all.

566
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:25,969
Damn!
What?

567
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,103
It's the wrong key!

568
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,849
Ow!
Oh!

569
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:40,917
My head!
Come on, whinger!

570
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,888
Over there!
Over there!

571
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,990
Come on, keep going.

572
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:47,857
Quick, quick, Mommy!

573
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,659
Excuse me.

574
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,728
Oh!

575
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,030
Love you.

576
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,665
Love you, too.

577
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,941
You dreamt you were
an inanimate object?

578
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:07,377
Yeah, I mean, come on.
An arrow flying
through the air!

579
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,345
That's pretty cool.

580
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:13,182
I don't understand.
How can you be a thing?

581
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,085
I don't know.
I've always had
dreams like that.

582
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,221
It sounds to me
like self-esteem issues,
sweetie.

583
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,356
You may need to
talk to someone.

584
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,828
You know,
there are razor hairs

585
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,930
in the bathroom,
again today.

586
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,232
Really?

587
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:32,001
You know
it gives me allergies.

588
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,203
Next time you have
one of your
weird dreams,

589
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,439
maybe you should dream

590
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,008
you're something useful
like a vacuum cleaner.

591
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,412
We have a cleaning lady.

592
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,147
What do you want?

593
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,082
For her to think
we're a pair of fuck-ups?

594
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,251
That's exactly
what we are.

595
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,457
Whoo!

596
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,735
You okay?
I've got sand
in my eyes.

597
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,805
Look at Mommy!

598
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,082
<i> I dreamt</i>
<i> I was an arrow.</i>

599
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,513
What have you told
the poor brat?

600
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:54,884
No! Just that
he sent me a ticket.
I've got no expectations.

601
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:57,186
Well, good, because
he's got a girlfriend.

602
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,054
Although you know
it's funny, her name

603
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,889
didn't come up once.

604
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,791
Yeah, well,
Katie's mature
enough to know

605
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,392
that when it comes to men,
it doesn't matter.

606
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,827
Yeah, well,
Katie also knows

607
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,129
that something
must have triggered

608
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,930
his sudden enthusiasm
to see her mom,

609
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,499
who, by the way,
knows him better
than anyone,

610
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,334
and is clearly
the best person to judge!

611
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,402
Oh, and, uh...

612
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,162
All right! All right!
Good to see you!

613
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,799
So, tired? Hungry?

614
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,935
No. Why?

615
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,352
Come on.

616
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,556
Do you want another?

617
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,125
Um, yeah.

618
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:10,459
All right.
I'll be back, okay?

619
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,500
So, you're new here.
I'm Jonathan!

620
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,136
Rosie!

621
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,505
Rosie?
So what do you do, Rosie?

622
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,241
I'm a mom!

623
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:29,245
Is that some kind of,
uh, performance thing?
You're a drama major?

624
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,615
I'm a mother
of a 5-year-old girl!

625
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,052
Cool! Cool!

626
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,454
Um...

627
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:42,225
Can I get you
a drink or something?

628
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,395
A gin and tonic.

629
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,433
Cell? Car keys?
Oh, dude. Come on.

630
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,901
Guys, guys, guys,
no, no, no!

631
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:55,037
Come on, come on!
Come on! Please!
It's gonna happen!

632
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,405
One, two, three!
Okay, okay!

633
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,540
Rosie, Rosie,
come on, come...

634
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,950
Can you give me a hand?

635
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,352
All right.

636
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,491
Come on. Come on!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

637
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,262
Oh.

638
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:20,630
You're looking way too
hot right now, Rosie.

639
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,505
Come on, all right, okay.
If you want it like that.

640
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,108
No, no, no!

641
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,214
- You stink.
- I stink?

642
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,383
You haven't bathed.

643
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,484
Bananas?

644
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,553
All right.
One, two...

645
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,990
Any good?
No, it's sort of...

646
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,029
Catch.

647
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,364
All right.

648
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,970
"You will live a long
and happy life." Sweet.

649
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:01,971
Oh, can I switch?

650
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,308
'Cause you prefer mine?
I prefer it.

651
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,244
I do, I do.
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

652
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,380
Well, you do go here,
so you probably

653
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,348
should know what
you're talking about.

654
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,190
<i> Strange to think</i>
<i> that I could have lived here</i>

655
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:22,458
<i> and been part of it.</i>

656
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,296
But I don't regret Katie,
you know?

657
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,132
I mean, how could I?

658
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,337
She's the most amazing kid.

659
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,011
The weird thing is

660
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,316
that she reminds me
more of you than Greg.

661
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,253
That's probably
just 'cause I love her.

662
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,038
We should go.

663
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,375
Yeah.

664
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,112
- Seriously cute.
- Aw.

665
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,314
It was a ball of fluff.

666
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,615
No seriously.

667
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,187
Sally.  Rosie.

668
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,589
Rosie, Sally.

669
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,557
Good morning.

670
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,159
Hi.

671
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,467
Wow. This should be
in a museum.

672
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,770
Oh, it's nothing.

673
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:43,172
Just quail egg
and asparagus

674
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,573
in filo pastry with
a cream of rocket sauce.

675
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,077
Well, my regular
is baked beans.

676
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:51,580
Good old
British baked bean.

677
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:52,815
Zero nutritional value.

678
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,451
Yeah. But good on toast.

679
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:58,788
Oh, you know
I can't drink.

680
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,289
Of course.

681
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,458
But how are we going
to cope without

682
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,459
the numbing haze
of alcohol?

683
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,596
Why can't you drink?

684
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,231
If that's not
a rude question?

685
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,402
Alex?

686
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,339
What?

687
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:29,752
Didn't... Didn't...

688
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,387
Alex and I are pregnant.

689
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,223
Twelve and a half weeks in.

690
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,695
That's wonderful.

691
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,132
Congratulations.

692
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:44,433
Congratulations.

693
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,870
Alex, you didn't tell me?

694
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,506
No, I...
Sorry, I thought I did.

695
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:51,674
That's...

696
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,375
Oh!

697
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,311
Let me help!

698
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:56,479
Shit!
Ah-ah-ah!

699
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:57,446
Daddy's antique table!
Alex, quick!

700
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,417
Oh, bollocks.
Language, please!

701
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:04,286
Oh, fuck!
No! Why can't you
just say fudge?

702
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:11,227
Oh, oh.

703
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,203
Look what you made me do.

704
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,710
It's fine. It's okay.

705
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:31,514
We have Herb's vernissage
in an hour... It's...

706
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,482
Everything
is gonna be fine.

707
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,268
I'm so sorry.

708
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,172
Sally had this
planned for weeks.

709
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,340
It's not for long, okay?
I promise.

710
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,243
Sweetie? Dr. Jones
is by the sweet
and sour prawn balls!

711
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,213
Look, he's just...
Sweetie, not now. Okay?

712
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:07,249
But he's a senior
thoracic surgeon, Alex.

713
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:08,951
She's right, Alex.
Go on.

714
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,487
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

715
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,227
This image here
is one of my favorites.

716
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,197
How to articulate
that transient moment

717
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,533
when you see something
through the camera's eye.

718
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,903
It's a little like
love at first sight.

719
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,573
Stops you in your tracks.

720
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:33,976
Suddenly you recognize it
for exactly what it is.

721
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:35,678
A load of bollocks.

722
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,586
Rosie! Rosie,
where are you going?

723
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,654
Back home.

724
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,456
And I mean England.
This is too crazy
for me, okay?

725
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,958
I walked straight
into the middle
of something here!

726
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,760
Look, it's all fine,
honestly.

727
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,796
Sally and I just needed
to air some stuff!

728
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,264
Oh, good, I'm glad
you're fine,
'cause I'm not!

729
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,867
We were out together
the whole night, Alex!

730
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,570
And all the while
your girlfriend was
at home expecting a baby!

731
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,672
And you didn't say!
Come on, Rosie.

732
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,640
Nothing happened,
we were just...

733
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:06,542
We were just
having some fun.

734
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:09,511
That's what you got me
over here for then?
Just some fun?

735
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,748
I wanted to see you!
For Christ sake,
you're my best friend!

736
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,385
Or maybe you needed
someone from your old life
to point out the truth!

737
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:22,324
What truth?
You're in a mess, Alex!

738
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,994
This whole situation
is one big bloody
giant mess!

739
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:26,362
Me? I'm in a mess?

740
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:27,563
And you're in denial!

741
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,265
You're projecting!

742
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,567
Okay, can we just stop
the psychobabble here

743
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,702
and just talk like
English people, please!

744
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:36,639
Fine! Fine! Fine. Fine. Look.

745
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:40,943
I was worried you
might find it hard,
you know, coming here.

746
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,978
Hard?
I mean, you've had
a tough time, Rosie,

747
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,582
and seeing where
we live, you know,

748
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,517
our apartment,
our lifestyle, it's just...

749
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,919
Okay! You thought
I was jealous of you?

750
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,655
No.

751
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:55,557
I pity you, Alex!

752
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,527
All I see is someone
compensating for
a crap personal life

753
00:54:58,529 --> 00:54:59,728
by schmoozing his way
up the career ladder!

754
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,031
Crap personal life?

755
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:05,501
All right, let's see.
Um, stable relationship
with beautiful girlfriend,

756
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:07,536
lots in common,
a great circle of friends,

757
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,438
a kid on the way,
who's gonna
have two parents,

758
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,939
by the way, not one!

759
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,849
Rosie, come on, I...

760
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:21,850
Forget it, Alex!

761
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,653
Go ahead and climb
your greasy pole!

762
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,022
You know, I will!

763
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,524
Just don't come
whinging to me

764
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,059
when you realize
you're empty inside.

765
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:31,760
No danger of that!
Good!

766
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,630
Excellent!
Fantastic!

767
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,504
Oh, no!

768
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,640
Pleased to see me?

769
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,109
What are you doing here?

770
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,444
You sent me
Katie's drawing!

771
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,179
I got on the first flight
I could!

772
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:33,215
No! No, no, no!
I did that on a whim, okay?

773
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,050
Katie drew the picture,
and it was a mistake!

774
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,618
I never expected you
to actually show up!

775
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,587
That letter really made me
think about my life!

776
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,155
I wanna meet her, Rosie!
I am her dad.

777
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,057
Dad?

778
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,860
And what precisely
is it that you think

779
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:45,828
qualifies you
for that title? Those?

780
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:51,500
when she woke up
with colic every night
for the first few months?

781
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:55,671
Or cut her first tooth,
or took her first steps?

782
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,172
Has anyone ever told you,
you have the most
amazing eyes?

783
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,082
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

784
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,185
I get it, I bailed on you.
I was a total creep.

785
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,020
But there hasn't
been a single day
in the last five years

786
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,889
that I haven't wondered
what she's like.

787
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,025
Is she like me?
Did she luck out
on the gene front?

788
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,227
You're so full of shit!

789
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,902
You have to give me
a chance, Rosie!

790
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,571
I can be different,
I promise.

791
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:30,973
Do you want me to crawl
on my hands and knees?

792
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:32,541
Anything, Rosie!
I'm begging you!

793
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:35,911
If this were about me,
I'd be driving you to
the airport right now!

794
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:37,513
You'd be right to.

795
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,683
One chance!

796
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,721
One chance,
but any mess-ups
and you're out.

797
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,256
And you be nice!

798
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:49,525
And I don't just mean
average nice, I mean

799
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,894
Father Christmas-Easter
Bunny-Tom Hanks
-all-rolled-into-one nice!

800
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:54,196
Yeah.
And you will buy her

801
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,598
the most expensive pair
of shitty pink shoes
that you can find!

802
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,135
I'm gonna Google them
right now.

803
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,109
Woo-hoo!

804
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,148
Hi-five!
Boo!

805
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,230
Whoo!

806
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,319
Wait a minute.
You did what?

807
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,089
Hey!

808
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,125
This is a man
who let you go to
casualty on your own

809
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,360
in the middle
of the night,

810
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,062
with a condom
stuck up your fanny!

811
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,698
He's Katie's dad.

812
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,900
You should see her
little face light up
when he walks in the room!

813
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,668
They're really bonding!

814
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,340
Of course, none of that
would matter
if he had a crap bod.

815
01:00:11,342 --> 01:00:13,141
He's really worked
on that thing. Wow.

816
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,677
You're evil, Rosie Dunne.

817
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,816
I just want to belong
to someone, Ruby.

818
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,351
I'm tired of waiting.

819
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,187
And it feels good with him.

820
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,923
We're a family.

821
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,690
Can you just stop
jumping up and down?

822
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,225
I'm just checking
everyone's here.

823
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,827
Everyone being who,
exactly?

824
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:06,862
How's the blushing bride?

825
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,730
Like a mad bunny.

826
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,298
Okay. Okay.

827
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,068
Oh.

828
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,805
Don't take this
the wrong way, love.

829
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:23,845
But if there's any part
of you that isn't sure,
even now, say the word.

830
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,380
We'll walk
straight out of here,
our heads held high.

831
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,749
So you like Greg, then?

832
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,253
Come on.
Let's get you hitched.

833
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,098
Do you like this?

834
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,233
Katie, would you please?

835
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,901
Mom!

836
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,004
Sorry.

837
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,558
<i> Hello?</i>
Sally...

838
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,160
Rosie.

839
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:20,896
What can I do for you?

840
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,931
Um, is Alex there?

841
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,066
Did he not tell you?

842
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,368
<i> Tell me what?</i>

843
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,903
Alex and I separated.

844
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,237
What? When?

845
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,273
<i> About eight weeks ago?</i>

846
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,175
Pretty much the day
of your wedding.

847
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,944
Oh!

848
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,414
Oh, God!

849
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,582
<i> What?</i>

850
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,118
<i> What?</i>

851
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,486
I think my water just broke!

852
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,254
Oh, God!

853
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,256
Wait, wait. Are you sure?
Maybe you just wet yourself.

854
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:50,392
No, I did not wet myself!
Where is Herb?

855
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:51,993
<i> Herb?</i>
Oh, God.

856
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,461
<i> Who, the artist?</i>
Herb!

857
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,431
It's happening! The baby!

858
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:01,436
It's coming! Herb!

859
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,984
Katie!

860
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,323
Mom! You're
supposed to knock!

861
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,225
The music! It's too loud!

862
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,993
Can't hear you!
The music's too loud!

863
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,964
Don't do that!
Yeah, this music
needs to be felt.

864
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,435
Is that lipstick
you're wearing?

865
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,304
Privacy, Mom!
Please!

866
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,373
Okay!

867
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,010
Now, have you
got the thermal
underwear I gave you?

868
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:51,246
It's the Mediterranean.

869
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:54,015
Um, what about cash?
I've got some
extra if you like.

870
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:55,984
Phone chargers?
Your wallet, Dad?

871
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:57,552
Rosie, it's fine.
Will you stop fussing
like a mother hen?

872
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,521
Yes.

873
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,089
Goodbye!
Love you.

874
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,157
Get in.
Love you.

875
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:03,124
Bye!
Bye!

876
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,026
Bye.

877
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,298
<i> So my parents</i>
<i> have sold up</i>
<i> and gone backpacking,</i>

878
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,169
<i> nagging a 12-year-old</i>
<i> about lipstick.</i>

879
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,637
I mean, seriously,
could you find
further proof

880
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,405
of how fucked up
my life is?

881
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,644
Bethany?

882
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,045
Rosie Dunne!

883
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,347
You work here now?

884
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,750
I just got promoted
to reception.
Ah.

885
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,653
Congratulations!

886
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,389
But you! Your success,
it's, uh... It's amazing!

887
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:36,358
I've just flown from Morocco,

888
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,692
tomorrow I fly out again,

889
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:40,095
New York, Boston,
Chicago, nightmare.

890
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,230
The heart bleeds.
Yeah.

891
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,332
Boston? You should
look up Alex.

892
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,067
Really?

893
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:48,770
Alex Stewart?
You guys still
keep in touch?

894
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:52,073
Of course. He could do
with a friendly face.

895
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,341
Great! I'll get his
details from you later!

896
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,544
Thanks. Oh.

897
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:58,413
Could I have some Evian
sent up to my room?

898
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,448
It's the only water
I can drink.

899
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,551
Three bottles.
And maid service
twice a day? Mmm.

900
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,053
Of course.

901
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,259
That's how
fucked-up your life is.

902
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,706
<i> Mom!</i>

903
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,108
How is Nice?
Have you found some
good places to eat?

904
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,282
Mom, are you all right?

905
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,685
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

906
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,654
<i> I'm...</i>

907
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,160
Mom, what is it?

908
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,730
<i> It's bad news for you.</i>

909
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,199
Mom?

910
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,169
Mom, what is it?

911
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,194
Hey.

912
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,231
Really?

913
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,533
Yeah.

914
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:09,511
When I heard,
the years fell away,
I was...

915
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,614
I was a fucked-up kid
all over again.

916
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,752
Hero worshipping
this amazing dad you had.

917
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,502
Sorry.

918
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,510
I never got to say goodbye.

919
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,213
Hey, come here.
Come here, you.

920
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:46,214
Hey. Shh.

921
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,891
Hey, hey!
Hands off my woman!

922
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,799
I've just been chatting
to your cousin.
She is such a bore.

923
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,804
Seriously? Are you pissed?

924
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,543
I find funerals
really difficult, Alex.

925
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,246
Ah, 'cause Rosie, I mean,
she's having a great time.

926
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,380
You know what?
Fuck you!

927
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,481
Please?

928
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,587
Thanks for turning up.
We both really
appreciate your support.

929
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,956
Let's go, come on.

930
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,570
<i> Rosie,</i>

931
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,610
<i> you deserve someone</i>
<i> who loves you with</i>
<i> every beat of his heart,</i>

932
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:50,778
<i> someone who'll always</i>
<i> be there for you,</i>

933
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,347
<i> and who'll love</i>
<i> every part of you...</i>

934
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,541
Mom! I'm not going
without my grey
skinny jeans!

935
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,010
All right!
I'll get them for you!

936
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,630
"Rosie, you deserve
someone who..."

937
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,365
Anything for me?

938
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,601
Uh, yeah, just this one.

939
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,443
In France, the day
before he died.

940
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:56,944
Oh, God, don't read that.
What?

941
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,013
Well, it'll upset you.

942
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,383
I'm already upset.

943
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,485
Right.

944
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,890
Do you want me to stay?

945
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,393
Funnily enough, no.

946
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,097
Okay. Well, call me
if you need anything, okay?

947
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,347
<i> Dear Rosie,</i>
<i> I can't believe it.</i>

948
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,952
<i> Here I am at last,</i>
<i> finally walking</i>
<i> the Mediterranean coast.</i>

949
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,725
<i> I've lost count of the years</i>
<i> I've waited for this moment.</i>

950
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:46,594
<i> Somehow life got in the way.</i>

951
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,496
<i> And it was all good,</i>
<i> I don't regret</i>
<i> a minute of it,</i>

952
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,599
<i> but we forget</i>
<i> our dreams at our peril.</i>

953
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,769
<i> I know you had yours, too,</i>

954
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:58,473
<i> and it must feel sometimes</i>
<i> like they're gone for good.</i>

955
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:01,042
<i> But I'm so proud</i>
<i> of the woman</i>
<i> you've become, Rosie,</i>

956
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,145
<i> of the mother</i>
<i> you've been to Katie.</i>

957
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,750
<i> What I once said</i>
<i> about you is still true,</i>

958
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:12,920
<i> there's nothing you can't do</i>
<i> if you put your mind to it.</i>

959
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,556
<i> So keep chasing</i>
<i> those dreams,</i>
<i> will you, darling?</i>

960
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,760
<i> For my sake, Dad.</i>

961
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,509
How can someone
just not be
there anymore?

962
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,847
Fuck knows.

963
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,789
At least he did
everything he wanted.

964
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,425
He didn't forget
his dreams.

965
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,665
What if I told you

966
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,101
I was gonna use my share

967
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,539
of the money
from the house

968
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,140
and get myself a hotel?

969
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,876
Somewhere simple but...

970
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,579
But my own place.

971
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,149
I think that
would be awesome, Mom.

972
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,194
<i> Rosie,</i>
<i> I understand that you</i>
<i> haven't been in touch.</i>

973
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,497
<i> And I just need</i>
<i> to know one thing.</i>

974
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,234
<i> Are you happy with him?</i>

975
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,542
<i> There's not much</i>
<i> I got right in my life,</i>
<i> but this family,</i>

976
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,579
<i> somehow we're making it work.</i>

977
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:46,881
<i> So I guess</i>
<i> the one word answer</i>
<i> to your question should be,</i>

978
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,083
<i> "Yes."</i>

979
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,560
Hey!
Hi.

980
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,863
So look at this.
The Sweetlands Hotel.

981
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,064
That's where
we had our end
of school dance!

982
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,032
Ah. They just
joined our group.

983
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:06,968
And I was just
checking for discounts,

984
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,769
and I found
this booking...

985
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,073
That's Greg's name!

986
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:15,009
The bridal suite,
for this weekend!
Mm-hmm.

987
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,612
He's already up
there on business.

988
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:20,014
Do you think...
For our anniversary?

989
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,518
Oh!

990
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,520
It's him.
Mmm.

991
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,291
Hey!

992
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:35,162
<i> Uh, listen, I'm gonna</i>
<i> have to stay here</i>
<i> a few extra nights,</i>

993
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:37,698
<i> the guys need me</i>
<i> to check out</i>
<i> some more venues.</i>

994
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,800
<i> Um, can you take Katie</i>
<i> and go to your mom's,</i>

995
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,636
<i> and then I can swing by</i>
<i> on Sunday and pick you up?</i>

996
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:44,572
<i> Babe?</i>

997
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,008
Fine.

998
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,176
<i> Cool, see you later, then.</i>

999
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,646
Talk later.
<i> Bye.</i>

1000
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,285
Check the booking.

1001
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,091
Here it is.
Bridal suite for two,

1002
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,893
checked in two hours ago...

1003
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,564
Oh, Rosie, I'm...

1004
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,819
Rosie! Rosie?
What are you going to say?

1005
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,363
Fuck!

1006
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,330
"Rosie,

1007
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,833
"you deserve someone
who loves you with
every beat of his heart.

1008
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,403
"Someone who will always
be there for you,

1009
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:58,706
"and who will love
every part of you,
especially your flaws.

1010
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:01,676
<i> "I know Katie needs her dad.</i>
<i> I don't want to intrude.</i>

1011
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:04,245
<i> "So if this is all wrong,</i>
<i> just ignore it</i>

1012
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,312
<i> "and I promise I'll never</i>
<i> broach the subject again.</i>

1013
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,050
<i> "Greg's not the man</i>
<i> for you, Rosie.</i>

1014
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,720
<i> "Twice I've let you</i>
<i> slip through my fingers.</i>

1015
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:15,189
<i> "Let's stop being afraid</i>
<i> and take the chance.</i>

1016
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,725
<i> "I know now I can</i>
<i> make you happy.</i>

1017
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:18,759
<i> "Call me if you</i>
<i> feel the same way.</i>

1018
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,062
<i> "Love, Alex."</i>

1019
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:07,875
Bethany?

1020
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:10,444
What are you doing there?

1021
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,079
<i> I live here now.</i>
<i> I moved in.</i>

1022
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,516
<i> Look who it is,</i>
<i> Mr. Schnuffs!</i>

1023
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:16,784
Mr. Schnuffs?

1024
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,519
<i> Rosie?</i>

1025
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,125
<i> Uh...</i>

1026
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,098
<i> Hey... Baby, that thing</i>
<i> we were talking</i>
<i> about earlier.</i>

1027
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,867
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Ask her now.</i>

1028
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,435
<i> Schnuffie...</i>

1029
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,138
<i> Um...</i>

1030
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,142
<i> Bethany and me,</i>

1031
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:44,478
<i> Uh, we thought,</i>
<i> why hang around, you know,</i>

1032
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,182
<i> um, so, she started</i>
<i> organizing the whole thing,</i>

1033
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:50,985
<i> but then Phil said no,</i>
<i> so your name came up,</i>
<i> obviously.</i>

1034
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,421
<i> We're getting married!</i>

1035
01:19:55,892 --> 01:20:00,394
<i> It's fast, but we need</i>
<i> to fit it in before</i>
<i> New York Fashion Week.</i>

1036
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:03,130
<i> And you have to</i>
<i> be our best man!</i>

1037
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,533
<i> I mean, you are</i>
<i> a girl but... Right?</i>

1038
01:20:05,535 --> 01:20:08,302
<i> This is all</i>
<i> because of you, Rosie.</i>
<i> You told me to come here.</i>

1039
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,404
<i> It wouldn't have happened</i>
<i> if it wasn't for you!</i>
<i> Thank you!</i>

1040
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,039
Hmm.

1041
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,078
It is so great
having you as a friend.

1042
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,380
I mean, every time
something goes
wrong in my life,

1043
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,881
all I got to do
is look at yours

1044
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,183
and it puts everything
into perspective.

1045
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,986
He proposed
to her on a boat.

1046
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:29,390
It's like Kate and Leonardo
in that scene on the deck.

1047
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:30,958
The <i> Titanic.</i>
Mm-hmm.

1048
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,460
How appropriate.

1049
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:35,930
Look, Alex is yours,
he always has been.

1050
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,598
This is just
proof of ownership.

1051
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,233
He wrote that months ago!

1052
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,037
And anyway
he's my best friend!
No!

1053
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,340
I'm your best friend!
Get it yet?

1054
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,076
We just keep
missing each other.

1055
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,280
Maybe we're just
not meant to be.

1056
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,516
Right.
Let me just try
and explain this

1057
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:56,951
in a language
you might understand.

1058
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,620
Ship. Iceberg.

1059
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,589
Ship hits iceberg.

1060
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:05,459
Mayhem, horror,
ocean of ice

1061
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:08,362
and then Alex
on the last lifeboat.

1062
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,964
One space left.
Is it Bethany?

1063
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,867
Or Rosie?

1064
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,870
Who's it going to be?

1065
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:21,642
What? You're
immigrating now?

1066
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,510
Less time, more outfits.
You're paying excess.

1067
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:28,916
I couldn't leave her
behind and wherever
Katie goes, Toby goes.

1068
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:31,185
Oh, are you two
an item now?

1069
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:32,620
No way. We're friends.
No way. We're friends.

1070
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:34,321
God give me strength.

1071
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:35,522
Well, come on,
we're really late.
Relax.

1072
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,192
I hate arriving early,

1073
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,927
and besides, we have
a five or six hour
cushion on the other side.

1074
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,037
Um, sorry,
what's going on?
Volcanic ash.

1075
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:51,338
I need to go to Boston!

1076
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,941
I'm afraid it's a five
to six hour delay.

1077
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:56,110
I think your
cushion just burst.

1078
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,188
Slow down!
I'm not wearing
a sports bra!

1079
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,291
Okay, you guys,
get your stuff!

1080
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:11,558
Katie move it!

1081
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,060
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1082
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:14,194
Ruby, come on!

1083
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:15,262
Mom!

1084
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,168
And you thought
the flight was rough.

1085
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:24,438
You'll have to get
dressed in the van!
We are so late!

1086
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:31,979
Excuse me?

1087
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,080
You get everything
the wrong way
round over here.

1088
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,682
And you are?
Ruby.

1089
01:22:34,684 --> 01:22:35,716
A pleasure
to meet you, Ruby.

1090
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:37,017
Likewise.

1091
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:38,152
Will you marry me?

1092
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:39,119
Yeah.

1093
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:42,990
What? That's not...
That's not fair!

1094
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,291
That's not...
It can't be that easy,
it's not...

1095
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,539
I think she wants
all the women
around her to look fat.

1096
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,174
Well, it works.

1097
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,124
No, no, you don't know
how hard it is.

1098
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,315
<i> Final word of warning.</i>

1099
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:44,385
<i> Alex can hold his drink</i>
<i> to an almost lethal degree,</i>

1100
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,387
as I discovered
on my 18th birthday,

1101
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:49,423
when he decided a night
of tequila slammers
was the way to go.

1102
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:51,725
Whoo!

1103
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,128
Well, you know
when people say that
they were so drunk,

1104
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,362
that the whole night
is a blank

1105
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,198
and you always go,
"No way, not possible."

1106
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,201
Well, believe me,
it's possible.

1107
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,148
Choosing a...

1108
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:18,252
Choosing the person
that you want to
share your life with

1109
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:24,525
is one of the most
important decisions
any of us makes,

1110
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,127
ever.

1111
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,798
Because when it's wrong,

1112
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,233
it turns your life
to grey.

1113
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,103
And sometimes...

1114
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,139
Sometimes
you don't even notice

1115
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,307
until you wake up
one morning

1116
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,843
and realize
years have gone by.

1117
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,580
We both know
about that one, Alex.

1118
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:54,088
Your friendship
has brought glorious
Technicolor to my life.

1119
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,458
It's been there even
in the darkest of times.

1120
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,128
And I am the luckiest
person alive for that gift.

1121
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,666
I hope I didn't take it
for granted.

1122
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:08,602
I think maybe I did.

1123
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:12,172
Because sometimes
you don't see

1124
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,341
that the best thing
that's ever happened to you

1125
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:16,610
is sitting there,
right under your nose.

1126
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,380
But that's fine, too.

1127
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:22,883
It really is.

1128
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,786
Because I've realized that

1129
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,756
no matter where you are

1130
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,194
or what you're doing,
or who you're with,

1131
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,232
I will always

1132
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,536
honestly, truly,

1133
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:46,306
completely love you.

1134
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,894
Like a sister
loves a brother

1135
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,164
and a friend loves a friend.

1136
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:15,269
I'll always stand guard
over your dreams, Alex.

1137
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,640
No matter how weird
or twisted they get.

1138
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:27,548
So, please, everybody,

1139
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,584
join me in a toast.

1140
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,953
To the bride and groom.

1141
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,856
To the bride and groom!

1142
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,502
Come on, show me
what you've got!

1143
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:49,736
No, please!
Well, okay then!

1144
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:51,271
Ready?

1145
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:52,906
Here we go.
You like it?

1146
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:34,514
Baby, baby, what's up?

1147
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:42,923
Katie?

1148
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,527
Katie just...
She just went through here!

1149
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:49,496
Katie?

1150
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:51,632
Mom?

1151
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,402
What are you
doing out here?

1152
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,340
Huh?

1153
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,909
Toby kissed me, Mom.

1154
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:03,944
Oh.

1155
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,014
Is that such a bad thing?

1156
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:08,849
Of course it is.

1157
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,654
Hey. Look, I...

1158
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:15,856
I was watching
you two tonight.
You're good together.

1159
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,725
You're a team.

1160
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:19,760
Don't you get it?

1161
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,963
It would be like you two
kissing or something.

1162
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,832
I'll just tell him
to forget the whole thing.

1163
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,003
Katie that...

1164
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:31,972
That would be
a big mistake.

1165
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,076
Look, if you
reject him now,

1166
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:38,879
he's gonna make it
his life's mission
to go out there

1167
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:40,981
and meet the most perfect,
beautiful girl in the world

1168
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,382
just to try
and get over you.

1169
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,888
And he'll end up
marrying this other woman

1170
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:50,957
and spending the rest
of his life with her.

1171
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:53,427
And you know,
he'll tell himself
that she's perfect and...

1172
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,632
He really must be happy,

1173
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,337
but she won't be you,
you know?

1174
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,640
But you two never
actually kissed?

1175
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:08,975
Did you?
Of course not.

1176
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,749
Katie?

1177
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:18,051
Toby!

1178
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:20,887
I'm really sorry.
Let's just pretend
it never happened...

1179
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:30,731
Alex?

1180
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:41,908
I only realized, uh,
tonight that you forgot.

1181
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:47,781
Your 18th birthday,

1182
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:50,951
about five tequila
slammers in, I think,

1183
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:56,723
<i> before you fell</i>
<i> off the stool...</i>

1184
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:03,864
So that's why you took
Bethany to the dance.

1185
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:11,171
And you went with Greg.

1186
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,447
Well, bye.

1187
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:21,948
Okay.

1188
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,141
Cheers!

1189
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,248
It's so nice.

1190
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:31,651
Your own hotel,
darling.

1191
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,053
Your father would be
so proud of you.

1192
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,871
Babe! Babe!
We've got a visitor!

1193
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:02,749
Do you have a room?

1194
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:05,886
Yes, of course.

1195
01:32:05,888 --> 01:32:07,654
A single,
for one night.

1196
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,993
Welcome!
You are our first guest.

1197
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,540
Have we met before?

1198
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,078
The condom came off
inside my vagina

1199
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,747
and at present
I'm unable to locate it!

1200
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,153
I don't think so.

1201
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:42,322
Ruby, would you please
see our guest
upstairs to his room?

1202
01:32:42,324 --> 01:32:43,924
Of course.

1203
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:44,791
And free champagne!

1204
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:47,227
All right,
follow me and then...

1205
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,299
Yeah, a brand new
bed, and...

1206
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:54,200
It's massive and you
get to see the sea.

1207
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:55,835
And it's...
It's really pretty.

1208
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:57,003
You'll love it.
You'll love it.

1209
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,001
Uh...

1210
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:29,235
Hi.

1211
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:31,771
Hi...

1212
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:36,643
Uh...

1213
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,251
Hey, guys!

1214
01:33:45,253 --> 01:33:46,886
- No, I want to see him!
- Come on, out. No, out.

1215
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:48,121
I said out!
Come on, out, out, out!

1216
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,356
No, but I...

1217
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:54,894
Um...

1218
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,330
So, I, uh...

1219
01:33:57,332 --> 01:33:58,932
I guess I need a room.

1220
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,301
Any baggage?

1221
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,304
No.

1222
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:06,840
I left it behind.

1223
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:09,342
So your wife...

1224
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:12,045
Won't be joining me.

1225
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,183
We both knew
it wasn't right.

1226
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,023
Sea view or garden view?

1227
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:25,258
I...
recommend the sea.

1228
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:30,130
Um, sea it is.

1229
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:35,201
One room with sea view.

1230
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:39,305
Um, Ruby would you mind
showing our guest upstairs

1231
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,445
Sorry, chief,
but I'm really busy
doing the files right now.

1232
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,418
Um, please, follow me.

1233
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:02,028
So, I had this weird dream
on the plane over...

1234
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,030
Let me guess,
you were a clip
on the seatbelts?

1235
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:05,298
No, I know,

1236
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,901
you were, um, a valve
in those annoying fans

1237
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:09,202
that blow cold air on you?
I can never turn
those things off.

1238
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,009
No.

1239
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,213
No, uh...

1240
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:25,218
I was me.

1241
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,289
And you were you,

1242
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:34,127
standing where
you are right now, perfect.

1243
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:42,435
And I took you in my arms,
in a manly kind of way.

1244
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:45,305
Like this.

1245
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,907
And said,

1246
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:54,948
"Rosie Dunne,
can I take you
to the dance?"

1247
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:00,987
Better late than never.
