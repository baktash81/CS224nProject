1
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,310
<i>I had dropped out of
law school when I met Eve.</i>

2
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,563
<i>She was very beautiful.</i>

3
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>Very pale and cool in her black dress,</i>

4
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,362
<i>with never anything more
than a single strand of pearls.</i>

5
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>And distant. Always poised and distant.</i>

6
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,414
<i>By the time the girls were born,
it was all so perfect, so ordered.</i>

7
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,460
<i>Looking back, of course, it was rigid.</i>

8
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>The truth is</i>

9
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,717
<i>she'd created a world
around us that we existed in,</i>

10
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,554
<i>where everything had its place, where
there was always a kind of harmony.</i>

11
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>Great dignity.</i>

12
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>I will say... it was like an ice palace.</i>

13
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,403
<i>Then suddenly one day, out of nowhere,</i>

14
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>an enormous abyss
opened up beneath our feet</i>

15
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,371
<i>and I was staring into
a face I didn't recognise.'</i>

16
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:33,213
"The basic popularity and appeal of Mao
for so-called American Marxists."

17
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,383
This is supposed to go in the sequence -

18
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,345
in under the sequence
in reel two about South Africa.

19
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,224
Um... what we wanna
do is get two examples.

20
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,686
But the idea is
his style was Marxist-Leninist -

21
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,271
Mao's style was Marxist-Leninist -

22
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:54,151
but that he was accessible to the lower
classes because of his use of homilies.

23
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,527
An example would be:

24
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:00,240
"The hardest thing is to act properly
throughout one's whole life."

25
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,326
What the hell does that mean?
Or, even worse...

26
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,428
Eve, I wasn't expecting you.

27
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:26,099
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, I just couldn't imagine who it was.

28
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,102
- Is Joey here? Where's Joey?
- Joey's in the shower.

29
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,981
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, just some coffee, if you don't mind.

30
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,525
No, it's no trouble at all.

31
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,362
I think I've found a very
nice vase for the foyer.

32
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,655
Uh-huh.

33
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:47,704
You'll probably think it's an extravagance,
but it's not, all things considered.

34
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,167
These pieces are
becoming increasingly rare.

35
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,254
Isn't that exquisite?

36
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,176
I hope you like it, because it's perfect
for what I have in mind for the foyer.

37
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,262
We already have a vase
in the foyer, Eve.

38
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,016
Yes, but this will never look right
when we redo the floors.

39
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,685
I've never understood
why the floors have to be redone.

40
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,106
What? We discussed all that, Michael.
Don't you remember? You agreed.

41
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,484
You know, it costs money

42
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,737
to have these things done and redone
two and three times over.

43
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,282
But the... It's such a large floor space.

44
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,078
That's why we agreed to the paler tones
to make a more subtle statement.

45
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,579
Pale woods would be lovely.

46
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,082
I never agreed about anything,
I'm always being told.

47
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,585
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it, Eve?

48
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,171
First the living room was finished,
then it wasn't.

49
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:42,050
Then the bedroom needed more work.
Now the floors have to be stripped again.

50
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,762
- You picked the sofa, then you hated it.
- It was a lovely piece.

51
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,808
It just was the wrong scale.
This is not an exact science.

52
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,062
Sometimes you just have to see it,
then you get the feel of it.

53
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,234
- You didn't like that in the bedroom?
- I knew you were gonna say something.

54
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,819
I get better use out of it here.

55
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,322
Well, if you utilised it in here,
that's fine. It's meant to be used.

56
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,284
It's just that it was part of what
we were trying to do in the bedroom.

57
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,453
It's the shade and the bedspread,
they set each other off so nicely.

58
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,706
I thought...

59
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,668
- How much is the vase?
- They're asking $400.

60
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,505
- Give me a break, Eve.
- All right, Michael. I'll return it.

61
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:29,264
Would you mind closing the window?
The street noises are just unnerving.

62
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,433
I hope you two aren't
having another argument.

63
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,809
Not at all.

64
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,645
Oh, I love that suit. Unique colour.

65
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,731
Renata calls it "ice grey".

66
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,443
It makes you look very beautiful.
Isn't she beautiful, Michael?

67
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,737
- Very lovely.
- I don't feel lovely.

68
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,073
I'm exhausted. I've been running
up and down Second Avenue all day.

69
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,161
Oh, wow. Is this for us?
It's exquisite.

70
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,831
- No, I was just showing it to Michael.
- It's too expensive, Joey.

71
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,792
Really? Well, that's too bad.

72
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,213
- Eve, let's keep it.
- No, no.

73
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,634
Yeah, let's keep it. It's very beautiful.
We'll work something out.

74
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,430
No, I was just carried away by it.
I don't know why.

75
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,060
Guess it's because it's so unique.
But it is an extravagance.

76
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,022
I'll just look for something along
the same lines at a better price.

77
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,983
But I have to point out one thing.
This really belongs in the bedroom

78
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,612
because it's too insignificant
a piece for in here.

79
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,115
The shade is just wrong
against all these slick surfaces.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,034
- I'll put it back.
- No, I'll do it.

81
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,119
I just want to try it in a different spot.

82
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:38,708
I can fix something for you,
something more inexpensive.

83
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,004
I've seen some nice pewters.
Um, maybe gunmetal.

84
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,591
And I can make the shade
in a smoother fabric, if you prefer.

85
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,762
But we should stick with
my beiges and my earth tones.

86
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,098
- "My beiges and my earth tones".
- Stop picking on her.

87
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,767
- Nobody's picking on her.
- She's a sick woman.

88
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,650
- That's great.
- Yes, it's nice.

89
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,529
So how do you feel?

90
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,699
I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

91
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,410
- Coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

92
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,045
Oh, I tell you, so many jobs.
It's just exhausting.

93
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,842
Yeah, I know. I can't get over how
you sort of jump right in and do it.

94
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,929
Well, I like it. I like to be busy.

95
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,309
And I think by now
I can say that my comeback

96
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,520
Is over the shaky period.
Wouldn't you say?

97
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,649
I think so, I think your work is better,
in fact, than it's ever been.

98
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,068
- Do you?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,865
Well, I have to admit that I have received
some rather special compliments lately.

100
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,075
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,289
Yes. Well, my spirits are high.
I'm feeling good about myself.

102
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,502
Not to say that I don't run
into an occasional setback,

103
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,423
but I haven't really felt
so confident in a long time.

104
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,009
I can see it. I mean,
you look better than you have in ages.

105
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:16,639
- Oh. Have you talked to Dad lately?
- No. He's still in Greece.

106
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,435
When he comes back, I hope you'll
corroborate the state of my wellbeing.

107
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,437
Of course.

108
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,900
I've certainly pulled myself together
in a way that he never thought possible.

109
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,237
- I mean, you're really impressive.
- Oh...

110
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,784
Well, maybe a reconciliation
could finally be discussed.

111
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,744
Think so?

112
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,039
Well, it hasn't been that much time.

113
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,292
I really don't... I don't know.

114
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,592
Why are you always
so negative about it?

115
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,219
I don't think that was negative.

116
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,306
Oh, you're always reluctant to
encourage me. I don't know why.

117
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,600
Mother, I know that you're optimistic,

118
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,061
but it's really important
for you to be realistic, too.

119
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,188
Is there something you know
that you're not saying?

120
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,067
- No.
- Dr Lobel doesn't think it's unrealistic

121
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,820
to hope that your father and I
might reconcile.

122
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,154
It's just a goal. That's all.

123
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,699
Fine, I didn't say anything
to get in the way of that.

124
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,746
You always make it sound
as though it's impossible.

125
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:26,709
- Mother, I didn't say it was impossible.
- Yes, you did. You imply that a lot.

126
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,089
Renata thinks it's going to happen.

127
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,050
- I'm sure she didn't say that.
- She did. She implied that.

128
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,010
- Well, maybe you read into it.
- No, I didn't.

129
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,221
She's just a person
who looks on the bright side.

130
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,682
Oh, great. I think that's wonderful.

131
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,934
I just don't think
you should delude yourself either.

132
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,770
You don't think there's any chance
your father will ever live with me again?

133
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,606
- I didn't say that.
- Renata thinks there's a good chance.

134
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,899
Just wait and see.

135
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,901
You just refuse to encourage me,
don't you?

136
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,446
- Why don't you discuss it with Renata?
- I will, thank you. I will.

137
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,524
Mother paced all the time.

138
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,193
She...

139
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,368
Um...

140
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,997
She was an insomniac.

141
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:50,335
You could always hear her upstairs,

142
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,006
pacing in the middle of the night.

143
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,719
But that was more when she...
got back from the hospital.

144
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,102
I, uh...

145
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,730
I saw her...

146
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,194
the first day that they
brought her back. Um...

147
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,905
She'd had all this...

148
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,577
electric shock therapy
and... her hair looked grey

149
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,373
and I couldn't believe it.
It was... It was like...

150
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,752
she was a stranger.

151
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,258
<i>After that,
she was always sort of, um...</i>

152
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>coming in and... going out.</i>

153
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,764
<i>I guess you...</i>

154
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,850
<i>you never knew.</i>

155
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,689
<i>Before her breakdown,
she was a very successful woman.</i>

156
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,108
<i>She was very demanding.</i>

157
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,443
<i>She, uh...</i>

158
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,072
<i>she put Dad through law school
and she financed the start of his practice.</i>

159
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>So in a sense,
it was like he was her creation.'</i>

160
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,040
We kept getting shuffled
around to aunts and cousins

161
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,377
and I guess
Joey had the worst of it, 'cause...

162
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,092
As a kid, Joey was very high-strung.
She was a bright kid, you know? She...

163
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,261
She was very sensitive.

164
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:28,099
<i>We'd spend some time with Dad,
mostly long Sunday breakfasts.</i>

165
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,185
<i>I always resented
his relationship to her, you know.</i>

166
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,563
<i>I always felt that he favoured Joey.'</i>

167
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,442
It just seemed that they were
very close and that I was left out.

168
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,528
I like Frederick.

169
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,782
He has dignity and promise as a writer.

170
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,745
My own strength is visual.

171
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,415
Your images are visual, Renata.

172
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,793
And in all candour,

173
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,505
- I much prefer Frederick to Mike.
- Mike's fine, Mother.

174
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,217
Well, he uses a very strong aftershave.

175
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,138
- It permeates the house.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

176
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,100
Do you think that if I bought him
another kind of cologne he would switch?

177
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,980
- Can we talk about something else?
- Well, let me give him some.

178
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,108
Then we won't have to talk about it.
It'll just be my gift.

179
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
Could we please talk
about something else?

180
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,864
Look, I wanna say something,
I'm gonna be very direct.

181
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
I think the occasion calls for it.

182
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,665
I've done a lot of
thinking about this matter

183
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,876
and a great deal of soul-searching.

184
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,548
Now that the girls are all on their own,
I feel that for my own self,

185
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,887
I must come to this decision,
though I don't take it lightly.

186
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:55,061
I feel I've been a dedicated husband
and a responsible father,

187
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:59,065
and I haven't regretted anything
I've been called upon to do.

188
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,570
Now I feel I want to be
by myself for a while.

189
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,327
And consequently,
I've decided to move out of the house.

190
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:16,040
I don't know how I'll feel about it when
I finally do it, and it's not irrevocable,

191
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,710
but I feel it's something I have to try.

192
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,759
Now, as I say,
it's not an irrevocable situation.

193
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,136
It's a separation.

194
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,807
It may be for the best. It may not.

195
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,270
But I wanted to lay it on the table,
in front of everyone,

196
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,524
so that everything is open
and as direct as possible.

197
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,496
Will you please not breathe in so hard?

198
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,881
- I'll move out.
- What does that mean?

199
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,510
- I don't want to live in this house anymore.
- Eve, think about it.

200
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,139
- I'll move out!
- Look, it's not irrevocable.

201
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,558
It's a trial separation.

202
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,479
I can't be alone.

203
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,066
- Eve...
- I don't wanna discuss the details now.

204
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,531
It's a very bad time for me.

205
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,209
My impotence set in a year ago.

206
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,963
My paralysis.

207
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,469
I suddenly found I couldn't bring
myself to write any more.

208
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:56,390
Rather, I mean, I shouldn't say suddenly.
Actually, it started happening last winter.

209
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,275
Increasing thoughts about death
just seemed to come over me.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,528
Um, these, uh...

211
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,826
A preoccupation with my own mortality.

212
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,500
These... feelings of futility
in relation to my work.

213
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,170
I mean, just what am I
striving to create anyway?

214
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,757
I mean, to what end?
For what purpose, what goal?

215
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,637
I mean...

216
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,017
Do I really care if a handful of my poems
are read after I'm gone forever?

217
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,145
Is that supposed to be
some sort of compensation?

218
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,484
I used to think it was, but...

219
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,698
now, for some reason...

220
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,538
I can't. I can't seem to...

221
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,796
I can't seem to shake
the real implication of dying.

222
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,509
It's terrifying.

223
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,810
The intimacy of it embarrasses me.

224
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,819
What's the matter?
You still thinking about your mother?

225
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,491
I can't believe Renata encourages her.
She fills her full of false hope.

226
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,827
She's just trying to keep her spirits up.

227
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,751
I wanna quit my job.

228
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,630
Oh, Joey!

229
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,799
I can't keep my mind on it.
I can't concentrate.

230
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,510
I sit there all day,
reading other people's manuscripts,

231
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,596
and half-way through I lose interest.

232
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,431
I get headaches from the words.

233
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,683
Then I'm supposed to sit down
and write an opinion.

234
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,310
It's not fair to the authors.

235
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,563
A month ago you said you finally
found something you enjoyed.

236
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,065
Well, I was wrong.

237
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,486
I think about going back to acting.

238
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,947
I'm not an actress.

239
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,160
Can't do that again.
Flyn's the actress in this family.

240
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,245
Why don't you work with me?

241
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,125
Because political activity
IS not my interest.

242
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,045
I'm too self-centred for that.

243
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,882
That's my whole point.
It would get you off yourself.

244
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,551
Sometimes I think if we had a child...

245
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,013
Oh, God.

246
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:46,060
I mean, that really makes me anxious.
I mean... it's totally irrevocable.

247
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,022
Whatever happened to your photography?

248
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,733
You have so much potential.
You used to be so hot on that.

249
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,319
I hate it. It's stupid.

250
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,698
I feel a real need to express something

251
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,785
but I don't know what it is I want
to express or how to express it.

252
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,335
It's always so difficult getting Mother
a birthday present. It's impossible.

253
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,587
Please, let's not stay forever at the party.

254
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,215
I really wanna get home
and finish proofreading those galleys.

255
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,261
Oh, come on, Frederick, really?
I really... I hardly ever see Mother.

256
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,680
I hardly ever spend any time
with her at all.

257
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,224
Besides, it's not going to be so terrible.
Flyn will be there.

258
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,644
Terrific. We get caught up on
the latest Hollywood gossip.

259
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,523
Oh, come on, Frederick.
You know Flyn likes you.

260
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,066
And don't behave condescendingly,

261
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,485
because I think she sort of senses
you talk down to her.

262
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,905
No, I don't talk down to Flyn. I love
hearing about her hair and her weight

263
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,950
and the latest piece
of TV junk she's done.

264
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,995
Well, that's her life.

265
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,582
And anyway, you have to admit
she is a sexy little girl.

266
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,334
No, Flyn is the opposite of sexy.

267
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,628
Hey, what about a scarf?

268
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,840
Flyn suffers from the same thing
my last book suffered from.

269
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:03,429
She's a perfect example of form
without any content.

270
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,600
That's very profound.
And you haven't even started drinking yet.

271
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,519
I am profound.
But I'm not the award-winning writer.

272
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,938
You're supposed to be
giving me insights into sex

273
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,940
and other world-shattering phenomena.

274
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,653
- Really?
- Really. C'mon, let's go, Frederick.

275
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,200
You look fabulous, Mother.

276
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,328
But the main thing
is that you're feeling well.

277
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,663
Yes, but I tire so easily.

278
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,415
Can I help you with something?

279
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,542
Joey tells me
that you're thinking about

280
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,753
taking on some decorating
projects again, Mother.

281
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:40,424
Yes, Joey pushes me.
But I'm not going to accept anything

282
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,303
until I'm sure I can maintain
the level that I expect of myself.

283
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,767
Mother, I can't believe this view.
It's just beautiful.

284
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,394
I'm getting used to it.

285
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,022
- I miss the sea.
- Yeah.

286
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,567
I can't get over how sexy Flyn got.

287
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,529
Yeah. She looks beautiful, doesn't she?

288
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,324
- Your new film is in Arizona?
- No. It's in Denver.

289
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,702
I leave tomorrow morning.
I have to be ready to shoot on Monday.

290
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,414
I have so many lines to learn.
But it's just a television movie.

291
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,291
Did you speak to Dad?

292
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,086
Yeah, I've spoken to him
on the phone once.

293
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,757
- Did he mention anything?
- He said he visits you.

294
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,262
Just now and then.

295
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,018
Mum?

296
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,980
Nothing to live for any more.

297
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,941
- Mum, don't say that.
- It's true.

298
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,403
You know that's not true.
Mother, look... It's all right, Mum.

299
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,947
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. She's fine.

300
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,157
C'mon Mum.
Mum, it's a trial separation.

301
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,785
Of course it is, Mother.
I mean, we've been through this before.

302
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,037
It just takes time.
Everything'll work out.

303
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
Renata.

304
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,003
It's her birthday, let her enjoy it.

305
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,672
No, I don't think
that's exactly the right way.

306
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,843
- Ah!
- Do you like it?

307
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,178
Oh, now, that's lovely. That's lovely.

308
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,973
- That's pretty.
- It's exactly like yours.

309
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,809
Very nice. Thanks.

310
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,936
- Lovely.
- I'm so glad.

311
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,899
I hope it fits, I think...
I'm pretty positive it will.

312
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,611
Frederick has finished what I've
already told him is his best work by far.

313
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,946
That's what you said
about the last one.

314
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,908
No, but I really feel
that this one comes off.

315
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,870
- I mean, it's terribly concise.
- You said the same thing.

316
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,956
- Concise. Spare, you said.
- Well...

317
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,459
You couldn't think of anything
you really liked about it,

318
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,546
so you had to call it something.
Concise. Spare. Pithy. Lean.

319
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,925
OK. OK. Well, you just can't
handle a compliment, that's all.

320
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,968
Guess I can't.

321
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,346
- We gotta go.
- Oh, really?

322
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,431
We hardly had any chance to speak.

323
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,183
I know.

324
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,145
So how are you doing?
You seem... You look OK.

325
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,314
I'm good.

326
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,817
I read something of yours
in a magazine. "New Yorker", I think.

327
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,528
Poem called "Wondering".

328
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,449
- Was very beautiful.
- It's an old poem.

329
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:15,037
I redid it. And now when I reread it,
I find it much too ambiguous.

330
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,790
Nah, I may redo it again.

331
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,962
We're starting our drive back.
Can we drop you some place?

332
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,215
I have to catch a plane
really early tomorrow morning.

333
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,886
Oh, right. I heard you're shooting a movie
in the cold Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

334
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:35,641
Couldn't be some place like Acapulco.
That's my idea of fantasy.

335
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:40,062
Lie around on the beach.
Get waited on hand and foot.

336
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,982
Really? I can't take Mexico.

337
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,859
I always think I'm gonna get shot
just walking down the street.

338
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,529
What was that?

339
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,243
"Happy birthday. Love, Arthur."

340
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,412
They're beautiful.

341
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,749
I like white roses better than
any other flower on earth.

342
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,335
There you are, Mother.
I knew he wouldn't forget.

343
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,879
Mum. And you were worried?

344
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,757
They're a good sign. Don't you think?

345
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,976
Well? Are you getting dressed or what?

346
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,982
Frederick, are you talking to me?

347
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,358
We said everything.

348
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't blame me.
I've been nothing but understanding.

349
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,158
- You don't help by patronising me.
- I wasn't patronising you.

350
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,411
Your work is great.
Who cares what the critics think?

351
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,415
That's easy for you to say.
You get nothing but encouragement.

352
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,042
You're just their little darling.

353
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,420
They're lenient with me,
obviously, because I'm a woman.

354
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,630
No.

355
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,592
- It's because you're so damn good.
- So are you.

356
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,303
All right. I mean, the book didn't get
the response it deserved.

357
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,139
I hate to tell you how often
they've missed the boat.

358
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,726
Stop lying to me. I count on you
for honesty, not flattery.

359
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
And who cares what anybody thinks?

360
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,814
They think what I think.

361
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,318
My work once showed promise
and I haven't delivered, as simple as that.

362
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,570
Your work's not fashionable, Frederick.

363
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,614
You should be thankful for that,
for God's sakes.

364
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,492
I mean, what are you after?
The superficial acclaim

365
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,578
of some little book reviewer
in some room somewhere?

366
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,916
We've always talked about fine work
that means something in the long run.

367
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,460
I don't care about fine work!

368
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,879
I don't wanna wait 25 years
to be appreciated.

369
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
I wanna be able to
knock somebody over now!

370
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,217
They're stricter with you
because you attempt more.

371
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,220
Don't you understand that?
They refuse to take that into consideration.

372
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,181
Stop looking for excuses, all right?
I'm not writing for a time capsule.

373
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,349
They won't give me an inch.

374
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:44,394
And half the stuff that's written,
it's garbage, they praise sky-high.

375
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,953
The baby-sitter will be here in a minute.

376
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,371
I told you, I'm not going.

377
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,582
We can't not go.
What is the matter with you?

378
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,043
I'm not in the mood
for your lesbian friends

379
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,088
and a lot of vacuous gossip
about New York poetesses.

380
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,174
You stop pitying yourself so much?
It's nauseating. I'm going.

381
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,720
Look, why can't you just once in a while
consider my feelings and my needs?

382
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,933
I'm sick of your needs! I'm tired of
your idiosyncrasy and competitiveness.

383
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,768
I have my own problems!

384
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,898
Then we have a superficial chitchat
about the nature of poetry,

385
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,026
your symbolism, your imagery,
your contribution to whatever.

386
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,989
We never see Marion and Gail.
I don't understand. You used to like them.

387
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:41,869
I can't stand them. They're so enthusiastic.
College kids. I get embarrassed.

388
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,329
Oh, well, don't get embarrassed.
Don't come.

389
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,373
Stay home
and drink yourself unconscious.

390
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,501
That's one of the clichés of being
a novelist you have no problem with.

391
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,670
Yeah, I sure can drink.

392
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,256
Yes, you're fine as long as
I keep everything going.

393
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,883
What you mean, keep everything going?

394
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,594
You're talking about that cheque
that arrives from Daddy every month

395
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,637
so that you can write yourself
into immortality?

396
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,349
I also raise the family that you wanted.
Or the family you thought you wanted.

397
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,686
Hey, you made some noises
about experiencing motherhood.

398
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,439
I'm sure you thought
it was great potential raw material.

399
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,774
Well, now you got another human being.
Three of us.

400
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,737
It wasn't my idea, and I'm not
ashamed to be subsidised either.

401
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,906
I turn things out.

402
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,453
Yeah, you do.

403
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,332
You turn things out. You're incredible.

404
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,634
Frederick...

405
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,221
Frederick, you have so much to offer.

406
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,307
I wanna help, not hurt.

407
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,272
I can't go out. I'm not in the mood.
I'm liable to kill somebody.

408
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,321
I'm going. Bye.

409
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,205
You look as good
as I've seen you in a long time.

410
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,336
And in no time at all you've turned
this place into a lovely home.

411
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,297
I saw Joey last week.

412
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,175
I may be working on her apartment.

413
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,930
Mike seems amenable.
He isn't really what I had in mind for Joey.

414
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,807
But I'm getting more used to him.

415
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,852
She has no direction.

416
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,606
I expected such great things from her.

417
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,193
She was an extraordinary child.

418
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,323
And how are you getting along, Arthur?

419
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,660
Fine. I'm fine.

420
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,664
Busy. It's important to keep busy.

421
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,877
Did you like the Matisse drawing?
It was on sale at Parke-Bernet.

422
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,672
Oh, yes. It's lovely.

423
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,424
So delicate.

424
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,055
Well...

425
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,101
We'll talk, Eve.

426
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,896
Good night.

427
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,250
She's got to go back to the sanatorium,
for a while at least.

428
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh, poor Joey. Poor Joey.

429
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:49,092
She spent so much time with her,
and... I don't know. What's the point?

430
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,594
We can't watch her constantly.

431
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,054
There's no way
you can be with her all the time.

432
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,727
How is Joey?

433
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:02,147
I worry about her.
She seems to be floundering.

434
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,442
I don't know.
I guess she hasn't found herself yet.

435
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,737
Couldn't you help her?
She looks up to you.

436
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:13,158
I do, Dad. I try. I try to be supportive.
I try to encourage her.

437
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,993
I'm not criticising,

438
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:20,123
but it just seems to me there's always
been an antagonism between you two.

439
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,667
Well, you know Joey.
She tends to be competitive with me.

440
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,797
Well, you're very successful.
I think you kind of hold that over her.

441
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:32,219
- Come on, Dad, That's not true.
- No, Renata. I'm not blind.

442
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,598
I see what's going on.
You seclude yourself in Connecticut,

443
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,726
acting out the part of the aloof artist,
and no one can get near you.

444
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,645
I don't wanna discuss this
right now, Dad. OK?

445
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,482
Can we just avoid the subject.
I'm upset. You're upset.

446
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,987
Joey had such potential.
And now it's come to nothing.

447
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,240
It's so typical. It's so typical.

448
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,409
As usual, you're obsessed with Joey
while Mother is lying in a hospital room.

449
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:00,205
Now, don't blame me for that.
That's nobody's fault.

450
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,129
- How's Frederick?
- Oh, fine.

451
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,508
- He's going to be teaching at Barnard.
- Oh, how nice.

452
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,470
I read something he wrote recently
in a "Sunday Times" review, I think.

453
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,390
It was very nasty, but very funny.

454
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,521
It's a giraffe. Enormous.
Cory would love it.

455
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,899
It's probably way too much money
but I'd really like to buy her one.

456
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,193
She's so cute.

457
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,030
She sits and has conversations
with the television set.

458
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,325
She's such a pretty thing.

459
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,912
- How's Mike?
- Fine.

460
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,498
We'd love to get together
with you and Frederick.

461
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:48,044
Oh, well, that'd be great, but it's
been sort of a rough week for me.

462
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,130
It doesn't necessarily
have to be this week.

463
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,259
I gotta give Frederick a chance
to get settled in at Barnard.

464
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,764
Renny, why do you keep pushing me away?

465
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,350
- Well, I don't.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

466
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,228
- It's like you don't even want me near you.
- Oh, Joey, come on.

467
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,981
You know, I mean. You know that
I've been having some work problems.

468
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,191
I need isolation, I need to be alone.

469
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,527
The creative thing, it's very delicate.

470
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,655
That's great.
You hide behind your work.

471
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,490
Flyn's never here,
and I inherited Mother.

472
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,784
I see Mother too. I phone her.

473
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,330
Yeah. But you're in Connecticut,
and I end up with all the dirty work.

474
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,208
Look, Joey. I can't help it if you feel guilty
about your feelings toward Mother.

475
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,919
I mean, you can't seem to do enough
to make up for it.

476
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,881
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

477
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,175
You could never stand her.

478
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,637
I don't believe this. My whole life,
I've only wanted to be her.

479
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,765
Yeah. Well, for a while there,
you were her, weren't you?

480
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,433
I don't know what you're talking about.

481
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,644
Oh, Joey, you know
what I'm talking about.

482
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,396
All those headaches every time
she'd come home from the hospital.

483
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,023
You never wanted her to come home.

484
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,527
This is incredible. I mean,
you twist everything I say. I give up.

485
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,508
You OK?

486
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,137
I just experienced
the strangest sensation.

487
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,058
Well, you look kind of pale.

488
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,728
It was as if I had a sudden...

489
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,399
clear vision where everything seems...

490
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,903
sort of awful and predatory.

491
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,701
It was like... It was like I was here

492
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:53,414
and the world was out there,
and I couldn't bring us together.

493
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,460
Could you maybe have dozed off
and had one of those dreams?

494
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,045
No.

495
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:05,051
No, because the same thing happened
last week when I was reading upstairs.

496
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,597
I suddenly became
hyper aware of my body.

497
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,769
And I could feel my heart beating,

498
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,480
and I began to imagine that...

499
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,985
I could feel the blood sort of
coursing through my veins

500
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,865
and my hands
and in the back of my... neck.

501
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:32,036
I felt precarious, like I was
a machine that was functioning

502
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,956
but I could just conk out at any second.

503
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,501
You're not gonna conk out.

504
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,129
You gotta put those kind of thoughts
out of your head.

505
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,382
Yeah. It frightens me too,
you know, because...

506
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,845
I'm not that far from the age when
Mother began showing signs of strain.

507
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,556
You're not your mother.
You're not. You're not.

508
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,601
You've been under some kind of stress
and you haven't been sleeping well.

509
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,853
Things like that. That's all.

510
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,824
What are these?
Are these Joey's photographs, these?

511
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,493
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me see.

512
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,579
They're not very good, I'm afraid.

513
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,374
No. She doesn't really have an eye.

514
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,670
She's gonna wanna know what you think,
so you'd better get ready.

515
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,839
Poor Joey.

516
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,928
She has all the anguish and anxiety

517
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,640
of the artistic personality
without any of the talent.

518
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,894
And naturally, I'm put in the position
of having to encourage her.

519
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,855
No, tell her the truth.
Get it over with. Don't lead her on.

520
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,983
I don't lead her on, but I mean,
God, I can't break her heart.

521
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,111
And you know how
competitive she is with me.

522
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,617
I always think it's better
to level with a person.

523
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,453
- Wish you'd done that with me more often.
- I did.

524
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,747
No, you didn't.
You flattered me, and I liked it.

525
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,875
Frederick, you're good,
and I've never hesitated to say it.

526
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,337
There's something missing from my work.

527
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,884
I don't know. I don't know if I've lost it
or I never had it, or what.

528
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,138
You're capable of being extraordinary
and you've stopped for spite.

529
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,642
No, not for spite!

530
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,108
I'll get back to it someday.

531
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,111
You throw everything away to spite me.

532
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,737
Let's not talk about it, OK?

533
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,074
Fine.

534
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,124
What are you gonna say to Joey?

535
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,751
She should just marry Michael

536
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,671
and stop her obsessive worrying
about being so damn creative.

537
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,257
Sometimes she just annoys me.

538
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,290
'Oh, Jimmy's getting excited. Isn't he?

539
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,250
<i>It's an exciting thing to be a Christian,</i>

540
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,086
<i>and I have a gentleman
who's a friend of mine,</i>

541
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,674
<i>a fairly new friend, but our friendship
goes way back to the cross of Calvary.</i>

542
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,053
<i>Roy Schwartz, it's a delight
to have you here today.</i>

543
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:39,223
<i>Now, Roy, you are
by birth what nationality?'</i>

544
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,268
<i>- A Hebrew.
- A Hebrew.</i>

545
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,104
<i>When I was talking about
God's chosen people -</i>

546
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,274
<i>you're probably very aware,
you've studied your history,</i>

547
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
<i>you're involved in this -</i>

548
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,988
<i>what part did the Jewish people
and the nation of Israel</i>

549
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,824
<i>have in God's timepiece today?'</i>

550
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,915
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

551
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,833
It's 45 minutes.

552
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,419
The traffic was unbearable, I'm sorry.

553
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,673
- You should take that into account.
- Could we drop this? My head is splitting.

554
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:16,177
- What's the matter?
- What do you think? I'm pregnant.

555
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,388
- Thought you might be.
- I'm goddamned annoyed!

556
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,766
- We'll take care of it.
- Naturally, we'll take care of it.

557
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,602
- You don't think I'm gonna have a kid.
- I said we'll take care of it.

558
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,104
It's nothing.

559
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,439
I'm so stupid!
How can I be so careless?

560
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,566
All right, it happens.

561
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,277
You know, we could have the kid.
It wouldn't be the end of the world.

562
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,321
For you maybe. For me,
it'd be the end of the world.

563
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,117
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Oh, Michael, I've thought about it.

564
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:43,371
It's absurd. How could we have a kid?
I don't even know where my life is going.

565
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,791
- Maybe it's not such a great idea.
- You don't think so either?

566
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,960
I guess not.

567
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,259
- Well, what happened to you?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

568
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,386
We found something wonderful
for the bedroom.

569
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,973
- This won't be too expensive, I hope.
- It's a little more than we planned.

570
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,101
- We had this discussion already.
- Can we not get into a financial dispute?

571
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,770
It's right over here.
I think you'll like it.

572
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,652
- Your father's back from Greece.
- Is he?

573
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,320
You know he's back from Greece.

574
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,573
You're having dinner
with him tomorrow at Renata's.

575
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,616
Renata told me.
Were you not going to tell me?

576
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,785
Yes, I just know how you are
on that whole subject.

577
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,163
Will you talk to him, Joey?
He listens to you.

578
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,790
He's a grown man.
He makes his own decisions.

579
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,418
Yeah, but he puts great store
by what you have to say.

580
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,589
If he wants to move back in with you,
he will. If he doesn't, he won't.

581
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:39,385
- Why are you so reluctant to help me?
- Reluctant? I do nothing but cater to you.

582
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,054
Joey, it's as though you don't care
if we get back together or not.

583
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,307
You're crazy.
Why wouldn't I want you to be happy?

584
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,225
I just think you shouldn't delude yourself.

585
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,060
Will you tell him
how well I've been doing?

586
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,771
That my work is finally
flourishing again?

587
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,524
- That my mood swings are less rapid?
- He doesn't care.

588
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,068
He just wants to know
that I'm on an even keel, that's all.

589
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,487
- I'm having an inner tranquillity.
- Leave me alone.

590
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,364
- Joey...
- Just leave me out of this!

591
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,325
Where are you going?

592
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,497
Joey, maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad idea to have a child.

593
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,125
- Oh, please.
- I mean, sometimes just taking...

594
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,502
- I can't, OK?
- You mean you won't.

595
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,047
Why do you stay with me?
I don't understand you.

596
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,841
I give you nothing but grief.

597
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,972
I think, you should take the job
at the advertising agency,

598
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,308
and we should maybe
think about getting settled.

599
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,310
Yeah, right! That's all I need.

600
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,938
If I start writing copy and having kids,
I'd never get out of it.

601
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,523
I'd be swallowed up
IN some anonymous lifestyle.

602
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,151
I wanna do something with my life.

603
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,783
Now I'm guilty 'cause I left
my mother standing.

604
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,493
- She'll be fine.
- Oh, a lot you care.

605
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,788
It's your mother that can't stand me.

606
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,949
- Well...
- I hope the cat isn't in the kitchen.

607
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,288
Cory's gonna go upstairs
and play for a while. OK, Cory?

608
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,291
I'll see you later, all right?
All right. Bye.

609
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,128
I mean, I'll be getting
them all out in about a month and a half.

610
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,797
Then you wouldn't have
anything left to say. Right?

611
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,758
Dad.

612
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,177
He was so excited when I spoke to him.

613
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,097
He saw that terrible movie
that Flyn was in on the plane.

614
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,975
- Come in. Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

615
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,186
The traffic in this town
Is getting impossible.

616
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,105
Hi.

617
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,606
Mike.

618
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,568
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Daddy.

619
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,861
- Renata.
- Hello, Dad.

620
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,531
- Hi. This is Pearl.
- Hello.

621
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,284
- Hi.
- I'm Mike. This is Joey.

622
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,494
- Glad to meet you. Hi.
- Hello.

623
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,121
- Frederick.
- Hi.

624
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,665
Um, would you like anything to drink?

625
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,085
Whatever Arthur's having's fine.

626
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,712
Here. Why don't you sit down there?

627
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,048
It's probably the only
comfortable place in the house.

628
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,262
It's good to be back.

629
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,307
Well, I'm sure
you must have enjoyed Athens.

630
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,976
You can't beat Greece islands
for sand and blue water.

631
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,313
And the food!
I could eat lamb six times a day.

632
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,773
And this one and his ouzo.

633
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,859
The only problem I had
was nobody spoke English.

634
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,737
Oh, it didn't matter. Everybody
understood what was important.

635
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,074
Did you get a chance to see
any of the temples, architecture?

636
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,161
Oh, yes. It's so wonderful.
You're steeped in history.

637
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,122
We saw some great examples
from the fifth century BC.

638
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,250
Remember that little island
with the temple? Beautifully preserved.

639
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:02,505
- To tell you the truth, I prefer the beaches.
- She could sit in the sun all day.

640
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,549
That's enough ruins.
How many ruins can you see?

641
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,344
But that hot sand,
that blue water - that's for me.

642
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,762
I don't wanna rush anyone

643
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,932
but maybe we should continue
this conversation in the other room.

644
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,227
First time I went to Europe,
with my first husband,

645
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,021
many years ago,
all we saw was churches.

646
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,606
One cathedral led to another.

647
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,858
Don't misunderstand me,
they were beautiful but...

648
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,153
you see two or three,
then enough already. All the day...

649
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,157
- Did you know he was bringing someone?
- Yes. Didn't I mention it?

650
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,329
Give me a good sirloin anytime.

651
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,668
Charcoal. They talk about
club steaks and porterhouse?

652
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,087
Sirloin, charcoal and blood rare.

653
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,840
Pearl's husband
was something of a chef.

654
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,094
He was an amateur chef.

655
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,432
Actually, he was in the jewellery business,
my first husband, may he rest in peace.

656
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:58,144
- Adam, my second, was an orthodontist.
- How many have you had?

657
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,731
Two. Adam had a massive coronary.
Rudy was an alcoholic.

658
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,818
- Would you like some more gravy?
- No, no, no. It's too heavy.

659
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,321
Ah, what are you worried about?
It's delicious. Try it.

660
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,450
- Where are you from, Pearl?
- Florida.

661
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,743
Oh, we lived all over the place
when I was younger,

662
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,247
but I prefer a warm climate.

663
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,000
I even lived in Australia for a year.

664
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,752
With my sister Fay, when Adam died.

665
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,213
I went nuts. It's dead there.

666
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,341
I was in Sydney, Australia, once.

667
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,262
Oh. Was I lying? Did you like it?

668
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,515
It was just a vacation.
I was only there a couple of days.

669
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,435
Lucky. It's like a morgue.

670
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,313
Nothing to do at night, no pizzazz.
I couldn't take that.

671
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,316
Here's a woman
who could go dancing every night.

672
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:51,322
You know what I say: you only live once,
but once is enough if you play it right.

673
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:55,367
- Do you have any children, Pearl?
- Oh, yes. I have two sons.

674
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,495
Lewis and John.

675
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,706
Lewis is in real estate.
John runs an art gallery.

676
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,625
Oh?

677
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,419
In the lobby in Caesars Palace
in Las Vegas.

678
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,798
It's not exactly a gallery,
it's more a concession.

679
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:14,094
- Paintings of clowns on black velvet?
- That's right, junk.

680
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,348
Oh, I tell you, it's pure junk,
but people like it.

681
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,309
They get a kick out of it.
He does very nicely.

682
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:25,397
- Pearl collects African art.
- Oh. Oh, I love black ebony.

683
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,692
I own some statues.
Actually, they're from Trinidad.

684
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:33,531
Oh, I love those real primitive statues
with the big hips and the big breasts.

685
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:38,285
Oh, I even have some voodoo masks.
I believe in that stuff.

686
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,497
I could tell your fortune,
but I need cards. Later, maybe.

687
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,916
This couple we met were raving about it,

688
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,544
so I cabled right away
from the office to get two tickets.

689
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,087
I'm glad I did. It was fabulous.

690
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,589
I know. We thought
it was very interesting too.

691
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,718
But depressing as hell. I mean,
it was pessimistic to the point of futility.

692
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,179
Fashionable pessimism
is all the rage nowadays.

693
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,139
When they sentenced
those Algerians to death,

694
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,183
I thought it was a good ending.

695
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,270
I don't know. You call that
fashionable, but it's hard to argue

696
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,398
that in the face of death,
life loses real meaning.

697
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:11,610
- It is?
- Well. I mean, I can't argue it succinctly,

698
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,821
but I suppose if you've read
Socrates or Buddha,

699
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:18,158
Schopenhauer, even Ecclesiastes,
they're very convincing.

700
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,787
Well, they should know.
I don't read that much.

701
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,331
What struck me
was the way the terrorists

702
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,166
only killed if they absolutely had to.

703
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,545
Never wantonly, just if they had to,
to achieve their own aims.

704
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,341
I was very moved when that Algerian boy
said he killed in the name of freedom.

705
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,053
- It gave me chills.
- It's still killing for an abstraction.

706
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:43,058
Why? You value the life of a single person
over the lives of thousands of others?

707
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,477
I don't know.
I mean, who are those thousands?

708
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,354
It's another abstraction.

709
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,066
To me, the conflict over
the giving of the information

710
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,446
between the French doctor and
the Algerian was the best part of the play.

711
00:51:55,571 --> 00:52:00,075
I know. The writer argued both sides so
brilliantly you didn't know who was right.

712
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,664
I didn't get that. I mean, to me,
it wasn't such a big deal.

713
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,708
One guy was a squealer.
The other guy wasn't.

714
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,168
I liked the guy that wasn't.

715
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,129
It's a little more complex
than that, don't you think?

716
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,841
Why? You liked the squealer?
Did I miss something?

717
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,636
That's what made me anxious
about the play, I mean,

718
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:21,430
how do you figure out
the right thing to do?

719
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,682
How do you know?

720
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:28,979
How do you know? I don't know.
You just know, you feel it. I mean...

721
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,482
You just don't squeal. I don't know.

722
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,527
Anyway, it was a good evening
in the theatre for a change.

723
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,697
I'd love another piece
of cheesecake but...

724
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,660
Well, have it.
What are you worried about?

725
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,914
You'll live to be 100 if you give up
all the things that make you want to.

726
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,049
Am I the only one or is it hot in here?

727
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,094
Can we open a window?

728
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,471
OK. Ready?

729
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,099
- Uh-huh.
- OK. Pick a card.

730
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,268
- Anyone.
- There you go.

731
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,687
- OK. Put it back.
- Let me see it.

732
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:13,482
Any place, any place.
All right. OK. Watch.

733
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,693
- I'm ready.
- All right.

734
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,987
Now we shuffle.

735
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,489
Now you... All right.

736
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,325
- What?
- No, nothing. Just go ahead.

737
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,202
- Is it that?
- No.

738
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,328
- That?

739
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,205
- That?
- Wrong.

740
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,833
- It's none of those three.
- None of those three.

741
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,376
Not that one.

742
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,255
- Not that one.
- No.

743
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,425
- That one.
- Jesus, that's fantastic.

744
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,928
- How did you do that?
- Oh, what's the difference?

745
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,222
That is a miraculous card trick.

746
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,809
And I was watching really closely.
Where did you learn that?

747
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,730
I'm a gal that's been around.
I've picked up a lot of useless information.

748
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,608
You tell fortunes. You do card tricks.
You do séances, too?

749
00:53:56,734 --> 00:54:01,113
Nuh-uh. Not me. I figure
whatever's out there, it's their business.

750
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,365
Besides, you think I wanna
bring back my ex-husband?

751
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,829
As soon as possible,
Pearl and I are gonna get married.

752
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,498
Oh, God.

753
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,543
That's gonna sink Mother.

754
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,795
She'll have a hard time at first
but she'll get over it.

755
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,839
- Easy for you to say.
- It's not easy.

756
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,050
- How long have you known her, Dad?
- Now, a month.

757
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,304
A month? Isn't that a little hasty?

758
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,891
- We've spent a lot of time together.
- That's a lot of time, four weeks?

759
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,226
I expect you all at the wedding.

760
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,855
Flyn, too, I insist that Flyn fly in and meet
Pearl and be there when we're married.

761
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,065
I must admit that the whole thing
does seem a bit fast.

762
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,567
It's gonna be fine.

763
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,529
She's a nice woman.
She's kind. She's affectionate.

764
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,824
Christ, I'm 63 years old.
I wanna relax.

765
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,243
I'm happy just to lie
on the beach with her.

766
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,872
I like it that she's full of energy
and demonstrative and open.

767
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,709
You just met her. She's a widow,
and you're a wealthy man.

768
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,920
What's that supposed to mean?
She's after my money?

769
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,339
- She's not saying that.
- Why? Is that so far-fetched?

770
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,715
I won't dignify that.

771
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,302
Don't get upset. It's just, a man
In your position has to be careful.

772
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,764
You don't know her yet.
She's a fine woman, and I love her.

773
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,935
OK. All right but it's going to be the worst
possible thing that could happen to Mother.

774
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,188
I can't believe she still imagines
we'll get back together after all this time.

775
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,982
Of course, she imagines it because
everyone except me leads her on.

776
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,610
- I don't wanna hear that old story.
- It's true.

777
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,988
And from the day you moved out,
all that talk about a trial separation.

778
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,283
- You were never coming back.
- I wanted to let her down easily.

779
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,453
- She's such a fragile thing.
- She is not a thing.

780
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,832
I mean, we all treat her like a patient
in a hospital. She's a human being.

781
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,543
Your idea of treating her
like a human being

782
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,878
is always to throw cold water
on her hopes all the times.

783
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,630
What hopes? Now, look what's happening.

784
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,549
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, Joey.

785
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,926
The most that we could do
was postpone it a little bit.

786
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,054
- You're all she lives for.
- Don't give me that...

787
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,809
- Now you're abandoning her for this...
- Joey, don't you go any further.

788
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,228
All right, Dad. Don't get upset.
Don't get all riled up.

789
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,647
And don't think I don't notice
the both of you looking at her

790
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,566
in a very judgmental, superior way.

791
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,609
Now, you're imagining things.

792
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,195
We knew about your affairs
when Mother was in the hospital,

793
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,531
but your choices
were just a little more discreet!

794
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,701
Joey, shut up! Dad, she's upset.

795
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,035
Joey, why do you do this to me?

796
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,871
You know how much
your opinion means to me.

797
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,790
- She's a vulgarian.
- Joey, be quiet!

798
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,625
I don't wanna discuss this.

799
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,587
I think you should do as you feel,
with our blessing.

800
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:26,550
- Joey, I count on you.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

801
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,762
Will you tell him it's OK?
Obviously, it's your approval he needs.

802
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,140
He certainly had no trouble getting yours.

803
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,725
Clearly, it doesn't mean
as much as yours.

804
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,020
I want the support of all my daughters!

805
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,064
I'm not just here to make
sacrifices and foot the bills.

806
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,651
It's time you thought of me!

807
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,092
I'm sorry to have hurried you
through lunch,

808
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,261
but I wanted you to get here
and see this

809
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,723
before the place gets
cluttered up with people.

810
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,893
When you wrote from Greece
you were telling me about

811
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,521
the mosaics in the Orthodox churches.

812
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:25,651
But look at this, all these mosaics.
There, behind the altar.

813
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,529
And in a Romanesque church.
Isn't that amazing?

814
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:33,909
And look at that. And here
in New York. It's really incredible.

815
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,911
Quite surprising.

816
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,289
It makes me homesick for our trips.

817
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,626
All those churches, you must have
seen a lot when you were there.

818
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:43,961
Yes.

819
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:51,218
Be so marvellous to forget everything
and take a nice slow trip to the Far East.

820
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:55,263
It might get us back on the right track.

821
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,309
Eve, I said I had something
I wanted to say to you.

822
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,228
What?

823
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,982
I think we should finalise our divorce.

824
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,192
You do?

825
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,404
Yeah. Sooner or later
we've got to face reality

826
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,573
and try to make new lives for ourselves.

827
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,201
You know, it's very funny,

828
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,371
because I thought that's
what might be on your mind.

829
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,541
- It's not the end of the world.
- It's not?

830
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,876
I think it's pretty goddamn terrible!

831
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,964
Eve, everything's going to be just fine.

832
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:34,636
Oh, I know that it's a little... soon
perhaps to talk about a reconciliation,

833
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,514
but I don't see why
we have to finalise our divorce.

834
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,268
I don't see why we can't
just go on the way we are.

835
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,062
- We should be free to make other plans.
- Like what? What kind of plan?

836
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,692
Well, in the event that we meet
other people. To become involved.

837
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,944
What are you saying?
You wanna remarry? Is that it?

838
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,572
- I'm not discussing that.
- Have you met someone?

839
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,157
- No.
- Oh, you're lying.

840
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:58,160
Of course you've met someone.
Why don't you be honest about it?

841
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,120
Yes, I have.
But if you're gonna make much...

842
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:05,125
Oh, never mind. Just don't talk about it.
Don't wanna hear any more.

843
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,419
I talked with your doctor.
He feels you can handle this.

844
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:12,591
- You talked to Dr Lobel behind my back?
- Not behind your back. Discreetly.

845
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:17,262
You've discussed this with Dr Lobel
behind my back. It's so humiliating.

846
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,974
Eve, it's your doctor and myself.
Now, how private can one be?

847
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,102
And he assured you
that I can handle it.

848
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:28,940
- Is that right? How humiliating!
- You're not humiliated.

849
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,693
Oh, I just wanna die.

850
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,904
Now stop that.

851
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,573
I just hate my life!

852
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,003
Oh, I can't... I can't breathe!

853
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,738
Flyn!

854
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,365
Hi.

855
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,035
Oh. Ahh. Oh, God, it's good to see you.

856
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,914
- No, it's good to see you.
- You look terrific.

857
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,416
You really do. That's a great sweater.

858
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,168
- Oh, no.
- It really is. It's nice.

859
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,381
- You've seen this sweater before.
- No, I haven't. It's terrific.

860
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,759
Are you tanned, Renny?
You been somewhere?

861
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,303
Why? Do I have on too much make-up?

862
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,222
You're the one that looks great, Flyn.

863
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,890
Oh, no. I don't. I'm heavy.

864
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,017
No. I've gained weight.

865
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:49,771
My plane flight was so bumpy,
I thought I was gonna die.

866
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,859
I made such a fool of myself
with the man next to me. Really did.

867
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:58,655
- Have you met Pearl?
- Yes. She's not what I expected.

868
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,034
No, God, God, isn't it strange
being back in the house again?

869
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,370
- Yeah.
- Have you spoken with Mother?

870
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,456
Oh, yes. We're gonna have
dinner one night this week.

871
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:12,544
- How's she holding up?
- I don't know. Better than we all expected.

872
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,756
- Isn't that right, Joey?
- She took it very badly at first.

873
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:20,051
But after the initial shock,
she seemed to come out of it.

874
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,972
Joey feels that all of her Jesus Christ
nonsense is actually somewhat of a help.

875
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,099
- Whatever works.
- Hello, Flyn.

876
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,727
- Michael. Gosh, hi.
- Nice to see you.

877
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,770
It's good to see you, too.

878
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,190
Joey, you have to tell me
what you're up to.

879
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,942
Yet another job. At an ad agency.

880
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,029
- That's fabulous.
- No. But it's temporary.

881
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,782
Here we are. I made some
cocktail franks and meatballs.

882
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,534
About time too. I'm starved.

883
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,412
There's plenty. We have everything
your little heart desires.

884
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,039
Good. Thanks.

885
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,417
Are you and Dad gonna be staying on here
or are you gonna take a place in town?

886
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,545
Well, it's a little quiet out here,
but Arthur loves it.

887
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,756
Of course, it means redoing
so much of the house.

888
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,132
In what way?

889
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:04,471
Oh, I don't know. There's just
the two of us and it's kind of pale.

890
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:07,349
Besides, I have so much furniture I own
and pictures and knick-knacks.

891
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,100
This place'd look like a warehouse.

892
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,770
Would you like to hear some music?

893
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,358
Do I look older?

894
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,526
Older?

895
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,238
Yeah, I mean it.
Do you think I look older?

896
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,282
No. Why would you think that?

897
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,868
I don't know, I don't know. I...

898
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,330
I look in the mirror every day
and I feel discouraged.

899
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,999
Now I see you
and you don't change at all.

900
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,419
No, you don't change. Your skin,
it's like cream. Look at your skin.

901
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,713
I work at it.

902
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,174
No, I don't think that's it.

903
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:47,097
I have a few good years, then my youth
will be frozen on celluloid for TV movies.

904
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,140
Come on, Flyn.
You're more than just beautiful.

905
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,309
You know you have talent.

906
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,104
- Don't pump me up, Renny.
- Why do you say that?

907
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,983
I know what I am.
Look, I'm not treated seriously.

908
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,654
When really classy projects
come along I get passed over.

909
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,740
If it wasn't for the stupid
television industry...

910
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,326
You have always been
so self-deprecating, Flyn.

911
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,912
- You know that.
- No.

912
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:18,878
No, you're the gifted one
in this family, Renny. I'm proud of you.

913
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:27,345
I wish you lived here,
I really do. Every time I see you, I...

914
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,390
It just reminds me
how much I do miss you.

915
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,731
How's Frederick?

916
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:44,362
He's angry. He's teaching
when he really wants to be writing.

917
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,615
Teaching's something
that can't be taught anyway.

918
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,493
Now, he's taking his rage
out in these critical pieces

919
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,621
under the guise of high standards.

920
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,500
I don't know. I guess I...

921
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:03,548
- I don't think I've been very good for him.
- Oh, Renny, he idolises you.

922
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,261
What time is it? We ought to get back.

923
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,681
No, I think I'm gonna stay a while longer.

924
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,267
OK, I'll see you back there.

925
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,958
Hi.

926
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,343
You know I want you to be happy.
I want you both to be happy.

927
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,848
Tell her.

928
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,476
Tell Pearl.

929
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:04,651
I know she puts on a gay facade,
but... she knows how you feel.

930
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,655
Tell her.

931
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,324
Will you?

932
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,785
OK.

933
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,457
You look deep in thought.

934
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,626
I'm deep in vodka.

935
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,548
Would you help me get my boots off?

936
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,385
That's the best offer I had all year.

937
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,224
I paid 200 bucks for these boots
and they kill my feet.

938
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,112
I did a terrible thing last week.

939
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,742
I wrote about this friend's book.
Not a very good book.

940
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,829
I pointed that out.
Which is what I was getting paid to do.

941
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,335
But I was extremely cruel about it.

942
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,589
And I took great pleasure in my cruelty.

943
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,469
My anger scares me.

944
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,973
I don't like what I'm becoming.

945
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,103
I happen to think you're
a very impressive person.

946
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,899
Oh, I think you have
very impressive feet.

947
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,612
And I happen to think
you're very drunk.

948
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:16,783
- Come on, not yet.
- Yes. Thank you.

949
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,617
We are gathered together here
in the presence of this company

950
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:04,414
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of matrimony.

951
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:08,418
Arthur, will you have this woman
as your wedded wife,

952
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:12,297
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?

953
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,133
Will you love her, comfort her,

954
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,344
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health,

955
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:23,683
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto her so long as you both do live?

956
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,227
I will.

957
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,565
Pearl, will you have this man
as your wedded husband,

958
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:34,110
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?

959
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,613
Will you love him, comfort him,

960
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:40,283
honour and keep him
in sickness and in health,

961
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:46,164
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto him so long as you both do live?

962
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,458
I will.

963
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:52,378
In as much as Arthur and Pearl
have consented together in wedlock,

964
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,922
and have withessed the same
before this company,

965
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,675
and thereto have pledged
each to the other,

966
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,845
and have declared the same
by joining of hands,

967
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,473
I, in accordance with
the authority invested in me

968
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,558
by the law of the State of New York,

969
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,395
do announce that they
are husband and wife.

970
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,816
You may kiss the bride.

971
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,363
Well, Arthur, friends...

972
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,867
Congratulations.

973
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:37,590
Jesus, I don't think I've ever
seen him dance before in his life.

974
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,938
Ow.

975
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,690
OK. Don't forget.

976
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,871
- Let me get you some champagne.
- That would be perfect.

977
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,541
Come on, baby.

978
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,294
All right.

979
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,717
Oh, my!

980
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,059
Jesus Christ, be careful!

981
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,648
- You've had too much to drink.
- Just because I don't act like an animal!

982
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,944
- That's enough!
- Oh, please! Just leave me alone!

983
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,173
What?

984
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,147
Oh, Frederick, you're drunk.

985
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,281
C'mon. You're always flirting with me.

986
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,784
No.

987
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,329
Yes. You flirt.
You like to be looked at.

988
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:05,793
Otherwise you don't exist,
except in somebody else's eyes.

989
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,673
Stop it, Frederick. You're drunk.

990
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:15,970
No, I'm celebrating. You got
a new mother. She's a hot number.

991
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,473
Can't you feel the heat?

992
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,600
No.

993
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,187
C'mon. It's been such a long time

994
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:28,983
since I made love to a woman
that I didn't feel inferior to.

995
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,652
Or am I being tactless?

996
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,972
Mother?

997
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,976
Is that you?

998
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,318
You shouldn't be here.

999
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,865
Not tonight.

1000
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,581
I'll take you home.

1001
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,254
You look so strange and tired.

1002
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:02,303
I feel like we're in a dream together.

1003
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,894
Please don't look so sad.

1004
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,527
It makes me feel so guilty.

1005
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,033
I'm so consumed with guilt.

1006
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,540
It's ironic

1007
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,962
because, uh... I've cared for you so...

1008
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:44,220
And you have nothing but
disdain for me, and yet I feel guilty.

1009
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:57,900
I think you're... really too perfect
to live in this world.

1010
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:03,322
I mean, all the...
beautifully furnished rooms,

1011
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:09,119
carefully-designed interiors,
everything's so controlled.

1012
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:15,376
There wasn't any room
for any real feelings.

1013
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,046
None.

1014
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,883
Between any of us.

1015
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,469
Except Renata,

1016
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,727
who never gave you the time of day.

1017
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,400
You worship Renata.

1018
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,154
You worship talent.

1019
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:49,576
Well, what happens to
those of us who can't create?

1020
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,750
What do we do? What do I do, when
I'm overwhelmed with feelings about life?

1021
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,171
How do I get them out?

1022
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:05,509
I feel such rage toward you!

1023
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:13,559
Oh, Mother. Don't you see?

1024
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:21,150
You're... not just a sick woman.

1025
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,030
That would be too easy.

1026
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,161
The truth is...

1027
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,624
there's been perverseness

1028
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,045
and wilfulness of attitude

1029
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,048
in many of the things you've done.

1030
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,929
At the centre of a sick psyche
there is a sick spirit.

1031
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,148
But I love you.

1032
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:08,030
And we have no other choice
but to forgive each other.

1033
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,325
- Are you talking to someone?
- Yes, uh...

1034
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,118
I thought I heard voices.

1035
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,829
- Mother?
- Yes?

1036
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,289
What?

1037
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,125
You said "mother" and I said "yes".

1038
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,003
Mother?

1039
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:52,616
Mother!

1040
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,706
Mother!

1041
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:21,797
<i>After the funeral service,
we all returned to the beach house.</i>

1042
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:27,886
<i>I couldn't help experiencing
some very nostalgic memories.</i>

1043
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,890
<i>Naturally, of my mother</i>

1044
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:36,895
<i>and, pleasantly, of the few
warmer moments we'd known.</i>

1045
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:40,857
<i>I recalled how beautiful she was,</i>

1046
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:44,069
<i>dressing to go out
for the evening with my father.</i>

1047
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:51,243
<i>And of how Renata looked up to her,
and her ideas about art.</i>

1048
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:57,833
<i>And how Flyn was
so impressed as a tiny girl</i>

1049
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:00,669
<i>when Mother decorated a Christmas tree.</i>

1050
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:07,217
<i>I felt compelled to write
these thoughts down.</i>

1051
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,972
<i>They seemed very powerful to me</i>

1052
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,452
Water's so calm.

1053
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,248
Yes.

1054
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:42,043
It's very peaceful.
