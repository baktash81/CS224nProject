1
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,209
No feet!

2
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,504
No! No!

3
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,673
- No! Not the hair!
- Yes.

4
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,013
- Not the - Frances!
- Ow!

5
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,070
I tried to make a frittata,
but it's really more of a scramble.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,992
This is interesting.

7
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,491
“To praise a work of literature
by calling it sincere...

8
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,994
is now at best a way of saying that,
although it may be given...

9
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,042
no aesthetic or intellectual
admiration -”

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,885
I wouldn't eat
a domesticated dog.

11
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,225
You say that
just because they're cute.

12
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,240
Don't be stupid.

13
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,787
I should sleep in my own bed.

14
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,202
Why?

15
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,625
Because I bought it.

16
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,710
Stay.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,799
But take off your socks.

18
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,972
- it's hairless?
- No, it has fine, curly hair.

19
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,475
There's this house
in Westchester -

20
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,485
the basement
is all Cornish Rexes.

21
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,772
It smells awful.
The top floor is Siamese cats.

22
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,819
- I'm allergic to cats.
- They're hypoallergenic.

23
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,484
- This is a special Frances kitty.
- Oh. Who knew?

24
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,159
This one's the runt, which is cheaper,
but I think it's the best one anyway.

25
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,122
I figure one runt
and one regular.

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,367
I put a hundred-dollar
down payment on each cat.

27
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,371
Well, 80 for the runt
and a hundred for the other one.

28
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,125
- Why not just get one cat?
- A cat needs a buddy. If you get one, you need two.

29
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,297
I'll give you $200
to get no cats.

30
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,964
So who will take care of them
if you go away?

31
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,012
I thought we could
get 'em together.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,178
And move them back and forth
between our apartments?

33
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,597
No. I thought maybe...

34
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,940
you could move in with me.

35
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,361
Oh. Wow.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,648
- Do you want to move in with me?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,651
Yes. I mean,
I do have this other thing.

38
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,494
- What other thing?
- Well, I don't know.

39
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,989
I promised Sophie
I'd stay through the lease...

40
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,116
and she'll probably
want to renew it.

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,293
Is that bad?
I'm sorry. I feel bad.

42
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,839
- Can't she find someone else?
- Yeah, but it's my friend.

43
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,008
<i>- Uh-huh.
- I want to move in with you. - Okay.</i>

44
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,848
- I feel bad.
- Don't feel bad. Forget it.

45
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,434
<i>- No. What?
- Nothing.</i>

46
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,555
- You're mad.
- I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.

47
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,398
- I feel bad.
- Stop feeling bad.

48
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,018
Frances, I asked you
to move in. You said no.

49
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,737
<i>- But I can't.
- You can. You don't want to.</i>

50
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,409
- Who is it?
- I don't have to get it.

51
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,200
<i>- Who is it? - Sophie. I'll call her later.
- Just pick up the phone.</i>

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,288
- Are you sure?
- Answer it.

53
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,709
Yo, girl! What's up?

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,584
Hey, where are you?

55
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,049
I can't come.

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,009
Are you drunk?

57
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,299
I love you!

58
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,970
Ahh! Dumpling House!

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,934
<i>I can't really talk right now.</i>

60
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,063
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,932
<i>Okay.</i>

62
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,024
I love you.

63
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,193
<i>She's with these guys...</i>

64
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,033
<i>Benji and Lev,
at a party in Chinatown.</i>

65
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,824
They're drunk.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,117
I don't know.

67
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,741
Maybe this isn't working.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,952
- I'm sorry.
- Me too..

69
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,805
Maybe -
No, never mind.

70
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,725
<i>- What?
- I want to pay you for the cats.</i>

71
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,223
I'm not gonna take
money from you...

72
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,726
but I am going
to get the cats anyway.

73
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,194
But then you're gonna be
a single guy with two cats.

74
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,858
Why would I be single?

75
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,323
<i>- With two cats.
- No, I know.</i>

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,614
I mean,
why would I be single?

77
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,658
I don't know.

78
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,532
I thought you said that
this isn't working.

79
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,834
I mean, if we don't move in together.
If we can't move in together.

80
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,548
We can move in together.

81
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,838
I don't know that I believe
anything I'm saying.

82
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,506
Uh-huh.

83
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,057
This hasn't been great
for a while.

84
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,974
“This hasn't been great
for a while.”

85
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,190
This has not been -

86
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,775
<i>- Where are you going?
- Home, I guess.</i>

87
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,274
I'm really... tired.

88
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,527
I'm always so tired.

89
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,779
Let's move in together.

90
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,219
Hi!

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,392
You're crazy.
You know Lev?

92
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,601
Yes.

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,188
- And Benji?
- Hi.

94
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,603
I can't get interested
in art or books...

95
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,273
or movies about animals.

96
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,739
The animals have to talk
or be at war for me to be interested.

97
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,412
Don't hit the third rail.

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,082
Shit!

99
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,171
The F's not running.

100
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,814
<i>- I want a sip.
- Do you want your own?</i>

101
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,687
I want a sip.

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,653
The coffee people are right.

103
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,280
We are like a lesbian couple
that doesn't have sex anymore.

104
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,289
<i>- Wait. Come back.
- Don't pick at your face.</i>

105
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
I don't like smoking alone.

106
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,966
Me and Dan
don't have sex anymore.

107
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,092
Didn't have sex anymore.

108
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
Yeah, that's why you broke up.

109
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,806
And if it happened,
he would just -

110
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,971
He only had one way
he could finish.

111
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,806
Oh, I hate that.

112
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,189
It was always with me facing flat
on the bed from behind...

113
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,148
which just -

114
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,643
everything that matters
is covered up.

115
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,487
- It's like with me and Patch.
- Yo, Patchy!

116
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,024
'Sup, brah?

117
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,867
The way he always likes
to come in my face.

118
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,488
Yeah. Classy.

119
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,578
He's the kind of guy who says,
“I've gotta take a leak.”

120
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,498
And wears predistressed
baseball hats.

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,458
He's a nice guy -

122
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,956
you know, for today.

123
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,459
I should feel bad
I went to that party.

124
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,383
You deserved it.
You just got out of relationship jail.

125
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,508
- I think Dan was an alcoholic.
- He was.

126
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,221
He wasn't a real alcoholic...

127
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,687
but sometimes he would have,
like, 12 beers.

128
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,061
- Hey.
- What?

129
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,688
Lev is asking
for your number.

130
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,528
Give it to him.

131
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,364
You did just break up
with Dan. Today.

132
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,236
Just do it.

133
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,210
I love you, Sophie,
even if you love...

134
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,205
your phone that has e-mail
more than you love me.

135
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,128
My phone that has e-mail
doesn't leave a casserole dish...

136
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,172
in the sink for three days.

137
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,762
What about that time
you made a cake?

138
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,140
I love you too.

139
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,402
“Ahoy, sexy.
Are you around this week?"

140
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,735
"Ahoy, sexy"?

141
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,949
That is actually very gay.

142
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,034
Am I nautically sensual?

143
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,284
You're funny.

144
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,532
Lev didn't laugh
at any of my jokes.

145
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,579
You are so funny.

146
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,665
Should I text him back...

147
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,754
“Starboard anal sex”?

148
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,550
No.

149
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,424
Tell me the story of us.

150
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,967
Again?

151
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,969
All right, Frances.

152
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,096
We are gonna
take over the world.

153
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,936
You'll be this awesomely
bitchy publishing mogul.

154
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,276
And you'll be this famous
modern dancer...

155
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,778
and I'll publish
a really expensive book about you.

156
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,441
That d-bags we make fun of
will put on their coffee tables.

157
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,365
- And we'll co-own a vacation apartment in Paris.
- And we'll have lovers.

158
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,285
<i>- And no children.
- And we'll speak at college graduations.</i>

159
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,160
<i>- And honorary degrees.
- So many honorary degrees.</i>

160
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
<i>- Colleen ?
- Yeah.</i>

161
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,479
<i>What time's rehearsal?</i>

162
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,815
It's 4:00. Don't forget
to bring your shoes.

163
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,357
- Hey.
- Jesus!

164
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,154
Sorry. I'm here.

165
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,905
I don't have time to talk.
I'm doing the job of three people.

166
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,826
But I can see you
after rehearsal.

167
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,833
<i>I read that article in the Times.
You must be so happy.</i>

168
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,041
<i>Yeah, thanks. I forget
I make my own work sometimes.</i>

169
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,539
<i>Bu! thanks.</i>

170
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,338
- I usually hate that woman's writing.
- Right. Thank you, Frances.

171
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,346
Actually, I had a couple of questions.
I'm trying to be proactive about my life.

172
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,215
Ah. Well, I might have some
studio space available...

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,263
if you want to play
with some choreography.

174
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
Uh, no, I was wondering
if there were...

175
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,889
any more classes
at the school I could teach.

176
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,062
I'm a little -
I'm kind of broke.

177
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,686
I'll check,
but I'm all full up, I think.

178
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,859
I thought so. I'm just proud
of myself for asking.

179
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,198
I'll probably be able to use you and some of
the other apprentices for the Christmas show.

180
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,117
- I mean, that's something.
- That's great.

181
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,116
I just wanted to say
I really look up to you...

182
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,334
and I just -
I think you're great.

183
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,874
A beat-up old dancer doing paperwork?

184
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,796
I really need to do
all this paperwork now.

185
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,045
I'm running rehearsal today,
so I'll see you there.

186
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,212
- Bye.
- Bye.

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,552
And then he was like,
"Rachel, you are cold and mean."

188
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,592
And I was like, “Fuck...

189
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,594
that really hurt my feelings.”

190
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,437
<i>And up over the head.</i>

191
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,903
<i>Boom. Perfect.
Over and. . . shoulder:</i>

192
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,947
<i>Boom, boom, boom. That was great.</i>

193
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,287
<i>Face each other.
Look at each other.</i>

194
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,701
<i>Wrap the head around.</i>

195
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,745
<i>That's nice. That's nice.</i>

196
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,743
<i>Move it around.</i>

197
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,870
<i>That's good, Rachel.
That's night.</i>

198
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,295
<i>- All night. Understudies, out.</i>

199
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,214
<i>Understudies, out. Out.</i>

200
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,054
<i>All right. Good.
Take it from the beginning.</i>

201
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,934
<i>Plié and straighten...</i>

202
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,346
<i>and plié and straighten...</i>

203
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,598
<i>and relevé and down.</i>

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,483
<i>And relevé all the way up
and turn...</i>

205
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,608
<i>to the other side...</i>

206
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,605
<i>and all the way down.</i>

207
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,449
<i>And now we have
the other foot in front.</i>

208
00:12:55,566 --> 00:13:00,197
And plié and straighten
and plié -

209
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,844
- Ahoy, sew!
- Ahoy, sexy!

210
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,198
- There's no service.
- Sometimes there is for a second.

211
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,447
What is going on
with that phone, lady?

212
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,334
I didn't want to do it without knowing
it was okay with you first.

213
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,837
- Do what?
- I want to move into this apartment with Lisa.

214
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,924
It's this great apartment in Tribeca,
which is what I've always wanted...

215
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,215
but I don't want to do it
if it's not okay with you.

216
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,464
- Oh.
- They need to know by tomorrow...

217
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,262
so I kind of need to say
something today.

218
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,180
Who have you been e-mailing?

219
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,429
My parents, for help
with the broker's fee.

220
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,681
- You have to pay our rent.
- I know.

221
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,103
I'll pay till the end of the lease.

222
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,899
You know, there's only
another two months anyway.

223
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,615
Are you okay with it?
I really don't want to do it if you're not.

224
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,532
- I thought we were gonna renew our lease.
- Yeah, but we never talked about it.

225
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,322
- I could've moved in with Dan.
- Not if you broke up.

226
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,700
- That's why we broke up.
- Really?

227
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,493
No.

228
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,464
It's literally on my favorite street.
Lisa said it was too good to pass up.

229
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,674
- You hate Lisa.
- She's okay.

230
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,089
- We make fun of her.
- We're both really clean.

231
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,757
I'm busy.

232
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,256
- I wish it was gonna be with you.
- Yeah.

233
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,554
- But Lisa found the place.
- Right.

234
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,435
Does this train go to DeKalb?

235
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,396
We could always look for a place
together, if you want.

236
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,774
But it's really hard
to find stuff in Tribeca.

237
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,859
I can't afford Tribeca.

238
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,482
I'm not leaving you.
I'm just moving neighborhoods.

239
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,825
What are you doing?

240
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,572
I put my ring on my thumb,
and I'm having trouble getting it off.

241
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,456
Hold your hand above your head.
It'll drain the blood out.

242
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,957
I look like
I'm asking a question.

243
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,662
Ow! Fuck! Fuck!

244
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,498
We bought the kettle
together, remember?

245
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,539
At the Mexican superstore?
Jesus!

246
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,879
Bring it back!
Or buy me another kettle!

247
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:27,537
Hi. I just - I just got a tax rebate.
Do you want to go to dinner?

248
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,076
This is me in the locker room
with the Knicks.

249
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,371
- Wow.
- Sophie said you liked basketball.

250
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,165
That was just one time.

251
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,162
Oh, crazy.

252
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,087
Oh, yeah. I was goofing around with
this vintage Triumph I think I'm gonna buy.

253
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,836
- Motorcycles are so loud.
- What?

254
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,962
You can't listen to music
when you're on a motorcycle.

255
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,964
But you're on a motorcycle.

256
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,683
- This is me with Jay Leno.
- He's such a dick.

257
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,595
I know,
but don't you just love him?

258
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
- Oh!
- No.

259
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,772
- Yes.
- No.

260
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,642
Ye- No. Yes.

261
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,769
I'm the one with the tax rebate.

262
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,522
- Can I take it?
- Uh - Uh - Uh-

263
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,190
Fine.

264
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,909
Just because you bought dinner
doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep with you.

265
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,199
I'm not trying to sleep with you.

266
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,325
- No, I was pretending to be a liberated woman.
- Oh. I got it.

267
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,794
Thanks for paying.
That was very sweet. You're a lady.

268
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,207
Sorry, but the card didn't go through.

269
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,627
- Do you have another card you want to try?
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

270
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,722
- This is a debit card.
- Only credit cards or cash.

271
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,215
<i>Okay-</i>

272
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm not a real person yet.

273
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,394
- I got it.
- No, no. No.

274
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,230
I'm just gonna go run
and get some cash.

275
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,906
<i>- Where's your ATM?
- No ATM. Not working.</i>

276
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,243
Is there an ATM that way?

277
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,408
That way? Okay.

278
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,906
All right. I'll ask her.
I'll let you know.

279
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,033
Okay, man. See you.

280
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,128
Sorry, that was Benji.
My Sophie.

281
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,209
You go to Switzerland?

282
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,628
Have I been to Switzerland?
No.

283
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,633
No. I mean, did you go to -

284
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,628
Where were you?

285
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,633
Oh, I - It took me
so long to find the -

286
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,727
What the fuck'?
You're bleeding.

287
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,971
What? Oh!

288
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,019
- I c- I can't find it.
- It's somewhere on your arm.

289
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,359
I - Oh, shit! Sorry.

290
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,228
Don't apologize to me.

291
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,481
Oh, damn it. Let me -

292
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,323
No, no. One second.

293
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,738
I'm gonna go...
use the bathroom.

294
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,702
<i>- This place is pretty awesome.
- Thank you.</i>

295
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,575
- You're welcome.
- I'm a first responder.

296
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,704
- Ah. You didn't have to do that.
- You're injured.

297
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,422
I know, but I'm fine.

298
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,884
- There.
- Like a Boy Scout.

299
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,505
Sophie makes fun of me because
I can't account for my bruises.

300
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,346
- We're not living together anymore.
- Really?

301
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,889
Yeah. I'm gonna have
to find a new place.

302
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,856
I can't afford to stay there alone.
I was thinking Washington Heights.

303
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,351
The chick in the little room
might be moving to Portland next month.

304
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,399
Oh. That's good to know.

305
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,403
You smoke inside?

306
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,152
- Yeah. Don't you?
- No.

307
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,074
- Want to?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,211
This makes me feel like
a bad mother in 1987.

309
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,080
You want to see my room?

310
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,502
Oh!

311
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,126
- Is this your family?
- Nope.

312
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,379
Yo, check it.
Vintage lenser.

313
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,311
Eh!

314
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,978
<i>Here we are.</i>

315
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,022
<i>Oh, my God. This is amazing.</i>

316
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,397
<i>- Lev? Honey, you home?
- Oh, Benji's home.</i>

317
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>So do you do it professionally?</i>

318
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,738
<i>Yes.
Well I mean, I'm an apprentice...</i>

319
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,328
<i>but it is a professional
dance company.</i>

320
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh. I love dance.
I dated a dancer in high school...

321
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,252
and her teacher said
I could've really had a future in it.

322
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,245
You liar. He's a liar.

323
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,256
No, I'm not.
Ask anyone from school.

324
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,717
No, I really love to dance.

325
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,713
It's pretty great.
I mean, it's a hard world, but -

326
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,215
<i>- Do us a dance.
-I'd feel weird.</i>

327
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,262
Come on.
Just one move.

328
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,269
Uh...

329
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>That was great.</i>

330
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,605
You should be in this music video
a friend is working on.

331
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,325
<i>- I'll hook you guys up.
- You guys are like magic.</i>

332
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,740
<i>Is Noodle Champion
still open? I'm starving.</i>

333
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,991
- I don't think so.
- All we have is - We have eggs.

334
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,243
I want something prepared...

335
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,916
and brought to me.

336
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,129
Wait.

337
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,807
- Bye. It was really good.
- I'll call ya. We'll shoot some pigeons.

338
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,272
- I'll let you know about my show.
- Yes, please.

339
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,356
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.

340
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,397
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Bye.

341
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,660
This is the best night I've had
since Sophie dumped me.

342
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,002
I should probably go.

343
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,045
Make a left out of the building,
take the first right.

344
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,170
- The F is on the other side of the bridge, on East Broadway.
- You'll see a 99-cent store.

345
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,968
Okay. Yeah.

346
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,682
I should go.

347
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,644
Is that chick really
moving to Portland?

348
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,516
- Yeah.
- Before you go, do us another dance.

349
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
<i>Okay-</i>

350
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,550
<i>I know when to go out...</i>

351
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,262
<i>or when to stay in.</i>

352
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,510
<i>Get things done.</i>

353
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,558
- What time you get in last night?
- Late. Like 1:00.

354
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,772
Why didn't you come in
and say hi?

355
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,059
I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep.

356
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,151
I wasn't asleep.
I heard you come in.

357
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,612
Then you knew
what time I got in?

358
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,321
<i>I'm working on some sample skits
for Saturday Night Live.</i>

359
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,320
A producer said I could probably
get a job writing for them.

360
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,446
- Cool.
- Such a lie.

361
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,456
- Guys, this is Nessa.
- Hey.

362
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,667
Hello. I'm Frances.

363
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,459
Lev and I were gonna make
bacon-egg bagels. You want some?

364
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,753
Oh, no. Thanks, though.
I wanted to go to the Met...

365
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,048
and I have to deposit this check
and drop off my laundry.

366
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,171
A whole Sunday planned.

367
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,344
<i>- Ever ridden on a motorcycle?
- Once.</i>

368
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,684
<i>It's an '85 Honda Shadow VT700.</i>

369
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,099
<i>- Are you impressed?
- Very. Mm-hmm.</i>

370
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,564
So why do you want
to live together?

371
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,776
Well, I met Benji
through my friend Sophie.

372
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,111
- Where is Sophie these days?
- Busy with work.

373
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,696
- Which Sophie?
- Sophie Levy.

374
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,907
Get out!
I fucked her little brother.

375
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,775
Oh, you fucked Thomas.

376
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,868
- Yeah.
- You fucked who?

377
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,866
- How do you know her?
- We went to college together, and we're the same person.

378
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,913
<i>- You're that Frances!
- But we have different hair.</i>

379
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,127
That's what we say.
Yeah, I'm that Frances.

380
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,793
- She speaks so highly of you.
- Well, we're best friends.

381
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,961
She's been to my house
for Christmas three times.

382
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,130
- Why doesn't she go to her own house?
- She's Jewish.

383
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,970
- She was saying last week she loved you.
- You saw her last week?

384
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,682
<i>- When did you fuck her brother?
- Where were you guys? - I met you last night.</i>

385
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,220
- We were at that restaurant, Po.
- Who were you fucking last week, Lev?

386
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,142
Is that a good restaurant?

387
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,858
Was she with -
Who was she with?

388
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,194
Me and Thomas and that guy
she dates, Patch.

389
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,029
- Double-date.
- And some girl. Lena?

390
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,367
- Lisa. Cunt.
- Who were you fucking last week, Frances?

391
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,578
- I make love.
- Frances: undateable.

392
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,539
- Aren't you a lot older than Sophie?
- No. We went to college together.

393
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,876
- Hmm. You seem older.
- I'm a couple months older.

394
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,745
Like, a lot older...

395
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,464
but less, like, grown up.

396
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,925
It's weird.
You have an older face.

397
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,262
But, like, you don't have
your shit together.

398
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,683
Nessa can't come from sex.
Only 69.

399
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,427
That's a crazy helmet.

400
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,271
Got to. Motorcycle law.
Can you leave that rent check?

401
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,392
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll just put it on your desk.

402
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,315
<i>- 950, right?
- Nope, 1,200.</i>

403
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,438
<i>I don't, um -</i>

404
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,531
When I moved in,
we said 950.

405
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,652
Nope. The whole space is 4,000,
but the little room's only 1,200.

406
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,407
No, she's right. We said we could pay
that much until she got more cash.

407
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,449
Remember? Because when I do
the Christmas show...

408
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,670
- I'll make more because I'll be doing ten shows a week.
- Oh, right.

409
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,212
So we're good with 950'?
That's okay? I'm really sorry.

410
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,460
No prob.

411
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,586
Catch you on the flip side.

412
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,927
<i>He leaves so easily.</i>

413
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,426
Well, transportation's his thing.

414
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,271
Bike, skateboard.
He has a car too.

415
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,186
I can't even get
out of the house on my feet.

416
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,478
You know what Virginia Woolf book
this reminds me of?

417
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,605
Frances: undateable.

418
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,988
<i>Want to watch a mo vie?</i>

419
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,079
- Now?
- Yeah. Let's do a movie afternoon.

420
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,948
I already wasted the whole day.
I already feel bad.

421
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,292
I think it's a great day.

422
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,457
I ate an egg bagel
that Lev's slut made me.

423
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,669
I Internet-acquired three pairs
of very rare Ray-Bans.

424
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,418
I'm doing awesome.

425
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,420
I thought we were both broke.

426
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,264
<i>I caved and finally took
a loan from my stepdad.</i>

427
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,056
Bastard.
I need a fucking job, though.

428
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,020
<i>- What about SNL ?
- Yeah, maybe.</i>

429
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,391
It's gone so downhill.

430
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,647
Till then, it's after 3:00.

431
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,279
I can drink.

432
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,490
<i>Let's do something fun.</i>

433
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,701
<i>- We could go to a movie.
- Movies are so expensive now.</i>

434
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,321
Yeah, but you're at the movies.

435
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,289
I should be saving
so I can pay full rent.

436
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,580
Well, I'm not gonna force you.

437
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,749
<i>I have to work out, at least.</i>

438
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,623
I cannot get fat.

439
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,759
Do I look old to you?

440
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,383
No. Yes.

441
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,351
- How old?
- Older than I am?

442
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,979
<i>- Older than 27?
- No.</i>

443
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,350
Twenty-seven is old, though.

444
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,075
<i>Isn't this place amazing?</i>

445
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,544
- Is that an Eames chair?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,546
- Isn't this great?
- Total rich-kid apartment.

447
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,709
The boys just have good eyes.
They find stuff all the time.

448
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,923
Do you know who
Lev Shapiro's dad is?

449
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,548
He doesn't get along with his dad.
Lev and Benji are artists.

450
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:40,269
Exactly. The only people who can afford
to be artists in New York are rich.

451
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,433
I'm an artist.
I'm not rich.

452
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,431
You are rare.

453
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,775
We need whiskeys.

454
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,738
It's just, this apartment
is very... aware of itself.

455
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,446
<i>Everyone who comes here loves it.
I love it.</i>

456
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,944
<i>The three of us
are hilarious together.</i>

457
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,948
<i>We're like a sitcom:
My Two Husbands.</i>

458
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,372
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you, Frances.

459
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,460
Thank you, Sophie.

460
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,414
Ladies.

461
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,711
Lev Shapiro, you know Sophie?

462
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,257
Of course.
Still beautiful.

463
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,763
- How is the publishing business?
- You know, not good.

464
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,723
How's sculpture?

465
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,968
Amazing-ng-ng.

466
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,391
Oh. My boyfriend likes
that artist you work for.

467
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,437
<i>- Tell your boyfriend he can talk to me
if he wants to buy something. - I will.</i>

468
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,310
Are we buying art now?
Is that the point we're at?

469
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,609
<i>- I need to get clean. Ladies.
- Bye.</i>

470
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,655
- Lev would totally date you.
- I have a boyfriend.

471
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,619
But isn't he charming
and so handsome?

472
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,489
You could be over here all the time.
it would be great.

473
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,242
Then you wouldn't have to spend
all that time with Lisa.

474
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,167
<i>- Right. I could fuck him just to not hang outwith Lisa.</i>

475
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,462
Don't mind me.
I'm just trying to get your attention.

476
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,507
How could you not want to date him?
He's kind of magic.

477
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,850
Because I'm with Patch.

478
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,304
Patch is the kind of guy...

479
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,648
who buys
a black leather couch...

480
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,150
and is like, “I love it.”

481
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,904
- What are we doing with our day?
- I got to get going around 5:00.

482
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,524
- I thought we were hanging out.
- We are.

483
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,403
- All day.
- I have plans with Patch tonight. I told you.

484
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,077
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I texted that to you.

485
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

486
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,418
- Here.
- We're not doing that.

487
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,754
That's shitty.
It's not court.

488
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,420
- I did text you, though.
- I believe you.

489
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,841
- You don't have to believe me. I did text you.
- Want to see my room?

490
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,340
I kind of have a crush on this boy,
but his name is Georgie...

491
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,934
so I don't really know
how far it's gonna go.

492
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,931
- Can't fuck a Georgie.
- “I want you inside me, Georgie."

493
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,433
- Have you been dating anyone?
- Nope.

494
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,480
- Oh, Frances.
- It's fine.

495
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,605
- What about Benji?
- Benji thinks I'm undateable.

496
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:59,199
It's really funny when he does it.
You and I are both undateable.

497
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,611
Guys can't handle us.
We're gonna end up spinsters.

498
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,363
You better break that to Patch.

499
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,162
Boys are easier.
Girls are passive-aggressive.

500
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,161
Boys are just like,
"Clean up your shit."

501
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,162
You're still messy.

502
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,007
I've been busy.

503
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,879
No, it wasn't a criticism.
I meant it as a nice thing.

504
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:24,141
You will always be messy, and you will always
look at yourself too much in the mirror.

505
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,182
- When did I look at myself in the mirror?
- Always. You just were doing it.

506
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,556
There are so many mirrors
in this apartment.

507
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,557
I don't want you to change.

508
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,982
I like your clothes everywhere
and your mirror thing. It's sweet.

509
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,652
- You have stuff too.
- What?

510
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,150
<i>You judge people who aren't
as moderate as you are.</i>

511
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,902
- I do not.
- You do, and you don't read.

512
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:48,533
- Hey, bitches!
- Benji! You're crazy!

513
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,081
<i>- Want to see my room?
- Sure.</i>

514
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,800
- Hey, guys, this is Lindsay.
- Hi.

515
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,560
I wish we had cookies.

516
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,435
I wish we had Chessmen.

517
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,097
- Good show tonight.
- You too.

518
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,566
- You were beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

519
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,356
<i>- Hey.
- Hi. Sorry.</i>

520
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,606
I'm so slow.
I have trouble leaving places.

521
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,277
You were great tonight.

522
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,571
Thanks.

523
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,535
<i>Frances,
I wanted to tell you...</i>

524
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,030
<i>so you would have
some days to process it:</i>

525
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,453
We won't be able to use you
in the Christmas show.

526
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,747
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

527
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,415
What?

528
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,541
<i>- I'm really sorry. You know what bad
shape the company's in.
- I know.</i>

529
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,134
We can talk about next steps
when we're back in February.

530
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,888
- Am I fired?
- No.

531
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,302
I just- I like you...

532
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,848
and I want to talk about the future
and make sure it's what you want.

533
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,438
<i>- I want to be in the company.
- I know.</i>

534
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,058
Take your time.

535
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,311
I will.
I can't help it.

536
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,663
Oh, my love!
I'm so glad you're here!

537
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,502
You were great.
Really great.

538
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,589
- Could you see me?
- We were in the risers, so we could see to the back.

539
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,050
- Who?
- Sorry. Had to take a leak.

540
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,590
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

541
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,179
Shall we all go out
for a quick drink?

542
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,516
“A quick drink”?

543
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,558
- Yeah, we have to get up early tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's Saturday.

544
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,523
We have to catch a flight. We're
meeting my parents in the Galapagos.

545
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,065
I haven't packed yet.
You know me.

546
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,904
- Last-minute Mabel.
- Ronald Rule-follower.

547
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,367
I want us to be family,
you know?

548
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,120
I can be part of your family,
don't you think?

549
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,839
Patch, I love you -
I want to love you -

550
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,799
but I need you to get drunk.

551
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,714
<i>- How are we doing?
- Really good.</i>

552
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,931
We'll get a bottle of your most
expensive vodka for the table...

553
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,638
and then all of the stuff
that comes with it.

554
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,305
Very good.

555
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,722
- Sophie.
- Yes?

556
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,975
<i>- Come with me.
- Where? - Bathroom.</i>

557
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,193
Really?
We're still doing this?

558
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,813
Patch, you got this,
money-wise?

559
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,439
Yep.

560
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,991
I was lying.
I don't love Patch.

561
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,955
- I do love him.
- Since when? When did this happen?

562
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,368
- It's been happening.
- That's fucking bullshit. Come on!

563
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,871
No, you're bullshit. And you're
making me feel really bad right now.

564
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,876
- I want to love him if you love
him, but you don't love him. - I do.

565
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,128
Sophie, I fucking held your head
while you cried.

566
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,301
I bought special milk for you.
I know where you hide your pills.

567
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,057
Don't treat me like
a three-hour-brunch friend!

568
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,802
I'm not talking to you
while you're like this.

569
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,394
<i>- We have to go.
- I'm going.</i>

570
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,142
- We can stay if you want.
- Come on, get your stuff.

571
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,736
I'm going.
You fucking sit down!

572
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,865
Enjoy the Galapagos.

573
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,906
I'm also going on vacation.
A long one.

574
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,450
<i>I'll set up my e-mail
so it sends out a vacation e-mail.</i>

575
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,199
<i>My voice mail will also say
I'm on vacation...</i>

576
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,998
so if you get that, don't worry -
I'm on vacation.

577
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,292
I'll try to give you a call
when I get back. Thanks, guys.

578
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,336
This was great.

579
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,435
- You're cleaning?
- I'm not messy. I'm busy.

580
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,641
I don't make the bed.
Sophie always made the bed.

581
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,111
I'm so happy you're home.
I had such a shitty night.

582
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,230
Tsk. Oh, sorry, kid.

583
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,201
I had a great night. I cracked the
second act of my script. I'm on page 68.

584
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,571
Oh, that's exciting.
Is it for SNL?

585
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,701
No, this is a sample script
I'm writing for the third Gremlins.

586
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,294
- Boy trouble tonight?
- Sophie trouble.

587
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,381
- Undateable.
- And I kind of-

588
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,043
I - I-l got temporarily fired.

589
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,716
I've been fired a million times.
Makes you cool.

590
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,340
Yeah, but if I don't have
the Christmas show...

591
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,717
I can't... pay rent.

592
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,099
Do you have any tunes?

593
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,393
Wait right there.

594
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,990
It's a jammer.

595
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,293
- It's great.
- I know.

596
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,421
- I love it. Put it on my mix.
- Aren't these headphones tits?

597
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,306
I just got 'em. They're super-duper
noise-canceling...

598
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,517
so I don't have
to hear Lev fuck.

599
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,768
- Oh, no.
- All right.

600
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,401
Lev and I were talking about getting
a maid to come once a week.

601
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,944
<i>- A maid?
- Yeah, it's not that expensive.</i>

602
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,405
<i>It's like 400 bucks a month.</i>

603
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,076
Do you know
I'm actually poor?

604
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,870
You aren't poor.

605
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,288
There are poor people.
You aren't one of them.

606
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,333
You'd feel poor if you had
as little money as I do.

607
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,628
But you're not poor.
That's offensive to actual poor people.

608
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,423
Yeah, I guess that's true.

609
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,295
You want -

610
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,635
- You want to hear something hilarious?
- Yes.

611
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,475
Lev thinks we're gonna
end up married.

612
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,469
I'm too tall to marry.

613
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,559
You are.

614
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,808
That's so funny.
Why does he think that?

615
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,312
Well, I did want to sleep with you
when I first met you.

616
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,651
But now - totally undateable.

617
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:39,822
I guess we are like a married couple
in a way. We talk. We don't have sex.

618
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,407
Yeah, we get along super well.

619
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,748
Sophie and I were like that too.

620
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,912
Right, but Sophie's a girl...

621
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,456
and you're both straight,
so it had less, like...

622
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,375
real-world probability.

623
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,248
Right. Well -

624
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,501
Okay. I'm done.

625
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,304
I hope I don't have the spins
when I lie down.

626
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,800
Just lay on your back
by the edge of the bed...

627
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,724
and put one foot on the floor.

628
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,518
It helps.

629
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,194
Good night, then.

630
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,733
Good night.

631
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,825
- Good luck with Gremlins.
- Three.

632
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,909
Open? Shut?

633
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,778
Shut, I guess.

634
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,997
<i>- I don't know. Does it matter?
- I'll leave it open...</i>

635
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,744
so if you need to throw up or cry
or something, you can call me.

636
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,711
<i>Thanks, yeah. Open.</i>

637
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,245
<i>Welcome
to Sacramento International Airport...</i>

638
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,246
<i>gate way to Northern California.</i>

639
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,999
- Hi!
- Hi, honey. So glad you're home.

640
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,923
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Rosie!

641
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,607
- People are lamenting being 28, Chris?
- I know. I can't handle it.

642
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,939
Bacon.
Bacon like it was chips.

643
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,280
<i>I'll send it. I didn't want
to load you down with photos.</i>

644
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,498
- I like this picture.
- I'll send it to you.

645
00:40:56,037 --> 00:41:00,588
I love - I love that trumpet!

646
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,681
Integrity and acceptance.

647
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,683
Integrity and acceptance.

648
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
We seek spiritual growth.

649
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,859
<i>- Intellectual stimulation.
- Intellectual stimulation.</i>

650
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,324
It's kind of far away from her.
There aren't any trains.

651
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,863
What about subways?

652
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,329
Look, look.
These - These look good.

653
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,494
- Okay.
- Look at those legs.

654
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,241
Does that hurt?

655
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,870
- Nope, you're numb. Won't feel a thing.
- Will it hurt when I'm not numb?

656
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,059
<i>Frances ?</i>

657
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,970
I'm in here.

658
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,099
<i>Come on, honey.
I really, really need to get in there.</i>

659
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,648
<i>- I'll be out in a second.
- Frances, how much longer?</i>

660
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,994
- Are these new cutting boards?
- Mm-hmm.

661
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,785
As soon as I found red ones,
there I was.

662
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,750
- We have to make -
- More tamales.

663
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,872
- I can't believe Mom gave our tamales away.
- Well, Mom, you know -

664
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,717
- What's this one? Did I make this?
- You made that.

665
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,258
Oh, here's the green ballerina.
This is the one.

666
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,803
- The green ballerina? - You were the green girls
- Chandra and her mother.

667
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,599
Right. Yeah, that was our level.
We were level green.

668
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,272
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye, honey.

669
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,820
<i>- It was a great trip.
- Yeah, I'll call you...</i>

670
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,786
as soon as I'm back
in New York. Bye.

671
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,789
Bye.

672
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,811
- Ahoy, sexy!
- Oh, hey.

673
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,144
Stop thanking me.

674
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,314
It just means a lot,
letting me stay with you.

675
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,484
I want you to know, you are
definitely getting a thank-you note.

676
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,243
Don't worry.

677
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,614
Hey, have you ever done
where you, like, play fight?

678
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,491
- Why?
- Because it's funny. To be funny.

679
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,161
- I don't want to.
- It's super fun.

680
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,001
Um, so just come at me.

681
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,336
No.

682
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,045
Okay, well, then, I'll just -

683
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,511
Stop it! Damn it!

684
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,512
Sorry.
You have to fight back.

685
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,298
Stop it! I said stop!

686
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,346
Oh. S-Sorry.

687
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,304
Thank you so much.

688
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,023
Oh, my God.
He's the most beautiful creature.

689
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,190
He's in the 90 percentile
for height and 95 for weight.

690
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,440
But it evens out later, when they walk.
It doesn't mean he'll be fat.

691
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,656
<i>No!</i>

692
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,494
- Eh, you're getting a phone call.
- Oh.

693
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,990
It's so funny when people
have kids, and they're all...

694
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,994
“I used to be so focused on me,
and now I'm totally not.” it's like, no.

695
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,998
It's still you. It's half you.
it's a mini-you.

696
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,716
I mean, you made it.

697
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,547
<i>- I forgot to eat today.
- The only time you hear the phrase...</i>

698
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,096
“I'm not here to make friends”
is on reality television.

699
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,137
- Oh! Sorry.
- It's okay.

700
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,516
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm trying to not drink right now.

701
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,393
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

702
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,270
You're not the one
who's bat-shit crazy after four vodkas.

703
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,399
<i>Janelle had a hard time
giving it up when she was pregnant.</i>

704
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,694
I did, yeah.
I totally understand.

705
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,912
What do you do?

706
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:44,247
- What? - What do you do? It's such a
stupid question, I thought I'd ask it.

707
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,752
Oh, no. I'm - I'm a lawyer.

708
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,339
- What do you do?
- That's such a stupid question.

709
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,086
Just kidding.
Um, it's kind of hard to explain.

710
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,339
Because what you do
is complicated?

711
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,591
Uh, because I don't really do it.

712
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,304
- I am a dancer, I guess.
- Mm.

713
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,477
Frances and I
are in the same company.

714
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,851
But Rachel's in the main company.
I'm an apprentice.

715
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:14,072
Hopefully the touring company soon.
I have a meeting with Colleen on Monday.

716
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,190
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

717
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,568
But things are really great.

718
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,946
Rachel and I have
a really cool apartment.

719
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,745
Or Rachel does,
and I'm staying there for six-ish weeks.

720
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,959
- Five.
- Right. Five. Yeah.

721
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,999
But everything's
up in the air right now.

722
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,919
I like being alone.

723
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,087
- I just got back from Sacramento.
- Oh!

724
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,836
Oh, Andy and Janelle
just got back from Paris.

725
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,635
Six and a half hours
on a plane with a baby.

726
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,429
Won't be doing that again soon.
But it was heaven.

727
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,644
Do you ever get to Paris?

728
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,309
Uh, no, not really.
Kind of, once.

729
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,065
Actually, no.
What's that museum...

730
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,059
with the escalators and tubes?

731
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,652
- The Pompidou.
- Yeah!

732
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,646
They have this great place
in the Sixth.

733
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,692
- Oh, it's a little pied-a-terre.
- Literally?

734
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,818
Yeah, but it's
a really special place.

735
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,829
Yeah, it's just so hard
to get to spend any time there...

736
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,457
since I got the job at the Journal...
and the baby.

737
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:10,454
I'd love to go to Paris.
I'll bet it's magic.

738
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,455
Uh, my friend
from college, Abby...

739
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,459
who moved there with her boyfriend
because he works at a bank...

740
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,213
in college, she was one
of the top five group of friends...

741
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,807
but then Zoe became closer
to the group and Abby moved...

742
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,470
to the outer circle.

743
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,936
Sophie and Abby
never totally got along...

744
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,600
<i>and then she started
dating Paul...</i>

745
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,224
who I always thought
would've dated any of us...

746
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,727
but... he ended up with Abby.

747
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,281
Well, if you're ever there...

748
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,867
- we like for it to be used.
- Yeah.

749
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,950
I don't see myself
getting there super soon...

750
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,699
but... thanks, thanks.

751
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,246
That is a very sexy dress.

752
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,329
Fuck, I sound
like a gay grandmother.

753
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,583
Frances, I think you know
one of my colleagues at Goldman -

754
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,630
Reade “Patch” Krause.

755
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,721
Yeah, I know Patch.
“'Sup, brah?”

756
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,007
That's him.
Nobody is better...

757
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,600
at anticipating inflection points
than Patchy.

758
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,438
His girlfriend, Sophie, and I
are the same person with different hair.

759
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,683
Not really.
We went to college together...

760
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:17,733
and we used to take the train into the
city on weekends and make bad decisions.

761
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,276
- You got pregnant?
- What? No.

762
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,992
She's a great lady.
I really like her. So smart.

763
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,737
Yeah. I mean - Yeah.

764
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,746
I mean, we're all smart.

765
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,366
Yeah, but she's...
book-smart smart.

766
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,710
She's actually not.
She doesn't really read...

767
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,955
except for work,
which is the funny thing.

768
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,548
She seems like
she reads a lot to me.

769
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,259
- I read way more.
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:44,347
I don't know why I'm shit-talking Sophie.
She's basically the best person I know.

771
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,927
- It's kind of crazy though, right?
- Mm, yeah.

772
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,395
- Which part?
- Japan.

773
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,105
Japan?

774
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,522
Yeah, they're moving to Japan
in a couple of weeks.

775
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,696
- Wait. What?
- Patch got transferred.

776
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,441
<i>it's a really cool position.
He's gonna be...</i>

777
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,781
<i>the director of research
for all the Asian markets.</i>

778
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,825
For how long?

779
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,948
<i>Indefinitely.</i>

780
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,246
But Sophie has a job
at Random House.

781
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,914
She quit.

782
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,457
Oh.

783
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,207
<i>The Pilates thing is nice.
You feel so good.</i>

784
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,050
<i>Frances and I do
a lot of yoga. It"s good for dance.</i>

785
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,092
<i>It's fun to go with somebody,
to have a friend to go with.</i>

786
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,682
I think I'm better-looking
than I am in pictures.

787
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,426
<i>Nadia ?</i>

788
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,929
I want this one moment.

789
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,600
It's - it's what I want
in a relationship...

790
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,979
which might explain
why I am single now. Ha, ha.

791
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,105
It's, uh -

792
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,779
It's kind of hard lo -

793
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:50,322
it's that thing
when you're with someone...

794
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,824
and you love them
and they know it...

795
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,834
and they love you
and you know it...

796
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,999
but it's a party...

797
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,836
and you're both talking
to other people...

798
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,296
and you're laughing
and shining...

799
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,340
and you look across the room...

800
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,555
and catch each other's eyes...

801
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,345
but - but not because
you're possessive...

802
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,686
or it's precisely sexual...

803
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,687
but because...

804
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,645
that is your person
in this life.

805
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,236
<i>And ifs funny and sad,
but only because...</i>

806
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:26,153
this life will end,
and it's this secret world...

807
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,241
that exists right there...

808
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,454
in public, unnoticed,
that no one else knows about.

809
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,034
It's sort of like how they say
that other dimensions exist...

810
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,750
all around us, but we don't have
the ability to perceive them.

811
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,507
That's -

812
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,878
That's what I want
out of a relationship.

813
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,639
Or just life, I guess.

814
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,383
Love.

815
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,268
I sound stoned.

816
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,400
I'm not stoned.

817
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,028
Thanks for dinner. Bye.

818
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,364
Oh. Bye.

819
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,404
<i>Where the fuck are you going?</i>

820
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,950
I'm kinda wasted.
I was gonna go home. Is that okay?

821
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,868
I don't care.
I was just kidding.

822
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,243
- Thanks so much for having me tonight.
- Nice to have met you.

823
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,795
Good luck, Frances.

824
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,752
You're leaving.

825
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,588
Actually, Andy...

826
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,633
I think I might be going
to Paris this weekend.

827
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,505
Really?

828
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,385
Oh. D-Do you want to stay
in our apartment?

829
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,806
Yes.

830
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,180
- Fantastic.
- Okay.

831
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,933
That's wonderful.
I'll get you the information.

832
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,027
- Wonderful.
- Great.

833
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,161
<i>Frances!</i>

834
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,121
- Benji!
- Hey!

835
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,750
I knew it was you.
I could tell by your weird man walk.

836
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,244
- A beard!
- Yeah.

837
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,745
- Hello.
- This is Caroline.

838
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,588
I'm Caroline.

839
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,049
How are the dances, Frances?

840
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,046
- Frances and I used to be married.
- What are you guys doing? You want to get a drink?

841
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,548
We're going to my friend's party.
it's a house party.

842
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,300
- I mean, that's the theme.
- How's that a theme?

843
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,679
- Amazing, right?
- And it's in an apartment.

844
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,226
- You can come if you want.
- No, I really -

845
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,942
I shouldn't.
I'm going to Paris for two days.

846
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,857
- What?
- Why so short?

847
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,321
I have a meeting
with Colleen on Monday.

848
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,907
- I don't know you.
- Wait, I thought you were poor.

849
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,618
I'm gonna use this credit card
I got in the mail.

850
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,113
That's not smart.
They want to keep you in debt.

851
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,831
I know that.
I see documentaries.

852
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,497
Good for you, kid.
I lived there for a year.

853
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,880
- You never told me that.
- Yep. I was there when Serge Gainsbourg died.

854
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,421
- It was a crazy time.
- Weren't you, like, eight?

855
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:53,011
- Yeah, it was the end of Euro-disco.
- I have so much to do.

856
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,093
I think I'll probably read Proust...

857
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,639
because sometimes it's good to do what
you're supposed to when you're supposed to.

858
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,386
Proust is pretty heavy.

859
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,606
- It's worth it, I hear.
- I meant the book - carrying it on the plane.

860
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,100
I should probably
learn French first...

861
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,478
and then read it in French.

862
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,946
Undateable.

863
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,280
Well, kid, we've gotta run.

864
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:19,281
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, you too. You're very pretty.

865
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,500
- Thank you.
- See you around, weirdo.

866
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,227
Hey, Abby, it's Frances.
I just got in.

867
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,446
Uh, I'm going to this...

868
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,567
free apartment of this dude.

869
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,910
Right now
I'm gonna get some sleep...

870
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,241
uh, but call me.

871
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,332
I'll be around all tomorrow.
I'd love to see you and Paul.

872
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,921
Oh, shit.

873
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,819
<i>Hey, Abby,
ifs Frances again.</i>

874
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,615
Do you guys want to meet for dinner?
I can meet you anywhere.

875
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,955
I'll be the girl with the acne
holding more acne.

876
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,334
<i>- Hello?
- Frances ?</i>

877
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,588
Sophie!
Oh, my God! Hi! Hi!

878
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,431
- Hi.
- Hi.

879
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:10,390
I called you to tell you
I'm moving to Japan with Patch.

880
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,979
Is that good?
Are you excited?

881
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,144
<i>I know things are weird
between us, but...</i>

882
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,609
we're having a kind
of going-away party tonight...

883
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,400
and I wanted to say
you're invited.

884
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,022
I'm -

885
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,617
<i>- I can't.
- You don't have to lie.</i>

886
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,699
I'm not lying.
I'm really not.

887
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,161
<i>- That's awesome about Japan.
- It's crazy.</i>

888
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,876
Last week Patch's boss
called Patch into his office...

889
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,961
and was like,
“Japan, bitch.”

890
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,917
I wish I could come tonight.

891
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,964
<i>Me too.</i>

892
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:47,135
- We could get dinner next week.
- Why now? No, I want to...

893
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,345
but Patch's grandfather
is real sick...

894
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,265
and we're all going to Chicago
for these special treatments.

895
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,684
<i>Being sick when you're rich
is totally awesome.</i>

896
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,603
<i>They replace all his cells
or something.</i>

897
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,693
We'll be back to New York a lot.
We'll just be based in Tokyo.

898
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,984
- You'll learn Japanese.
- We can videochat.
Twenty-first century. What up?

899
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,279
- My computer doesn't have that.
- New places are good for you.

900
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,903
<i>- Yeah.
- You should travel, Fran.</i>

901
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,745
I am. I will.

902
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,489
I'm going to.

903
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,626
I'm really happy for you.
I just -

904
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,996
<i>No, you know What?
I'm just really happy for you.</i>

905
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,090
- We're gonna have a blog.
- Together?

906
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,800
Yeah. Barf.

907
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,261
We'll upload pictures
and stories and stuff.

908
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,598
<i>I'm so sorry I missed
your Christmas show.</i>

909
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:33,060
<i>- I guess I was mad.
- I didn't -</i>

910
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,144
I wasn't so good anyway.

911
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,356
<i>How's all that going?</i>

912
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,190
Good. Great.

913
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,186
I'm meeting on Monday
with Colleen to talk about stuff.

914
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,029
You'll finally be in the company?
For real?

915
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,782
<i>Yeah. I'll probably
be touring, though.</i>

916
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,901
That's so great, Fran.

917
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,449
Yeah, it is.

918
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,449
<i>Where are you living? I heard
you're not with the boys anymore.</i>

919
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:57,577
<i>Hey, do you want to live
in our apartment while we're in Japan ?</i>

920
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,624
No, I- No.

921
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,839
I'm gonna have
my own place real soon.

922
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,582
Maybe one day
I'll stay with you.

923
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,175
Maybe.

924
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,921
I should go.
Thanks for calling.

925
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:12,300
<i>I'm - I'm sor- I'm sorry too.</i>

926
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,394
<i>- Apology accepted.
- Don't be a dick about it.
- I wasn't.</i>

927
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,140
<i>- This phone call's costing me a fortune.
- Why?</i>

928
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,062
Just kidding. It's not.

929
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,603
<i>Hey, Is Abby in Paris night now,
do you know?</i>

930
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,323
<i>- I think so.
- Okay.</i>

931
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,320
- You sound really good, Frances.
- I am.

932
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,287
I am really good.

933
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,870
Thank you for calling.
I'm going to say something now...

934
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:45,591
but I don't want you to feel obligated to say
anything back, so I'm gonna hang up right away.

935
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,717
I love you, Sophie. Bye.

936
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:56,018
Hello. When did
Puss in Boots start?

937
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,400
<i>Hi, Frances.
Honey, we just got your messages.</i>

938
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,694
<i>I don't know why
they didn't come through before.</i>

939
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,863
<i>We're here.
We'd love to see you.</i>

940
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,657
<i>This is so wild.</i>

941
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,867
<i>You remember Gerard,
Nicolas' brother?</i>

942
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,161
<i>The one who looks like
Jean-Pierre Léaud?</i>

943
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,452
<i>Well, he's divorced now,
and hes staying with us.</i>

944
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,581
<i>I think you'd really like him.
Come to dinner tonight.</i>

945
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,003
<i>He'll be there,
as well as a philosopher...</i>

946
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,168
<i>and a painter couple
who are really great.</i>

947
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,553
<i>Oh! This is such good timing.</i>

948
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,683
Hey, you. Come on in.

949
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,102
<i>- Rachel said you were in Paris.
- I was.</i>

950
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,818
- Back so soon?
- Well, we had this meeting.

951
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,313
<i>We could've moved it.
I mean, I almost canceled it...</i>

952
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,190
myself this morning.

953
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,989
I woke up with this tickle
in my throat.

954
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,579
Listen, do you want
to take over Nancy's position?

955
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,451
- Nancy, who works in the office?
- She 3 pregnant.

956
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:47,170
Oh. No, I don't.
Who told you that?

957
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,210
No, I'm asking you.

958
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,670
I assumed you're not
keeping on with the company.

959
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:55,466
<i>- You don't want to be an apprentice for life.
- Nope.</i>

960
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,681
You should think about putting
your own stuff together.

961
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,142
- Like how?
- Like, your own work.

962
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,853
Oh, no. I kind of
gave that up after college.

963
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,018
Plus, that was basically like...

964
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,267
cheerleaders
doing my choreography.

965
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,487
<i>- I always liked the stuff you did, even for the kids.
- Yeah?</i>

966
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,900
You really should think
about taking Nancy's position.

967
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,697
It's not a lot of money,
but it's enough to keep you going.

968
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,448
- Why would I do that?
- It's just a good day job...

969
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,747
while you figure out whether
you want to choreograph.

970
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:30,122
- You say it like it's easy.
- No, it's not easy.

971
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,215
But if you work here,
you can use the studio space.

972
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,050
No.

973
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,797
I'll get something else.
I'm really close to getting something.

974
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,471
- A job?
- Yeah. Dancing. I'm still
gonna be a dancer. Just not here.

975
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,266
Wow! Well, good for you.
That's great.

976
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,105
<i>I know.</i>

977
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,982
Well, good luck to you,
Frances.

978
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,148
Yeah.
Good luck to you too.

979
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,155
<i>- Hi Mom.
- Hi honey.</i>

980
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,995
<i>- H1i Mom.
- Tom, pick up the other phone.</i>

981
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,786
<i>- How is it up there?
- Good. Good.</i>

982
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,624
<i>I I'm dancing, kind of</i>

983
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,745
<i>I get to live in a dorm
I didn't live in, which is fun.</i>

984
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,090
<i>- All the RAs live in dorms.
- Not the one in the living room. The battery is dead.</i>

985
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,086
<i>- Is it strange to be back?
- It's nice.</i>

986
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,804
It's so empty in summer.

987
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:24,518
It's weird. It's like I went back to college, but
everyone was a dancer and not a semiotics major.

988
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,104
<i>- That must be fun for you, though.
- And now I'm one of the adults.</i>

989
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,815
- I keep thinking I'm gonna run into Sophie.
- Hi, honey.

990
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,820
<i>I got a picture of Sophie
and Patch in the largest dog park in Japan.</i>

991
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,315
<i>- I think I'd like that.
- I got a picture of them at a porn> mall.</i>

992
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,984
<i>- Do you have enough money?
- Yeah. I mean...</i>

993
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,828
I'm still in debt from Paris.
That was just stupid.

994
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,620
<i>- I'm sorry we can't help you out.
- You help out so much.</i>

995
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,415
I'll be okay. They pay me extra
to work the events.

996
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,585
<i>- Oh, you aren't a good waitress.
- It's not waitressing. It's like pouring for donors.</i>

997
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,676
<i>- Are you choreographing?
- Tom, we went over this.</i>

998
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,178
At least you can't spend
money in nature.

999
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,844
<i>- Where are you right now?
- Nature.</i>

1000
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:08,645
We don't have to, like,
guide them personally, do we?

1001
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,606
We just have to make sure
they don't fuck or die.

1002
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,773
- Ah, good, because I'm having a Walden's Pond moment.
- You have a pond?

1003
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,192
I found something out
about Walden's Pond:

1004
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,782
It was five minutes
from his mom's house.

1005
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,118
He used to go over there
and get supplies.

1006
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,202
- So where are you?
- Here.

1007
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,866
- No, where do you go to college?
- I don't. I'm not -

1008
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,620
I'm done with college.
But I went here when I was younger.

1009
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:36,419
Weird. For some reason, I thought
you had to be in college to do this.

1010
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,917
Nope. I just wanted
to get out of the city...

1011
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,421
and I knew the director of the summer
program, so she hooked it up.

1012
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,345
They had room and board. I'm working
the events to make more money.

1013
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,844
- You're super responsible.
- No, I'm not.

1014
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,562
It wasn't that long ago
that I went here. I'm only 27.

1015
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,738
- Are you with the program?
- Yes, I'm assisting.

1016
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,577
- Great. So you're a teacher.
- No, I'm not.

1017
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:10,119
- I'm an RA, but I'm also a dancer.
- I'm so sorry.

1018
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,993
- For what?
- Resident assistants can't take class.

1019
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,416
But I'm -
I'm not just an RA.

1020
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,001
I'm so sorry.
I don't make the rules.

1021
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:21,423
- I'm a dancer, and I went here.
- Sorry. I have to start class.

1022
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,225
You're a really good waitress.

1023
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,647
I'm not a waitress.
I just pour.

1024
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:49,788
- You were supposed to be on duty ten minutes ago. Shh!
- I'm sorry. I -

1025
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,642
Are you okay?

1026
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,433
Yeah.

1027
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,065
I'm just gonna sit here, okay?

1028
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,991
You don't have to do that.

1029
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,996
I'm just going to, though.

1030
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,014
Are you gonna
study abroad there?

1031
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,225
Oh, no.
I'm not a student.

1032
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,690
There's no more “abroad.”

1033
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,150
I'm half Japanese.

1034
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,861
My best friend
kind of lives there now.

1035
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,522
Are you done?

1036
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,659
Ma'am, you can't smoke here.

1037
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,707
- Oh, sorry.
- No, don't throw it!

1038
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,046
Goddamn it!

1039
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,756
Famous, how?

1040
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,422
<i>She's a senator
or a congress woman or something.</i>

1041
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,296
- She's important.
- I should read the news more.

1042
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,843
Your job tonight
is to follow her.

1043
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:36,061
Just make sure she's taken care of. She
just gave a ton of money to the school.

1044
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,063
So you don't leave
until she leaves. Got it?

1045
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,649
When I went here,
it was all girls.

1046
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:45,236
To meet a boy, we had to take
the fuck truck to Hoboken.

1047
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,864
You went here? Excuse me.
You went to here?

1048
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:51,155
- Yes.
- Oh, my God. That makes so much sense.

1049
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,029
I knew you looked familiar.
You were on the freakin' brochure.

1050
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,656
- I'm Frances. I went here.
- Nice to meet you, Frances.

1051
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,251
You too. Sorry, sorry.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

1052
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,416
- I'm pouring.
- Ah, yes.

1053
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,878
You're very inspiring.

1054
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,468
Actually,
the endowment has grown.

1055
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:12,510
Oh, you look so lonely.
I'll see you later, Karen.

1056
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,930
<i>You look like a painting:
The Lonely Boy.</i>

1057
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,765
I'm actually a painter.

1058
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,474
- You're kidding.
- No.

1059
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,224
What kind of painter are you?

1060
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,521
<i>You don't care.</i>

1061
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,895
- You hate me!
- I don't hate you. I love you.

1062
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,149
You bought the cheapest
auction thing. The cheapest!

1063
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,946
<i>I didn't even go here!</i>

1064
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,286
You gave a great speech.

1065
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:46,460
I seriously can't believe you're an
independent, because that's bullshit.

1066
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,504
Sorry.
Sophie, let's go.

1067
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,799
I went here. I thought you were great.
I made him give money.

1068
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,637
<i>Good. Nice to meet you.</i>

1069
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,474
We live in Japan,
so it's, like, crazy we're here.

1070
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,185
That's wonderful you came
all the way back for the auction.

1071
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,681
I wish. No, we're in New York
for a funeral. His grandpa.

1072
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,435
<i>- I wanted to come here. He
drove, but it was my idea. - Ah.</i>

1073
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,527
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- It's okay.

1074
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,865
- His grandpa had a psycho family in Germany.
- Sophie, let's go.

1075
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,609
I loved meeting you.
A real honor.

1076
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,907
This douche is my affianced.

1077
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,780
- Ah.
- We're engaged.

1078
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,158
You're engaged?

1079
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,539
It's not... “engaged” engaged.

1080
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,504
Right. What?

1081
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,712
We're back for a funeral. I would've called,
but you were touring with the company.

1082
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,302
Yeah, right, I was,
but I needed a break...

1083
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,263
and I thought
it would be so funny...

1084
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,850
to come back to the college
for the summer.

1085
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,684
It is funny.
In a great way.

1086
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:44,306
And, yeah, just making
extra money doing this kind of gig.

1087
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,432
Yeah.

1088
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,685
What a slut!

1089
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,106
- Are you okay? Do you need some food?
- I'll just eat this.

1090
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,527
- I really didn't expect to see you.
- Ditto.

1091
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:01,498
It's almost hard to be happy about it,
because I didn't have time to anticipate it.

1092
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,491
Want to get out of here?

1093
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,163
I can't.

1094
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,207
I have to shadow
this woman.

1095
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,549
She's my ward.

1096
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,465
<i>- I want to drive.
- No, you're too fucked up.</i>

1097
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,213
<i>- You're fucked up.
- No, I'm not. I drank fucking Perrier.</i>

1098
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,055
<i>I'm not going beck to New York.
I don't want to go to the funeral tomorrow.</i>

1099
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,894
- You have to go!
- I'm hanging outwith Frances. We're going to the mall.

1100
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,306
- No, we're not.
- I'm bringing Frances to the funeral.

1101
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:27,899
I don't want to go.

1102
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,435
You didn't even know your grandpa.
You didn't hang out.

1103
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,779
It's a funeral. It doesn't matter.
Get in the car!

1104
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,398
If you're so broken up,
why did we go to the auction?

1105
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,617
- You made me go!
- I don't want you here!

1106
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:41,238
You were wasted!
And I wasn't going to let you drive.

1107
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,490
- Goddamn it, Sophie!
- Frances, what do you think?

1108
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,082
- About what?
- You don't need to answer.

1109
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,952
- How sad were you really when your grandpa died?
- Pretty sad.

1110
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:52,048
I wasn't, and I don't see why you should be.
Your grandpa was a cheating Nazi!

1111
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,167
He was not a Nazi!

1112
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,756
Take your feet off the dash!
Frances, where do you live?

1113
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,594
- Chuggins.
- Is that a dorm?

1114
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,431
- Yes.
- How the fuck do you get to Chuggins?

1115
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,654
Oh, this is me, right up here.

1116
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,196
My dorm.

1117
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,283
Chuggins.
We never lived in this dorm.

1118
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,871
I know.
It's like the life I never had.

1119
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,493
Anyway...

1120
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,620
congratulations
on your engagement.

1121
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,463
And sorry for your loss.

1122
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,503
You are so fucking selfish.

1123
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,252
- Good night, Frances.
- Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.

1124
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,346
- She's my friend. She doesn't even like you.
- I like you.

1125
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,465
I like you too, Frances.

1126
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,951
Hey. Hey, come in.

1127
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,447
<i>- Can I stay?
- Of course.</i>

1128
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,824
Come. Stay.

1129
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,917
It's made in the microwave,
but it's good.

1130
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,090
Thank you.

1131
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,259
I hope it's okay
I borrow loungewear.

1132
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,054
- Of course.
- I think I'm gonna -

1133
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,927
Oh! Okay, okay.
Here. Shit.

1134
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,857
I'm sorry I was so drunk
I threw up.

1135
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,189
I'm sorry I live in a dorm...

1136
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,196
and have a single bed.

1137
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:43,443
Here. You lay on the outside.

1138
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,912
Okay.

1139
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,658
Lay on your back
and put one foot on the floor.

1140
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,830
It helps
if you have the spins.

1141
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,419
I used to throw up all the time
when I was pregnant.

1142
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,420
You were pregnant?

1143
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,889
In Japan, for a few weeks.

1144
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,391
And then I miscarried,
which was cool.

1145
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,805
Wow.

1146
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,850
That sounds crass.
Miscarriage is not cool.

1147
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,019
- Would you have had it?
- No.

1148
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,359
- Are you gonna marry Patch?
- No.

1149
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,064
I can't believe that pregnant
is no longer crazy.

1150
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:26,244
I don't want to stay in Tokyo.
I hate it there.

1151
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,658
- Really?
- Yeah.

1152
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,784
And then when I got pregnant,
I was just like, “Get me the fuck out."

1153
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,788
But your blog looks so happy.

1154
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:39,257
I don't think my mom would read it
if it were about depression.

1155
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,167
My mom would.

1156
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,673
I was telling the truth.
I like Patch.

1157
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,765
I don't hate him.

1158
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,102
I know.

1159
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,266
I'm sorry about -

1160
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:59,606
It's just, if something funny happens
on the way to the deli...

1161
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:02,230
you'll only tell one person,
and that'll be Patch...

1162
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,449
and I'll never hear about it.

1163
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,868
Fuck, I'm tired.

1164
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,416
It's bedtime for all good children.

1165
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:19,923
I want to leave Patch and leave Tokyo
and come back to New York.

1166
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,292
- You should.
- I'm going to.

1167
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,213
I could - I don't know.
I could - I could help you.

1168
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,886
I was gonna say,
“You could live with me”...

1169
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,974
but I don't have a home.

1170
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,936
- I am going to do it.
- Fuck, yeah, girl.

1171
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,147
I miss my job.

1172
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,933
I miss old skyscrapers.

1173
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:42,403
Maybe we'll move back to New York
at the same time and be like...

1174
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,148
women who rediscover
themselves after a divorce.

1175
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:47,195
<i>- That's what my mom did.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.</i>

1176
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,444
No. I think it'll be great.

1177
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,788
We should get apartments
close to each other in Brooklyn.

1178
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,408
Yeah.
That's what we'll do.

1179
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,047
I've always felt
so competitive with you.

1180
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,086
Really?

1181
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,380
I don't think I realized
we were competitive.

1182
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,503
<i>- Fran?
- Yes?</i>

1183
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,723
Can you -
I know it's not my bed, but -

1184
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,467
What?

1185
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,468
<i>Can you take off your socks ?</i>

1186
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,266
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1187
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,357
It's just, you know -
socks in bed.

1188
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,185
Right. Gross.

1189
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,364
I love you, Frances.

1190
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:28,991
Good night.

1191
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,162
I love you, Sophie.

1192
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,997
Good night.

1193
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,601
<i>F, I'm sorry I was so drunk last night...</i>

1194
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:03,443
<i>but' thank you for being nice to me, which I know
you were, even though I don't remember it.</i>

1195
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:07,234
<i>All I know is you don't have a trash can
this morning, so it must've been bad.</i>

1196
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,278
<i>Ha, ha. I love you.</i>

1197
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,744
<i>I've got to get back
to this funeral in New York.</i>

1198
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,873
<i>Call me when you're a wake.
My phone works in the States...</i>

1199
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,083
<i>and there aren't
any charges or anything.</i>

1200
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,749
<i>XOXO. Sophie.</i>

1201
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,007
Sophie!

1202
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,092
Sophie!

1203
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:32,089
Sophie! Sophie!

1204
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,456
How can they be so nasty?

1205
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,371
I'm sorry.

1206
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:15,006
<i>- Probably head back in about five.
- Yes, hi. This is Frances.</i>

1207
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,600
Yes, “Frances for tonight.”

1208
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,639
Thanks.

1209
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,186
I just wanted to double-check that we're still
on for me bringing my guys in a little early.

1210
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,520
Okay. Great.
I'll see you in 30.

1211
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,523
I think the other two groups
will be here by 6:45.

1212
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,615
We'll be done by then.
Thanks.

1213
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,968
- Hey!
- Good to see you.

1214
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,838
Hi! Hi.
Thanks for coming.

1215
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,340
Urn, over there.

1216
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:10,278
Then you guys rest for a second.
Can I see the two of you?

1217
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,537
- Okay.
- Cue one...

1218
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,044
into the master,
and you're all set.

1219
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,001
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1220
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,668
Yea!

1221
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,418
Fuck you guys.
You got married.

1222
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,132
- We did.
- What?

1223
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,543
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1224
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,391
Hey. That was great.

1225
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,930
Oh, thanks, Ben.

1226
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,804
I like things
that look like mistakes.

1227
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,099
No, at times
it reminded me of -

1228
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,146
Did you see the exhibit
at the Met...

1229
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,812
about the textiles
that influenced Matisse?

1230
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,813
That's what your piece
reminded me of-

1231
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,574
not the paintings,
but the textiles.

1232
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,364
- Hmm.
- Undateable.

1233
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,579
- Me?
- No, I meant me that time.

1234
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,495
Oh. Oh, yeah. Textiles.

1235
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,376
Yeah, but also true.
Meaning I'm not dating anyone.

1236
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,916
- Undateable. Same difference.
- Oh.

1237
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:37,133
Are you really still, uh -
Are you undateable?

1238
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,798
You mean, am I -
Oh. Oh, yes.

1239
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,467
Yes. Very undateable.

1240
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,683
It was so interesting,
and so you.

1241
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,191
- Oh, thank you.
- To me it came right out.

1242
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,027
<i>I really appreciate that.</i>

1243
01:20:57,144 --> 01:21:00,023
Yeah. It's a huge accomplishment.
it's a huge piece.

1244
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,400
Yeah, I- I know.
It's a lot of people.

1245
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,368
<i>Thank you.</i>

1246
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,534
<i>It's just great.</i>

1247
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,748
<i>I have to say, it just...</i>

1248
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,833
<i>is so impressive to me.</i>

1249
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,376
Who - Who are you
making eyes at?

1250
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,717
That's Sophie.
She's my best friend.

1251
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,664
<i>I know when to go out...</i>

1252
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,458
<i>or when to stay in.</i>

1253
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:40,581
<i>Get things done.</i>
