00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,200
<i>Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.</i>

3
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:59,617
<i>Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.</i>

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,533
<i>Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.</i>

5
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:05,617
<i>Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.</i>

6
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,075
<i>Because thou hast made the
Lord, which is my refuge,</i>

7
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:12,408
<i>even the most high,
thy habitation.</i>

8
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:15,825
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

9
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:18,325
There shall
no evil befall thee,

10
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:21,617
neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,492
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

12
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,242
For he shall give
his angels charge over thee,

13
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:29,700
to keep thee in all thy ways.

14
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:32,617
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

15
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,908
Let's take a little break,
shall we?

16
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,950
Hon, are you feeling
all right?

17
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,033
Yeah, I'm fine.

18
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,783
I just can't remember
one quite like this.

19
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,200
He should try and get
some sleep.

20
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:04,658
Yeah. Here you go.

21
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,242
- Oh, I'll take him, Mr. Glatzel.
- Huh?

22
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,700
Yeah.

23
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,033
Thank you.

24
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:12,158
- Thank you, Arne.
- No problem. Come on, buddy.

25
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,825
He can't take much more
of this.

26
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,575
He won't have to.

27
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,492
Things will move quickly now that
the exorcism's been approved.

28
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,533
Father Gordon's already
on his way.

29
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,367
You're one brave kid,
you know?

30
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,700
I was a little runt growing up,

31
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,992
so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

32
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,617
But...

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

34
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,408
I don't feel very brave.

35
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:54,283
Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

36
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,117
It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

37
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,117
It's gonna be all right.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,492
I won't let anything
happen to you.

39
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,242
I promise.

40
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:11,242
Arne. When are you gonna
ask my sister to marry you?

41
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,117
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,992
- Come on.
- No, I don't, I...

43
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,450
No! Help me!

44
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,700
No, no, no! No, no, no!

45
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,450
- David!
- David! Where is he?

46
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,575
David!

47
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,742
What's happening, buddy?
Are you okay?

48
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,575
David, what's going on?

49
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,950
David?

50
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,492
No!

51
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,658
Father, we need to do this,
right now!

52
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:52,700
Okay, let's get him down to the car
and we'll drive him to the church.

53
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:54,950
No, Father. Right now.

54
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,408
No! No! No!

55
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,658
Grab his arms, don't let go.

56
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:29,283
Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

57
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,658
Let him find in you, Lord,

58
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:35,158
a fortified tower in the face
of the enemy.

59
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:36,908
Put on the full armor of God,

60
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,408
that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

61
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,742
Against the powers
of the darkness of this world.

62
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,700
Against wickedness.

63
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,950
Lorraine, what's wrong?

64
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm fine.

65
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:54,950
Lorraine.

66
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,325
Lord! Send him aid
from your Holy place

67
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,742
and watch over him from Sion.

68
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,408
Lord, heed my prayer.

69
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:07,992
Lord!

70
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,075
No. Father!

71
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,325
Father!

72
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:38,408
- Where's your first aid kit?
- It's in the kitchen!

73
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,408
I'm on it!

74
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,825
Ed, hurry up!

75
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,492
Hurry, Ed!

76
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,950
Ed. Ed, Hurry!

77
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,533
It's not working!

78
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,700
What? David, wait!

79
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,825
Stop it! What? What?

80
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:20,200
David! David! Help me, please!

81
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,825
What are you doing? David!

82
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:24,242
Help him, please!

83
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:27,450
David, stop it! David! David!

84
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,325
- Leave him alone!
- Arne, don't talk to it.

85
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:35,950
I said, leave him alone.
He's just a little boy, you coward!

86
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,700
No, Arne, don't talk to it!

87
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,575
I'll stop
your heart, old man.

88
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:52,867
Ed!

89
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,742
Hey!

90
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,200
Listen to me. Look at me.

91
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,950
Look at me. I know
you're still in there, David.

92
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,242
Just leave him alone, okay?

93
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,408
Leave him alone and take me.

94
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,117
Take me.

95
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
Hey, take me. Take me!

96
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:22,617
David!

97
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,033
Leave him alone and take me!

98
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,575
No.

99
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,283
No, no.

100
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:48,408
David. David, David!

101
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:51,492
David, are you okay? Hey, hey.

102
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,825
David, go with Mom.

103
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,033
Oh, oh!

104
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,492
Yes, David.

105
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:03,158
Ed? Ed! Hon!

106
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,325
What?

107
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,867
- Somebody call 911!
- Okay.

108
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,117
Mrs. Warren.

109
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,242
He's stabilized.

110
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,867
We're gonna transfer him
to the coronary unit.

111
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,950
- So, it was a heart attack?
- Yes.

112
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,908
And not a minor one,
I'm afraid.

113
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:30,075
- Can we see him now?
- Not yet.

114
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,075
We're gonna to put a stent
into his artery,

115
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,742
try to get blood flowing
back to his heart.

116
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,075
So, is he gonna be all right?

117
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,825
We're gonna need to run a few more tests
before I'm comfortable answering that.

118
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,408
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:03,158
- <i>Leave him alone!</i>
- <i>Arne, don't talk to it.</i>

120
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:05,408
<i>Leave him alone and take me.</i>

121
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,033
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

122
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,367
Hey, the mummy lives.

123
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,908
Hey, why did you let me
sleep so late?

124
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,117
I didn't let you,
I couldn't wake you.

125
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
- You couldn't wake me?
- No, I couldn't.

126
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,867
Oh, that's strange.

127
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,783
You mustn't have been
trying very hard.

128
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,033
No.

129
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,492
- Buddy! Easy, easy, easy!
- Okay, Bruno is right outside.

130
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:36,992
Oh, come on. Bruno's a worldly
man, he doesn't care.

131
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,575
No.

132
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,867
No, no, wait. Actually,
I do want to ask you something.

133
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,242
Okay. What do you want
to ask me?

134
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,325
Um...

135
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:48,033
- It's no big deal.
- Mmm-hmm.

136
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,492
- I've... I've been thinking...
- Mmm-hmm.

137
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:53,325
And now David's
out of the woods,

138
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:57,075
maybe we should
put all this behind us

139
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:00,325
and get out of this place.

140
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:03,242
- You know?
- You mean, leave Brookfield?

141
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,617
Sure, why not? We've got nothing
keeping us here now. Do we?

142
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,367
Oh, yeah.
Nothing but my family

143
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,700
and all the money
we don't have. Arne...

144
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,325
Okay, well,
money's no big deal, right?

145
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,617
We're both working,

146
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,575
and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

147
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:17,492
Arne, I just started this job.
I can't just up and walk out now.

148
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:19,533
- Jesus Christ!
- And besides,

149
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:21,825
Bruno doesn't know the first thing
about taking care of these dogs.

150
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,200
Hey...

151
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:30,283
Let me think about it. Okay?

152
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,117
- You'll think about it?
- Yeah, I'll think about it.

153
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,283
Okay. There we go.

154
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,283
Okay, get dressed.

155
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:41,908
I love you.

156
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,950
I think David will love that.

157
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,700
- Did you call my mom?
- Yeah, I did.

158
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,700
- I told her we were going to be very late.
- Okay, thank you.

159
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:54,742
No, Arne. Please stop eating,
please stop.

160
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:57,492
Mrs. Haskett, so good to see
you, thanks for coming by.

161
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,367
- Hey, we're headed out now.
- Bye, Pookie.

162
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,617
I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do while we're gone.

163
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, keeping track of this stuff is
what I'm supposed to be paying you for.

164
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,450
Not on weekends, you're not.

165
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,158
I'm letting you live here
rent free.

166
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,033
That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays, too.

167
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,283
Okay, Andy gets one cup,
everyone else gets two.

168
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,908
Magic and Sparky are getting picked up,
so you don't need to worry about them.

169
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:18,742
But, you'll have to take everyone else
outside at some point this afternoon.

170
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,325
Oh, Ruby's allergic to bees, if she gets
stung you've got to call the emergency vet.

171
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,158
I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

172
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,158
Yo, Arne, you wanna make
a quick five bucks, man?

173
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,908
My stereo's busted.

174
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:34,492
Yeah, sure. I'll take a look at it later.
But, make it 15.

175
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,658
Ten.

176
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,617
- ...what happened this morning.
- I know.

177
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,658
Ma, okay.
Please don't say anything.

178
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:43,408
I won't say anything,
I promise.

179
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,658
Okay, just...

180
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,325
He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

181
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:50,158
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.

182
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:53,283
- Actually, you mean he proposed?
- Not exactly.

183
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,075
- Did you say, yes?
- Not exactly.

184
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:57,783
Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

185
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,117
Oh, yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving, bud?

186
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,075
Yeah.

187
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay, I'll go get the meat.

188
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,075
Ow!

189
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,450
<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

190
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,825
<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

191
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:27,283
It was nice seeing Judy again.

192
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,742
Will she be staying long?

193
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:35,658
I don't know, um,
it depends if...

194
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:42,867
The nurse says that you have
been sleeping in that chair.

195
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,867
Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

196
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,950
Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

197
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,700
No, I don't think so.

198
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,783
Just that you were young.
In high school, wasn't it?

199
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah. We were 17.

200
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,283
<i>I went out with
my girlfriends and...</i>

201
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,408
<i>And he was an usher at the
movie theater that we went to.</i>

202
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,283
Afterwards...

203
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,450
<i>we went out for ice cream.</i>

204
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:21,367
<i>He took me out to the park,
but then it started to rain.</i>

205
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>And we stood under the gazebo
until it stopped.</i>

206
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,992
That was 30 years ago.

207
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,742
I could go back
to the house, Father,

208
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,450
but my home is here
with him.

209
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,450
Jesus Christ, Arne!
What the hell?

210
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:08,242
Can we please do something
about this racket?

211
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,950
These dogs are driving
me crazy!

212
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,992
They probably just
smell a rabbit or something.

213
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,158
- How come you're not at work?
- I wasn't feeling so hot.

214
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,408
Arne!
Perfect timing, man.

215
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,117
Hey, why don't you come inside
with me, have a beer.

216
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,950
If we get that stereo fixed we
can put up a sign, close up shop.

217
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,450
- You know what, I don't think so, Bruno.
- Come on.

218
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,783
- Why, you quit drinking?
- No, I just don't...

219
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:33,117
Tell you what, we can
both quit next Saturday.

220
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,450
How about that?

221
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,450
Lorraine. Lorraine.

222
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,617
- Lorraine.
- Daddy!

223
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,533
Oh, Ed, thank God.

224
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,200
Lorraine.

225
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,742
- You have to call the Glatzels.
- She just called, you're fine...

226
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:06,408
We have to warn them,
it's got the kid.

227
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,658
No, it's fine, it's over.

228
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,658
David is safe,
the demon is gone.

229
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:12,908
Arne. It's got Arne!

230
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,325
It's beautiful, man.
Nicely done!

231
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,950
Come on, man,
don't make me drink alone.

232
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,492
Your girl's gonna think
I'm a drunk.

233
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,158
Do you know...

234
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,700
that I saw these guys
play in Sydney?

235
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,450
They nearly blew the roof off
Her Majesty's Theater!

236
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,408
Bruno! Can you turn that down?

237
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,492
I'm testing out his work!

238
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,408
Hey.

239
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,867
What's the matter?
Are you okay? Bruno...

240
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,700
- Let's dance, brother!
- Bruno! No, stop!

241
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,575
Bruno. Bruno! Oh, my Lord...

242
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,908
Okay. Bruno, go night-night.

243
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:38,242
- No! Not until we dance.
- Yes! No, we're not dancing.

244
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:41,658
- One dance! One dance!
- I don't want to dance! Bruno!

245
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,408
Okay, one dance.

246
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,408
- This is Officer Thomas.
- <i>My name is Lorraine Warren.</i>

247
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,450
I know how this is
going to sound,

248
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:08,200
but there's going to be a tragedy
at the Brookfield Boarding Kennels.

249
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,533
Debbie!

250
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,783
- Arne...
- Bruno?

251
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,283
No, stop.

252
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:31,992
Arne!

253
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,200
Bruno, stop!

254
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,075
Arne, help me.

255
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:44,575
Arne, whoa. What is going on?

256
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:47,367
What are you doing?

257
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,533
Arne, please stop it!

258
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,283
Baby?

259
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,325
What the hell?

260
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,033
No, stop!

261
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:48,408
Hey.

262
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:50,950
You okay there?

263
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,325
Hey.

264
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:03,408
You okay?

265
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:11,117
Now, you just stay right there, okay?
Don't move.

266
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:14,617
I think I hurt someone.

267
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,242
<i>This is Sergeant Thomas.</i>

268
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:20,325
<i>I have one victim down,
multiple stab wounds.</i>

269
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:22,075
<i>Residents of Brookfield
were shocked this afternoon</i>

270
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:24,825
<i>by the broad daylight murder
of Bruno Sauls.</i>

271
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:27,158
<i>Sauls, the manager
of a local dog kennel,</i>

272
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:30,075
<i>was stabbed 22 times.</i>

273
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:35,200
<i>This is the first murder in
that town's 193-year history.</i>

274
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:46,992
<i>Who shall ascend
into the hill of the Lord?</i>

275
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:50,617
Or who shall stand
in his holy place?

276
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,408
He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart,

277
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:57,450
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity,

278
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,908
nor sworn deceitfully.

279
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,367
He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord,

280
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,450
and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.

281
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,367
Right. That's enough.

282
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,658
Thank you.

283
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:15,117
Well?

284
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,325
These religious objects
would've been enough

285
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,825
to provoke an inhuman spirit,

286
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,783
if there was one present.

287
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:27,492
Does that mean
he's not possessed?

288
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:30,450
The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

289
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,617
So, what does this mean,
then...

290
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm just crazy?

291
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:39,492
Well... you're not possessed.

292
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,867
But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

293
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,658
I... invited this
thing into me,

294
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,783
and that's the reason
that he's dead.

295
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,533
So, you know,
whatever happens to me,

296
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:57,158
I've got it coming.

297
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,575
No, you don't.

298
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:01,742
Look...

299
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:05,075
I was there.

300
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,408
Whatever is going on...

301
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:12,658
whatever happened that day...

302
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,367
that was not Arne.

303
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:25,033
We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

304
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,825
If the demon's gone,
what can you do now?

305
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,742
Who's your lawyer?

306
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,867
He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

307
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,283
The murder weapon belongs to him and
it's got his fingerprints all over it.

308
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:44,533
Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going to prison.

309
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:47,867
All we're saying is that there
were mitigating circumstances.

310
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:50,450
Mitigating circumstances?

311
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,492
Look, I don't think he should
get the death sentence, either.

312
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,658
But I am not going
before a grand jury

313
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,200
and saying he was possessed
by demons.

314
00:27:58,283 --> 00:27:59,575
It's never been done.

315
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,533
Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

316
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:03,408
The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

317
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:07,033
Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done successfully.

318
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,950
Then let us help you.

319
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:13,033
Ed and I have proven the existence
of the demonic hundreds of times.

320
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:16,450
You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

321
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,242
The standards of evidence
are completely different.

322
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,075
The courts accepts
the existence of God

323
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,075
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

324
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:26,825
I think it's about time they
accept the existence of the devil.

325
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,533
How are you going
to convince a jury

326
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,242
if you can't even convince me?

327
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:41,117
I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house for dinner.

328
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,617
We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

329
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,325
Introduce you to Annabelle.

330
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,450
If you're not convinced,
we'll butt out.

331
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,575
Deal?

332
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:57,450
All right.
Show me what you got.

333
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:03,908
Mr. Johnson, to count one of
indictment number S-A-J-1-2-1-6,

334
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,033
which charges you with
first-degree murder,

335
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,700
a class-A felony,

336
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:09,408
how do you plead?

337
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:12,075
Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty

338
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,700
by reason of
demonic possession.

339
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:38,617
This is ridiculous.
I can walk down a flight of stairs.

340
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,992
Oh, hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

341
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:43,700
Lorraine.

342
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,492
I just talked to a friend of
mine in the prosecutor's office.

343
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,950
He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

344
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,992
I'll build the case,
but that kid is gonna either live or die

345
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,325
depending on what you two find.

346
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,075
Well, we won't let him down.

347
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,533
I hope not.

348
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:01,992
Keep me posted.

349
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:08,617
So, what now?

350
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,867
We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

351
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,575
Demons don't just
disappear like this.

352
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,033
There's something else
going on here,

353
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,200
something that we missed
the first time.

354
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:21,825
Where do we start?

355
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,242
At the beginning.

356
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,325
<i>It's July 18th, 1981.</i>

357
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>This is Ed Warren,
here with Lorraine...</i>

358
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,908
<i>and Judy Glatzel,
Deborah Glatzel,</i>

359
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:40,033
<i>David Glatzel
and Arne Johnson.</i>

360
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,158
<i>All right, let's get started.</i>

361
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:45,158
<i>Who was there when David first
started exhibiting this behavior?</i>

362
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:49,867
<i>We all were.
It was the day we moved in.</i>

363
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,658
There you go.
Go have fun with them.

364
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,617
- Wanna order some pizza?
- Yeah sure, I'll do that right now.

365
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,367
- Hey.
- Put that box down a second.

366
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,908
- Why?
- I just...

367
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,075
What are you doing?

368
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,492
- Have a look...
- What is... Arne!

369
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,617
You know you're supposed to
do this when you get married?

370
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Okay, so maybe
we'll do that too.

371
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:10,825
Oh.

372
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:31,867
No!

373
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,450
Mom!

374
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,700
<i>I didn't know
what happened.</i>

375
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,408
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

376
00:33:57,492 --> 00:34:01,075
<i>And nobody believed me
when I told them.</i>

377
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:04,033
<i>But that was the first time
I saw it.</i>

378
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,325
I don't get it.

379
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,867
How could he have invited a demon?
He was only in here for a few minutes.

380
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:25,908
There wasn't even anything
in here.

381
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,158
Where was the water bed?

382
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,408
Where that rug is.

383
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,950
The wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured.

384
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,200
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please.

385
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:57,117
That's not water damage.

386
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:15,575
Hon, will you let me
handle this?

387
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,200
You're going to ruin your dress
if you go in there.

388
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:24,617
So, um, the guest room's about
15 feet in and to the right.

389
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,158
Okay.

390
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:29,450
- Just be careful.
- Just hold my purse.

391
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:13,242
Lorraine! Are you all right?

392
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:15,950
Yeah, I'm fine, Ed.
It's just a rat.

393
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:14,158
It's a witch's totem,

394
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,825
used by Satanists
in their rituals.

395
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:20,283
Remember how I told you that an
inhuman spirit needs to be invited?

396
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,117
And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

397
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:26,867
Well, you were right,
he didn't.

398
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,867
We think David was cursed.

399
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,242
And on the night
of the exorcism,

400
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:39,700
the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

401
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,367
Cursed?

402
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,075
Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

403
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:49,075
We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

404
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:50,783
The demon is summoned,

405
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:53,325
the possessed individual takes
a life and the demon departs.

406
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:56,533
Which is why Arne was able to
read from the Bible afterwards.

407
00:38:56,617 --> 00:39:02,408
Yeah. We think whoever cursed
David, used this to draw the demon.

408
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,200
And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

409
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:06,367
to every police department
you can find.

410
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,033
Start locally.

411
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:11,742
And, just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

412
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:16,117
There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

413
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,492
Do you remember the priest

414
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:21,075
who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

415
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,242
It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago...

416
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,992
- Father Kastner?
- Yeah, you're right.

417
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:28,575
Only it isn't "Father" anymore,
he's been retired for a while.

418
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,908
He tried to help those people.

419
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,283
He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

420
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:40,033
If anyone is going to be able to
tell us what this is, it's him.

421
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,242
Father Kastner.

422
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,117
I didn't hear the car drive in.

423
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,117
Would either of you care
for an omelet?

424
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,950
We had breakfast before
we left home.

425
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:25,617
I'm Ed Warren,
this is my wife Lorraine.

426
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,992
I have chicken shit
on my hands.

427
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Thank you.

428
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,450
Forget you ever saw this.

429
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,825
You've seen it before?

430
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,158
No. But I've seen ones like it.

431
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:01,325
This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece of work.

432
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:04,492
What I don't understand is...
is why?

433
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:08,617
David, the little boy who was
possessed, he didn't do anything wrong.

434
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,908
Why would someone
target this family?

435
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,158
Why?

436
00:41:13,492 --> 00:41:16,117
The "why" is irrelevant.

437
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:22,575
The "why" is counter to everything
that the Satanist stands for.

438
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:25,492
His sole aim is chaos.

439
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,367
His nectar is despair.

440
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,867
But someone had to
put it under their house.

441
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,075
So, what does this tell you
about the person who made it?

442
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,117
Come with me.

443
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:02,575
I don't want to go down there.

444
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,408
What is this?

445
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,908
It's the reason you're here.

446
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:29,742
I collected these while I was
studying the Disciples of the Ram.

447
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:46,783
- You should burn all this.
- I've thought of it.

448
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:51,658
But I felt it was safer
to keep them locked.

449
00:42:51,742 --> 00:42:54,075
I like taking guns
off the streets.

450
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,950
I don't suppose you have
all these books organized

451
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:02,242
using the Dewey Decimal System,
do you?

452
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:06,575
No. No. No, I do not.

453
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:10,617
The clues you seek could
be anywhere. Or, they...

454
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,450
Or, they may not be here
at all.

455
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:16,742
Ed, don't.

456
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:19,658
I studied
these people for nine years.

457
00:43:19,742 --> 00:43:24,450
They worshipped Satan and his
demons with blood sacrifice.

458
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:28,158
They defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals,

459
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:35,242
and they committed acts of blasphemy...
which I shall never speak of.

460
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:39,908
But... these acts gave
them power.

461
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:43,158
The trial of the Disciples,

462
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:49,117
the lead prosecutor,
his wife was pregnant.

463
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,658
A few days after the Disciples
were all found guilty,

464
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:56,242
his baby was born
six weeks early,

465
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:59,158
with its heart
outside of its body.

466
00:44:01,783 --> 00:44:03,992
Three months later,
his wife committed suicide

467
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:08,033
by laying her neck
on a railroad track.

468
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:13,200
A master Satanist is not an
adversary to be taken lightly.

469
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:21,033
We know the dangers,
better than you might think.

470
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,908
This boy, who's headed
to the death chamber...

471
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:30,200
is saving him worth
everything you have?

472
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:33,242
Because that's what it may
very well cost.

473
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,658
So, you gonna clean it up,
or what?

474
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,158
I'm sorry.

475
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:18,950
What?

476
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:37,700
<i>♪ Color me
your color, darling ♪</i>

477
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:40,075
<i>♪ I know who you are ♪</i>

478
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:48,533
<i>♪ Come up off
your color chart ♪</i>

479
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:52,867
<i>♪ I know where
you're coming from ♪</i>

480
00:46:55,742 --> 00:46:57,783
<i>♪ I know who you are ♪</i>

481
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,658
It was here!
I swear to God, it was here!

482
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:35,200
Look what the Perron family
sent.

483
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:39,200
Oh, that was sweet of them.

484
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,658
- I got it.
- Ed, let me.

485
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:43,617
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

486
00:47:45,658 --> 00:47:46,867
- Hello?
- <i>Ed?</i>

487
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,575
We've got a bite.

488
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,867
I just got off the phone with a
homicide detective in Danvers,

489
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,492
he wants to talk to you guys.
He says he says he's seen it.

490
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:12,783
Katie Lincoln and Jessica Strong
went missing about four months ago.

491
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:15,492
They were best friends
in high school.

492
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:19,200
Katie's body was found
near here, stabbed 22 times.

493
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,408
We still haven't found Jessica.

494
00:48:21,492 --> 00:48:24,450
But when we searched her home
back in May...

495
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:26,867
we found this.

496
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:36,325
So, you're the experts.

497
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:37,867
What can you tell me
about this?

498
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,783
Well, to be honest, not much.

499
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:43,117
Only that if this totem works the
same way as the one in Brookfield,

500
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,658
it's possible that your
missing girl was possessed.

501
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:51,450
Look, I've read all about what you
two think happened in Brookfield.

502
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:55,700
But I'm only interested in leads
that are grounded in reality.

503
00:48:55,783 --> 00:48:57,533
Good. So are we.

504
00:48:57,617 --> 00:49:00,075
We were actually hoping there might
be something in this case file

505
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:01,992
that might help prove
Arne's story.

506
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,158
No, no, no.
I brought you here to help me,

507
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:05,992
not the other way around.

508
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,950
Now, we've been looking
for a link to some sort of

509
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:10,158
satanic cult ever since
we found that thing.

510
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:13,408
And these devil-worshippers,
they're just people.

511
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,658
Crazy, evil people,
but, people.

512
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:20,533
Maybe we can help each other.

513
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:25,575
We need to see your casefile...

514
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:27,783
and you need to find
the missing girl.

515
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,742
So, give us a chance.

516
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,575
- To do what exactly?
- To find Jessica.

517
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:35,742
We've been combing through these forests
for over three months now, Mrs. Warren.

518
00:49:35,825 --> 00:49:38,825
I can see things that
your people can't.

519
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:03,367
One of these is the knife used
on Katie Lincoln.

520
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:08,117
The others I just pulled
from the evidence locker.

521
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,783
And what? You want her to pick
out the murder weapon?

522
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,450
Mmm-hmm.

523
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,367
I'll take you out there,
but first I want to see what she can do.

524
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,575
Absolutely not! My wife's gift
is not a sideshow attraction.

525
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:20,242
If she is what you say she is,
then this shouldn't be a problem,

526
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:21,492
Mr. Warren. Right?

527
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:23,658
- No way! Forget it. We...
- It's this one.

528
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:40,283
It was a one-in-three chance.

529
00:50:41,992 --> 00:50:43,575
This song's appropriate.

530
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:48,700
You know, I actually met
Elvis once.

531
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:50,325
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

532
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:53,950
- Was that before or after he died?
- Before...

533
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:56,575
and after.

534
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,283
You missed a turn.

535
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:15,033
The spot where you found Katie's
body, it was back that way.

536
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,117
<i>They're in Danvers,
right now.</i>

537
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,908
<i>If they can find some way to</i>

538
00:51:25,992 --> 00:51:28,908
connect what happened there to
what happened to you, then...

539
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:31,158
You know, it's...
It's a pattern.

540
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:35,700
They might even find out
who did this.

541
00:51:35,783 --> 00:51:39,783
Okay. Well, that sounds great,
right?

542
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,283
- It's great.
- Baby...

543
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,700
What's going on?

544
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,117
Nothing.

545
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:51,075
I'm fine,
I'm tired, you know...

546
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:52,242
Come on.

547
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:55,617
You're keeping something
from me.

548
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,075
Don't you think
I can tell that?

549
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,408
Look, I'm fine. Totally fine.

550
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:08,908
It's cold in here.

551
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:12,867
Yeah, right?

552
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,450
It's like, they're trying to freeze us
out, or something.

553
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:22,075
I remember what it felt like.

554
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:27,450
You're always cold,
and you're never alone.

555
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:29,367
David, what are you
talking about?

556
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,575
That's why you can't sleep.
Because it's never quiet in your head.

557
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:37,533
Sometimes you think something,

558
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:40,992
then you're not sure
if it was really you.

559
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,200
But now you're seeing it.

560
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:48,658
It's here with you.
And it's telling you to do things.

561
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:52,617
Arne, what is it telling
you to do?

562
00:53:06,992 --> 00:53:09,075
You sure you should be tromping
through the woods like this?

563
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:10,742
Yeah, I'm fine.

564
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:12,658
Then what are
you worried about?

565
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:14,617
Afraid she won't be
able to do it?

566
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,450
No.

567
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:20,783
I'm afraid that she will.

568
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:35,408
Ed, something terrible
happened here.

569
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:06,367
Katie, wait up.

570
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,492
Hey.

571
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:14,950
I got you something.

572
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,533
They were selling them
at the May Festival this year.

573
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:19,367
Your parents still dragging you
up there for that?

574
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,492
Every year, since I was six.

575
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:26,200
It's dumb, but,
I thought this was cool.

576
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:29,200
It reminded me of the ones
we made in high school.

577
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:31,992
Will you help me put it on?

578
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:33,242
Sure.

579
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:30,492
All right, that's enough.

580
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:35,742
Hon, that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

581
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:47,033
Katie? Katie? Oh, my God.
What did I do?

582
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,117
Hon, no!

583
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:51,783
Lorraine!

584
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:25,575
Lorraine!

585
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:31,658
Lorraine.

586
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:36,908
Ed.

587
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:40,575
No!

588
00:57:56,325 --> 00:58:00,367
It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

589
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:13,658
She's down there.
Ed, she's down there.

590
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:28,117
<i>Blood pressure's
a little high.</i>

591
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,825
I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

592
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:32,242
It's a pill, you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

593
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:34,117
It'll open up
your blood vessels.

594
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,033
Yeah, I have those.

595
00:58:36,992 --> 00:58:38,992
I left them at home.

596
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:42,075
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you.

597
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:45,033
Mind giving us a minute?

598
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,575
Recovery team found a body.

599
00:58:54,783 --> 00:58:57,408
- Is it...
- We're not sure.

600
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,367
Look, I know what
it looks like.

601
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,700
But, I don't want any of this getting
out until we have a positive ID

602
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,408
from the coroner.

603
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:07,492
You know, we dragged
this basin. Twice.

604
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:09,658
Had to pull teeth to get
it done a third time.

605
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:11,700
We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

606
00:59:12,992 --> 00:59:14,950
I'm just glad we could help.

607
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,617
Let me know where
you're staying.

608
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,992
And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

609
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:35,617
Hello?

610
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,200
Oh, my God, I've been leaving
messages all day.

611
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,992
- What's wrong?
- <i>It's Arne. It followed him!</i>

612
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:41,908
You said this was over,

613
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:43,658
but now he's trapped in there with
this thing and it's telling him

614
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:45,742
- <i>to kill himself!</i>
- Debbie.

615
00:59:45,825 --> 00:59:48,700
Just calm down and listen to me. I need
you to call the prison chaplain, um...

616
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:51,450
- Father Newman.
- Father Newman. Tell him that

617
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:54,992
<i>Arne needs to be put on a 24-hour
suicide watch! He's got...</i>

618
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,992
What? Hello?

619
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:02,533
What is this thing?

620
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,075
Arne.

621
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,450
God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

622
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:08,367
This demon...

623
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:13,075
it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

624
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:14,783
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

625
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:18,533
That means, we know that this
is a curse,

626
01:01:18,617 --> 01:01:20,492
and curses can be broken.

627
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:25,575
All right.
Then, how do we do that?

628
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:34,242
Back at the Glatzel house,

629
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:38,075
I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

630
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,742
I didn't know what it was then.

631
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:46,200
But I think that I was connected to
the person who is responsible for this.

632
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:50,033
Ed, that body they found...

633
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:54,117
if it's Jessica,
if it's really her,

634
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,242
then that connection
could still be open.

635
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:03,908
There's gotta be another way.

636
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:37,950
Okay... okay.

637
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:42,325
Okay.

638
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,825
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>

639
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,825
there is nothing I shall want.

640
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:09,075
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

641
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:27,242
There's nobody there.

642
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:40,533
We'll leave a note.

643
01:04:21,242 --> 01:04:22,742
Oh, boy.

644
01:05:18,742 --> 01:05:20,075
Please be careful.

645
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,367
Do you see anything?

646
01:05:59,242 --> 01:06:02,075
No. There's nothing.

647
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,242
There's nothing here.

648
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:10,283
I'm not sensing it.

649
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:24,075
- Lorraine, what is it?
- The connection.

650
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:29,367
It's here.

651
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,117
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

652
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:36,408
Yes.

653
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:40,992
Yes, there are... some stairs.

654
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:43,825
I heard a train.

655
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:46,867
<i>But now...</i>

656
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:50,950
there's an altar.

657
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:54,492
All those black candles.

658
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:59,575
<i>There's 12 of them.
In a circle.</i>

659
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,700
Oh, Ed.

660
01:08:00,783 --> 01:08:02,200
Okay, that's enough,
come back.

661
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:03,575
I can't.

662
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,617
Lorraine.

663
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:11,950
It's a woman.

664
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:14,367
<i>Can you see her?</i>

665
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:17,450
<i>I am her.</i>

666
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:20,450
Can you tell where she is?

667
01:08:21,408 --> 01:08:23,950
I don't know. I...

668
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,033
<i>She's doing it again.</i>

669
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:30,367
<i>She's reaching out to Arne.</i>

670
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:36,492
<i>She's trying to complete
the curse.</i>

671
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,742
<i>Oh, she has him.
She has Arne.</i>

672
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,700
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

673
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,450
No, no. Oh, God.

674
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:08,700
End this black sabbath.

675
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:13,117
By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

676
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,200
I got a cutter! C-19!

677
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:26,575
Come on, kid.

678
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,575
How are you doing this?

679
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:44,450
God has shown you to me.

680
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:48,492
Then your God has damned you.

681
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,950
Ed. The connection
works both ways.

682
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:41,075
Lorraine.

683
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,950
You need to come back.

684
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:48,075
Lorr...

685
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:05,158
Lorraine?

686
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:07,617
You need to break
the connection.

687
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,950
Drop her hand.

688
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:13,492
Lorraine, let go of her hand.

689
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:36,200
Ed...

690
01:11:38,283 --> 01:11:40,158
She knows who we are.

691
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,742
We are so sorry.

692
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,825
Oh, we're so sorry.

693
01:11:55,908 --> 01:11:57,200
How's Arne?

694
01:11:57,283 --> 01:12:00,033
He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

695
01:12:00,117 --> 01:12:01,992
We got the casefile.

696
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:04,908
There's got to be something here that
connects these girls back to him.

697
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,283
That's great.

698
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,617
I got something
to show you, too.

699
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,575
I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

700
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:19,783
The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

701
01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:22,742
Now...

702
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:27,450
my Latin is rusty, but...
I think this...

703
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:30,158
is talking about
a human sacrifice.

704
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:34,783
One by murder
and the other by suicide.

705
01:12:34,867 --> 01:12:36,825
Does it say how to stop it?

706
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:39,700
Yeah, it looks like...

707
01:12:39,783 --> 01:12:42,450
you can break the curse by destroying
the altar it was cast from.

708
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,242
But...

709
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:46,658
this part looks like Aramaic.

710
01:12:48,242 --> 01:12:51,075
This next part,
I can't read it.

711
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,242
But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

712
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:55,575
She can't.

713
01:12:55,658 --> 01:12:58,075
Once started, the curse
must be completed.

714
01:12:58,158 --> 01:12:59,825
Her soul depends on it.

715
01:13:01,658 --> 01:13:03,617
We'll find another way.

716
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:06,242
Was there anything
in your vision

717
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:08,200
that might help us
find her altar?

718
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,492
It was cold.

719
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:20,533
There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

720
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:23,992
I think I heard a train.

721
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:29,950
But it sounded strange somehow.
Like, um...

722
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,492
I don't know, muffled?

723
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:35,867
Well, maybe it was underground.

724
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,825
Could be. I don't know where.

725
01:13:40,242 --> 01:13:42,533
This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

726
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:43,783
Maybe there's
a connection there.

727
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:44,783
Let me take a look at the...

728
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,283
<i>Take a look at the...</i>

729
01:13:47,908 --> 01:13:49,117
<i>file.</i>

730
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:23,825
Lorraine?

731
01:15:13,492 --> 01:15:14,617
Lorraine?

732
01:15:23,908 --> 01:15:25,325
Lorraine!

733
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:56,658
Where is she?

734
01:15:56,742 --> 01:16:00,700
You know, the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

735
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,783
If you hurt her...

736
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,742
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Warren.

737
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,367
You're so close.

738
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,575
I'd hate for you
to give up now.

739
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:56,367
He who calls forth the water of the sea!

740
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,658
The Lord of Hosts is His name!

741
01:16:58,742 --> 01:16:59,992
Deliver Thy servant

742
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,492
from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

743
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:06,325
Fear and flee, unclean spirit!

744
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:09,867
Ed!

745
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,158
Ed.

746
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:16,158
I'm sorry.

747
01:17:16,908 --> 01:17:18,825
Ed, it was her!

748
01:17:19,783 --> 01:17:21,117
It was her.

749
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:26,283
- Ed, what the hell is going on?
- Help me find it!

750
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:27,617
Find what?

751
01:17:32,825 --> 01:17:33,700
Where is it?

752
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:34,783
Ed.

753
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:37,658
Ed!

754
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:41,283
She was here!
She was in our house!

755
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:06,617
When did these get here?

756
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:12,617
They just arrived yesterday

757
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,325
while you guys
were driving home.

758
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,117
They were fresh
when they got here.

759
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:06,908
We have
to find this woman.

760
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:09,575
We've identified the curse

761
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,117
and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

762
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,325
There has to be
something in here.

763
01:19:14,742 --> 01:19:16,992
Okay, I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

764
01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:19,992
There has to be a clue about
where we can find the altar.

765
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:21,367
So what do we do?

766
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,158
You should go be with Arne.

767
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:25,867
He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

768
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:28,075
Ask Father Newman for help.

769
01:19:29,908 --> 01:19:33,033
Drew, you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

770
01:19:33,117 --> 01:19:35,325
We've got to find a link
between these cases.

771
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:38,908
And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

772
01:19:38,992 --> 01:19:41,908
Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

773
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:01,492
They've stopped his sedation.

774
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:05,033
He'll be coming around soon.

775
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,450
There's nothing
in these interviews.

776
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:27,700
Her friends barely saw her
after she got back from college.

777
01:20:27,783 --> 01:20:29,367
Didn't that
seem strange to you?

778
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,825
I mean, we're here,

779
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,783
the Glatzels live here,
just 15 minutes away.

780
01:20:32,867 --> 01:20:35,825
But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

781
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:39,867
Why is this one so far away?

782
01:20:42,783 --> 01:20:44,908
Hey, where did Jessica
find her totem?

783
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,825
I just saw something
about that.

784
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:50,825
It was in an interview
with her parents.

785
01:20:50,908 --> 01:20:52,575
It was in a box.

786
01:20:52,658 --> 01:20:55,200
"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

787
01:20:56,492 --> 01:20:58,200
Where'd she go to college?

788
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:02,617
Fairfield.

789
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,617
This woman lives in the area.

790
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,783
Still a lot of ground to cover.

791
01:21:23,033 --> 01:21:25,575
Yeah, but not
a lot of train tracks.

792
01:21:25,658 --> 01:21:27,992
Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

793
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,742
What time was it?

794
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:32,783
Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

795
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,408
Probably
close to midnight.

796
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:36,283
Then it can't be
either of these two.

797
01:21:36,367 --> 01:21:38,158
The commuter lines
don't run that late.

798
01:21:38,242 --> 01:21:39,783
That just leaves
this freight line

799
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:41,117
that crosses the river here.

800
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:44,492
The river.

801
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:48,033
Oh, dear God.

802
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,533
Mrs. Warren.

803
01:21:57,617 --> 01:21:59,117
I'm sorry, Father,
we tried calling,

804
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,033
but we couldn't reach you.

805
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:04,575
We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage from this book.

806
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,908
Of course. Come in.

807
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:11,658
Thank you.

808
01:22:20,117 --> 01:22:23,033
Give me your keys.
You stay here, call the police.

809
01:22:23,117 --> 01:22:24,325
What do you want me
to tell them?

810
01:22:24,408 --> 01:22:26,158
Anything,
just get 'em out there!

811
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,742
It's the curse.

812
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:41,075
It says, the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

813
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:45,283
It refers to them as...

814
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:49,158
"The child, the lover
and the man of God."

815
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:52,825
The embodiment of God's work.

816
01:22:53,658 --> 01:22:57,992
Purity, love, faith.

817
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:02,367
Has there been another?

818
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,158
It's Ed. It's my husband.

819
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,117
Last night we found a totem
in his office.

820
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,908
That is unfortunate.

821
01:23:24,617 --> 01:23:27,242
Here, come with me.

822
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:31,408
There's something
I need to show you.

823
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:56,408
Father?

824
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,117
I've been here many years...

825
01:25:01,908 --> 01:25:04,075
starting when I was a priest.

826
01:25:06,575 --> 01:25:10,492
The church
used this mill for storage.

827
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:16,200
It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

828
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:19,533
Things they didn't understand.

829
01:25:36,117 --> 01:25:37,742
You had a child?

830
01:25:40,617 --> 01:25:43,033
Her mother died in childbirth.

831
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:47,575
The Church couldn't know.

832
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:51,367
So I raised her here,
in secret.

833
01:25:54,575 --> 01:25:55,992
It was just the two of us.

834
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:01,992
Our happiness
filled this house.

835
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:08,450
I continued my studies
into the occult.

836
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,950
I wanted to protect her
from all this.

837
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:18,450
Instead I created
a fascination.

838
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:25,408
We must be careful

839
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:28,742
how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

840
01:26:33,325 --> 01:26:36,158
"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

841
01:26:36,242 --> 01:26:38,825
will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

842
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:40,783
I will say of the Lord,

843
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:44,492
'He is my refuge
and my fortress,

844
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:47,450
my God, in whom I trust.'"

845
01:26:54,617 --> 01:26:56,867
It's just the wiring.

846
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,783
You know, state building.

847
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:03,325
Debbie.

848
01:27:03,992 --> 01:27:05,033
Arne.

849
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:11,783
What is it?

850
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,450
She's... she's close.

851
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,992
You knew?

852
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:34,950
We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

853
01:27:38,408 --> 01:27:40,325
She's my daughter.

854
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:44,367
I couldn't...

855
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,242
I didn't want to see.

856
01:27:51,825 --> 01:27:52,992
After all these years,

857
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,408
I thought she'd come back
to me again.

858
01:27:57,575 --> 01:28:01,075
And now I know
the real reason she's here.

859
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:07,658
There are tunnels
under this land.

860
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:11,283
She would explore them
as a child.

861
01:28:13,742 --> 01:28:16,658
Her altar must be down there.

862
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:20,617
It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

863
01:28:22,658 --> 01:28:25,367
We need to destroy it.

864
01:28:31,742 --> 01:28:33,283
She's here.

865
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:46,200
Go.

866
01:29:27,408 --> 01:29:29,617
I failed as a priest.

867
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:33,742
And I failed as a father.

868
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:36,283
Please, God,
don't let me fail...

869
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:52,700
Lorraine!

870
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:53,950
Lorraine!

871
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:55,533
Ed!

872
01:31:56,492 --> 01:31:57,658
Lorraine!

873
01:31:58,617 --> 01:31:59,700
Lorraine!

874
01:31:59,783 --> 01:32:00,950
Ed?

875
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,450
Ed!

876
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:08,367
Lorraine!

877
01:32:20,742 --> 01:32:21,742
Ed!

878
01:32:56,533 --> 01:32:58,117
Look at me.

879
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,200
Open your eyes.

880
01:33:05,783 --> 01:33:07,367
Look at me.

881
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,492
No!

882
01:33:16,867 --> 01:33:17,992
Look at me.

883
01:33:18,075 --> 01:33:20,533
Open your eyes and look at me.

884
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,700
Open up.

885
01:33:46,408 --> 01:33:47,742
Lorraine!

886
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:50,242
Lorraine!

887
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,617
Lorraine!

888
01:33:58,700 --> 01:33:59,908
Lorraine?

889
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:02,325
Ed!

890
01:34:27,283 --> 01:34:28,533
Ed?

891
01:34:31,492 --> 01:34:32,658
Ed?

892
01:34:53,533 --> 01:34:55,325
- It's happening.
- Now?

893
01:34:56,117 --> 01:34:57,033
Now.

894
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:13,742
Ed, stop!

895
01:35:16,117 --> 01:35:18,992
Stop!
Ed, I'm begging you!

896
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,992
Ed! Stop!

897
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:36,117
Arne!

898
01:35:39,075 --> 01:35:40,825
Arne, please. It's okay.

899
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:44,575
Our Father who art in heaven

900
01:35:44,658 --> 01:35:46,450
- hallowed be thy name...
- No, Arne. It's okay! Please!

901
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:48,283
...thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

902
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:50,617
- on earth as it is in heaven.
- Arne, it's okay!

903
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,742
Stop this!
Ed, I'm begging you!

904
01:35:54,908 --> 01:35:57,450
I'm begging you, remember me!

905
01:35:58,283 --> 01:35:59,617
Stop!

906
01:36:05,117 --> 01:36:08,158
Ed, stop!

907
01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:13,658
<i>Ed, please.</i>

908
01:36:13,742 --> 01:36:15,075
<i>Remember me.</i>

909
01:36:19,908 --> 01:36:21,575
Oh, my God! Guards!

910
01:36:21,658 --> 01:36:23,575
...and lead us not
into temptation

911
01:36:23,658 --> 01:36:25,033
but deliver us from evil.

912
01:36:25,117 --> 01:36:26,658
- For thine is the kingdom...
- Arne, it's okay.

913
01:36:26,742 --> 01:36:28,367
...the power and the glory...

914
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,533
...now and forever, amen!

915
01:36:30,617 --> 01:36:34,117
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name,

916
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,325
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

917
01:36:36,408 --> 01:36:38,575
- on earth as it is in heaven.
- No, Arne!

918
01:36:40,492 --> 01:36:42,117
Arne? Arne, what are you doing?

919
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:50,408
What are you doing? Stop it!

920
01:36:50,492 --> 01:36:53,033
What are you doing?
Father Newman, help him!

921
01:36:56,367 --> 01:36:58,700
Please... Guards!

922
01:36:58,783 --> 01:37:00,700
Please! Stop it!

923
01:37:00,783 --> 01:37:02,242
Please help him!

924
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,033
You're not gonna do this!

925
01:37:07,117 --> 01:37:10,117
This is wrong and you know it!

926
01:37:14,117 --> 01:37:16,158
Father Newman... No, no.

927
01:37:17,117 --> 01:37:19,700
What's happening?

928
01:37:19,783 --> 01:37:22,117
Please, Father, make it stop!

929
01:37:28,783 --> 01:37:32,950
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

930
01:37:33,033 --> 01:37:34,283
thy kingdom come...

931
01:37:34,367 --> 01:37:36,950
No, no, no! Arne, no!

932
01:37:38,283 --> 01:37:41,033
Arne, stop, please! Stop it!

933
01:37:42,408 --> 01:37:45,075
Don't do this, Arne,
I love you!

934
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:46,242
No...

935
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:47,867
And lead us
not into temptation,

936
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,825
but deliver us from evil!

937
01:38:06,575 --> 01:38:09,617
Ed... Remember me.

938
01:38:15,533 --> 01:38:17,533
<i>She tried to
turn you against me.</i>

939
01:38:20,908 --> 01:38:24,492
<i>Because, she thinks our love
is our weakness.</i>

940
01:38:29,367 --> 01:38:30,783
<i>But it's not.</i>

941
01:38:32,242 --> 01:38:33,950
<i>It's not.</i>

942
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:40,242
<i>It's our strength.</i>

943
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:44,992
<i>Now, open your eyes.</i>

944
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:16,700
Arne? Arne, are you okay?

945
01:39:19,908 --> 01:39:21,825
Oh, my God!

946
01:39:23,908 --> 01:39:25,533
Oh, my God.

947
01:40:06,492 --> 01:40:08,117
Your curse is broken.

948
01:40:20,325 --> 01:40:22,908
You promised a demon a soul.

949
01:40:27,533 --> 01:40:29,908
And it can't go back to hell
without one.

950
01:40:48,492 --> 01:40:50,658
Oh, my God.

951
01:40:50,742 --> 01:40:53,408
It's okay. It's over.

952
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:56,367
Please say it's over...

953
01:41:08,575 --> 01:41:11,325
Hon... I...

954
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,950
I forgot my pills.

955
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:50,825
Arne?

956
01:42:52,283 --> 01:42:53,158
Arne?

957
01:42:55,492 --> 01:42:56,908
Excuse me. Arne!

958
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:00,867
I love you.

959
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:32,575
Will the defendant please rise?

960
01:44:22,408 --> 01:44:24,575
Oh.

961
01:45:09,408 --> 01:45:12,367
As we go back now,
listen to the tapes

962
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:14,533
as well as being there
and hearing him do it,

963
01:45:14,617 --> 01:45:18,200
he would constantly challenge
what was in that boy.

964
01:45:18,283 --> 01:45:19,533
What does that do

965
01:45:19,617 --> 01:45:20,908
- to the whole system of law...
- Yes.

966
01:45:20,992 --> 01:45:23,033
...if a person
can walk in and say,

967
01:45:23,117 --> 01:45:24,367
"The devil made me do it"?

968
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:32,867
<i>David, I'm going to
put this on you.</i>

969
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:34,492
<i>In the name of Jesus,
Jesus repels you.</i>

970
01:45:35,367 --> 01:45:37,200
<i>Leave this child alone.</i>

971
01:45:38,033 --> 01:45:40,033
<i>It's on your forehead.</i>

972
01:45:41,492 --> 01:45:44,367
<i>Yes, remember, you are
not strong, you're weak.</i>

973
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:46,242
<i>You're weak.</i>

974
01:45:46,325 --> 01:45:49,408
<i>Jesus loves this boy.
This is... this is His child.</i>

975
01:45:49,492 --> 01:45:52,325
<i>Wake him out of it.
Prop him up. Do something!</i>

976
01:45:52,408 --> 01:45:54,325
<i>He won't get out of it
right now, Ma.</i>

977
01:45:54,408 --> 01:45:56,492
<i>Well he called me names,
you didn't do nothing now!</i>

978
01:45:56,575 --> 01:45:58,158
<i>Well, what do you think
we've been doing all this time?</i>

979
01:45:58,242 --> 01:45:59,325
<i>In the name of
the Father and the Son</i>

980
01:45:59,408 --> 01:46:02,158
<i>and the Holy Spirit, amen!</i>

981
01:46:02,242 --> 01:46:04,867
<i>You gotta hold him down.
He told me to.</i>

982
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,575
<i>Hold him on the ground.</i>

983
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:08,242
<i>Mommy's here.
Mommy's here.</i>

984
01:46:08,325 --> 01:46:09,617
<i>Come on, wake up.</i>

985
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,867
<i>Come on. Get up.
Come on, let's go.</i>

986
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,408
<i>Get out. Get out of my son.</i>

987
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:15,742
<i>Get out of my son. Come on.</i>

988
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:18,783
<i>Come on, son. Come on.
Get out. Get away from my son.</i>

989
01:46:18,867 --> 01:46:20,700
<i>Go on! No!</i>

990
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:22,200
<i>I'm your mother!</i>

991
01:46:22,325 --> 01:46:24,533
<i>No, you're...</i>

992
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:26,992
<i>David. David. Wake up!</i>

993
01:46:27,075 --> 01:46:29,450
<i>Let the boy go.</i>

994
01:46:29,533 --> 01:46:31,742
<i>Look,
you need to hold him.</i>

995
01:46:31,825 --> 01:46:33,283
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

996
01:46:33,367 --> 01:46:36,992
<i>and the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

997
01:46:37,075 --> 01:46:39,450
<i>Do something.
Sit him up.</i>

998
01:46:39,533 --> 01:46:40,783
- <i>It won't work.</i>
- <i>You can't sit him up, he's...</i>

999
01:46:40,867 --> 01:46:42,158
<i>It won't work.</i>

1000
01:46:42,242 --> 01:46:45,033
<i>Mom, you're dead!</i>

1001
01:46:45,117 --> 01:46:46,950
<i>David!
Please, get up!</i>

1002
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:48,867
<i>My God, get up!</i>

1003
