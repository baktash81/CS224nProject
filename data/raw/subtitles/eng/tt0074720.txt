00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,506
*THE TOY *

2
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,123
~ Mr. de Blenac, please.
~ Do you have an appointment? ~ Yes.

3
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,121
~ You are Mister...
~ Perrin. Francois Perrin.

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,465
Mr. de Blenac, Mr. Francois Perrin is here.

5
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,822
A moment, please.

6
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,821
~ Mr. de Blenac is expecting you.
~ Thank you.

7
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,824
Please be seated.

8
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,525
Do you have much affection that beard?.

9
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,621
Excuse me?.

10
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,112
I advise you to shave. Mr.
Rambal-Cochet doesn't like beards.

11
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,824
Go shave it off and
come right back to me.

12
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,176
It may be a good journalist
can carry off a beard.

13
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,474
You should know that Mr. Rambal-Cochet
participates personally in the magazine.

14
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,355
I'm the editor-in-chief, but he
supervises everything. It's his hobby.

15
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,423
He comes here every day. Go, shave.

16
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,345
Aside from that, things
are pretty relaxed here.

17
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,811
I've been here from the outset...

18
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,425
for maybe 20 years...

19
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,840
Yeah, exactly 19 years and 5 months.

20
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,806
And you, what have you been doing?.

21
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,812
I'm unemployed, for 17 months...

22
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,981
more precisely, 17 months and 6 days.

23
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,805
This is called forced labor.

24
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,822
To begin, you'll be only a number.

25
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,653
I take the photos, and you should
compose the original story.

26
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,528
A Business Breakfast in
Rambal-Cochet's factory.

27
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,779
The President Mr. Rambal-Cochet
congratulated his staff.

28
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,824
We're not going to get the
prize for best feature, friend.

29
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,505
The editor-in-chief, de
Blenac --- what's he like?.

30
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,422
De Blenac is a puppet.
You'll catch on pretty quick.

31
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,997
Ladies and gentlemen,...

32
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,805
President Rambal-Cochet
is slightly delayed...

33
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,823
and requests that we start without him.

34
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,319
Grub's up!.

35
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,822
This isn't too bad, is it?.

36
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,017
You haven't tried the pate, have some...

37
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,017
~ Not with the salmon...
~ Try it, it's stupendous!.

38
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,823
Ladies and gentlemen --- good
morning, please be seated.

39
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,424
Go on, please.

40
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,822
Take this, it's my pate.

41
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,868
No, it's not mine. It belongs to Mr....

42
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,151
I'm sorry, madam.

43
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,813
This son of one of the staff,
a cook or a gardener...

44
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,118
Rambal-Cochet has a message for him.

45
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,927
No, from Division # 327.
There's been a mistake...

46
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,224
Please.

47
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,184
However, it is nice...

48
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,824
It's hard to find work
for the deaf and dumb.

49
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,821
Then Mr. Rambal-Cochet is very friendly...

50
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,815
I have money troubles, you may be sure.

51
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,115
I would like to advance
something, do you think...?.

52
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,815
A little, if and when it's not the
continuation of an earlier advance.

53
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,534
~ Pignet.
~ Perrin.

54
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,711
I call the bank every day. I'm in the red.

55
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,419
~ Is it a huge bank or just a branch?.
~ A little branch, why?.

56
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,118
Good, then invite one of
the managers for dinner.

57
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,223
It's what I do. You have
to learn to be convincing.

58
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,608
You explain that you're
expecting a large deposit soon...

59
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,523
then you tell a joke to get
the manager to laugh.

60
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,804
And the, that type of guy will say...

61
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,632
Doctor, yes...and your
feet, I also still want...

62
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,823
I know the same joke,
but with vetinarians.

63
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,550
Here's another, fine, fine, but truthful.

64
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,811
At the Cannes Film Festival, I reported...

65
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,175
and met in Croizet with movie stars.

66
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,045
I'm sorry, has it been
3 hours?. I have to go.

67
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,004
~ The bill, please.
~ Yes, sir.

68
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,584
How can you break nuts
with the edge of your hand?.

69
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,819
Operation Dragon.

70
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,821
I, I'm sorry...

71
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,934
That leaves no spots, so...

72
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,805
Let's cut to the chase, if it seems right.

73
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,821
Yes, of course.

74
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,665
Can you assure me that you're going
to pay by the end of the month?.

75
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,923
Absolutely.

76
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,023
~ Let's see, it's roughly six million or so?.
~ Yes...

77
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,523
Thanks.

78
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,599
It's very important.

79
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,611
This week I get it covered, at the
latest within the month, and I'll...

80
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,215
Don't even think of paying by check!

81
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,421
Pardon?.

82
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,811
I don't want you to pay by check.

83
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,994
I instructed them not
to accept your checks.

84
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,809
But we've already agreed...

85
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,015
I'm sorry, but I prefer to be paid in cash.

86
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,621
But I don't carry cash.

87
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,814
Yesterday, I wanted to withdraw
200 francs from the bank
and they wouldn't let me.

88
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,914
OK, I'll pay.

89
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,872
No, it was me who invited you!

90
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,698
To invite with my money. How agreeable!

91
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,894
What can we share?.

92
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,823
It's not your problem, friend, let it go.

93
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,718
~ Is that your daughter?.
~ My wife.

94
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,521
A moment, Mr. President,
I've got to look for him.

95
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,824
Perrin isn't here?.

96
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,518
~ Perrin?.
~ Yes?.

97
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,018
Come with me.

98
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,424
The President wants to see you.

99
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,718
Hurry, he's waiting for you.

100
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,823
Come in.

101
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,515
Be seated, please.

102
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,025
Mr. de Blenac told me
that he's happy with you.

103
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,167
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,417
Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,023
We're going to sign your contract
at the beginning of the week.

106
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,821
You will become a member of the family.

107
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,289
I made a great effort so that the
magazine has become like a big family,...

108
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,276
that's why I love it...

109
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,829
and so do the readers, too.

110
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,060
Mr. President, Master Eric on line 1.

111
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,825
Yes, dear boy?. Is everything all right?.

112
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,120
You're intelligent.

113
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,065
Good, tell me what you'd like...

114
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,684
Yes, OK. You can choose it yourself.

115
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,817
A kiss, dear boy. Until later.

116
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm sorry, Mr. President, should I leave?.

117
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,375
No, no, it's OK.

118
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,213
Thanks, Mr. Perrin.

119
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,118
Good bye, Mr. President...

120
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,619
...would be the price of
12 machines, which...

121
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,822
~ Where's Nicole?.
~ Eh?.

122
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,810
~ Nicole.
~ With Mr. Moravietti.

123
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,812
~ What?.
~ With Mr. Moravietti.

124
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,814
~ And where is Mr. Moravietti?.
~ Down the corridor to the right.

125
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,891
Hi, I'm Francois Perrin, the
husband of this young lady.

126
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,824
There's someone called Moravietti,...

127
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,424
He's head of the service department,
and has been a burden for two years.

128
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,307
She cries every night.

129
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,734
Two years of nightmares,
and I've had enough of it.

130
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,618
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Moravietti.

131
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,817
But this isn't Mr. Moravietti, he's
Mr. Robert, the subdirector.

132
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,820
Mr. Moravietti just left!

133
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,219
Any problems?.

134
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,906
Anyway, I don't want to work.

135
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,319
But are you sure...?.

136
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,524
I'll have a firm contract
next week, Nicole!

137
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,804
Mr. Rambal-Cochet
personally promised me!

138
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,142
Do you know who Rambal-Cochet
is?. Can you believe it?.

139
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,018
~ Hello, Mr. President...
~ Hello, Mr. Pignet.

140
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,107
De Blenac.

141
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,314
Yes, Mr. President.

142
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,823
Come at once.

143
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,792
Mr. President?.

144
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,118
I've terminated your
contract with Mr. Pignet.

145
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,423
Pardon?.

146
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,614
I've terminated your
contract with Mr. Pignet.

147
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,822
Very well, Mr. President.

148
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,811
Why, Mr. President?.

149
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,822
He has a damp handshake.

150
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,993
What a load of crap?. How should I
know I have a damp handshake?.

151
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,025
I've never had a wet palm. You got that?.

152
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,235
This can't be real.

153
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,453
I have resources, I'll go to the union.

154
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,881
In any other company, there
would be a strike, and you...

155
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,175
In your place, I'd take care.

156
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,524
If you were in his place,
you wouldn't lift a finger.

157
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,606
However, something could be done...

158
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,406
How about to return to unemployment?.

159
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,615
Now's not the best time for the press.

160
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,823
It's in everyone's interest, not just mine.

161
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,719
GREAT TWO WEEKS OF TOYS

162
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,811
On the left, we have the
Japanese with robots,

163
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,822
electrical toys and machines
with remote controls.

164
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,821
On the right, we have Italian
and British products:....

165
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,104
cars, weapons, and small models.

166
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,022
And here --- American toys,
with an authentic Indian.

167
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,604
You can photograph these, it's true.

168
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,819
He comes from the Sioux Reservation in
the Dakotas. Only a few are still in stock.

169
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,021
It's nice, eh?.

170
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,088
Wasn't it the Sioux who rebelled
against the U.S. a few months ago?.

171
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,624
Yes, yes.

172
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,718
Good. Bravo!

173
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,015
Bad Americans...bad!

174
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,515
Good Indians...good!

175
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,818
I am with you.

176
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,823
I go...for the visit.

177
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,610
Poor guy.

178
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,568
No, no, he's not unhappy
here. He charms the kiddies.

179
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,812
We invited them on Monday,
but we expect a lot of people.

180
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,128
Today, the shop is yours.

181
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,516
~ Well, go to see by your side.
~ OK.

182
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,320
~ That.
~ Zorro?.

183
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,617
The Cosmonaut?.

184
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,517
No, that one.

185
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,921
~ The man?.
~ Yup!

186
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,611
No, no...we can't give
you him, my dear boy.

187
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,723
Why not?.

188
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,058
Well...because...

189
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,819
it's a man!

190
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,015
We can't give you a man.

191
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,724
Why not?.

192
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,823
Look, we're going to choose
the best toy in the store.

193
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,117
I want that one.

194
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,584
Yes, don't blame yourself, dear.

195
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,825
We already resolved this
--- you can't have him!

196
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,820
Don't pull a nervous act.

197
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,424
Can you be patient for just a second?.

198
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,918
Georges Puziet, manager
of the premises.

199
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,818
Do you work in Mr.
Rambal-Cochet's magazine?.

200
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,812
And you know that...

201
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,824
this shop is also Mr. Rambal-Cochet's.

202
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,323
And?.

203
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,823
His son...Rambal-Cochet's.

204
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,015
I don't know what you'll make of this...

205
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,167
but I want you to go with him.

206
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,824
Then the company will
handle it, and then...

207
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,981
you'll go back to the magazine.

208
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,914
~ Him...is he sick or what?.
~ No, no, listen...

209
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,505
It's a very serious matter.

210
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,523
Mr. Rambal has ordered
me to please his son...

211
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,324
He's a very sensible lad.

212
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,617
I don't want to have a
nervous breakdown here.

213
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,711
Yeah, but I'm a journalist!

214
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,371
And I am the director of the shop,
and I want to stay that way.

215
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,317
Well, then?.

216
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,815
A moment, dearest.

217
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,811
He's going to have a nervous breakdown!

218
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,823
No one would believe such
an absurd development!

219
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,995
And we'll be on a blacklist.

220
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,606
And why aren't you going?.

221
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,622
He doesn't want me, he wants you!

222
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,822
He doesn't want the Indian?.

223
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,005
OK...this is ridiculous, but in the end...

224
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,808
Great, thanks! This has saved us, buddy!

225
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,674
We're going --- announce the good news.

226
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,822
It's solved, my dear boy.

227
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,018
The gentleman will go with you.

228
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,875
I'd like him crated up.

229
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,523
I'd like him crated up.

230
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,906
That's not possible, my dear boy.

231
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,965
You cannot put this gentleman in a...

232
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,419
Why not?.

233
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,311
OK...well, because it isn't done...

234
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,623
Yes!

235
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,721
Well, I'll get back to work,
if you'll excuse me...

236
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,374
Listen to me!

237
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,506
You must follow the rules!
Don't be stupid, I tell you!

238
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,817
What?.

239
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,721
I won't be useful in a box!
What's wrong with your head?.

240
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,811
You'll see, it'll be very comfortable.

241
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,870
It's a synthetic with holes for breathing.
It'll be just as comfy as a chair...

242
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,120
You can't be serious!

243
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,122
And I want tape wrapped
around it! What I hope for is
a good night by the fireplace.

244
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,415
Do you prefer being unemployed?.

245
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,824
We're going to do this, don't be
stupid. Tell yourself it's just a game...

246
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,988
a dramatization.

247
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,515
Master Eric's present has arrived.

248
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,418
Finish up your meal, Master Eric.

249
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,424
Master Eric!

250
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,652
You must finish lunch, Master Eric!

251
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,811
Help me.

252
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,811
We're going to be opening it soon.

253
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,321
You can't get up from the table.

254
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,614
Are you listening to me?.

255
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,114
Return at once to the table, or it
won't be opened until tomorrow!

256
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,224
Eh?. Oh, no!

257
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,522
What's going on here?.

258
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,817
~ She doesn't want me
to open my present.
~ How come?.

259
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,811
Have you been naughty?.

260
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,880
I'm sorry, but I'd rather leave here.

261
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,578
~ What's that?.
~ My present.

262
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,624
Look for a couple of tools.

263
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,420
Step on it!

264
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,612
Who is it?.

265
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,406
Francois Perrin, Mr. President.

266
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,548
I'm one of your journalists.

267
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,522
~ What's the meaning of this?.
~ Nothing, he's my present.

268
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,224
I was doing a feature at the shop, and
your son wanted to bring me here.

269
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,822
Let's go, let's finish dinner.

270
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,822
What are you waiting for?.

271
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,221
~ What's your name again?.
~ Perrin. Francois Perrin.

272
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,818
Oh, yes, excellent!

273
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,325
Well, Mr. Perrin, I'm pleased to see
that my son has a sense of humor.

274
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,010
He's been well-behaved recently
--- I was planning to reward him.

275
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,419
He's pulled off a good joke.

276
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,205
Let's put an end to this minor
farce, and you can go home.

277
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,123
I'll ask the editor to give you a
small bonus for this little stunt.

278
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,802
Don't bother, Mr. President. Excuse me...

279
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,813
He's a child. It's understood
that they like a bit of fun.

280
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,118
I enjoy kids...excuse me...

281
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,160
I told this gentleman that I'm happy
my son has a sense of humor.

282
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,879
And now that we've all had our
little laugh, he can go home.

283
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,869
Let's go, my dear boy, say
thank you and goodbye.

284
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,511
He's mine and I want him.

285
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,763
Come with me.

286
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,814
You'll live here a few days ---
I hope that's not a problem?.

287
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,415
I'll tell the editor-in-chief that
you're working on some stories.

288
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,075
I'll make sure you're well taken care of.

289
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,421
See my secretary to settle the details.

290
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,517
But this is totally nuts!

291
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,201
Do you want to leave?.

292
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,141
I'm going to send you to my secretary.

293
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,721
Hello, sir. I'm Mr. Rambal-Cochet's
personal assistant.

294
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,020
So...you need pyjamas, hygienic items...

295
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,193
Do you use an electric razor?.

296
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,456
~ De Blenac?.
~ Yes.

297
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,804
~ I'm calling from the
Rambal-Cochets' house.
~ Yes, I know.

298
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,811
Good, then listen well:...

299
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,642
Tell Mr. Rambal-Cochet that the
joke has gone on long enough.

300
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,005
My place is in the editorial
office, not in his son's playroom.

301
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,807
I'm a professional journalist. I've been
working in the press for 15 years.

302
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,004
I'm not accustomed to
being treated like a toy.

303
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,124
Everything will be OK, relax!

304
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,814
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Promise me you won't run off.

305
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,823
~ Promise?.
~ Yes, OK --- but hurry!

306
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,822
~ Are you coming?.
~ Where to?.

307
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,615
To tour the house.

308
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,824
You'll need this.

309
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,817
Ready?.

310
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,819
My room.

311
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,621
This is not the first time
that the Council of...

312
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,578
The office of my father.

313
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,219
Don't be scared.

314
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,706
That was his lunch, Dude.

315
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,187
It was your fault.

316
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,724
Pay the fine.

317
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,936
It's an accident, but
you have a part to play.

318
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,314
But I don't know anything!

319
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,416
It's easy, ask for their documents
and so on. Let's move it.

320
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,051
My license and my ID, Inspector.

321
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,362
Crossed in amber but
not in red, Inspector.

322
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,319
Very well.

323
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,522
Take this test for DUI.

324
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,517
Blow.

325
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,814
Blow!

326
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,813
Can I clean up the
dishes now, Master Eric?.

327
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,220
~ Yes, yes, we're going?.
~ Are you coming?.

328
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,496
What are you up to?.

329
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,774
I'm not done yet.

330
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,416
Their brightwork's dirty, sir.

331
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,822
No, play something else.

332
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,706
Look at this tire! Get out of the car.

333
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,723
~ I said we'd play something else.
~ Get out of the car!

334
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,823
By what right are you
using "'tu"' with me?.

335
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,811
You addressed me that
way. I have witnesses!

336
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,017
Yes, you so addressed the inspector, sir.

337
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,811
Come with me!

338
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,025
I'm Eric Rambal-Cochet.

339
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,667
So what, keep moving!

340
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,517
~ What's there?.
~ A cupboard, sir.

341
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,655
Good, let's go.

342
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,822
You're nuts! Let me go! Open up!

343
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,224
What's going on?.

344
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,522
We're playing, Mr. President.

345
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,314
~ You're crazy?.!
~ What's happening, Eric?.

346
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,815
Nothing. We're playing.

347
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,824
Are you coming?.

348
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,622
Good, Julien.

349
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,821
Be careful!

350
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,718
~ What's your name
~ Francois.

351
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,616
No, your name's Julien.

352
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,004
You're my friend, Julien.

353
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,004
How long do I have to be here?.

354
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,043
I have a wife who's
expecting me, you got that?.

355
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,841
I have a profession. A proper life.

356
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,174
What am I doing here?.

357
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,823
~ You want to play?.
~ I asked you a question.

358
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,118
Every time I score a goal,
you get an extra year.

359
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,788
Right, let's begin.

360
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,520
And if I win?.

361
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,621
You can go.

362
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,288
You know, I played
pretty well in my youth.

363
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,514
Let's see.

364
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,821
One year.

365
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,048
I wasn't ready.

366
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,819
Two years.

367
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,821
Are you playing?.

368
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,301
How many are there here?.

369
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,615
~ I'm sorry?.
~ How many employees are there?.

370
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,625
14, sir.

371
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,018
If you have to look hard,
will the others come?.

372
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,189
We'll be able to have a huge party, right?.

373
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,900
Well, be that as it may, I'm still finishing.

374
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,717
Come on, let's go!

375
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,814
2-0.

376
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,817
2- 1.

377
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,814
2-2.

378
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,421
3-2.

379
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,814
Are you deserting?.

380
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,081
You play very well.

381
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,870
Then I won.

382
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,723
Why can't I go, then?.

383
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,916
Don't get fooled, Julien
--- you're well-off here!

384
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,261
Dad will give you a big heap of cash.

385
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,644
Where are you going?.

386
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,139
~ I'm lost!
~ Stay or I holler for my Dad.

387
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,082
I don't believe you.

388
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,946
Damned spoiled rich kid ---
you should get a good beating.

389
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,819
That's not why you were sent here.

390
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,901
~ You think?.
~ Just try it.

391
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,425
~ Are you happy, my dear boy?.
~ Yes, very.

392
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,785
We played football, now we're
going to play ping-pong.

393
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,681
No, I think it's time to go riding.

394
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,625
Go change your clothes.
I'll wait down there.

395
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,219
Do we bury the hatchet?.

396
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,822
What do you need from me?.

397
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,017
~ We'll go together.
~ What?.

398
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,824
We'll go together.

399
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,573
But I can't do this!

400
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,618
I've never been on a horse.

401
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,117
What's this?.

402
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,514
Your riding gear.

403
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,912
Perrin, This is de Blenac. I'm late
with the magazine. I'm very sorry.

404
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,821
Oh, sure. Now that you want
to get up on horseback...

405
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,117
The kid. You want me to ride a
horse, and to see me act the clown.

406
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,415
We must put an end to this
atrocity, do you hear me?.

407
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,357
Hang on, Perrin, don't
get pissed, calm down.

408
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,207
You'll receive a humongous surprise.

409
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,875
Courage --- it'll be worth it, believe me!

410
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,995
I already warned your son that
I don't know how to mount...

411
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,438
Or dismount, for that matter.

412
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,822
Good, they'll go without me.

413
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,822
Penny for your thoughts.

414
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,730
Is something wrong?.

415
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,324
~ My wristband!...I've lost my wristband!
~ Stop!

416
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,914
~ Right, are you happy now?.
~ Forward.

417
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,617
Are you out of your mind?.

418
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,516
You were right. He fell.

419
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,060
I've been dismissed, friends.

420
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,821
Why?.

421
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,820
I don't know. Dismissed...

422
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,459
Maybe because I was
in the shop with Perrin?.

423
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,117
I have no idea.

424
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,724
So I've have been chucked out, too.

425
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,102
Oh, it was just a small bump.

426
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,708
I took the liberty of phoning your wife.

427
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,623
I told her you're doing a story
and not to wait up for you.

428
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,814
Here's the surprise he mentioned...

429
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,752
Your contract.

430
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,019
The President was to
finalize it next week.

431
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,980
But now he seems likely
to fix it right now,...

432
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,379
to compensate you for
the inconveniences.

433
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,880
And a bonus check.

434
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,116
Look at the zeros! Look!

435
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,336
As I see it, this is a grand
gesture of esteem, right?.

436
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,624
Well, I'll leave you --- I should go.

437
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,723
Goodbye and good luck!

438
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,381
Your wife will go mad with joy!

439
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,424
De Blenac.

440
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,716
Buying a journalist as a toy...

441
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,601
that seems normal to you?.

442
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,517
There's probably 2,000 people
looking for work in the press.

443
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,017
~ Take this?.
~ What is it?.

444
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,758
Open it!

445
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,332
Sorry for what the horse did...

446
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,921
I bought it myself. Nice, huh?.

447
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,821
Yes, it's nice.

448
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,020
~ Your bath is ready, Master Eric.
~ We don't take a bath together?.

449
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,811
You're much to big to take a bath
with someone else, Master Eric.

450
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,923
And go on.

451
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,965
He's coming with me.

452
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,721
~ It's already beginning...
~ I'm looking for his father...

453
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,808
We'll have a naval battle.

454
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,722
Listen, Master Eric, I'm
looking for your father...

455
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,617
Leave me alone.

456
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,663
Why are you staying here with me?.

457
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,218
Is it very hard to find
work as a governess?.

458
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,935
Where's the bathroom?.

459
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,221
~ You're not going to take a bath with...
~ It's right here.

460
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,074
Master Eric, I ask you, please...

461
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,620
No one can come into the bath room...

462
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,823
Master Eric!

463
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,424
Which end do you want?.

464
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,398
It's a joke --- I won't
take a bath with you.

465
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,414
~ Oh, good ~ Just wait in the
room --- it's a joke, I tell you.

466
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,424
It's not a joke.

467
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,120
Well done, Julien, bravo!

468
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,755
Pleased to meet you, Julien.

469
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,519
Hi.

470
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,821
Ma'am...

471
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,726
Is everything alright?.

472
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,134
~ Do you like our house?.
~ I have no choice.

473
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,817
Sorry...

474
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,684
Go on, blot it dry. It might not stain...

475
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,535
Take it.

476
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,417
Wait!

477
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,723
Let's go!

478
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,117
Your dinner, sir...

479
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,523
~ What about the monster?.
~ Excuse me?.

480
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,814
~ Is the little monster asleep?.
~ I don't know, sir.

481
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,818
Do you really like that beard?.

482
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,058
Mr. Rambal-Cochet has
a loathing for beards.

483
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,117
Well, his wife will be delirious with joy.

484
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,220
Our magazine is a big family, Mr. Perrin.

485
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,524
That's why I love it
and so do the readers.

486
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,824
Oh, shit!

487
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,822
Did I startle you?.

488
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,734
You're funny when you play by yourself.

489
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,723
You have no luck with food.

490
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,417
Are you pissed off?.

491
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,240
No, I'm fine.

492
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,822
Yes, you're pissed.

493
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,894
Take this, it's good.

494
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,822
It's very good, I tell you.

495
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,324
What are you waiting for?.

496
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,317
It's bed time, Master Eric.

497
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,775
Your dad's waiting to give you a kiss.

498
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,618
Do you want to come say good night?.

499
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,114
I'll wait for you, OK?.

500
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,825
~ Good night.
~ Ma'am.

501
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,415
~ Are you looking for something?.
~ The...uh...the bathroom.

502
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,185
Come along, I'll show you.

503
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,971
I want to talk with your husband,
I can't really do much else here.

504
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,720
I want to go home.

505
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,165
I'm working on that ---
you'll be home soon.

506
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,014
Here it is.

507
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,775
Thanks, you've been very kind.

508
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,475
You're the only sensible person
I've found in the whole house.

509
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,592
This is the gentleman
the child bought at noon.

510
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,815
Excuse me a moment.

511
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,315
Sir, please.

512
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,014
~ My suit.
~ I'm sorry?.

513
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,011
~ My suit.
~ It's in the laundry, sir.

514
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,612
~ Go look for it.
~ But it's not dry, sir.

515
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,815
Bring me my clothing!

516
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,415
What's going on?.

517
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,798
You can't treat people like this! It can't
be done. I'm voiding the contract.

518
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,813
Give it to your father. I've
gone crazy since I arrived!

519
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:48,106
You stay here! I bought you in
the shop! You belong to me!

520
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,697
They're not bringing you that suit.

521
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,017
Who's there?.

522
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,534
Weren't you doing stories?.

523
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,819
Are you hurt?.

524
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,464
What's with the pyjamas?.

525
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,188
A story of lunatics, you see.

526
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,509
De Blenac?. I want to see him at once.

527
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,818
I said right now!

528
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,954
Everything will turn out OK, my dear.

529
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,725
You did everything right.

530
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,046
I'm sure it'll be fine.

531
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,214
I'm not very popular in Rambal-Cochet's
home just at the moment.

532
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,815
What's going on?.

533
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,817
~ Who is it?.
~ De Blenac.

534
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,911
I have to talk with you. May I come in?.

535
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,047
There's no point, there's
nothing to be said.

536
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,812
I apologize for hassling you, but...

537
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,597
President Rambal-Cochet
asked me to come see you.

538
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,614
He asks that this wait until
another time. He'll expect you.

539
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,213
Tell him he's crazy and just as
spoiled as his son. Good evening.

540
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,788
He's a poor kid.

541
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,117
A poor child?.

542
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,822
He's the son of his first marriage.

543
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,859
He lives with his father only
for one month each year.

544
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,820
That explains the indulgences
of President Rambal-Cochet.

545
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,812
The boy will return to his
mother within the week.

546
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,812
You could try, just a little.
It won't be for long.

547
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,822
A week...

548
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:21,316
After I took sleeping pills,
I went to sleep and then...

549
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,276
he woke me up...

550
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,814
Good night, Perrin. Good luck.

551
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,321
De Blenac!

552
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,518
Come along.

553
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,569
We're going to do something.

554
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,015
You see, he's back already.

555
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,015
Turn in now.

556
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,725
Sleep well, Julien.

557
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,810
You can't come in here, sir.

558
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,323
~ I have to talk with Mr. Perrin.
~ Who?.

559
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,819
Perrin, Francois Perrin.

560
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,820
There's no Mr. Perrin here.

561
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,048
Yes, yesterday he was
brought here in a box...

562
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,552
Oh, yes. Just a moment.

563
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,478
Is everything OK?.

564
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,809
Poor...

565
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,811
Thanks for coming to see me.

566
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,811
Do you know I got fired on your account?.

567
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,821
You're joking, right?.

568
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,410
It's no joke. Drop by any time.

569
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,775
~ Who are they?.
~ The folks from "'Le Syndicat"'.

570
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,528
They want to disrupt
Rambal-Cochet's feast.

571
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:33,725
Let's go, come along with us.
There's nothing to be done here.

572
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,389
What do you think, that they'll
take you back at the magazine?.

573
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,334
Get changed, let's go.

574
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,821
Hands up, Julien!

575
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,014
Start praying.

576
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,822
Give me a chance, Jim!

577
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,330
~ Fine, agreed.
~ Perrin...

578
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,012
We're meeting up on the
main street in a few minutes.

579
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,534
~ The sooner the better.
~ See you, Julien.

580
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,815
Perrin, for God's sake!

581
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,819
One second.

582
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,417
Sorry.

583
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,116
Be careful, Mr. Perrin.

584
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,175
It's to entertain your son, Mr. President.

585
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,459
After all this, you're still
making me come back, right?.

586
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,822
Then I can leave if you want.

587
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,889
Thank you, ma'am.

588
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,814
Stop messing around. Perrin!

589
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,822
Enough bull, you got that?.!

590
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,073
You play dead well, agreed?.

591
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,822
Here they are, Perrin.

592
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,814
Can you give us a
moment, Mr. President?.

593
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,822
~ If the police arrive late...
~ Dance...!

594
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,821
~ Pardon?.
~ Dance!

595
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,243
Let's go. Come with us.

596
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,820
You coming, Julien?.

597
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,821
Indians! Out of here!

598
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,822
For our liberty!

599
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,889
No to the firings!

600
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,317
Indians!...Here come the Indians!

601
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,225
Eric!

602
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,968
Indians! Sound the alarm!

603
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,520
Put all the carts in a circle!
Abandon the caravan!

604
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,535
It's the cavalry!

605
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,221
They always arrive just in time!

606
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,221
Find something else to do.

607
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,917
Hang on --- give me a second.

608
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:33,458
Do you know how it feels
standing among a bunch of
strangers in your pyjamas?.

609
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:36,832
I'll show you!

610
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,963
Let's make a magazine.

611
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,505
I'll teach you journalism. It's easy.

612
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,420
We'll start with the accident.

613
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,822
The train jumped its tracks...

614
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,278
I'm the editor in chief...

615
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,835
and I call you to my office.

616
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,508
Hi, Coco.

617
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,603
I've named you Coco because
everyone's named Coco in journalism.

618
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,314
There's been a serious train
wreck in the USA, Coco.

619
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,514
You investigate it.

620
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,420
Not in the USA.

621
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,220
Not in the USA, this happened in France.

622
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,809
How come?.

623
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:45,211
Dad says the readers are
only interested in France.

624
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,823
You know nothing, I'm
going to be the editor.

625
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,811
I'm listening.

626
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,811
We need a title --- I propose...

627
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:04,824
"'Serious train wreck in Lyon, 80 victims."'

628
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,514
~ I don't like this train wreck
~ Why not?.

629
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,520
I don't like it.

630
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,832
"'The Paris-Lyon express
derailed. 80 victims."'

631
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,655
That's the headline.

632
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,072
I've been a pro journalist for 15 years. I
think I know the style of headline writers.

633
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,807
If you had style, you'd be
the editor instead of me.

634
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,811
Quit calling me Coco.

635
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,185
Don't blame yourself, Julien.

636
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,915
You're not playing anymore?.

637
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,822
Look at this.

638
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,816
It's fun working on a magazine.

639
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,406
You get to interview people,
to learn about their lives.

640
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,718
We're going to call the
President, for example.

641
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,808
He'll be a very rich guy --- very strong.

642
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,015
He could buy anything with his money.

643
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,696
We'll talk about all the President's
adventures from one day to the next.

644
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:24,554
Isn't that fun?.

645
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,166
He'll have a family.

646
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,665
His wife will be very
much younger than him.

647
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:41,704
He'll have a son, who detests her...

648
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,890
because she replaced his mother.

649
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:54,880
And the boy, knowing that his
father had bought this new wife...

650
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:01,188
might do the same to
him, as a punishment.

651
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:06,983
One day he bought a man in a shop.

652
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,825
This will make your magazine.

653
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,821
This will do.

654
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,419
Let's go.

655
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,284
~ You don't know the owner?.
~ No!

656
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,821
~ Was his demeanor casual?.
~ Yes, yes.

657
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:47,722
Sir, ma'am, hello. I'm Rambal-Cochet.

658
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,302
Pardon the interruption --- I
have to ask you something.

659
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,504
Sir...

660
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,522
Go on, please.

661
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,324
~ How much would your house cost?.
~ It's not for sale, sir.

662
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:06,745
I didn't ask if it were for sale, I
just want to know what it's worth.

663
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:12,814
I don't know. I've paid
60 million over five years.

664
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,277
Now it's probably worth 80 or 90.

665
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,015
I'll give you 200.

666
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,822
Is this a joke?.

667
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,921
200 million is apparently a good price.

668
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,714
Three.

669
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,714
How's that?.

670
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,818
300 million, if you leave this instant.

671
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,814
I don't understand.

672
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,815
Stuff the suitcases and head off.

673
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,821
But this is impossible!

674
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,884
You've got one minute to think it over.

675
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,824
Well, can you leave the
house for a minute?.

676
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,541
Right now.

677
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,720
Take it or leave it, you have 30 seconds.

678
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,819
Good...

679
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,715
Very well, I'll get ready...

680
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,820
Good...Let's go.

681
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,712
A letter from your son, Mr. President.

682
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,332
From my son?.

683
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,084
"'THE TOY"'. Editor in
Chief: Eric Rambal-Cochet.

684
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,546
Reporter: Francois Perrin.

685
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,164
Thank you, Miss.

686
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,826
"'How does President Rambal-Cochet
acquire his properties?. "'

687
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,207
~ Where's Eric?.
~ He's gone out, sir.

688
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,506
~ Where to?.
~ I have no idea, they left together.

689
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,818
Let me know when they get back.

690
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,833
I'll ruin you. You'll be smeared for life!

691
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:28,297
Hey, Pignet.

692
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,345
~ What's the meaning of this?.
~ Don't worry, it's a survey.

693
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:34,905
What survey?.

694
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,820
A new survey. For a new magazine.

695
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,705
The title is magnificent: "'The Toys
of President Rambal-Cochet"'.

696
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:45,116
~ What?.
~ It's a free-sheet. Great, huh?.

697
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:49,812
May I present the editor-in-chief,
Eric Rambal-Cochet.

698
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,999
Oh, Rambal-Cochet?.

699
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,641
Let's go. Thanks, Pignet. See you around.

700
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,595
The truth is he does
have a damp handshake.

701
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:11,137
He sent me to get shaved...

702
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:15,555
I responded that many good
engineers have beards.

703
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,117
And I refused.

704
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,720
And you couldn't find a job?.

705
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,219
No, nothing.

706
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,414
I'm going to my mom at
the end of the month.

707
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,804
We've got a big house.

708
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,823
With a swimming pool
where you can bathe.

709
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,808
Are you free just now, Mr. President?.

710
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,822
No. Not now.

711
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,715
Do you want me to be the goalkeeper?.

712
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,536
Let's go!

713
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,622
You have to come with me.

714
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,408
Don't worry about me.

715
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,810
If you call me, I'll come...

716
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,818
You'll call me, Francois?.

717
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,230
You don't call me Julien anymore?.

718
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,817
I have to talk with you.

719
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,118
Leave us alone for a moment, please.

720
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,814
You're waiting for me?.

721
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,014
Wait in my room.

722
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,016
You're a very good journalist, Mr. Perrin.

723
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,242
I have a good
editor-in-chief, Mr. President.

724
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,818
What is it that you want, exactly?.

725
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,824
Nothing, Mr. President.

726
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,821
Well, then, why this
ridiculous provocation?.

727
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,885
I'll explain.

728
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,408
Back when I was an
employee, Mr. President,...

729
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,800
I didn't have the right to express myself,
I censored myself, and I was scared.

730
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:11,825
Now I don't have to answer to anybody.

731
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:14,253
I'm a toy.

732
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,388
So now I can speak.

733
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:25,080
I wonder what's the point, maybe
I should go back to the magazine.

734
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:32,156
I need a bunch of information and I
know now that you're just the right man.

735
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,018
I'm a simple man --- what
do you think, Mr. Perrin?.

736
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:46,823
Hello, Paul, how's things?.

737
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,822
Sir, I'm not Paul, I'm Lucien.

738
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,115
I'm Paul, sir.

739
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:56,816
Yes, of course. Then, Paul, how is your
daughter's heart trouble, improving?.

740
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,524
I have a son, sir. It's Lucien
who has a daughter...

741
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,814
Good --- is she better?.

742
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,823
Yes, she's better. It was the mumps, sir.

743
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,024
These shrubs aren't lined up right.

744
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,813
I need a chief information officer. But it
should be someone prudent, Mr. Perrin.

745
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:17,119
I advise you to play something
else, something more prudent.

746
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:24,623
"'The Toys of the President:
6000 employees --- 6000 toys."'

747
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,118
Well?.

748
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,224
He was very polite.

749
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:46,824
I hear you're a good
journalist....very good.

750
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,368
Are you offered work?.

751
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,287
In fact, he offered me a bribe.

752
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,995
If I drop this, I'll be appointed
head of information.

753
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,914
~ So it goes, my little comrade.
~ Let's stop it.

754
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,572
Yes, we cancel, that's much better.

755
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,594
You can go home if you want, Francois.

756
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,823
"'The Toys of the President:
6000 employees ~ 6000 toys."'

757
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,830
It's a pity, it was a good magazine.

758
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,814
~ Is there a copier?.
~ What?.

759
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,936
There's a photocopier in
the house, isn't there?.

760
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,817
Foucault!

761
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,701
If I see another copy of this foolishness,
you'll have to deal with me, understood?.

762
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,994
Good day, de Blenac.
Good day, Foucault.

763
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,905
~ Mr. President...
~ What?.

764
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:02,696
There were 50 copies
distributed this morning.

765
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:09,621
Like this. Francois Perrin
and...and your son.

766
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,296
The whole world's got
a copy, Mr. President...

767
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,314
What's going on here?.
Why aren't you working?.

768
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:37,209
I want to see all the copies
which were produced.

769
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,450
Very well, Mr. President, right away.

770
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:47,821
Come in!

771
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,815
Here, Mr. President: the
dance of the Greek princess...

772
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,516
There was all the rage.

773
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,810
An interview with Claude Francois.

774
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,869
He appears at his moment
of triumph at the Olympia.

775
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,813
There's a new naturist club here.

776
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,811
It opened for Paris.

777
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,822
I believe this will titillate our readers.

778
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,821
Leave it, I can see for myself.

779
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,417
Very good, Mr. President.

780
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,641
Do you consider this
exhibition of meat tasteful?.

781
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,323
Naturism is recently much in vogue.

782
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,517
That was the original club ---

783
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,419
Knoll's furniture, choice,
the high quality and...

784
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,621
Get undressed.

785
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,616
Get undressed.

786
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,112
The whole editorial staff will be naked.

787
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,827
We'll have a chance
to evaluate its impact.

788
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,314
Mr. President, I...

789
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,120
I told you to strip.

790
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,117
What are you up to, de Blenac?.

791
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,119
I'm getting undressed, Mr. President.

792
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:28,509
If you don't stop, you'll be
naked and in everybody's mind.

793
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,123
I didn't ask for this, Mr. President.

794
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:36,116
I'm going to ask an important
question, de Blenac.

795
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,115
Which of the two of us is the monster?.

796
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:44,016
What I'm asking you to do is take
off your pants and flash your butt.

797
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,299
I don't know, sir...

798
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,122
The whole problem is here, I believe.

799
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,062
You can go, Mr. Perrin.

800
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:11,118
You're no longer needed.

801
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:16,244
I will explain to my son.

802
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,683
He'll understand it well enough.

803
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,637
He surely knows now what
kind of person you are.

804
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,251
This has caused resentment.

805
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,739
He knew that from the
moment you arrived here.

806
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:34,135
You think only of the
expansion of his world.

807
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,718
You don't get it yet, Mr. Perrin.

808
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,923
You're free.

809
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,346
I wanted to give your son
a chance, Mr. President.

810
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,123
The worst of it is that he
could become like you.

811
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,895
Yet that can still be avoided.

812
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,123
I will control you, Mr. Perrin.

813
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,117
I was a present for him, you understand.

814
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,838
I can't tell him goodbye?.

815
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,220
It's not necessary.

816
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:36,451
This is called "'Jet Stream"', it's not
for the pool, but for the ocean.

817
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,720
You can swim either with
or against the current,...

818
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,002
you see, it's very strong.

819
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,624
Your mother told me that the
installation is almost completed.

820
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,974
It'll be even more difficult to
dry off from swimming now.

821
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,428
Call me as soon as you
arrive, don't forget.

822
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:03,617
Your departure has been
moved up by eight days.

823
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:09,417
I'd like us to go the US, to
Disneyworld, for example.

824
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,624
That's not a bad idea, eh?.

825
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,117
~ Hi, Moro.
~ Mr. President. How's things, Eric?.

826
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:28,414
Perrin?. This is Rambal-Cochet,
Eric has run off. We're sure
he went to your house.

827
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,014
I'm on the way.

828
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,862
You got the readies for
a cab?. I'm flat broke.

829
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,939
Your father's on the way here.

830
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,122
Don't sweat it.

831
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,118
We'll still be together and
we'll continue the magazine.

832
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,404
No, it's not a game anymore.

833
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,314
What did I say?. No more
playing. You go with your father.

834
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,915
~ I want to be with you.
~ This is impossible.

835
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,112
~ Why not?.
~ Because you've got a family.

836
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,009
A father, a mother --- they love you.

837
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,122
You've grown since the
incident with the jacket.

838
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,125
Are you listening?. Leave me in peace!

839
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,018
No, I want to stay with you.

840
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,724
But I'm nobody!

841
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,913
I don't have a job, no money, nothing!

842
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,163
Even if your father calls, I can't.
I'm poor, do you understand?.

843
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,119
He's here.

844
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,021
~ What's going on?.
Are you crazy or what?.
~ I don't want to go with you!

845
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,611
If you wouldn't welcome
him, he wouldn't run off.

846
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,020
But until a time comes
when I have to, shit!

847
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,908
I told you I'm tired! Tired of
Rambal-Cochet, father and son!

848
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,706
Time flies --- I've got to eat.

849
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,518
We're not going to play
another game. Beat it!

850
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:18,925
Thank you, Mr. Perrin, call me tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do for you.

851
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,914
Everything I do in my
life is for you, my love.

852
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,540
Everything I have is yours.

853
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,565
You're my only reason for
going on, you understand?.

854
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,828
He's a poor type, just like one of
millions. He has nothing to offer you.

855
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:46,684
Nothing.

856
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:50,544
Think about what you'd
lose by being with him.
