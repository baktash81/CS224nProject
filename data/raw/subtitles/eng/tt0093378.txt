1
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,353
Richie...

2
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,025
...time to get up.

3
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:15,800
The harder you work, the more you're paid.
What's holding you up?

4
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,606
Come on, we're wasting money.

5
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,039
"Don't you touch me," I says.

6
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,998
"I'm tired of being hit by men, already."

7
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,335
So, I punched him.

8
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:19,172
His feet went up, and when he hit
the floor, I thought he was dead.

9
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:23,341
I says to him, "Sweetheart,
if you don't like it, you can lam it."

10
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,386
So he lammed it.

11
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,614
Richie?

12
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:46,284
Bob?

13
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,120
Richie, you taking a break already?

14
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:56,787
So, Mr. Big Shot...

15
00:04:57,758 --> 00:04:59,133
...you finally showed up.

16
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:01,709
I'm lucky I even found this place.

17
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,628
Rosie...

18
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:06,724
...this is my brother, Bob.

19
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,219
Why did you wait a year to join us?

20
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,606
Bob, watch it! My guitar, man.

21
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:27,734
Sorry, I didn't know that piece of junk
was so important to you.

22
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,371
I even sleep with it.

23
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,786
It's no hole.

24
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,574
Come on.

25
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,421
Jersey Joe.

26
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,046
Joe Louis.

27
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,178
Rocky Marciano.

28
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,629
You okay? Can you move it?

29
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:50,883
You all right?

30
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,014
Can you move it?

31
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:57,817
You've grown, cabron.

32
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,107
You're a big sucker for 16.

33
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,688
- What's the matter, you miss me?
- No.

34
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:04,773
You should have.

35
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,445
What was it like inside?

36
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,496
The joint is the joint.

37
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,538
Why didn't you come home
after you got out?

38
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,241
We haven't had a home since Steve died.

39
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,872
Don't be such a dreamer, man.

40
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:23,041
My dreams are pure rock 'n' roll.

41
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,811
- Go wash your hands for dinner.
- Okay, mama.

42
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,340
You little pigs.
I'm going to tell your mothers on you.

43
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:06,707
Wait and see!

44
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,263
You tell 'em, Rosie!

45
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,679
Mom, what in hell are you doing here?

46
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,312
Working.

47
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,440
I came to take you out of this dump.

48
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,361
Not before we make some money.

49
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:35,873
I mean honest money.

50
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,459
I've been working.
Why can't you believe for once?

51
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,290
Mom, what's going on?

52
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:53,099
We're getting out
of this shit hole tomorrow.

53
00:07:58,689 --> 00:07:59,720
Okay.

54
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,236
Oh, God.

55
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,451
Oh, please.

56
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,636
Tell me you love me.

57
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,955
Why didn't you tell me
this was your first time?

58
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,750
You didn't ask.

59
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,092
You coming, Richie?

60
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,848
No, I'll wait up a while.

61
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,623
You're really something, you know?

62
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,016
What's up?

63
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,987
I should ask you.

64
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,662
Wait a minute.

65
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,001
Did I horn in on you?

66
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:27,165
Just forget it.

67
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,999
I thought you'd changed.

68
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,130
Come on!

69
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,806
Come stay with us sometime.

70
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:43,260
Bob got us a house in Pacoima.
We could visit L.A.

71
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,846
You'll be late for work.

72
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,815
My dad wouldn't like it.

73
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,347
Come on, let's go.

74
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,771
I love you.

75
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,689
'Bye, Connie.

76
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,145
Goodbye.

77
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,370
'Bye, Rosie.

78
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:31,433
Rosa!

79
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:00,672
Connie, don't let the baby fall
off the chair.

80
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,022
Breakfast is ready. I'm off to work.

81
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,397
- Don't ditch school today.
- Thanks, mom.

82
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:21,192
Rosie, the baby's with the girls.
See you tonight.

83
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:38,995
Quiet.

84
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:40,668
Class is in session.

85
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,399
Take out your history books. Chapter 7.

86
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,397
Who is the blonde?

87
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:05,741
I don't know. But I think I'm in love.

88
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,066
Forget it.

89
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,486
She's way above your class, High Tone.

90
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,655
Just concentrate on that audition tonight.

91
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,301
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,886
They call me High Tone. You?

93
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,101
Donna.

94
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:37,980
Mind if I walk with you, Donna?

95
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,687
Sure.

96
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,650
I mean, no, I don't mind.

97
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,273
Donna. That's a nice name.

98
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,609
Look, call me Richie.

99
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,906
This is my class.

100
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,619
Where's yours?

101
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:00,954
In the gym. I have P.E.

102
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,339
You're late.

103
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,792
Yeah.

104
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,381
'Bye...

105
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,133
...Donna.

106
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,139
'Bye, High Tone.

107
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,028
Say, Ed...

108
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,825
...you wanna buy a kilo?

109
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,666
You did it, carnalito!

110
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:46,916
By the sweat of my balls.

111
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,168
You did it!

112
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,376
All right.

113
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,129
Richie, meet Rudy.

114
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,552
He's leader of the Silhouettes.

115
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,802
Look, Valenzuela...

116
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,474
...Chino tells me you're a hot shot.

117
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:43,894
What's that?

118
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:46,604
- My amp.
- Looks like someone threw it away.

119
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,355
Well, it's mine now.

120
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,576
So, don't worry about it.

121
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,724
No lie!

122
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:04,597
The pendejo was smoking weed.
He was smoking milkweed!

123
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,725
I got him back.

124
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,978
Go on, Rosie, take a hit, man!

125
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:16,772
Put a little mota in our love life.

126
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,871
Baby, I need some action tonight.

127
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,338
Come on, baby.

128
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,306
Rosie, come here. I was only joking.

129
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,723
Open the door.

130
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,395
Go away.

131
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,643
Know what? Let's get going.

132
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:55,947
- Go where?
- Home.

133
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:57,984
Other people sleep, you know.

134
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,952
You don't have to split.

135
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,532
Rosie, we're leaving.

136
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:07,911
I'm serious. Stick around.
Rosie'll be out in a second.

137
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,329
Rosie, come on out!

138
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:12,622
Hassle it out with your old lady.

139
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,919
I know what's happening.

140
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,849
Good night, Bob.

141
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,389
Come on, Rosie.

142
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,767
Open the door.

143
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,824
I said, "Open the door," goddamn it!

144
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,070
Stop it. I'm trying to sleep.

145
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,578
Open the goddamn door!

146
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:50,291
Leave me alone! Go away!
Go get drunk for all I care.

147
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,327
Okay, babe, you asked for it.

148
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:12,263
Our first gig's next Friday night.
Let me see if you're ready by then.

149
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,473
Right.

150
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,077
Rosie, are you okay?

151
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,992
Yeah, Richie, what do you want?

152
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,541
Nothing.

153
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,124
Sorry, my mistake.

154
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,502
No, Bob. It's no use. No more.

155
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:47,472
Don't you ever get enough?
Is this all you want me for?

156
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:49,636
Come here.

157
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:04,898
What is it?

158
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:08,203
I made it. I'm in the Silhouettes.

159
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,075
Really, mijo?

160
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,620
That's wonderful.

161
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:21,337
Who's the Silhouettes?

162
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,836
This is not like I expected.

163
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,630
You are not like I expected.

164
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:29,383
I don't have a life here!

165
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,055
You're always gone.

166
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,519
Do you think I like being here alone?

167
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,358
Look, Rosie, you're not my wife!

168
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:40,938
Stop being such a drag.

169
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,982
What the shit's eating you anyway?

170
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,367
I'm pregnant.

171
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:02,585
Aren't you going to say anything?

172
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,587
What's there to say?

173
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,263
It's not my first...

174
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,384
...or my last.

175
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:26,446
You son of a bitch!

176
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,905
What's going on?

177
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,451
Bitch! You bitch.

178
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,536
Is it my fault you got pregnant?

179
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,793
Richie, don't!

180
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,460
- It's none of your business.
- But I...

181
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,967
I am not your puta!

182
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,973
Do you always carry a guitar?

183
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,477
It's my future.

184
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,276
Sure of yourself, aren't you?

185
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,188
Yeah. Aren't you?

186
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,814
No, I'm the new kid on the block.

187
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:09,903
Poor little rich girl.

188
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,322
I'm not rich.

189
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,528
Right.

190
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,998
My dad.

191
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:26,959
I want a place like this
for my mom one day.

192
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,502
Hi, Daddy!

193
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,096
I have to go.

194
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:39,345
Listen...

195
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:43,311
...I'm playing at a garage party tonight.
Want to come?

196
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,239
- Garage party?
- It's my big debut.

197
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:50,241
It'll be a real gas, kitten. Please, come.

198
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:55,655
Okay.

199
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,786
I'll meet you there.

200
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,629
No problem.
I wrote down the address for you...

201
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,792
...in case.

202
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:11,043
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

203
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,149
Who's the big kid?

204
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:30,194
A friend.

205
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,735
What is he, Italian?

206
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:04,107
- Mom, look at Richie.
- I see him, baby.

207
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:03,156
Mama, when's Richie going to sing?

208
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:05,997
Pretty soon. Now stop asking me.

209
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,459
We thank all of you
for attending our dance tonight.

210
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:15,636
We hope you had an evening to remember.

211
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:17,964
So, until next time...

212
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,596
...speaking for myself, Rudy Castro,
and all the guys in the band...

213
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:26,684
...we are the Silhouettes,
bidding you a good night.

214
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,612
Goodnight, Richie.

215
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:45,036
What do they mean, not letting you sing?

216
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,251
Who do they want, Elvis?

217
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:51,124
No big deal. I'll make them come around.

218
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,757
They don't know who they're dealing with.

219
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:59,635
My granddaddy
was a full-blooded Yaqui Indian.

220
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:20,316
What's the matter? Bad dreams?

221
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,699
I'm sorry, carnal.

222
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,574
I didn't mean to wake you up but...

223
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:31,369
...I need a place to crash.

224
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,627
No, man, here. Come on. Get some rest.

225
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,222
Keep your ass to the wall.

226
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:51,433
I'm so messed up,
I may take you for Rosie.

227
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,873
Where'd you get this picture of Steve?

228
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:08,115
Mom gave it to me after the funeral.

229
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:11,785
I wish I could have been there.

230
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,804
But he was your dad, anyway. Not mine.

231
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,425
Don't forget to turn off the light.

232
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:38,398
You been laid yet?

233
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,616
I'm serious. I know what your problem is.

234
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,365
Sperm pressure. It's scientific.

235
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:48,285
You got hard-ons all the time,
nightmares, wet dreams...

236
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:50,366
Shut up and go to sleep!

237
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:57,963
A kid your age
needs an authority figure around.

238
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,960
Believe me, I know.

239
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,841
I tried to go, Richie. Honestly.

240
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,731
- You don't have to apologise.
- Who's apologising?

241
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:14,559
My dad wouldn't let me.

242
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,608
- Honest to God?
- Honest.

243
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:20,987
I really wanted to be there.

244
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,360
Cowboy Palace!

245
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,291
I can't do it, honey. Richie's a minor.

246
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,534
He'll be singing, not drinking.

247
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,578
Rock 'n' roll to a bunch of cowboys.

248
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,956
My husband, Steve,
drank himself to death in here.

249
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,502
Don't you owe his boy something?

250
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:46,005
We should've brought Chino.
I need a drummer.

251
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:49,217
Screw the Silhouettes.
I'll keep the beat for you.

252
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:52,597
They got drums inside.
What're you going to play?

253
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:53,719
Boney Maronie.

254
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:58,223
Boney Maronie? To these shit-stompers?

255
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:05,407
Howard, they're here!

256
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,486
Cut the jukebox.

257
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:11,989
Testing, one, two, three.

258
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,832
Sure good to see you folks
out there tonight. Everybody having fun?

259
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,117
Turn the jukebox back on!

260
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:21,080
One of our local boys is making his
professional debut tonight right here.

261
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,582
Let's give a great big
round of applause for...

262
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:27,301
...Ricky "Ricardo" Valenzuela.

263
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:36,595
Howdy.

264
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,739
Here's one out of Lubbock, Texas.

265
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:47,199
Lubbock, Texas?

266
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,731
Follow me.

267
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:13,111
"You don't know
what you've been missing"

268
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:18,954
We were rocking, man, we were rolling!

269
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:22,245
Didn't I tell you? We don't need no band.

270
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:27,046
We just play the bars with the drummer.
Me, for instance.

271
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:29,168
I'm talking about making money!

272
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:33,555
I'm talking about making music.
My music. That's all I care about.

273
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:39,011
What you need is exposure.

274
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:43,222
A big place where you can sell
a lot of tickets, put a lot of posters up.

275
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:44,556
You gotta think big!

276
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:47,362
- You want to be my manager?
- Sure, I can do it.

277
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:51,064
I can get the American Legion Hall.
Steve was a World War I veteran.

278
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:53,115
What, you don't think I can do it?

279
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:56,368
Just for that you can be my flunky.

280
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,705
Mom, thanks, but no thanks.
Anybody but Bob.

281
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:04,085
- What does that mean?
- Just take care of Rosie, okay stud?

282
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,040
Try staying home for a change.

283
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,498
Listen, punk...

284
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,716
- I don't need you...
- Stop it, both of you.

285
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,511
Richie, don't be so "High Tone."

286
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:17,677
And you Bob, you're your brother's keeper.
You never heard of that?

287
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,144
'Morning Connie, Richie.

288
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:24,596
'Morning.

289
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:27,808
You missed a great show last night.

290
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,020
Richie was wonderful.

291
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:32,361
Really? I'm not surprised.

292
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,901
I'm flying this coop.

293
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,448
Catch you all later.

294
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:39,330
I'm late for work.

295
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:41,330
What did I do with my purse?

296
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,286
"Flying the coop."

297
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:44,748
That's it!

298
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:49,256
"Richard Valenzuela and his
Flying Guitar."

299
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:04,850
- This is it. What do you think?
- This is beautiful, man.

300
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,395
With some publicity
we can raise the roof.

301
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:11,102
You're dreaming, Valenzuela.
They wouldn't even let us into this place.

302
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:13,521
No, I told you.
My mom, she set it all up.

303
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:16,695
Since when is your mama
running this band?

304
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,034
- We need all the breaks we can get.
- I heard that. Richie's right, man.

305
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:22,202
No dice, Chino.

306
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:25,744
I decide what's best for the Silhouettes,
and this ain't it.

307
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:27,958
So, let's beat it out of here.

308
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:29,832
What's his problem?

309
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:35,128
Are you guys coming or what?

310
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:43,387
I guess it's "what."

311
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:53,857
What's going on?

312
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:55,738
Show business, mijo.

313
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,117
Show business? These look like shit.

314
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:02,570
A monkey can draw better than this.

315
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:03,781
Oh yeah?

316
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:11,585
Should have kept my mouth shut.

317
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,674
Every wall, every liquor store.

318
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:17,418
Every telephone pole in town.

319
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:20,548
Hit them all! Now, tear buns!

320
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:45,035
We need a little help
hanging that crepe paper across there.

321
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:50,038
Those chairs don't go there, Felipe.
They don't go there.

322
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:57,301
You're looking really handsome.
The girls are gonna go crazy over you.

323
00:34:57,385 --> 00:35:00,055
- There's only one girl I care about.
- Who's that?

324
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:02,465
Nobody you'd know.

325
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:06,601
- Is everything in order in here?
- Perfect. Thanks, Rosie.

326
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:10,271
We're gonna pack the place, Mom.

327
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:13,939
I hope so. We paid for this place
with our rent money.

328
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:20,699
Someday I'll buy you
the house of your dreams. I promise.

329
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:23,275
Tell me about it. Where is Bob?

330
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:07,078
Three cups, thirty cents.
Here's your change.

331
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:11,666
Ten cases. Counting the door, that's $150.

332
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,411
We gotta do this again.

333
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,060
- Did you find Bob?
- What do you want? No.

334
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:34,939
- Did you look?
- No!

335
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,861
- He's pretty good.
- He's great.

336
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,292
What'll you have?

337
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,698
Can I have a Coke?

338
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,706
Here's a little number...

339
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:02,340
...for the criminal element here tonight.

340
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:05,550
And you know who you are.

341
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,535
Look at my Richie...

342
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,833
...shining like a star.

343
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,917
Look at Bob.

344
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,926
You're drunk, Bob. Give me that bottle.

345
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,583
That's my brother.

346
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,589
Asshole!

347
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,116
Stop it!

348
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,306
Why, Bob?

349
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,223
How could you do this to Richie?

350
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,108
To Richie? I did this to me!

351
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:28,361
That's my Bob.
Always thinking of others first.

352
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,900
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- Don't take it out on Rosie.

353
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,371
You don't understand.

354
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:40,251
You don't understand a goddamn thing.

355
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:46,544
What do you think,
the whole world revolves around you?

356
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,063
Is this where you live?

357
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,061
No.

358
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,188
I live down the street.

359
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,446
Hop in, I'll take you home.

360
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,072
Why don't we just go for a drive?

361
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,034
Okay, you drive.

362
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:27,874
What do you think?

363
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,879
Not bad...

364
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:33,172
...for a birthday present.

365
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:37,884
You say you're not rich?

366
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:42,182
My dad sells cars.
Can I help it if he knows his business?

367
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,514
He just didn't want me
walking home anymore.

368
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,315
Because of me?

369
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,734
How come you've been avoiding me?

370
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:00,287
Is it that blow-out at the dance?

371
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:03,417
- Don't be silly.
- Then what's the problem?

372
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,292
My dad.

373
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:12,085
Does it mean I can't ask you out
on a regular date?

374
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:16,546
Why don't you ask me?

375
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:22,057
I got my own wheels now.

376
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,184
Who cares what my father thinks?

377
00:41:55,845 --> 00:42:00,056
Get your ass in gear.
We still got a lot of places to stop at.

378
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,559
Look at this.

379
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:07,270
It's Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard.

380
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:09,814
This is the real stuff.

381
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:13,400
- They make cartoons out of these things.
- Can it, jerk-off.

382
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,030
It's kiddie stuff.

383
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,400
Finders, keepers.

384
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:39,801
Yes?

385
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:47,020
He lives here. Why?

386
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:08,539
Happy birthday, mija.

387
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:15,038
- This man here wants to talk to you.
- Hi, Richie.

388
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,876
Mind if I call you Richie?

389
00:43:16,968 --> 00:43:20,301
My name is Bob Keene, I'm president
of Del-Fi Records in Hollywood.

390
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,509
I don't speak Spanish.

391
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,807
But we can speak business.

392
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:29,558
Let me just say that I...

393
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:33,895
...I really dig your music,
and I'd like to record it.

394
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:36,063
What do you say?

395
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:42,742
Welcome to Del-Fi Records.
I work out of the basement.

396
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:46,196
This is your recording studio?

397
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:49,490
The Ampex is good,
the mikes are excellent.

398
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:53,955
What more do you need? Relax, Richie.
This is just for starters.

399
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:56,749
I thought we'd start off easy.

400
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,296
Play a few riffs,
move on to a couple of vocals.

401
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:03,383
Nothing heavy.
When you're ready, we'll record.

402
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:05,181
What? Do you mean today?

403
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:06,677
What about my band?

404
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:12,060
Frankly, I can't use any of them.
Is that a problem?

405
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,975
Yeah. They're my buddies.

406
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:18,773
Thank you.

407
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,234
Excuse me.

408
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:21,859
Wait, Richie.

409
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:25,741
Wait a minute, man.
I understand about friendship.

410
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,780
I'm being honest here.

411
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:31,206
Not everybody in this world
gets a shot at the brass ring.

412
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:35,290
You're going to have to ask yourself
what's more important, your friends...

413
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:36,790
...or your music.

414
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,811
My family.

415
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:54,655
- Is that you?
- Richie, come here.

416
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:01,999
Did you trace this or what?

417
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:04,926
Trace, hell. This is free hand.
Look at this.

418
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:09,588
Art contest. $500 in prizes.

419
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:12,134
Think I should enter it?

420
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:14,101
Yeah, go for broke.

421
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,580
Fantastic.

422
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:47,649
I wasn't there when it happened.
But in the dream, it's like I am.

423
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:51,692
My best friend got killed.

424
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:56,119
Got crushed by one of those
falling planes.

425
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:58,533
Where were you that day?

426
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,951
My grandfather's funeral.

427
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:04,495
I guess his death saved my life.

428
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:09,127
Thank you.

429
00:48:12,763 --> 00:48:16,428
My mom says it means
I was saved for something special.

430
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:19,055
Know what it is?

431
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:21,139
Rock 'n' roll?

432
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,728
I'm gonna be a star...

433
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:32,108
...because stars don't fall
out of the sky, do they?

434
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:40,492
You think I'm gonna dump garbage
for the rest of my life?

435
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,374
How will you support the baby?

436
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,374
Drawing Woody Woodpecker?
I don't want that piece of junk in here.

437
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:50,129
Then to hell with you.
You don't respect any shit I do.

438
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,418
What about your respect for me?

439
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:08,769
I almost have to rape her
just to have sex.

440
00:49:10,946 --> 00:49:12,606
To her, it's dirty.

441
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:19,318
Look, Bob...

442
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:23,366
...it's cool if you move in with me...

443
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:27,915
...but what about when the baby comes?
Shouldn't you be with Rosie?

444
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:31,884
My old man wasn't around
when I was born.

445
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:33,879
Why should I be?

446
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:40,181
- Figure it out.
- There you are, mijo.

447
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:42,307
Bob Keene called me at the restaurant.

448
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:45,598
You're recording at Gold Star Studios
next Wednesday.

449
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:47,852
Right in Hollywood.

450
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:50,604
Didn't you hear me?

451
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:53,862
That means he's going to put you
under contract with Del-Fi.

452
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:01,234
Richie, I'm so happy.

453
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,912
It's only the beginning, mijo.

454
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,128
Bob has great news, too.

455
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:11,791
Come on, tell her.

456
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,000
That art contest? I won it.

457
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,053
$500 in prizes.

458
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,883
That's great, mijo.

459
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,549
With the baby coming and everything
the money'll...

460
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:25,601
In art lessons.

461
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:29,847
See, they gave me a drafting table.

462
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:36,147
All our dreams are gonna come true.

463
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,026
I just know it.

464
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:54,622
Cut.

465
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:57,879
Let's start again.

466
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:07,891
Cut. Don't rewrite the song. Just do
it the way you did it the first time.

467
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:21,315
Cut.

468
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,280
That was our fault.

469
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:39,792
Cut.

470
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:44,674
That's more right on, but that "little
darling" line, I like that better.

471
00:51:57,863 --> 00:52:00,983
I don't see what's wrong with those takes.
That's how I sing.

472
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:03,744
It's gotta be clean.
Each take has to be identical.

473
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:06,034
- Why?
- So, that we can edit later.

474
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,369
- This isn't Mexico.
- Who said it was?

475
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:12,502
I lived there. I understand the tradition
of the song, always changing the lyrics.

476
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:15,421
I've never even been to Mexico.
My music is my music.

477
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:17,083
You tell him, carnal.

478
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:22,385
How many more takes?

479
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:25,381
As many as it takes. Okay?

480
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,352
Cut.

481
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:44,241
That was good. Same energy.
Just try it again.

482
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:02,836
Shall I get a new role of tape?

483
00:53:05,222 --> 00:53:08,057
I think we got him.
I can cut something here.

484
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,557
Nice work, Richie. 60 takes, man.
How's the throat?

485
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:16,099
I think we got it all.

486
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:20,150
60 takes?
I didn't hear a difference in one of them.

487
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:22,732
I'm ready to go home.

488
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:26,533
I want to discuss one thing with you.
Come here.

489
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,447
- What is it?
- Your professional name.

490
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:39,295
From now on, it's Ritchie with a "t."
R-I-T-C-H-I-E.

491
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:41,415
I got a new last name for you, too.

492
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,843
Valens with an "s." Ritchie Valens.

493
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:48,046
- How does that grab you?
- I don't like it.

494
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,675
That's for shit, man!
Valenzuela was our dad's last name.

495
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:54,769
- You can't just cut it in half.
- It's no big deal.

496
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:59,144
People in this business change their names
like they change wives.

497
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:01,898
Even me. My last name is Kuhn.

498
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:03,104
Look.

499
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:05,817
Trust me on this one.

500
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:09,035
Let's just go.

501
00:54:14,302 --> 00:54:15,465
Thanks.

502
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:19,131
Look, it could've been worse.
You could have been Ricky Zuela.

503
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,811
- Hello.
- Hello?

504
00:54:31,028 --> 00:54:32,273
Is Donna in?

505
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:35,447
No, Donna's not in. This is her father.
Can I help you?

506
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:38,279
Daddy, who is it? Is it Ritchie?

507
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:45,625
Could you tell her
that Ritchie called again, please?

508
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:46,954
Yeah, okay.

509
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:01,213
He plays that goddamn jungle music!
Need I say more?

510
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:05,601
Come on, honey.
You said yourself it's not serious.

511
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:10,519
I hate Dad when he acts like that!
I just hate him!

512
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:14,191
Good morning, you survivors!
You want to call? I'd love to talk to you.

513
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:18,111
We got evicted. We're sleeping
in the car. My wife is pregnant.

514
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:19,950
You're down about it?

515
00:55:20,035 --> 00:55:23,238
- She's in the car now.
- She's pregnant and sleeping in the car?

516
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,907
She's there right now.

517
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:27,662
- What kind of car do you have?
- A Rolls Royce.

518
00:55:31,421 --> 00:55:33,663
Your mom listens to KFWB, right?

519
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:37,298
Ritchie Valens' mom out there
in Pacoima listens, too.

520
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:40,173
And she's gotta be proud of her boy today!

521
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:44,716
Ritchie's got a song headed
for the top of the charts, with a bullet.

522
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:48,933
Ritchie Valens, Come On, Let's Go.

523
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:54,018
- How are you?
- Pretty good, thanks.

524
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:56,225
Valens... Valens.

525
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:58,989
French, right?

526
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:00,825
How did you know?

527
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:03,702
Come on, man.

528
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:06,076
He's one of those barrio kids
from the Valley.

529
00:56:06,164 --> 00:56:07,195
Not for long.

530
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,370
Pretty good.

531
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:11,283
I know.

532
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:21,835
Everybody keep it down.
That's my Ritchie on the radio.

533
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,639
- How about a beer?
- Not while I'm working, but I'll get you one.

534
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:45,907
No, I'm sorry. Donna's studying.

535
00:56:49,749 --> 00:56:53,498
Supper time, pizza fans!
Here's a contest to kick off summer!

536
00:56:53,587 --> 00:56:57,667
We have a special mystery guest
here at the studio. Say hello, Mr. Guest.

537
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,081
Hello.

538
00:56:59,843 --> 00:57:03,128
Here's what you do. Our guest comes
from the San Fernando Valley.

539
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:06,970
What does he have in common with the
Vice President of the United States?

540
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,561
The first person to identify the mystery
guest will win 12 fresh, hot pizzas.

541
00:57:11,646 --> 00:57:15,976
Here's the kicker: this mystery guest
will deliver the pizzas...

542
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:20,445
...and have a pizza party at yourplace,
free, from KFWB.

543
00:57:34,044 --> 00:57:35,871
No, Donna's not here.

544
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,161
Thank you.

545
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:40,249
- She's out on a date.
- Yeah.

546
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:43,165
Right.

547
00:57:53,313 --> 00:57:55,104
Yes, may I help you?

548
00:57:55,565 --> 00:57:56,894
May I see Donna?

549
00:57:58,235 --> 00:57:59,397
Please.

550
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:01,189
I know she's here.

551
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:05,115
Just one moment.

552
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,484
Donna?

553
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,405
It's Ritchie.

554
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,367
Now, it's better not to lead him on dear.
You know how your father is.

555
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:19,880
Okay.

556
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:25,761
Hi, Ritchie.

557
00:58:28,848 --> 00:58:30,259
Can we take a walk?

558
00:58:36,439 --> 00:58:37,934
No, I can't.

559
00:58:40,694 --> 00:58:43,897
Okay, let's not beat around the bush.
Are you seeing other guys?

560
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:48,989
Yeah, I've been out a few times.
What's wrong with that?

561
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:51,275
You're my girl.

562
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:54,406
When am I supposed to see you?

563
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,415
I can't tag along to your appearances.
All those other girls...

564
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:01,746
I don't care about those other girls!

565
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,175
What am I supposed to do?

566
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:10,421
You don't have time for me right now.

567
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:12,093
You wanna break it off?

568
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,100
I don't know what I want anymore.

569
00:59:24,362 --> 00:59:25,987
I'll see you around sometime.

570
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,443
Ritchie.

571
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,991
Hello?

572
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:07,084
- Sorry.
- "Oh, Donna"

573
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:09,880
- "Oh, Donna"
- That's it.

574
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,339
That's your song.

575
01:01:11,428 --> 01:01:13,052
Thought you'd like to hear it.

576
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:14,501
It's beautiful.

577
01:01:15,014 --> 01:01:16,094
Thank you.

578
01:01:16,683 --> 01:01:18,011
- 'Bye.
- Yeah.

579
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,971
Carnal, I think I know
what your problem is.

580
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:27,398
And it's time we did something about it.

581
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,153
Come on, let's go.

582
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,691
Where to?

583
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:34,109
Let's just go.
I should have done this a long time ago.

584
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:35,861
Come on, hop on.

585
01:01:37,412 --> 01:01:40,329
- Done what?
- Gotten you some tail, man.

586
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,182
Come on, Ritchie with a "t."

587
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:01,801
I'm going to show you the best part of TJ.

588
01:02:04,564 --> 01:02:06,391
Ritchie, come here. Check it out.

589
01:02:06,483 --> 01:02:10,563
Don't worry. It smells like fish,
but it'll taste like chicken.

590
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:13,695
You alright, man!

591
01:02:15,575 --> 01:02:18,695
This is your manager's job,
getting you some tail.

592
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,029
He looks at you,
I bet he sees a meal ticket.

593
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:23,874
Come on, change the record.

594
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,368
Look, man: "Ritchie Valens."

595
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:32,540
With a name like that, nobody's
even going to suspect you're Mexican.

596
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:36,300
I think it's an insult to Steve's memory.

597
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,965
Steve was so gung-ho American,
he'd be proud of anything I do. Lay off.

598
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:42,802
It's my name.

599
01:02:43,978 --> 01:02:45,805
Yeah, it's your name, man.

600
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,954
- What did she say?
- She likes your big...

601
01:03:10,797 --> 01:03:13,502
- What do you think?
- It looks like a high school prom.

602
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:15,880
Only this prom puts out.

603
01:03:49,002 --> 01:03:51,160
Look at those bongos.

604
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:52,620
Get in there.

605
01:03:54,048 --> 01:03:55,626
I can see fine.

606
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:58,131
Pick one you like.

607
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,507
They'll like you. It's guaranteed.

608
01:04:08,605 --> 01:04:11,938
I don't know. It's really hard to choose.

609
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:15,110
Shit, take two, man. It's on me.

610
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:26,031
La Bamba!

611
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:28,246
Ritchie, come here.

612
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,075
I brought you here to get laid.

613
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:32,414
Later.

614
01:05:29,018 --> 01:05:30,678
I'm coming.

615
01:05:42,615 --> 01:05:44,655
Connie, I need your help.

616
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:48,740
It's the baby.
Where is Bob, for God's sake?

617
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:56,244
I'm gonna get Ritchie, okay?

618
01:05:56,379 --> 01:05:57,873
It's gonna be okay.

619
01:07:02,487 --> 01:07:04,396
Yo no speak-o espanol.

620
01:07:19,879 --> 01:07:23,046
What's the idea, Bob,
leaving me alone with this old man?

621
01:07:24,217 --> 01:07:26,755
I had some business to take care of in TJ.

622
01:07:27,053 --> 01:07:29,378
Besides, you were sleeping it off, stud.

623
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,181
Was I that drunk last night?

624
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:34,219
You were screwed, blewed, and tattooed!
Look at that.

625
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,468
Well, at least tattooed anyway.

626
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:42,600
The old man wants us to eat breakfast.

627
01:07:53,788 --> 01:07:55,780
I never had snake before.

628
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:00,412
It's not bad.

629
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:10,423
What's he saying?

630
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:13,672
He says, "Life is a snake.

631
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,934
"A snake crawling out of its
own dead skin.

632
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:20,272
"Like a dream."

633
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:25,935
He's a curandero, a healer...

634
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:30,444
...and a wise man.
He's sort of my spiritual father.

635
01:08:31,993 --> 01:08:34,116
I've been coming to him for years.

636
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,744
He's giving you that.

637
01:08:44,547 --> 01:08:47,417
"To live is to sleep."

638
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:51,715
"To die...

639
01:08:51,971 --> 01:08:53,465
"... is to awaken."

640
01:08:56,642 --> 01:08:58,635
I told him about your nightmares.

641
01:09:00,062 --> 01:09:03,562
That talisman will help,
if you believe in it.

642
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,150
What is all this?

643
01:09:27,214 --> 01:09:31,378
Mexico! You went to Tijuana
without telling anybody?

644
01:09:31,928 --> 01:09:34,134
A fine pair of sinvergüenzas!

645
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:38,599
I'd expect this from Bob
but not you, Ritchie.

646
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:43,727
What did you do, drink the night away?

647
01:09:43,814 --> 01:09:46,519
Okay, it was my fault. I took him there.

648
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:49,901
- How's Rosie?
- She's in the hospital, where else?

649
01:09:51,697 --> 01:09:54,983
She was all alone.
I had to drive her to the hospital myself!

650
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:57,359
She was in labour all day with the baby.

651
01:09:57,453 --> 01:10:00,822
Do you hear me?
Do you care about anything?

652
01:10:01,749 --> 01:10:04,157
Go ahead! Go play with your bike!

653
01:10:10,216 --> 01:10:12,043
Did Rosie have a boy or a girl?

654
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:15,338
She had a girl. We named her Brenda.

655
01:10:17,473 --> 01:10:18,801
What's this?

656
01:10:20,101 --> 01:10:21,180
Bob.

657
01:11:43,017 --> 01:11:45,686
That's beautiful, Ritchie. That's the one.

658
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,805
Coming up in September,
we have the Pacific Ocean Park...

659
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:52,937
...followed by
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

660
01:11:53,027 --> 01:11:54,355
High Tone lunch, huh?

661
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:57,106
Followed by...

662
01:11:58,074 --> 01:11:59,651
Are you listening?

663
01:12:00,326 --> 01:12:03,576
...a week's booking in San Francisco.
Now, Ritchie...

664
01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:05,073
...we fly up for that one.

665
01:12:06,624 --> 01:12:08,415
Fly? No, I'd rather drive.

666
01:12:08,501 --> 01:12:11,336
Ritchie, please. It's a long drive.

667
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,750
I don't care. I never fly, I told you.
I have my reasons.

668
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:19,178
All right, I'll see what I can do.

669
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:24,218
We still need another single
to go along with Donna.

670
01:12:24,308 --> 01:12:25,886
How about Suzie?

671
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:28,556
How about La Bamba?

672
01:12:28,771 --> 01:12:32,306
- La Bamba? It's not rock 'n' roll.
- It is the way I play it.

673
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:35,140
It's a folk song.
I don't want to offend anybody.

674
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:38,154
- Besides, it's in Spanish.
- That's how I want to sing it.

675
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,860
Rock 'n' roll in Spanish.
You gotta be crazy.

676
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:43,608
- It'll work. Just let me have a crack at it.
- No.

677
01:12:43,828 --> 01:12:47,161
Even assuming that the other side
of Donna was a throwaway...

678
01:12:47,414 --> 01:12:51,911
...how are you going to handle the lyrics?
You say yourself you don't speak Spanish.

679
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:54,838
If Nat King Cole can sing in Spanish,
so can I, right?

680
01:12:55,339 --> 01:12:58,423
Come on, Bob-O. What do you say?

681
01:13:00,594 --> 01:13:01,923
Bob-O?

682
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:08,010
Okay, now smile!

683
01:14:09,914 --> 01:14:11,491
It drives like a dream!

684
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:13,705
Beats the hell out of taking a train.

685
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,666
How much did this baby cost?

686
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,830
You don't want to know.

687
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:21,956
But if all goes well in Philadelphia...

688
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,420
...the car is yours.

689
01:14:24,511 --> 01:14:25,543
Philly?

690
01:14:27,139 --> 01:14:28,883
We're going to Philadelphia?

691
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:30,676
American Bandstand.

692
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,190
We fly up for that. Okay?

693
01:14:42,363 --> 01:14:44,189
Come on, let's go.

694
01:14:50,955 --> 01:14:54,406
- I thought you said you didn't like to fly.
- I don't.

695
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,789
But I love driving fast.

696
01:14:56,961 --> 01:14:59,796
Let me in, damn it!
I want to see my daughter!

697
01:15:00,297 --> 01:15:03,749
I'm her father! I'm her father, goddamn it.

698
01:15:03,842 --> 01:15:05,467
You're a goddamn drunk!

699
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:07,338
Bob, stop it.

700
01:15:07,638 --> 01:15:11,137
Get back. Have you gone crazy on me?

701
01:15:11,684 --> 01:15:13,842
I have finally had it.

702
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:17,431
- I want to see my daughter.
- Not in your condition.

703
01:15:17,523 --> 01:15:20,892
I went pendeja for the motorcycle,
but no more.

704
01:15:20,985 --> 01:15:23,226
- I want my wife.
- You don't want a wife.

705
01:15:23,362 --> 01:15:26,114
He wants a love slave.
One that he can kick around.

706
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:28,950
Sober up and you can see her tomorrow.

707
01:15:29,034 --> 01:15:31,572
Now go downstairs and pass out.

708
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:35,740
I've got enough to worry about
with Ritchie.

709
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:41,585
You always worry more about Ritchie.

710
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:44,668
What about me?

711
01:15:45,384 --> 01:15:48,420
I know you don't give
a goddamn about me.

712
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,589
You had me turned in!
You had me locked up!

713
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:56,392
Do you think I could ever
forgive you for that?

714
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:02,392
You can't keep me from seeing my kid.

715
01:16:02,693 --> 01:16:06,311
This is my house. I'll kick you all out.

716
01:16:15,914 --> 01:16:17,113
You see anything?

717
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:22,336
I just saw the Grand Canyon.
It's a long way down there, boy.

718
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,628
You okay?

719
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,261
You know what, Bob-O?

720
01:16:36,894 --> 01:16:40,678
I've always believed
I was going to die in a plane crash.

721
01:16:40,773 --> 01:16:44,224
That's a hell of a thing to say
while we're still in the air.

722
01:16:46,403 --> 01:16:50,531
It's do or die, man.
American Bandstand, Philadelphia, PA.

723
01:16:50,657 --> 01:16:52,816
Drink this. It's vodka.

724
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:55,616
Straight.

725
01:16:57,456 --> 01:17:00,576
And away we go.
You are all comfortably seated, I presume.

726
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:02,164
Excellent.

727
01:17:02,294 --> 01:17:05,129
Let's greet a young man
who's making his debut...

728
01:17:05,297 --> 01:17:08,547
...here on American Bandstand.
From Del-Fi Records in Los Angeles.

729
01:17:08,634 --> 01:17:11,006
Ladies and gentleman,
here's Ritchie Valens.

730
01:17:54,138 --> 01:17:55,715
What do you want?

731
01:17:56,723 --> 01:17:58,134
I got money.

732
01:17:58,225 --> 01:17:59,885
I don't want your money.

733
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,805
What the hell?

734
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:05,811
- I was watching that! Put that back on.
- You've had enough for one afternoon.

735
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:08,985
Put it back on! That dude's my brother!

736
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:11,738
Yeah, and I'm your Irish uncle, too.
Leave it off.

737
01:18:43,937 --> 01:18:46,428
What'd you think of Ritchie
on American Bandstand?

738
01:18:46,523 --> 01:18:50,355
- I think it's so keen that he was on there.
- I can't believe he sang Donna.

739
01:18:50,444 --> 01:18:52,353
You are so lucky.

740
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:54,604
And you?
Who are you taking to the dance?

741
01:18:54,698 --> 01:18:58,281
- Nobody.
- Oh, come...

742
01:19:05,626 --> 01:19:07,832
- Hi, kitten.
- Hi.

743
01:19:08,921 --> 01:19:10,747
So, where's your car?

744
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:14,042
It was a loaner. My dad sold it.

745
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:15,422
Hop in.

746
01:19:19,056 --> 01:19:21,179
- Hi, Suzy.
- Hi, Ritchie.

747
01:19:25,312 --> 01:19:27,885
Hi, can I have your photograph?
I mean, autograph?

748
01:19:27,981 --> 01:19:30,686
- Can I get one, too?
- Can I get one?

749
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:34,522
I'll do you one better...

750
01:19:34,613 --> 01:19:36,487
...I'll get you Donna's autograph, too.

751
01:19:40,452 --> 01:19:42,196
Just like old times?

752
01:19:42,746 --> 01:19:44,324
I really missed you.

753
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,201
I've missed you, too.

754
01:19:53,006 --> 01:19:54,501
So, how's school?

755
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:58,834
Not the same without you.
When are you coming back?

756
01:19:59,638 --> 01:20:01,346
My school days are over, kitten.

757
01:20:01,598 --> 01:20:03,757
Bob-O's got me booked all winter and fall.

758
01:20:03,976 --> 01:20:05,600
I'll be in the Big Apple.

759
01:20:08,313 --> 01:20:10,520
I'm really happy for you, Ritchie.

760
01:20:11,358 --> 01:20:14,644
All your success and everything,
you really deserve it.

761
01:20:16,071 --> 01:20:17,399
I'm flying.

762
01:20:19,283 --> 01:20:20,943
I'm really flying.

763
01:20:51,398 --> 01:20:53,023
It's yours, Mom.

764
01:20:53,275 --> 01:20:55,433
- It's mine?
- Yes.

765
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,780
Come on.

766
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:12,283
- Is this where we're going to live?
- It's like a castle.

767
01:21:13,712 --> 01:21:14,957
This is home.

768
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:19,543
That's the garage.

769
01:21:20,385 --> 01:21:22,793
Over there is the guest house.

770
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:26,426
Come on, slow poke.

771
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:28,972
Look at this. Isn't it nice?

772
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,601
Right here is where I think
we'll put the swimming pool.

773
01:21:34,733 --> 01:21:37,604
No, Ritchie, the girls can't swim.
I don't want no pool.

774
01:21:44,076 --> 01:21:45,985
We'll make it a dishwasher, right?

775
01:21:46,078 --> 01:21:48,747
No problem. But after we fly back east.

776
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:52,492
- Back again?
- 10 day tour, 13 cities.

777
01:21:52,876 --> 01:21:55,711
Including a spot on national television.

778
01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:59,000
So, congratulations, Mrs. Valens.

779
01:21:59,549 --> 01:22:01,838
Here are the keys to your new home.

780
01:22:02,135 --> 01:22:05,635
Ritchie, this is better
than Queen for a Day.

781
01:22:06,264 --> 01:22:08,091
I love you, Mom.

782
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:10,350
You're the best.

783
01:22:47,055 --> 01:22:49,297
What's the matter? Nervous?

784
01:22:49,391 --> 01:22:51,716
I'm just a kid from Pacoima.

785
01:23:41,568 --> 01:23:43,644
You're gonna knock 'em dead.

786
01:23:43,737 --> 01:23:46,109
Eddie Cochran, a wonderful human being!

787
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:51,073
And now for you rock cats, another
wonderful human being, Mr. Jackie Wilson!

788
01:23:55,248 --> 01:23:58,415
Eddie, you were great, man. Really great.

789
01:23:59,628 --> 01:24:01,953
It's that live New York audience.

790
01:24:02,088 --> 01:24:02,835
Rock 'n' roll is an addiction.

791
01:24:25,278 --> 01:24:27,105
Here you are, Ritchie.

792
01:24:27,197 --> 01:24:29,355
Where else? The kid's got taste.

793
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:32,112
I need you, Valens.
One of the Belmonts got sick.

794
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:34,735
Probably malnutrition
from this three-ring circus.

795
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:36,739
- Just kidding.
- I got to move you up.

796
01:24:36,832 --> 01:24:40,912
You're going on after Jackie Wilson.
In five minutes. You can do it.

797
01:24:41,002 --> 01:24:42,034
Good luck.

798
01:24:42,212 --> 01:24:43,790
They're waiting for you.

799
01:24:44,256 --> 01:24:45,418
- Let's go!
- Get rocking!

800
01:26:04,336 --> 01:26:08,416
If they love you, they'll want to kill you.
If they don't, same difference.

801
01:26:13,386 --> 01:26:15,379
And here he is...

802
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:19,969
...America's newest rock 'n'
roll sensation...

803
01:26:20,352 --> 01:26:24,349
...the California Kid, Ritchie Valens.

804
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:40,487
This is a bit of a rattlesnake.

805
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,590
No, I mean it Bob-O...

806
01:29:12,315 --> 01:29:14,058
Merry Christmas, High Tone.

807
01:29:15,235 --> 01:29:16,729
I've missed you.

808
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,481
Okay, go ahead and open the presents.

809
01:29:25,745 --> 01:29:27,821
Just the little kids.

810
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,832
- Look at all this food.
- Wonderful.

811
01:29:40,093 --> 01:29:42,928
- Hungry?
- I could eat a horse.

812
01:29:49,018 --> 01:29:50,347
Seven and seven?

813
01:29:52,272 --> 01:29:53,351
What about you?

814
01:29:53,523 --> 01:29:55,350
I'm on the wagon, man.

815
01:29:56,067 --> 01:29:57,561
The garbage wagon.

816
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,604
$5 a week and all you can eat.

817
01:30:00,697 --> 01:30:03,188
With all this food, I'm staying.

818
01:30:08,121 --> 01:30:10,113
Bobby, where's Mom's new dress?

819
01:30:10,874 --> 01:30:14,077
- What new dress?
- The one I asked you to buy her.

820
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:18,586
You're the asshole with all the money.
Buy it yourself.

821
01:30:24,804 --> 01:30:28,138
Don't let him upset you.
He's been on the wagon for a month.

822
01:30:28,308 --> 01:30:31,641
He's meaner when he's drunk.
Come on, help yourself.

823
01:30:33,062 --> 01:30:36,099
Let's go into the living room.
I got a present for Ritchie.

824
01:30:52,999 --> 01:30:55,668
I just got mauled by King Kong!

825
01:30:56,336 --> 01:30:58,162
Everybody, let's party!

826
01:30:58,296 --> 01:31:00,834
This is a celebration. My Ritchie is home!

827
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:20,688
You okay, Bob?

828
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,064
Sure, I'm okay.

829
01:31:24,948 --> 01:31:26,608
Mom was asking for you.

830
01:31:27,575 --> 01:31:29,069
She afraid I'm drunk?

831
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,529
I've had one sip of beer,
and it tastes like piss to me. Want it?

832
01:31:53,685 --> 01:31:55,345
What's your problem, man?

833
01:31:58,982 --> 01:32:00,559
Old Steve.

834
01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:05,275
He always said you'd be somebody.
And I bought it, too.

835
01:32:06,447 --> 01:32:09,947
If that's the way Steve wanted it,
that's the way it was gonna be.

836
01:32:10,868 --> 01:32:14,035
Even after he told me he wasn't my dad.

837
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,665
Once I knew the full score...

838
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:22,128
...I understood why he always
treated you a little bit better than me.

839
01:32:23,423 --> 01:32:27,041
I said, "I'll just hang around
and take the leftovers."

840
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,717
Like a dog.

841
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:32,088
That's how much I loved Steve.

842
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:33,801
Like a goddamn dog!

843
01:32:34,017 --> 01:32:36,389
Look, we don't have to talk
about this now.

844
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:39,931
Shit! I want to talk about it now
and you'll listen!

845
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:41,933
This is a crock of shit.

846
01:32:42,066 --> 01:32:46,396
He set you up to conquer the world,
and he didn't leave me shit!

847
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:49,102
Nobody told you
to throw your life away, man.

848
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:52,365
I'm only sorry I didn't say anything
about your drinking.

849
01:32:52,452 --> 01:32:53,827
You did it to yourself.

850
01:32:53,911 --> 01:32:57,612
You come in here
like you own the goddamn country.

851
01:32:57,832 --> 01:33:01,664
To me, you'll always be the little
asshole who followed me around.

852
01:33:01,878 --> 01:33:03,705
Yeah, I followed you around.

853
01:33:03,963 --> 01:33:06,964
I followed you around
'cause I thought you were somebody.

854
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:08,296
Then.

855
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:10,544
Don't you walk out on me!

856
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,259
Don't you talk to me like this!

857
01:33:22,482 --> 01:33:24,688
You wanted her. I'm not Rosie, asshole.

858
01:33:25,818 --> 01:33:27,811
You asked for it!

859
01:33:28,112 --> 01:33:30,568
I'll kill you!

860
01:33:54,722 --> 01:33:57,130
He couldn't have meant it. He's just hurt.

861
01:33:58,142 --> 01:34:00,812
Your success can't be easy for him.

862
01:34:02,855 --> 01:34:04,018
I love you, Donna.

863
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:05,933
I'll always love you.

864
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:09,728
You sound so serious.

865
01:34:11,197 --> 01:34:12,193
I am.

866
01:34:15,493 --> 01:34:17,818
I'm still going to marry you
one of these days.

867
01:34:19,622 --> 01:34:20,997
Will you wait for me?

868
01:34:21,165 --> 01:34:22,825
For how long? Forever?

869
01:34:27,588 --> 01:34:29,131
No, until I'm 25.

870
01:34:29,215 --> 01:34:32,833
Then I'll have a big glass cabinet
to keep all my gold records in.

871
01:34:39,267 --> 01:34:40,844
I love you.

872
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:49,060
I'm never going to let anyone get in
the way of my feelings for you, ever again.

873
01:34:53,573 --> 01:34:55,530
- Come here.
- What?

874
01:35:02,081 --> 01:35:03,326
Come here.

875
01:35:33,029 --> 01:35:36,647
The whole heating system in the bus
broke down. The whole bus is shot.

876
01:35:36,782 --> 01:35:38,941
You didn't say the tour
would be like this.

877
01:35:39,035 --> 01:35:40,612
The hell with it, come home.

878
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:43,621
- You mean quit?
- No. You're sick.

879
01:35:43,915 --> 01:35:46,951
I'm really sorry.

880
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:51,252
No, I'll stick it out.
But see what you can do about the bus.

881
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:55,715
Look, take care of yourself,
and I'll call you tomorrow.

882
01:36:00,056 --> 01:36:01,716
Hello, baby.

883
01:36:03,309 --> 01:36:04,803
How you feeling?

884
01:36:05,019 --> 01:36:08,435
Listen, Holly's lining up a plane
to fly us to Fargo tonight.

885
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,109
- All of us?
- Just the headliners.

886
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:15,444
You better get with it,
or you'll be out in the cold.

887
01:36:15,571 --> 01:36:19,984
You catching my snow drift, man?
The word is out, all right?

888
01:36:57,488 --> 01:36:58,519
Hello.

889
01:36:58,614 --> 01:36:59,645
Hello, Bob.

890
01:37:00,825 --> 01:37:02,070
It's me, Ritchie.

891
01:37:05,204 --> 01:37:07,411
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

892
01:37:07,999 --> 01:37:10,157
I can barely hear you. You sound funny.

893
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,370
I got a cold.

894
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:14,576
Is Mom there?

895
01:37:14,672 --> 01:37:17,210
No, no one is here.
They all went to church.

896
01:37:17,466 --> 01:37:19,210
Just me and my daughter here.

897
01:37:19,677 --> 01:37:23,212
I was going to go, but you know how it is.

898
01:37:28,185 --> 01:37:29,929
Sure wish I was there.

899
01:37:30,563 --> 01:37:33,480
But you can't have your cake
and eat it, too.

900
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:36,391
Listen, Bob.

901
01:37:38,738 --> 01:37:41,407
Why don't you fly to Chicago
and meet me?

902
01:37:41,657 --> 01:37:45,322
We can finish the tour together.
I need some family around me.

903
01:37:48,164 --> 01:37:50,073
Sure you want me around?

904
01:37:51,876 --> 01:37:54,830
After all that happened and
the shit I said?

905
01:37:55,046 --> 01:37:57,204
Those were your real feelings.

906
01:37:58,382 --> 01:38:00,339
We're still brothers, aren't we?

907
01:38:08,517 --> 01:38:09,680
You still there?

908
01:38:11,896 --> 01:38:14,221
Yeah, cabron, I'm still here.

909
01:38:15,608 --> 01:38:17,268
And I'm still your brother.

910
01:38:20,112 --> 01:38:21,144
All right, man.

911
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:24,192
I'll see you in Chicago.

912
01:38:26,494 --> 01:38:27,988
Later, alligator.

913
01:38:46,305 --> 01:38:48,298
Look what just rolled in.

914
01:38:51,352 --> 01:38:52,348
It's cold.

915
01:38:53,521 --> 01:38:55,264
Ritchie, here's the situation.

916
01:38:55,815 --> 01:38:57,558
I heard how you feel about flying.

917
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,142
I didn't think you'd be interested.

918
01:39:00,444 --> 01:39:03,860
It's between Tommy and you.
I'll toss this coin.

919
01:39:04,281 --> 01:39:08,943
Whoever wins will ride in this plane
and will sleep in a warm bed tonight.

920
01:39:09,161 --> 01:39:12,744
Whoever loses
will freeze his ass off on the bus.

921
01:39:15,209 --> 01:39:16,372
Heads!

922
01:39:18,587 --> 01:39:19,750
Heads it is.

923
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:22,164
Alright. Ritchie, let's fly!

924
01:39:22,258 --> 01:39:25,923
Allsup, back on the bus. Have a good ride.
We'll see you in North Dakota.

925
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:27,007
Sorry, Tommy.

926
01:39:27,513 --> 01:39:29,969
The first coin toss I ever won.

927
01:39:30,391 --> 01:39:32,051
Come on, let's go.

928
01:39:35,271 --> 01:39:37,844
Jesus. You look like the Three Stooges.

929
01:39:51,162 --> 01:39:53,735
Ritchie, relax. Everything's cool.

930
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:58,377
The sky belongs to the stars, right?

931
01:40:40,419 --> 01:40:43,171
We interrupt this program
to bring you this bulletin.

932
01:40:43,631 --> 01:40:47,331
Four persons, three identified as
nationally famous rock 'n' roll singers...

933
01:40:47,802 --> 01:40:52,463
...died early today in a plane crash,
five miles north of Clear Lake, Iowa.

934
01:40:52,598 --> 01:40:54,923
Buddy Holly, 22, of Lubbock, Texas.

935
01:40:55,142 --> 01:40:58,227
Ritchie Valens, 17,
of Los Angeles, California.

936
01:40:58,646 --> 01:41:03,142
And J.P. Richardson, 29, of Louisiana,
known professionally as The Big Bopper.

937
01:41:04,443 --> 01:41:06,768
Did you hear? Did you hear...

938
01:41:06,862 --> 01:41:09,187
...what the radio said about Ritchie?

939
01:41:09,657 --> 01:41:11,281
Are you sure he said Ritchie?

940
01:41:12,493 --> 01:41:15,494
Oh, my God! What about Connie?

941
01:41:25,047 --> 01:41:26,707
What is it? What's the matter?

942
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:29,459
You'd better sit down, Donna.

943
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:35,303
We understand Holly chartered the plane...

944
01:41:35,391 --> 01:41:38,890
...because the tour bus
had broken down several times...

945
01:41:39,436 --> 01:41:41,263
...and had no heating system.

946
01:41:47,278 --> 01:41:50,362
The youngest of the three stars
killed in the crash was Valens.

947
01:41:50,781 --> 01:41:53,865
At 17, this youngster
from Pacoima, California...

948
01:41:53,951 --> 01:41:57,154
...won a place at the top of the charts
with his hits, Donna...

949
01:41:57,246 --> 01:41:59,654
...La Bamba and Come On, Let's Go.

950
01:42:00,374 --> 01:42:02,117
Valens was still in high school...

951
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:04,368
...when he was signed to the Del-Fi label.

952
01:42:05,004 --> 01:42:07,043
And just a brief eight months later...

953
01:42:07,882 --> 01:42:09,424
...Ritchie Valens is gone.

954
01:42:13,929 --> 01:42:15,589
Not Ritchie.

955
01:42:16,891 --> 01:42:18,551
Not my Ritchie!

956
01:43:13,989 --> 01:43:16,112
Here in the San Fernando Valley...

957
01:43:16,533 --> 01:43:19,024
...and perhaps,
throughout the entire nation...

958
01:43:19,578 --> 01:43:21,820
...the name of Ritchie Valens...
