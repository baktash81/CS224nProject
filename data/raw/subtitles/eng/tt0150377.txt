1
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:17,170
I'm pretty hungry. I hope we catch
some fish soon. Help me wind.

2
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,540
Turn this one.
Slowly.

3
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,083
- Slowly.
- I am doing it slowly.

4
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,484
Oh Matty, look.
You see that big boat?

5
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:35,788
She is the prettiest boat on
Whidbey Island. The "Morning Star".

6
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:41,195
Some day I'll teach you to sail.
It's the best thing there is.

7
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:45,963
- Better than fishing?
- Yep. But you know what, kiddo?

8
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,872
I don't think I want you to grow up.
What if you marry some beautiful girl?

9
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:55,071
- Who's going to sail with me then?
- Dad?

10
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,840
Not a chance.

11
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:18,233
- Nick, we need to talk.
- Always happy to talk to you, Rudy.

12
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,632
Hey, Warren.

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:25,301
- Get that notice from First Seattle?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

14
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,073
Then you know you've got a problem.

15
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,912
First Seattle is not a problem.
These martinis are a problem.

16
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,715
Do you mind?
Where were we? First Seattle...

17
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,920
- Mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.

18
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,791
- How's it going?
- Hand-off.

19
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,757
He's a sack of potatoes.

20
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:53,634
You've carried him around the whole
party? We'll never marry you off.

21
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,501
Yes.

22
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,774
Picasso. Blue period.

23
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,850
The artist's name is Kandinsky.
Wassily Kandinsky.

24
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,752
German, of Russian extraction.
1866-1944.

25
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,623
By the way, Picasso's blue period
was figurative, and ended in 1904.

26
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,754
These watercolors are abstract,
done in 1911.

27
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,838
Picasso.

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,004
Everyone, pipe down.
I'm about to give a speech.

29
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,411
The sign of a good party is when I'm
having a better time than anyone else.

30
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,954
But now is the time you ante up, for
drinking my liquor, eating my food.

31
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,819
Spilling tomato sauce on my couch...
Bobby Long.

32
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,291
You didn't think I saw you?

33
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:55,500
- He is insufferable.
- The Small Frye School needs cash.

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,733
So while you're reaching
for your cheque-books...

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:08,336
I'm pleased to introduce Rebecca
Tingley, our ravishing headmistress.

36
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,019
Mr. Parsons. Thank you.

37
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:20,522
I'd like to start by introducing
a few members of my valuable staff.

38
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:25,926
Our dedicated teacher, and head
of admissions, Miss Angela Green.

39
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,116
What are you thinking about?

40
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,551
- Was I always as rude as I am now?
- Absolutely.

41
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,895
Hi.
Come have a seat.

42
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:20,217
- Should we break the news to her?
- It's best she hears it from us.

43
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,652
- She's not going to be happy about it.
- What's up, guys?

44
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,654
Close your eyes. Close them.

45
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,727
Stand up.

46
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,441
- Libby, what is your favorite thing?
- Me?

47
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,276
Not even close.

48
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,180
All right, open.

49
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,450
I made Sean an offer.

50
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,926
He agreed to let us take it out for
the weekend. If you like it, it's yours.

51
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,498
If I like it?

52
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,461
- We can't afford it.
- Have I ever let that get in my way?

53
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,869
- What about Matty?
- I'll take care of him. It'll be great.

54
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,104
- You hate to sail.
- I can learn.

55
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:59,010
Generally, a wine like this
needs time to breathe.

56
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,211
I don't think we should... wait.

57
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,686
I don't see land.

58
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,323
So where is it?

59
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:17,661
Alaska's that way, Japan is straight
ahead, and Australia is off to the left.

60
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,068
- Where would you like to go?
- Bed.

61
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,033
That can be arranged.

62
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:14,919
- We should do this more often.
- What, buy expensive sailboats?

63
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:19,528
If this is what happens,
I'll buy you another one tomorrow.

64
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,602
No, go away, just the two of us,
with nobody else around.

65
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,736
I'll drink to that.

66
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,952
Nick?

67
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,429
Nick?

68
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,200
Oh, my God...
Nick?

69
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,633
Nick?

70
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,920
Nick?

71
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,204
Nick?!

72
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,654
Oh, my God.

73
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:03,367
Oh, my God. Nick?

74
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:11,373
This is the Coastguard.
Put the knife down and step away.

75
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:17,915
I... I don't know...
I don't know where my husband is.

76
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,036
Hey, Tom.
What have you got for me?

77
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,817
- Anything?
- No.

78
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:02,985
Cutter, please don't let them
give up. He's a very strong man.

79
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,594
The raft and life preservers
are all on board.

80
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,604
These guys tracked the wind,
the currents...

81
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,042
There's nothing.

82
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,442
The water temperature overnight
was 51 degrees.

83
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,106
That's really cold.

84
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,050
- I can't breathe.
- Just put your head down.

85
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,953
Deep breaths. Big breaths.

86
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,051
Mommy, look!

87
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,834
Hey, kiddo.

88
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,700
Hey, Bobby.

89
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,541
Hey, Libby.

90
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:32,946
Cutter asked me to come by
and talk to you.

91
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,611
Not as an attorney, just as a friend.

92
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:45,326
The inquest was held this morning.
Nick's officially been declared dead.

93
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:54,263
Libby, they determined it was
a wrongful death, and you...

94
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,938
Jesus... You're being
formally charged with his murder.

95
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:04,208
I'm here to advise you, make no
statements whatsoever to the sheriff.

96
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,111
I'm sorry, Libby.

97
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,192
Cutter!

98
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,921
Not in front of my kid, okay?

99
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,256
I'm sorry, Libby.
The judge denied us bail.

100
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:05,637
Can Angie keep looking after Matty?
Good.

101
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,911
Okay...

102
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,375
Let's take a look at this,
see what we can do.

103
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,179
Bobby, here's what I think happened.

104
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:22,121
I had some wine. And I fell asleep.
It must have been the sun.

105
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:28,528
Maybe Nick was trying to cut
a snagged line, because... -

106
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,933
- the knife from the galley
was on deck.

107
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:39,135
And maybe the boat pitched,
and he cut himself.

108
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:43,839
And he tried to come below
to wake me up.

109
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,662
I quit these when I met Nick.

110
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,395
It'll be all right. I promise you.

111
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,707
Why don't we take a look
at this First Guarantee Life?

112
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:18,813
You both bought insurance policies
from the company four months ago.

113
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,442
- And you are the beneficiary?
- I'm his wife.

114
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:28,082
- You know it's worth two million?
- He wanted everything to be okay.

115
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:34,426
I'm afraid the jury may see
the two million as a motive.

116
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,195
- Is that what they're saying out there?
- No one is saying...

117
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,533
That I killed Nick for money?

118
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,570
I know we had problems,
and Nick worried, but we were okay.

119
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,945
Two of his investors
were suing him for embezzlement.

120
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,817
First Seattle issued a lien on
all his properties, your possessions...

121
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,828
Nick's death erases these problems,
leaving you with two million dollars.

122
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:13,265
- Do you think I killed him?
- What lawyers think doesn't matter.

123
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,634
It matters to me.

124
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,877
No, of course,
I don't think you killed him.

125
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:32,213
What was the condition of the radio
when you had a chance to inspect it?

126
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:39,160
- The handset cord had been cut.
- And as you approached the boat, -

127
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,233
- what did you see?
- Mrs. Parsons was holding a knife.

128
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,665
I show you State's exhibit
number four.

129
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,610
Mayday, mayday,
this is "Morning Star".

130
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:00,343
- State your emergency.
- I've been stabbed.

131
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,253
I'm bleeding. Jesus...
My name is Nicholas Parsons.

132
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,293
- State your position?
- I don't know.

133
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:15,229
Three miles northwest of
Whidbey Island, I guess.

134
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,426
Oh, God!

135
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,436
Mrs. Parsons,
you've heard the testimony,

136
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,205
and your explanation is that someone
must have boarded the boat.

137
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,813
That's right.

138
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:34,043
Well, let's consider
all the possibilities.

139
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:40,317
Maybe a band of pirates. Or aliens.
Did aliens murder your husband?

140
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,258
No, aliens weren't beneficiaries in
your husband's life insurance.

141
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,991
- Objection. The prosecutor...
- Overruled.

142
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:54,402
- I told you what happened.
- You told us that you were asleep.

143
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,804
Maybe you were sleepwalking
when you stabbed him to death.

144
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,709
- This isn't a closing argument?
- Withdrawn.

145
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:10,010
I didn't kill my husband.
I loved my husband.

146
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,823
I did not kill my husband!

147
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,021
You have to believe me.

148
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,281
I'm sorry, Libby.

149
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,746
It's not your fault, Bobby.

150
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,429
I want to ask you something, Angie.

151
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,863
I'd like you to adopt my son.

152
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,103
- I can't do that. Not to you.
- I've thought it through.

153
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,079
I barely survived my parents' house.
I'm not going to put him there.

154
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:19,821
Money's no problem. The two million
is going into a trust fund in his name.

155
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,792
- It isn't about money.
- I know.

156
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,332
Matty loves you.

157
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,999
We can't let him become
a ward of the State.

158
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,851
Thank you.

159
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,221
Hey kiddo, come see me.

160
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,063
You're going to stay with Angie
for a while.

161
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,071
And you're going to have lots of fun.

162
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,370
I know you're going to be a good boy.

163
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,308
Yes, Mommy.

164
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,078
As soon as all this is over, -

165
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,776
- we'll be together again.

166
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,381
That's a promise, kiddo.

167
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,988
I love you.

168
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,092
I love you too.

169
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,680
- Who's this?
- Rich bitch from Whidbey Island.

170
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,260
- She ain't gonna make it.
- What do you think? A year?

171
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,457
Five cartons says she offs herself
inside of six months.

172
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,764
- Get away from me.
- Take it easy. We're your friends.

173
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,203
Heard you did your husband.
He probably deserved it.

174
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,104
Mine did.

175
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:22,038
- I know what a pain it is to get here.
- I taught him how to say the ABC's.

176
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,266
- Is that true?
- Yes.

177
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:28,641
Did you learn the alphabet, sweetie?
Can you tell me?

178
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:33,308
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

179
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,977
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,

180
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,488
Q, R, S, T, U, V,

181
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,493
W, X, Y and Z.

182
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,895
Now I know my ABC's

183
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,161
next time won't you sing with me.

184
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,412
- Give it up. Come on.
- Get off the phone, bitch.

185
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,258
You're low on cigarettes. You wanna
make friends? Buy another pack fast.

186
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,129
'Cause your personality
ain't the best I've ever seen.

187
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,794
You're trying to reach your friend,
the one with your boy?

188
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:04,703
Yeah, I can't find him.
He disappeared.

189
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:09,279
If you could disappear that easy,
I wouldn't be here now.

190
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,177
Me either.

191
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,116
Think. Use your head.

192
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,190
There's got to be a way
to track him down.

193
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,465
- Small Frye School. Front office.
- Hello, this is Angela Green.

194
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:39,303
- Angie, it's Jennifer.
- It's nice to hear your voice.

195
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,606
I haven't got a severance cheque
in a while.

196
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:47,184
Do you have my correct address
and phone number?

197
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:52,187
- I'll check. Can you hold on a sec?
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

198
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,190
Yeah, I have it right here.
Tell me if this is right.

199
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:04,666
3321 Mason Street,
San Francisco 94105.

200
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,430
The phone number is 415...

201
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,077
- Hello?
- Angie?

202
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:20,446
- Libby, I've tried to call you.
- Is Matty okay? Where is he?

203
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,020
- Everything is fine.
- Why are you in San Francisco?

204
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,625
- Put him on the phone.
- Why are you acting this way?

205
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,091
You disappeared!
I haven't seen my son in a month!

206
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,164
- I was just about to call you.
- Bullshit!

207
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:39,099
- How can you move and not tell me?
- We were coming next week.

208
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,705
Just put Matty on the phone.

209
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,312
Matty, it's Mommy. Come say hi.

210
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,853
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hello, sweetie-pie.

211
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,924
How are you, Matty?

212
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:06,428
I think about you all the time. I miss
you so much. Are you doing okay?

213
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,792
I love you.

214
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:12,927
I know this has been really hard, -

215
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,164
- but Angie's going to bring you
up to see me next week.

216
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,003
Yes, Mommy...
Daddy!

217
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,536
Nick?

218
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:51,068
He was in San Francisco last night.
The number is already disconnected.

219
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,401
No, I don't have
a forwarding address. He's gone.

220
00:27:56,574 --> 00:28:01,534
Don't you have investigators? Doesn't
your company want its two million?

221
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:06,013
Why aren't you listening to me?
I am innocent.

222
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,798
Put some elbow grease into it.
No one wants burnt tapioca.

223
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:33,433
- Does it smell like it's burning?
- You got shit for brains, girl.

224
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,512
You're in prison.
Do you get that?

225
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:43,519
So you can forget about re-opening
your case, or a jailhouse appeal.

226
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:48,523
They take years,
and they're 95% unsuccessful.

227
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:53,392
So if you want my advice, and you're
gonna get it, you do your time.

228
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,126
What are you now, a lawyer?

229
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,792
Once upon a time.

230
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:06,241
But they tend to disbar murderers.
Here's your Christmas present...

231
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,472
Pay attention, this is the best advice
you're ever gonna get.

232
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,675
You ever hear of something called
double jeopardy?

233
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:19,984
It provides that no person may be
tried for the same crime twice.

234
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:26,324
They say you killed your husband.
They can't convict you a second time.

235
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:32,095
When you leave, track him down.
When you find him, you can kill him.

236
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:39,309
You can walk right up to him, put
a gun to his head and pull the trigger.

237
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,412
And there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

238
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,718
Makes you feel
warm and tingly all over, don't it?

239
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,911
That's right, keep stirring.

240
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:21,079
I got to hand it to you, honey,
it's sheer hate driving you on.

241
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:40,930
The only way you'll look like that
is if I staple the picture to your head.

242
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,811
Matty's eighth birthday, honey.

243
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:23,744
I read that even if a child is
separated from its mother at birth, -

244
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,349
- it never forgets her voice.

245
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,177
You think that's true?

246
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,791
Of course I do.

247
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:45,799
- "I've grown these past six years."
- They don't want you to be a tree.

248
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,304
Repeat after me: "If I could trade
places with my husband, I would."

249
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,537
And throw in
that born-again Jesus stuff.

250
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:59,979
Start with this: "I'm not sitting
in front of you to make excuses..."

251
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,110
I'm not sitting in front of you today
to try and make any excuses.

252
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,757
I killed my husband.

253
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,361
I've lived with that for six years.

254
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,996
But I'm a changed person.

255
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,724
Why should we believe you?

256
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:22,203
I can't ask you to believe me.
All I can do is believe in myself.

257
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:27,072
I know that, if I'm given a chance,
I can do something good with my life.

258
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,645
Make up for the wrong I did.

259
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:55,696
Mommy, talk to me.

260
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,274
Man, did you see that?

261
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,692
...if the people who did that
showed up here...

262
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,796
- The man's across the hall.
- Thanks.

263
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,591
Let's imagine that...

264
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,940
Come in.

265
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,349
- I'm Elizabeth Parsons.
- What do you have in that box?

266
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,953
Elizabeth Parsons...

267
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,059
The state of Washington
has granted you a conditional parole.

268
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:03,663
For three years, no fighting,
no fornicating, no drinking or drugs.

269
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,470
- No exceptions. Do you understand?
- Yes.

270
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:14,447
This is your social security card.
You will find sustained employment.

271
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,680
You're not to carry a weapon
of any kind, especially a knife.

272
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,024
Curfew's at 8:30.

273
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,527
My cell-phone number. If there's a
chance you'll be five minutes late, -

274
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:31,031
- you will call me.
I will have you picked up.

275
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:36,333
If you violate these conditions,
your parole will be revoked by me.

276
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:40,409
You'll return to prison to serve
the remainder of your sentence.

277
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,887
- Is this a problem for you?
- No.

278
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:03,659
- Yes, it is. Want to tell me about it?
- No.

279
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,798
- I'm gonna have trouble with you.
- No, I learned my lesson...

280
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:17,403
I'm only interested in your behavior.
Behave yourself. You're in room 8.

281
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,608
You're never going to get anywhere
like that. Here...

282
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,354
Nice shampoo...
What are you looking for?

283
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,724
A friend I haven't seen in a few years.

284
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,559
Boyfriend?

285
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,966
- Girl.
- In that case, I'll help you.

286
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,334
- Does your friend have e-mail?
- I have no idea.

287
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,443
Okay, let's do some surfing.
What's your friend's name?

288
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,307
- Angela Green.
- Zip code?

289
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:30,411
Social security number? We can run
a credit report and get her address.

290
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,787
- She was a schoolteacher.
- Done deal.

291
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,863
And... voila.

292
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,171
Maybe when this thing
is finished searching -

293
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,937
- we could go to this bar I know
and get a drink.

294
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:01,183
- What do you say?
- After I check with my parole officer.

295
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,691
- You've been to jail?
- Prison. Jail is a different thing.

296
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,390
What did you do,
not pay your parking tickets?

297
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,464
I was convicted
of murdering my husband.

298
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:22,129
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not.

299
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,833
Sliced and diced.
Can you believe that?

300
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,847
- You're not kidding.
- No, I said I wasn't.

301
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,350
But it'd be nice to have a drink.
I haven't been out in a long time.

302
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,822
- I have this appointment...
- See you.

303
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,483
See you.

304
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,924
Oh, the book. See you.

305
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,405
Oh, my God.

306
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:06,447
So he takes me out for dinner
and feeds me escargot. Snails!

307
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:11,680
Anyway, the moment I go to bed
with him, the asshole dumps me.

308
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:17,658
- You dick-sticking fuck!
- You insult me by raising your voice.

309
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,228
I don't like being called dirty names.

310
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:25,267
- Don't do this to me.
- Where were you this afternoon?

311
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:30,100
- You were on Pike St. in hot pants.
- I was on my way to work!

312
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,971
You haven't been to work in a week.
Get your stuff.

313
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,912
I'm sorry. I won't ever
do that shit again. I promise that.

314
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,713
You blew off your parole,
you're going back. It's that simple.

315
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:49,418
- You dirty cocksucker!
- You've got a dirty mouth, Ruby.

316
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,155
I just want one chance!
God damn you, you motherfucker!

317
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:59,702
You mean fucker! You send me
back there and they'll kill me!

318
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,964
Fucking asshole!

319
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,569
Show's over. Go to sleep.

320
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:17,048
- Am I a mean son of a bitch?
- She could get a second chance.

321
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:21,988
There are no second chances.
This is the last-chance house.

322
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:29,058
- What's wrong with that guy?
- He used to be a college something.

323
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:35,502
- A law teacher.
- How can a law professor end here?

324
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:40,133
- Life's a bitch.
- He got a DUI and totaled his car.

325
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:45,078
- He totaled his wife and daughter.
- Nobody got killed.

326
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:49,709
When his wife got done with him,
he wished he had. She took it all.

327
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,721
Including the kid.
He hasn't seen his girl in years.

328
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,999
- Libby, it's wrong of you to be here.
- I'm sorry, but you're my only hope.

329
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,973
Sharon, put that down, please.

330
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,604
- Libby, I'm sorry, I can't.
- I want to find my son.

331
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,446
Matty's had six years with Angie.
Think about it. Six years.

332
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,680
Benjamin, that's a great sandcastle.

333
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:04,521
If you come back into his life now,
it'll cause more disruption and pain.

334
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,493
Please, just think about it.

335
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,467
I just want to see him, Rebecca.

336
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,662
Can you give me Angie's address
so I can see him?

337
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,865
I really am sorry.

338
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:12,161
- Where's Parsons?
- I don't know. Not here.

339
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,856
I got her. Up here!

340
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,731
I got her!

341
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,389
There she is!

342
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,024
Jesus Christ, Libby!
What are you doing here?

343
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,459
Did you have a nice day
at the beach?

344
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,204
You've pissed me off, Parsons.

345
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:33,119
Angela Green.
The one who's got your kid, right?

346
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,659
- Could we not talk, please, Lehman?
- All right.

347
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,160
Why'd she skip town?

348
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:44,597
With your husband who isn't dead
because you didn't kill him? Bullshit.

349
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:49,706
I chopped my husband into bits and
dumped him in the Pacific. Satisfied?

350
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:54,140
No! You were a lot closer to your kid
three days ago than you are today.

351
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,748
All you had to do was wait three
years. That's all. You fucking idiot.

352
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:08,658
I sat in prison for six years
and thought of nothing but my son.

353
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,489
Did I make the right choice?
I didn't have one. Fuck your curfew!

354
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,006
Who's that? Your daughter?

355
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,340
Is that a problem for you, Lehman?

356
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,780
I'm going up top.

357
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,690
Don't go anywhere.

358
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,772
Shit!

359
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:43,050
- Did you voluntarily give her a gun?
- Come on, what do you think?

360
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,862
Were you drinking?
It's been known to happen.

361
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,263
Any idea where she's gone?
Well, that's about all then.

362
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,137
There will be an investigation
into your actions today.

363
00:52:56,306 --> 00:53:01,369
I wouldn't hold my breath about
the prospect of keeping your job.

364
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,549
Thanks a lot.

365
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:23,291
I sent your father off to the VFW.
He'll be playing gin for hours.

366
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:28,530
- Some things never change.
- He's not as bad as he used to be.

367
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,071
I'm glad for you, Momma.

368
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:45,717
I always said
there was good money in tomatoes.
