1
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,940
There's a strange old man.

2
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,880
Once he drew a huge image of a Bodhidharma

3
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,480
on a paper as big as 120 tatami.

4
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,140
And another time,

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,540
he painted two sparrows on a grain of rice.

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
You may never have heard of Tetsuzo

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,800
but you have surely heard of the artist named Hokusai.

8
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,940
Well, that strange old man is my dad.

9
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,260
I just stepped on dog poo.

10
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,740
11th year of the Bunka era (1814)
Summer - Edo

11
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,510
Who's there?

12
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
It's me.

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,860
Ah, Oei.

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,100
I bought some bento.

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,890
Thank you.

16
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,780
I heard that recently, your dad have less work.

17
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,520
Who told you that?

18
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,900
Just some gossips.

19
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,960
I hope at least that the both of you can still eat well.

20
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,980
Of course we eat well.

21
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,980
As long as we both have two pens four chopsticks

22
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,100
we'll get enough food.

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,460
I heard that you went to see your sister.

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,070
She said you just went to see her.

25
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,160
To give her a new summer Kimono.

26
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,340
You also sent her some goldfish.

27
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,960
Yeah.

28
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,260
She told me she looks at them every days.

29
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,040
Obviously, she can't really 'see' them.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,500
She can.

31
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,820
Mother, what if I moved here to live with you?

32
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,500
That would make me happy.

33
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,780
But think about your dad...

34
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,340
Tetsuzo really don't care if there's people around him.

35
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,460
Don't talk about him as if he's a lizard.

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480
Finally, the lilacs are blooming.

37
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,020
They are blooming in a frenzy yet die off so quickly.

38
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,600
The long festival is starting.

39
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,420
This is the place we are living in, my dad and I.

40
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,670
We don't cook nor clean up.

41
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,900
We move away when it's too filthy.

42
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,890
Tetsuzo don't care about anything else beside painting.

43
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,600
He doesn't drink nor smoke.

44
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,020
But since he often painted erotic figures, I guess he that.

45
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,360
He did draw it up but it's all gone now.

46
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,460
What do you mean by that?

47
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,280
Please let me see the master.

48
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,590
Well, I don't know where he put it.

49
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,940
Don't play me as a fool.

50
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,520
It's no longer here.

51
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,060
That's true.

52
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,000
Master, where's the Dragon?

53
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,560
As soon as I finished the drawing, it just flew away.

54
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,910
What? We promised it by the end of the month.

55
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,340
We still have a full day left.

56
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,360
Come back tomorrow.

57
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,700
It may fly back from the sky by tomorrow.

58
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,760
And what if it doesn't?

59
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,100
We'll do as you wish.

60
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,500
My Lord wouldn't be satisfied even if I cut both your heads.

61
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,480
I have no choice.

62
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,520
What about a ritual apology?

63
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,360
It will hurt badly.

64
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,120
Even if it's due tomorrow, I won't draw it.

65
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,560
I know.

66
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,380
It's a bad idea, Big Bro...

67
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,890
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,380
I said that you need to meet Master Hokusai.

69
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,760
That drunk is named Zenjirou.

70
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,000
That parasite decided to live with us and is a shameless womanizer.

71
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,170
He was a samurai once.

72
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,220
He abandoned his swords to become a painter because of something he did.

73
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,270
I met this guy at the store.

74
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,080
Err...

75
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,180
Hey you,

76
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,860
You better not forget to be thankful
If you ever become an artist one day.

77
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,630
The old guy you see there is the famous Mr. Hokusai.

78
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,460
It's a big honor for me.

79
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,860
My name is Kuninao Utagawa and I'm under the tutelage of Toyokuni Utagawa.

80
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,860
(Utagawa Toyokuni: Edo Ukiyo-e artist
1769 – 24 February 1825)

81
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,240
Although I'm an Utagawa school disciple, I admire your work, Mr. Hokusai.

82
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,940
Let me stay for the evening, Master.

83
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,060
Kuninao?

84
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,380
Why didn't you say so!?

85
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,340
You didn't ask.

86
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
So you really are Kuninao...

87
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,160
You're well liked.

88
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,840
No, don't flatter me.

89
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,960
Sit down.

90
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,780
Ok

91
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,040
You're nineteen, right?

92
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,660
Yes.

93
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,720
So you are four years younger than me.

94
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,740
Eat!

95
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,660
No!

96
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't hold back! You're still growing!

97
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,560
Stop that, Big Bro...

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,780
Sorry to wake you up, miss.

99
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,160
Oh! The dog poo!

100
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,580
Hmmf...

101
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you know her?

102
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,500
She's the Master's daughter, miss Oei.

103
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,900
You're miss Oei??

104
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,470
That's such a coincidence. I often see you on the bridge.

105
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
A dragon?

106
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,060
It needs skills.

107
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,750
You can weaken it by shaking your brush tip

108
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,190
and by seeing it clearly in your head.

109
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,480
And then, you must hold your breath

110
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,420
and wait for it to come down.

111
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,750
As soon as he land,

112
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,680
you immobilize it with a brush stroke.

113
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,500
It's unlike anything

114
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,620
so are the rules for capturing it.

115
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,500
What? It's not me saying it.

116
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,720
It's a old story.

117
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,140
That's outrageous!

118
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,710
Courting the Master's daughter?

119
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,100
How dare you?

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,430
Don't misunderstand ...

121
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,090
I wasn't trying to offend miss Oei...

122
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,900
Women must  like you.

123
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,890
Your seduction technique is unusual...

124
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,410
You brat!

125
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,280
Don't brag!

126
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,240
Get out!!

127
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,360
Wow. She even driven out her own father.

128
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,420
Master, let's go drink something.

129
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,160
Ok, just for a few cups.

130
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,700
Look over there, she telling us to go inside.

131
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,440
She's teasing!

132
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,960
Dragons don't really exists in this world.

133
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,390
I saw one in Shinshu when I was a kid.

134
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,120
You must have seen a tornado.

135
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,340
That's what happens when the wind whirlwind through a valley or a mountain.

136
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,570
I've seen one.

137
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,520
I clearly saw scales and fangs in the dark clouds.

138
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,940
You're just imagining stuff.

139
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,920
That's because you are too shallow that you can't draw a good picture.

140
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,090
The people you paint look totally fake.

141
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,260
As soon as they try to take a step, they turn into a pool of mud.

142
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,040
But what's interesting is the smell your painting have.

143
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,900
Since they are piling in the house, it smell a lot.

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,020
You have talent, that could be dangerous.

145
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,900
D... dangerous?

146
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,220
Yeah, that may put you in danger.

147
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,880
Be careful not to provoke other artists older than you.

148
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,800
Right.

149
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,960
So annoying.

150
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,730
Since you got here, I didn't understood anything of what you said.

151
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,740
What!?

152
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,110
Stay out of our conversation!

153
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,360
You tease!

154
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,860
You're becoming really angry.

155
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,180
Woman, you know who that man is?

156
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,110
That old guy is Master Hokusai!

157
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,570
What a good joke!

158
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,530
That makes me happy!

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,460
You really love joking.

160
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,680
Good morning, the other two just left before dawn.

161
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,720
What a dumb head, I woke up too late.

162
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,900
Shoo shoo!

163
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,880
What?

164
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,260
So you managed to get inside, you curious little thing.

165
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,200
What? Are you saying we are the same?

166
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,940
Onao

167
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,640
Big sister!

168
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,800
I got permission from the head mother.

169
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,420
We'll go for a short walk.

170
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,880
Onao was born blind.

171
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,720
Miss Oei, you have some ink on your face.

172
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,180
Did you wipe it out?

173
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,010
Where do you want to go?

174
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,800
On the bridge.

175
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,680
Again?

176
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,010
You really like that bridge, Onao.

177
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,340
Spicy chili peppers for sale!

178
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,100
Glutinous rice dumpling with honey!

179
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,040
It's a good place to hear a wide variety of sounds.

180
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,580
And odors too.

181
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,460
Ah? That's very interesting.

182
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,840
I like that Bridge too.

183
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,100
Rice cake?

184
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,660
Is it rice cake from Ishihara?

185
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,540
No. It's from Tozaki. Enjoy.

186
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,200
Dad never have the time to come see me.

187
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Do you know why?

188
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,930
That's because he's too busy with work.

189
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,160
He doesn't dislike you, Onao.

190
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,320
My body is so weak that I can't properly help mom and dad.

191
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,540
If I were to die, I would surely go straight to hell.

192
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,380
Don't be silly!

193
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,500
Tetsuzo is useless and a coward crybaby.

194
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,620
Miss Oei.

195
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,190
Is she the master's youngest daughter?

196
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,040
She's Onao

197
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,240
She's lodging at Anju, learning to play the Biwa

198
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,580
Yeah, the master mentioned it.

199
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,960
Miss Onao, I'm your dad newest disciple, Hatsugorou.

200
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,540
My painter's pen name is Hokkei Totoya.

201
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Totoya? Like the fish?

202
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,280
Yeah. I used to sell fish.

203
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,790
What were you doing?

204
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,620
We were just taking a look at this bridge, enjoying the sounds and smell.

205
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,200
That's nice. The bridge is an interesting place.

206
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,240
Oh, by the way...

207
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,560
Your latest women paintings are really beautiful.

208
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,200
They are much better than my paintings.

209
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,820
That's not true.... really.

210
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,480
No no. Even Manjido think so.

211
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,380
I have to go, good-bye.

212
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,760
I have to go to the printing workshop.

213
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,840
See you again, Onao.

214
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,600
This is for you, miss Oei.

215
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,800
Hm?

216
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,840
Here.

217
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,540
For that ink stain.

218
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,380
It's such a pity on your pretty face.

219
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,080
Good-bye

220
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,220
He seems really nice.

221
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,100
Yeah, he's really someone nice.

222
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,580
You were not acting the same as usual.

223
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't be silly!

224
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,740
Say, let's take the boat.

225
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
So? It's very nice, right?

226
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,180
And now, we're going through under the bridge.

227
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,920
Are you afraid?

228
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,140
Where will we end up if we keep going?

229
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,340
To the sea.

230
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,510
The sea's really big.

231
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,460
Bigger than all of Honjo and Asakusa combined.

232
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,670
Ah?

233
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,050
Tetsuzo often painted it.

234
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,700
It's thrilling to see the waves roll.

235
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,020
A single giant wave could engulf this boat.

236
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,570
Waves?

237
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,380
Ow ow ow...

238
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,720
Please, spare me master Hokusai.

239
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,080
You're right, let's stop painting something so filthy.

240
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
You're making me do such awful things.

241
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,640
And now your face is all dirty.

242
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,250
What's that?

243
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,380
Ah... That's an erotic drawing.

244
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,040
The visages look too much like Eizan Kikukawa's work.

245
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,040
(Eizan Kikukawa: Late Edo ukiyo-e artist,
1787 – July 17, 1867)

246
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,680
As for the composition, it's a replica of Utamaro's style.

247
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,680
(Utamaro Kitagawa: Edo Ukiyo-e artist,
1753 – 31 October 1806)

248
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
You're right.

249
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,800
That's why Oei says you are so useless and incompetent.

250
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,470
Miss Oei's so talented at painting erotic figures.

251
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,600
It's hard to compete.

252
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,050
Your lack of ambition is why she despise you.

253
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,840
Eh?

254
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,900
She's good at painting women.

255
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,580
I often think she's better at it than me.

256
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,080
As for drawing men, she always model them on my paintings.

257
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,850
Yeah.

258
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,070
That idiot betrays herself by trying to draw something that she has no knowledge of.

259
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,800
Something that miss Oei has no knowledge of?

260
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,930
That's why shouldn't be depressed about it.

261
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,300
Don't you think you should be ashamed of letting your daughter draw erotic figures?

262
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,520
She stubbornly says she can draw anything.

263
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,290
She's reluctant to admit to any weakness.

264
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Hm?

265
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,640
Welcome back.

266
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,180
What do you want, Mr incompetent?

267
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,180
Nothing.

268
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,500
You're going somewhere?

269
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,780
Yeah, I'm going to Yoshiwara to paint a courtesan.

270
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,780
(Yoshiwara:  Edo's red-light district, created in 1617)

271
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,680
You're going to Naka?

272
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,520
Manjido personally asked me to do a painting of her.

273
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,000
You know that courtesan's nickname and where she lives?

274
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,080
Why are you asking?

275
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,980
Ah... never mind.

276
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,740
She's Sayogoromo of house Kikyo.

277
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,840
How do you know?

278
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,220
The rumors currently circulating in Naka are all about

279
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,400
a famous courtesan named Sayogoromo.

280
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,860
Rumors? What are they saying?

281
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,460
They say that when it's nearly dawn...

282
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,440
...her head suddenly move away from her body.

283
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,140
She's getting taller?

284
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,320
But that's only unproven rumors.

285
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,560
I stayed until the morning and didn't see the slightest movement.

286
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,300
Those patrons probably just dreamed about it.

287
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,370
Sayogoromo always put an act but truth is,
she goes to bed completely slovenly.

288
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,480
It must only be her head falling off the pillow in the morning.

289
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,280
You really see that happen?

290
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,880
Yeah, with my own eyes.

291
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
Then she's really getting taller.

292
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,260
Eh?

293
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,460
You're such a worldly person, how can you see real ghosts?

294
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,050
They are really nice.

295
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,760
Those are more glamorous than me.

296
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,670
Young girl, I think you have real talent.

297
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,160
Those drawings will guide me for the real paintings.

298
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,870
Then I'll do the nishiki-e.

299
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,870
(Nishiki-e: Multi-colored woodblock printing for ukiyo-e)

300
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,070
I can't wait to see them.

301
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
Sorry for the wait.

302
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,040
What did you want with me?

303
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,280
If you wish to see strange phenomenon you should try going to Higashi Ryogoku.

304
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,490
This is Yoshiwara, not a freak show.

305
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,880
We meant no offence!

306
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,370
Get out!

307
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,310
That old man came here to tell you a story.

308
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,450
At least listen to it.

309
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,650
It's not a long story, please sit down.

310
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,450
I'm her father and I'm also a painter.

311
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,720
So, it's a story that happened before she was born.

312
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,150
Twenty-five years ago.

313
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,950
Someone commissioned a painting about ghosts.

314
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,950
I finished it at sunset,

315
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,440
so I decided to take a rest.

316
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,500
I then heard the sound of beating against the tatami.

317
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,350
I look around and saw

318
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,220
that my own hands were moving.

319
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,940
Then my hands left my body

320
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,800
and flew out the window.

321
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,680
Since only my hands had left,

322
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,170
I couldn't see where they went.

323
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,300
However, the wind against my fingertip was very cold.

324
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,080
I concluded that my hands were flying away at high speed.

325
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,900
It keep happening every night.

326
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,750
It was very frightening at first

327
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,350
but It became interesting.

328
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,770
Sometimes they were flying through miscanthus.

329
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,350
Sometimes wrapped around the spire of a five-storied pagoda.

330
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,020
Sometimes flying under a bridge.

331
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,120
And then I asked myself,

332
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,170
what if they were to get cut by accident while flying around?

333
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,700
Would I still be able to use my real hands?

334
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,400
Back then, I didn't draw much yet.

335
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,620
I went to see a monk about it.

336
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,100
He told me to do something about it.

337
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,980
Then the monk wrote scriptures on my arms and wrapped them with prayer beads.

338
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,030
After that night, It never happened again.

339
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,980
And I became the great painter that I am today.

340
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,610
Congratulation.

341
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,640
If you hear the sound of a bell tonight, please come to the room next door.

342
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,800
If you don't hear anything by dawn, then please leave.

343
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,950
This will be our secret.

344
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,800
Understood?

345
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,150
This is no different than work.

346
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,200
You are not forced to stay.

347
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,850
Do as you want.

348
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,800
Well, occasionally, this could be fun.

349
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,150
You're noisy.

350
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,120
What?

351
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,200
I didn't say anything.

352
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,010
You have been moaning and groaning.

353
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,440
It's because it feels like a very long night.

354
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,800
Is this a bug?

355
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,820
Can you see something?

356
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,170
What?

357
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,320
She can't go out of that net.

358
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,680
It act like a barrier.

359
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,450
You're lucky there's a net.

360
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,480
Actually, I can cross it very easily.

361
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,200
But if you fly out of the net...

362
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,650
Are you suggesting that I put some sutra and prayer beads around my neck?

363
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,650
What if your head never come back?

364
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,590
Then I'll see when that happens.

365
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,940
It can't be, leaving that place and still stay pure and chaste.

366
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,750
I never heard about that story before today, master.

367
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,100
The one about your hands.

368
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,720
Don't be a fool. It never happened.

369
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,690
It's an old Chinese story that Bakim wrote.

370
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,190
Why did you do that?

371
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,820
If I didn't told that story, we wouldn't have seen such a wonder.

372
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,350
Finally, I don't understand anything at all.

373
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,700
I wanted to see a completely different kind of wonder.

374
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,850
That's why your drawings are so shallow.

375
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,700
I can't help but love to see a fire.

376
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,080
As soon as I hear the alarm, I can't sit still.

377
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,120
Hurry up!

378
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,900
It's spreading!

379
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,170
Pull!

380
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,400
Pull!

381
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Pull!

382
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,850
You guys, go over there!

383
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,300
Quickly!

384
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,870
Look at it!

385
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,540
Watching the fire soldiers demolish a house.

386
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,050
Pulling it away from the fire to cut off its path,

387
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,620
and seeing the fire die like a big bonfire.

388
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,710
Another fire?

389
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,410
What's so great about it?

390
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,870
What can I say. It's the same way you like women and Tetsuzo like candy.

391
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,120
I see.

392
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,630
Bunch of idiots.

393
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,460
The fields on the right are snow covered and all white.

394
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,670
The Okawa river's cherry trees obviously won't bloom until spring.

395
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,370
But seeing the bare branches covered with snow is very pretty.

396
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,020
Aren't you cold?

397
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,470
The Mimegori Inari's Torii is in front of us.

398
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,470
(Torii: Gate that mark the entrance to a sacred space.)

399
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,550
It was built before the river wall,

400
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,760
so the top of the Torii is in line with your eyes.

401
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,010
A Torii is this shape. Are you visualizing it?

402
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,350
We're going down the steps.

403
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,570
Wait a little.

404
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,450
What is it?

405
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,650
It's a camellia.

406
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,820
It's my favorite flower.

407
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,960
Give me your hand.

408
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,150
What color is it?

409
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,270
It's red.

410
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,550
It's a warm and gentle color.

411
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,510
You can keep it.

412
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll put it in your sleeve.

413
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,000
There's no sound.

414
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,620
Yes, it's very quiet.

415
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,120
The sounds are absorbed by the snow cover.

416
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,000
Are you afraid?

417
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,760
You're getting cold.

418
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,650
Two glasses of warm wine.

419
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,100
Wait here, I'll go ask her.

420
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,820
Err..

421
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,120
Two glasses of warm wine.

422
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,220
Good.

423
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,590
Try to throw that snowball the best you can.

424
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,520
I'm here! I'm here!

425
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,150
This way! This way!

426
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,850
Here!

427
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,100
Here! Here!

428
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm here! I'm here!

429
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,800
Onao!

430
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,460
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sister.

431
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,970
It's alright.

432
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,520
Today was tiring.

433
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,270
I didn't notice.

434
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,090
But I was very happy today.

435
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,240
Playing in snow was really interesting.

436
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,520
Would you want to see where I live?
We're almost there.

437
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,570
Maybe dad will also be there.

438
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,590
Ah...

439
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:06,850
Want to?

440
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,410
If I visit so suddenly,

441
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,450
daddy will be unhappy.

442
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,820
I will be sad if I make daddy unhappy.

443
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,280
Then let's continue.

444
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,800
yeah...

445
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,400
What's happening, Mrs.!

446
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,400
The painting in the back room...

447
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,300
I heard the laments of the dead!

448
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,960
Even after explaining it was just the sound of a Scaly Thrush,

449
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,650
she still refuses to believe us.

450
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,720
The master commissioned that painting about Hell from miss Oei to atone

451
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,320
from his past sins and to be a remainder so that he can attain felicity in the afterlife.

452
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,100
The master is very fond of it.

453
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,820
I also like that painting.

454
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,720
Her next crisis happened in plain daytime.

455
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,500
The white magnolia's season have ended it would seem.

456
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,720
Say, Is she ok in her head?

457
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,230
That Hell painting may be realistic but still...

458
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,460
There's still more!

459
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,720
After that, because she didn't feel well,

460
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,270
she stayed in bed.

461
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,450
The master knew that the painting was the source

462
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,120
but, the painting was too good to part with it.

463
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,620
And then later on...

464
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:33,720
My Dear!

465
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,020
Fortunately it was only a small fire.

466
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,800
His wife's illness is getting more serious.

467
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,920
That's why he asked me to find a solution.

468
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,920
Miss Oei, you created a dangerous painting.

469
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,600
Drawing too well can be a hassle.

470
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,700
I think it rather shows she needs to put more efforts into it.

471
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,860
Hey, show me your draft.

472
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,960
As I was saying...

473
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,400
You always end up before it's complete.

474
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,530
You must always finish your work.

475
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,120
Finish it?

476
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,760
Let's go take a look, Oei.

477
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,900
We can't. We'll disturb them at this hour.

478
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,670
Hey, Manjido.

479
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,370
Next time, it won't just be a small fire.

480
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,470
Put the painting up.

481
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,800
Look.

482
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:55,020
See?

483
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,420
That the way we finish a painting.

484
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,110
Mister, you'll no longer have ghosts haunting your house.

485
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,100
I'm very grateful.

486
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,300
You still have a lot of learning to do.

487
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,570
Master! Master!

488
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,620
Look!

489
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,250
Afterward, that lady was never again disturbed by the painting.

490
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,600
Damn Tetsuzo. It's frustrating but he's always 100 steps ahead of me.

491
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:07,970
I'll repaint it.

492
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,300
Tell me what isn't good.

493
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,600
That's not the problem.

494
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:15,150
It's too solemnly.

495
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,820
Your drawing became too serious, that's a flaw.

496
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,420
Everyone have strengths and weaknesses.

497
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,350
Like Zenjirou.

498
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,570
The drawings he just printed are selling well.

499
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,650
And still, his painting skills are less than yours.

500
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,270
His drawings are almost grotesque.

501
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,200
With great hands but elongated heads.

502
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,900
But this weirdness adds a bit of charm.

503
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,570
It can seize the heart.

504
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,150
You are just the opposite.

505
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,970
Your drawings are well done yet leave us cold.

506
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,620
In the end, I don't really blame you.

507
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:59,200
Why is Mr. Hokusai letting you draw those even though you are still not married.

508
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,830
Mister Hatsugorou.

509
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,230
Where are you going?

510
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,300
I was at Manjudo's.
I was just returning home.

511
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,970
I just left Suhara's place.

512
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,430
I'll take you home.

513
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,020
It's not on your way.

514
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,870
It's ok. I wanted to play a game of go with Master Hokusai.

515
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,520
You're getting all wet.

516
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,530
What's that odor?

517
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,370
Hair oil?

518
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,610
Suhara told me he wanted to meet with Zenjirou.

519
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,140
Zenjirou?

520
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,710
That incompetent.

521
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,270
Maybe, but his painted women are not bad.

522
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,810
There's some feeling.

523
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,690
Eroticism?

524
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:07,940
Yeah.

525
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,140
They are very sensual, yeah.

526
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,650
Me, I find what he draw horrendous!

527
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,920
I forgot I had something to do.

528
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,700
Go ahead.

529
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,150
It's the smell of his skin.

530
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,510
It's completely different than Tetsuzo and Zenjirou.

531
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:48,200
His skin...

532
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:55,900
Welcome.

533
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,620
Does the lady have someone familiar?

534
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,420
No... not really.

535
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:01,850
Right? Right?

536
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,100
You will come back, right?

537
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,700
Alright, alright!

538
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,400
Hey, little flower.

539
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,420
I'm off.

540
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,800
- I'm already waiting.

541
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,570
- Please come again.

542
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,150
Is it your first time?

543
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,570
Then do you want to come and pick someone?

544
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,000
Bleah! You smelly bad old man!

545
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,950
Yo, sister. What's up?

546
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,700
That was stupid of me. Let me go!

547
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,420
If it was foolish then let's have fun!

548
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:37,450
Come!

549
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,450
Let me go, idiot!

550
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,250
Yes yes, I'm an idiot!

551
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,550
Boss, don't give me another guest for the rest of the day.

552
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,550
But... but...

553
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,600
Undress.

554
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,300
What?

555
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,670
You're all wet. It's drenched.

556
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,770
You'll ruin my tatami.

557
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,280
Put this instead.

558
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,820
A Furisode.

559
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,820
(Furisode: a long sleeve kimono)

560
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,730
I'm called Kichiya.
Nice to meet you.

561
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,570
Time to have fun!

562
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,270
Girl...

563
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,730
That's Yamagoshi Amida

564
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,720
It's said it is from Kanō Tan'yū.

565
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,720
(Kanō Tan'yū: Kyoto painter,
4 March 1602 – 4 November 1674)

566
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,230
Idiot.

567
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,670
A master like Tan'yū wouldn't paint such an horrendous thing.

568
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:09,080
It's not good?

569
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,700
It's awful.

570
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:13,880
You know about painting?

571
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,710
Why is this Buddhist painting hanging over here?

572
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,900
Because some monks are a little too frisky.

573
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,400
I thought it would protect me a little.

574
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,220
It was just a wasted effort.

575
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,570
The monks coming over here fears no Gods nor Buddha.

576
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,120
I can see that.

577
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,370
Speaking of which, I had a weird dream some days ago.

578
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:40,550
Just like in that painting.

579
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,820
Buddha suddenly appeared behind the mountain.

580
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:48,470
Everyone bow down exclaiming, "Thank you! Thank you!" to the Buddha apparitions.

581
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,620
They stamped on everything, regardless of the people.

582
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,620
They kept going without looking aside.

583
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,650
Isn't it terrible?

584
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,100
It it really bliss?

585
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,350
We stop or we continue?

586
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,870
Good! Let's have some fun!

587
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,620
Hey!

588
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,020
Sorry.

589
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,230
Let me sleep a little.

590
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,410
Count to a hundred then I get up.

591
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,120
Promised.

592
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,410
I'll properly compensate you.

593
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,020
He's heavy.

594
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,120
Is there real bliss?

595
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,500
And what of Hell?

596
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,470
I leave you at this.

597
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,450
Thanks for the work.

598
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,370
Oh yeah...

599
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,380
Miss Oei, the Danjūrō group is playing this afternoon if you are interested.

600
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,380
(Danjūrō group: Early Edo Kabuki family dynasty that began with Ichikawa Danjūrō)

601
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,540
They perform "Sukeroku".

602
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,200
The store folks wanted to go

603
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,750
but there was suddenly an impediment.

604
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,730
I only have one wooden plaque.

605
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,050
There's no harm into learning something new.

606
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,370
Thank you.

607
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:25,650
I'm leaving.

608
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,000
You may see Hatsugorou over there.

609
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,250
I just gave him another plaque.

610
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,850
Miss Oei!

611
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,920
Is it you, miss Oei?

612
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,350
What's going on?
Is there something bothering you?

613
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,140
It's nothing.

614
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:55,990
Where were you going?

615
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,900
I was returning home.

616
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,420
What a coincidence.

617
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,600
I'm just returning from the printer.

618
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,470
Today is the Day of 46,000 Blessings.

619
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,980
Day of 46,000 Blessings: July 9 and 10 religious festival, held at the Buddhist temple of Sensō-ji (dedicated to the goddess Kannon)

620
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,980
Why don't we go pray to the goddess Kannon?

621
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,000
I don't really like possessive women

622
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,550
that are quick to cry.

623
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,300
I prefer the kind that is stern

624
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,880
And strong willed.

625
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,350
When I first met you, miss Oei

626
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:48,070
I thought to myself
"Oh! This is not someone ordinary".

627
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,350
Therefore I ...

628
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,650
Want to tell you, miss Oei...

629
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,720
Good choice, mister.

630
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,720
What did you pray for?

631
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,320
An easy child birthing.

632
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,470
Just kidding.

633
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,090
You love making jokes, miss Oei.

634
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,320
What time is it?

635
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,220
Earlier it was noon.

636
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,460
Now, it must be around two.

637
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,070
You have something scheduled?

638
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,170
No, no really.

639
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,370
What about eating a bowl of jelly noodle?

640
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,480
Alright!

641
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,400
Two bowl of jelly noodle.

642
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,750
Coming!

643
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,650
Sorry! I have to go!

644
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,100
Miss Oei!

645
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,630
What was that?

646
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,420
That's delicious, mom.

647
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,120
You like it? You can also eat my portion.

648
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,070
Really?

649
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,200
It's mine!

650
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,650
Wait, I want to eat it.

651
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,370
No!

652
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,250
Onao is not feeling well recently.

653
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,470
I went over to see mom.

654
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,710
Onao was bedridden.

655
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,690
She was sent back to recuperate.

656
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,750
They said it wasn't life threatening.

657
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,700
Mom says she will recover soon.

658
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,800
You should go visit mom.

659
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,410
Onao would be glad to see you.

660
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,050
Yeah...

661
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,050
Are you that scared of catching it?

662
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,770
You wander aimlessly all day

663
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,770
but you never have time to see Onao!

664
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,870
Birds, Birds...

665
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,760
Release the birds...

666
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,250
Well-meaning people should release the wild sparrows...

667
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,920
Birds, birds to release...

668
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,770
How many do you have in those cages?

669
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,850
Hm, about thirty.

670
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,250
Take this and release them all.

671
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,700
Thank you for your kindness.

672
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,570
You are more superstitious now.

673
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,670
However, that good deed will not matter.

674
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,000
They clipped their flight feathers.

675
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,950
They'll be caught back again.

676
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,750
Really?

677
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:00,470
There could be some lucky ones that will escape.

678
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,490
Say, do you want to come visit?

679
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,880
Onao would be happy to see you.

680
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,400
I just made some rice cakes.

681
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,820
That's unusual.

682
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,400
Let's eat together.

683
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,420
There's only sweets...

684
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,720
Is she sleeping?

685
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,640
She was sleeping earlier.

686
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,100
Who's there?

687
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,280
How are you feeling, Onao?

688
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,600
It's you, dad?

689
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:52,500
Death is the world's most frightening thing and an abomination.

690
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,350
I will never die.

691
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,470
I will never...

692
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,220
Oei, will you bring this with you

693
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,400
when you go visit your mother?

694
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,500
It's to exorcise the evil spirits.

695
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,970
The man has a big brushy beard.

696
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,610
He's holding a sword.

697
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,880
With his sword, he's cutting away your disease.

698
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:51,590
With his left hand, he's suppressing your pain.

699
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,570
Although he look scary,

700
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,590
he's protecting the children.

701
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,600
Do you think dad hate me?

702
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:00,980
Why?

703
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:04,170
Because dad hates sick people.

704
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,550
Tetsuzo is afraid of sick people because he's a coward.

705
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,130
For you it's different.

706
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,810
That's why he drew this for you.

707
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,250
Your hands are really soft.

708
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,370
Now that you're back home,

709
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,340
You should stop cutting your hair

710
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,900
and let them grow long.

711
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,150
I could help with your hairdo.

712
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,570
Really?

713
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,460
Of course.

714
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Your sister's hair are nice.

715
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,100
They're combed beautifully.

716
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,300
I see, she's talented.

717
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:52,800
I can't wait...

718
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,000
I hope they grow quickly.

719
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,700
Can I sleep here tonight?

720
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,860
That's a good idea, Oei.

721
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:04,970
Let's all slept together.

722
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,970
Say...

723
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,620
Are you asleep yet, sis?

724
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:37,270
Not yet.

725
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,000
There's something up there on the net.

726
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:40,820
What?

727
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,800
I'm certain.

728
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,970
It was a big insect.

729
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,670
It's ok, I put it outside.

730
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:35,540
An insect?

731
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,250
Was it beautiful?

732
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,680
Yes, it was slender and elongated.

733
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,220
A little like a lentil.

734
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,320
Was it gentle?

735
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,760
Yes, very gentle.

736
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,570
Was it cute?

737
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,700
Yes, very cute.

738
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,450
Sis?

739
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,400
Yes?

740
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,750
I'll go to hell when I die.

741
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:23,900
In hell, I will work to build heaps of stones for dad.

742
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,820
Why?

743
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,120
Why not?

744
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,670
It's like that. It can't be changed.

745
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,050
Is there anything that you want to do?

746
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,650
Recently her complexion looks better.

747
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,270
Indeed.

748
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:31,380
Don't worry, it's not a serious illness.
She will be fine in a few days.

749
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:34,200
Say...

750
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:38,300
Next time, bring your dad along.

751
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,030
Tetsuzo's a crybaby.

752
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,880
Don't be silly.

753
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,110
I'm also a crybaby.

754
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,300
The medicine are working, she's much better.

755
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,250
Last night she ate some porridge.

756
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,330
You should go back to see her.

757
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,500
You're really a bad liar.

758
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,990
That's why you still haven't caught a man.

759
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,550
That's really strange...

760
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,390
I felt that there was a little girl behind me.

761
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,900
That girl, what did she look like?

762
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:44,200
She looked a little classic.

763
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,120
Shoulder-length hair.

764
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,760
That's some really strong wind.

765
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,600
You managed to get here, like a grown up.

766
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,720
She's gone.

767
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:26,270
There.

768
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:42,670
Perhaps I'm the one that stole that child's eyes and life.

769
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,720
What?

770
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,810
What?

771
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,090
That's strange.

772
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,620
No, I didn't lie, I swear!

773
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,670
I really have the feeling of being followed.

774
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,620
It's the truth!

775
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,350
Mr incompetent...

776
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:56,300
Someone did follow you...

777
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:57,620
What!?

778
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,270
Sorry, Big bro.

779
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,750
Kuninao! What are you playing at?

780
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:12,750
I've been following for some time

781
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,370
but you never noticed.

782
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,120
Master, miss Oei.

783
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,670
I'm glad to see you in good health.

784
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,770
You too.

785
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,050
So are you, Big bro.

786
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,320
Shut up! shut up!

787
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:32,420
What are you doing here, you bum!?

788
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,720
Why? There's an interesting girl that came from Fukagawa.

789
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,720
She supposedly never get drunk.

790
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:41,690
More than you?

791
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,500
I don't know.

792
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:47,470
That's why I'm going to compete with that girl.

793
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,670
Are there benefits to win?

794
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:50,800
Yes.

795
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,050
If you win, she will let you look at her back tattoo.

796
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,700
Apparently, no one ever seen it yet.

797
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,770
That's boring.

798
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,520
Let's go eat some soba.

799
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:18,720
Good idea! I'm hungry for soba!

800
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,390
Bye. Until next time, miss Oei.

801
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,420
Manjido is about to ask for our work.

802
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,150
If he doesn't get it on time, he'll lose face.

803
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,000
Stop worrying about his honor.

804
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,600
Keep painting, I'm counting on you.

805
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,670
I won't do your work!

806
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,370
Oei, Manjido asked me a few days ago

807
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,370
If it wasn't time for you to start drawing your own paintings.

808
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,070
I'm afraid it will be a long night!

809
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,410
Onao, how is it up there?

810
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:19,520
What I know at least is that you didn't go to hell.

811
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,310
Here, It's still the same.

812
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,020
Life isn't that good

813
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,350
but I still have a great time.

814
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,100
Right?

815
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,370
Tetsuzo never stopped painting until the end

816
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,750
at ninety years old.

817
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:27,900
Zenjirou took the nickname of Eisen Keisai

818
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,600
and became famous with his women's paintings.

819
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:33,200
He died one year before Tetsuzo.

820
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,180
That incompetent.

821
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,620
I was married only once.

822
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,800
But I left and went back to live with Tetsuzo.

823
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,410
I stayed there until his death.

824
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,950
Tetsuzo intended to live to be over a hundred.

825
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,250
He left when he was ninety years old.

826
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:55,120
He told me in his last days that if he had 10 more years...no.

827
01:24:55,770 --> 01:25:00,520
If he even had five years longer, he would have been able to draw even better.

828
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,170
He was serious.

829
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,870
What a strange old man.

830
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,980
After Hokusai's death, Oei
lived a little here and there.

831
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,150
She would have died in the 4th year of the Ansei era  (1857).

832
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,990
9 years after her dad.

833
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:29,820
No one really know where
she actually died .

834
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:37,290
Eleven years after Oei's death ,

835
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:40,710
Edo's Tokugawa Shogunate
ceased to exist,

836
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:46,220
Calling for the end
of the last feudal military government.

837
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:52,180
The new Meiji government (1868–1912)
changed the name of Edo for Tokyo.
