1
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,460
Hey, folks,

2
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,505
I know the Mets are down
3-0 in a best of seven.

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,007
I know no World Series team...

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,926
has ever come back
from 3-0 down to win four straight.

5
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,471
I know they haven't played well.
I know the pitching's been bad.

6
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:24,144
I know "no clutch hitting,"
I know '86/'69 seem a long, long time ago.

7
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:25,789
And there's no Ruth, there's no Gehrig.

8
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:28,148
Goodness gracious,
there's no Donn Clendenon.

9
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:31,026
But you are not out of it...

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,487
until you lose four games
in a best of seven.

11
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,782
That is all there is to it.

12
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,036
Back to the phones we go.
Bruce is in Bayside.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,912
- Bruce, how are you?
- How you doing, Chris?

14
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,622
Good to have you aboard, bud. What's up?

15
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,708
Listen, I'm writing off this season.

16
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,168
As far as I'm concerned,
the Mets are out of it.

17
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,045
They're down 3-0.
They might as well pack their bags.

18
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,630
- Write it off?
- Wait a second, my concern is next year.

19
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,133
- What do you mean, write it off?
- You look at great teams of the past,

20
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:57,469
the A's in '88, the
Phillies back in the '50s,

21
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,554
the Indians in '54 won
over a hundred games.

22
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:02,474
The following years, these teams wouldn't
have been anything, they were no good.

23
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,350
- All right.
- The Mets, they'll be out of it this year.

24
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:05,935
- Question!
- They need to worry about next year.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,520
Did the Indians in '54 say,

26
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,856
after they lost the third
game to the Giants,

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,526
"You know, let's not show up for Game 4.
We've lost. Let's rebuild for next year"?

28
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,361
They might as well have.
They might as well have.

29
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:20,408
Hey, the A's won in '89,
and it's not easy to win every single year.

30
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:23,244
This is a team that has proven
they cannot win in the clutch.

31
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:24,729
It's so obvious. Every year they...

32
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,664
They won in '86, didn't they?

33
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,292
They won in '86 because a guy couldn't
field a ground ball.

34
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:30,418
If I was on first base...

35
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,712
How about the playoffs
and the World Series, Bruce?

36
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:35,715
The Mets would've lost the World Series
if I was playing first base.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,802
That is incorrect
because the game was tied...

38
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,735
Let's go! Let's go!

39
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:07,288
How many times you be late for school?
Your sister gets to school on time.

40
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,167
What's the problem with you guys?

41
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,206
You want to be driven around
like you're the President,

42
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,423
like I'm your goddamn chauffeur.

43
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,259
- Dad, it wasn't our fault.
- Dad, it wasn't our fault.

44
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:23,263
- Oh, yeah? Whose fault was it? Mine?
- No.

45
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:26,850
Aunt Wendy told us
to take out the garbage,

46
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,602
- and she hogged up the bathroom.
- Hogged up the bathroom.

47
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:30,770
All morning.

48
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,606
We couldn't get in there
to brush our teeth or do anything.

49
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,569
We had to wait till she got out.
By the time we got out, the bus was gone.

50
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,529
So how are we supposed to be on time?

51
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,781
This is the only way we're gonna get there.

52
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,826
Hey, listen to me.
I'm the boss, not Aunt Wendy.

53
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,744
When it's your turn to use the bathroom,

54
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,790
you tell Aunt Wendy
to get the fuck out of the bathroom.

55
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,959
What are you, men or mice?

56
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,295
"She's hogging the bathroom."

57
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,005
Call me. I'll throw her the fuck out.

58
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,673
Every facet of the game.

59
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,466
They're being outpitched,
they're being outslugged,

60
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,751
and they're being out-fielded.

61
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,304
They're also being out-efforted,
if there's such a word.

62
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,306
They're going to lose 4-0.

63
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,807
No, they're not. They're gonna win.

64
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,517
- Strawberry's fucking killing them.
- They're going to lose!

65
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:10,810
- Gonna win!
- They're going to lose!

66
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:12,478
Knock it off.

67
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:16,482
David Cone will be the starter at Game 4,
and that has a lot of fans, myself...

68
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,984
Strawberry's killing them.

69
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,611
Not only will Cone be setting the pace...

70
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:22,030
Go Coney! Yeah! All right!

71
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,365
- Knock it off, will you?
- Come on.

72
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,367
Give me a goddamn headache.

73
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:30,622
I know all five of those runs were unearned.
I still don't think that's...

74
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:31,956
Bye, Dad.

75
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,626
- Bye, Dad.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,378
- Bye, Dad.
- See you.

77
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,879
The next two games
in this series are at Shea.

78
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:20,964
If they can win them...

79
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,209
that at least puts a doubt
in the minds of the Dodgers,

80
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,509
and that's what the Mets need.

81
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,512
They need to prove
that the Dodgers are not invincible.

82
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,055
It would also restore their confidence,

83
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,348
and the Mets are a dangerous team...

84
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,433
when they get on a roll
and start believing in themselves.

85
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:34,269
Jeff Torborg called a closed-door...

86
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,561
Get some shots.

87
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,982
I want some shots over here,
from this window here.

88
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,402
Mikey, come here.

89
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,822
I think we got some prints over here
on the inside of this door.

90
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:50,243
Right on the inside here. Try and get them.

91
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,289
How you doing?

92
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:58,584
I got two young girls,
shot in the head twice each.

93
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,586
It's kind of messy. Over here, Mikey.

94
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:02,588
Get some pictures
from the other side there, please.

95
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:06,009
I don't know if they're still wearing
the rounds in their head or what.

96
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,845
Hey, Mikey, get this back door over there.

97
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:12,515
There's something on the inside.
Around... On that door. Thank you.

98
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,319
- Anybody see anybody?
- Yeah, a dookie.

99
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,362
We got this one Chinese guy over here...

100
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,781
who saw a couple guys
running over these park benches...

101
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,158
towards Park Avenue.

102
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:33,119
We got a pretty good description
on the two guys.

103
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,372
The uniformed guy put it on the air.
We'll see what happens.

104
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,666
Michael, on the inside of that door.

105
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,712
And let me have some shots
on the eye-level.

106
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:45,340
Mets my ass. Dodgers are smoking?

107
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,265
Yeah, they're smoking.
But what about tomorrow?

108
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,803
What are you thinking? You like the Mets?

109
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:54,599
- What do you think of that shit back there?
- Terrible.

110
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:56,184
You guys got money coming.
What are you gonna do?

111
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,352
Dodgers all the way.

112
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,895
I'd save your money.

113
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,271
With Cone pitching?

114
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:02,436
That Conehead motherfucker
got rocked the first game.

115
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,816
I wouldn't bury the Mets.

116
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,101
Even money with Cone pitching?

117
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:06,819
That's right.

118
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,781
You don't think they're
going to beat him twice, do you?

119
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,996
You're right.
Not only that, they're due, man.

120
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,623
Put my three on the Mets. Even money.

121
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,291
Listen,

122
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:23,461
take the five. Put it on the Mets.

123
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,880
You say that like it's
a fucking death sentence.

124
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,632
It's a smart bet.

125
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:30,802
I think it is a fucking death sentence.

126
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:32,637
Strawberry burns.

127
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,430
Nah, man. He can't win the four in a row.

128
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,682
- No? All right.
- Three. That's it, max.

129
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,101
- Max.
- What about Strawberry?

130
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:50,029
Yeah. Give me a cup of coffee.

131
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,782
Don't put on the cover.

132
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:33,489
- Hello.
- Mike, how are you?

133
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,935
What's up, guy? How are you doing?

134
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,492
Here's what we're going to do.

135
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,244
We took in 10,000 in action.

136
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,289
We got six on the Mets,
four on the Dodgers.

137
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:45,334
Plus, I want another 15,000
of my own on LA.

138
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,336
Fifteen? But that's what you're up.

139
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,921
Why don't you just go ahead?

140
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:51,257
Hey, don't give me that bullshit.

141
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,758
The Dodgers are a lock.

142
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,385
Are you sure?

143
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,096
Just put in the bet.
I'm going to make some money.

144
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:58,806
You got it, guy.

145
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,225
Give me something to cook.

146
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,684
What's up, man?

147
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:46,729
Here you go.

148
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,274
Thanks.

149
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,655
It's good shit.

150
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,657
You can cut it in half.

151
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:11,087
Shit's going to kill you, man.

152
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:15,258
What the fuck are you,
a drug counselor or a drug dealer?

153
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,467
Never do your own product.

154
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:18,886
What kind of fucking businessman are you?

155
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,376
Get back. Police activity.

156
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,386
Give me something back for the road.

157
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:30,249
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I'll have the money.

158
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,976
- He's the thief!
- Relax.

159
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,146
- Which one of you guys got the money?
- We ain't got no money.

160
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,315
Empty your pockets out, the two of you.

161
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,108
- What is this, man?
- Empty your pockets. Let me see 'em.

162
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,486
If we wasn't black,
you wouldn't be doing this shit.

163
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:06,489
- It's him. It's him.
- Shut the hell up, man.

164
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,616
- Cops, arrest him.
- What's going on?

165
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,494
Lieutenant, sir, the owner says
they stole cash from the register.

166
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,996
- The owner's full of shit...
- Shut the fuck up!

167
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:18,083
He was chasing them down the block
when I caught up with them.

168
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,710
Get me a Bud, a High Boy.

169
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,915
Make sure it's fucking cold.
I'll straighten this out.

170
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,319
- This is bullshit, man.
- That's him.

171
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,676
- It's him. Arrest him. Arrest him.
- How much did they take?

172
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,262
- How much did they take?
- $500.

173
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:32,681
- You're out of your mind, man.
- Shut your...

174
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,308
What the fuck?

175
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:39,522
Take this guy down to the precinct
and make out a report.

176
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,818
- You'll have to come with me, sir.
- No.

177
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:45,486
- Relax. Just relax.
- No, I don't want to go.

178
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,155
- It's gonna be okay. Just relax.
- No.

179
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,411
Give me the fucking money now.

180
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:10,636
Get the fuck out of here.

181
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,511
Your daddy will be right back.

182
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,440
The door sticks. Just a second.

183
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,823
You're just on time.

184
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,787
Got some very, very fine
brown shit for you.

185
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:20,956
Yeah?

186
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,626
Same you loved last time you were here.

187
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,962
No, nobody there. Nobody there.

188
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:34,511
Here. Where's your pipe?

189
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:53,739
You ready?

190
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,164
Here.

191
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,500
This one is yours.

192
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:10,673
Let's see. Where did I put the lighter?

193
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,841
Here's the lighter.

194
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,804
You got a lighter.

195
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,557
I'll light my cigarette.

196
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,018
It's lit.
Oh, my God.

197
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,204
I'll get you a little bit more here.

198
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,257
Give me a little more.

199
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,842
There you go.

200
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:03,559
It's a big pile.

201
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:40,674
Please leave your message after the beep.

202
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,764
Hi. It's David. Talk to you later.

203
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,350
Hello?

204
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,354
I already received it.

205
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,859
Hello? Hello?

206
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,321
Hello?

207
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:08,285
So with Brett Butler on third
and Kal Daniels on first,

208
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:11,413
Strawberry stands in
against David Cone.

209
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,624
Cone leaning in for the sign.

210
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,125
He goes to the stretch.

211
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,418
The pitch on the way,

212
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:20,339
and it's a long high blast
to right center field.

213
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:24,343
Over the fence and off the scoreboard
at Shea Stadium.

214
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:27,429
Darryl Strawberry trots it out
around the bases,

215
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:31,725
and he hits one of those moon shots
that have trademarked his career.

216
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,895
Quite a clout, but maybe
too little too late.

217
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:38,815
A Mets 11-0 lead is now 11-3.

218
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,026
A three-run homer for Strawberry.

219
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,323
His third home run of the series,
and RBIs 10, 11, and 12.

220
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:48,116
It's 11-3, Mets.

221
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,953
No matter how far
Strawberry hits a ball,

222
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:55,123
he cannot drive in enough runs
to get the Dodgers back in this game.

223
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,500
Strawberry with the moon shot...

224
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:59,878
getting congratulations
in the Dodger dugout.

225
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,089
That brings Eric Davis to the plate,

226
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,716
and right now all the Dodgers
want to try and do...

227
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,093
is close the Mets out,

228
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,720
gain some momentum back
going into Game 5.

229
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:11,974
If they can make a little noise here,
get some offense going...

230
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,271
Give her a piece of cake. Mom, you okay?
Have a little bit of cake.

231
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:20,357
Hey, Strawberry, want a cup of coffee?

232
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,609
Cone into the windup.
Here's the first pitch.

233
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:25,404
Why don't you come here
and have a cup of coffee with us.

234
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:28,282
Davis again stepping out.
Looks for the sign.

235
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,867
Steps back in.

236
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,706
You know, let's face it, folks,
I know they got a ways to go yet.

237
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,582
I know they have a ways to go.

238
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:41,712
But the Dodgers blew a match point.

239
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:45,632
- Possible man shot, 153...
- I'll tell you something right now.

240
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:49,511
The first one to get is always the hardest
to get when you're down by a large...

241
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:53,056
Confirmed, man shot. 153 Jane Street.

242
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,614
Hey, Veronica, baby, what's going on?

243
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:12,451
There's a ki somewhere in the back seat.

244
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:17,664
Hey. How you doing?

245
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,417
What we got here is
a black male with his throat cut.

246
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,021
- Somebody look at him?
- Yeah, probably.

247
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,545
- Anybody check the car?
- Not yet.

248
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:26,131
- I'll check the car.
- All right. Good.

249
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:27,716
Hey, Sarge.

250
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,176
How are you doing, boss? What do we got?

251
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,303
I've got a black male with his throat slit.

252
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:34,222
- It looks like he's going to...
- Any weapons?

253
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:36,767
Lieutenant's checking the seat now.

254
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,643
How about any witnesses?

255
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:42,397
First three uniform guys on the scene
got two, possible relatives.

256
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:45,233
Let me see what the Lieutenant
wants us to do here.

257
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,533
- What's that?
- Looks like a ki of coke.

258
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,286
Put it in evidence.

259
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:09,216
Hey, I want you two guys
to go contact your junkie friends...

260
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,676
over there on 25th Street till we get up.

261
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,179
You two guys go over
to them two pawnshops,

262
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,555
see what else we can get from that.

263
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,015
What's going on?

264
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,518
They raped a nun up in Spanish Harlem.

265
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:22,604
Imagine having that happen to you.
I would've killed these motherfuckers.

266
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,732
They took the fucking chalice.
The host was still in there.

267
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:26,858
What they want with the host?

268
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:29,236
What the fuck you think?
What, you think they wanna eat the host?

269
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,780
They wanted to pawn
the fucking chalice off.

270
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,407
Put up a $50,000 reward.

271
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:36,118
Leave it to the Catholic Church.

272
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,036
Girls get raped every day.

273
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:39,371
Now they're gonna put up 50 Gs...

274
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,915
just because these chicks
wear penguin suits.

275
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:43,458
What is your fucking problem?

276
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,212
The Church is a racket.

277
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:49,131
So what? Are you a Catholic?

278
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:50,799
I'm a Catholic.

279
00:23:57,223 --> 00:24:00,475
Why don't you have a little bit
of fucking respect?

280
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:02,894
Hey, fuck that noise.

281
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:05,230
How about them Mets?
Bet you won a shitload.

282
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:06,481
More than you did.

283
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,983
I want to get paid.

284
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:10,360
What about tomorrow?

285
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,237
What do you guys want to do?

286
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:15,157
Want to make a bundle?
Leave it all on the Mets.

287
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:18,076
What, you think they're
going to beat Martinez?

288
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:21,288
The series has got to last seven games.

289
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:24,207
You know how much money is riding
on commercial time alone?

290
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,126
A New York/LA team?

291
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:31,089
When's the last time a series in New York
did not last seven games?

292
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:35,135
You know the revenue alone
in TV commercials?

293
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,512
Endorsements for the players?

294
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:39,598
The income it's bringing into the city
for transportation?

295
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:42,851
There are no fucking jobs
in New York, are there?

296
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:45,437
There's no way the series
is gonna end tomorrow.

297
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:47,881
There's too many people want to milk it
for what it's worth.

298
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,150
Did I steer you wrong yesterday?

299
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:55,697
You want to make a smart move?
Leave it on the Mets.

300
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,241
What do you want to do?

301
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:03,038
I'm in.

302
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,293
Are you a doubter? I'll
tell you what, then.

303
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:10,337
Don't listen to the way
I steered you yesterday.

304
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,630
All right?

305
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:13,924
So you owe me money.

306
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:15,383
What do you want to do?

307
00:25:56,676 --> 00:26:01,179
Dr. Sherman, 247. Dr. Sherman, 247.

308
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:04,349
Can I help you with something?

309
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:07,519
I'm in charge of the investigation.

310
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:11,231
Just checking security.

311
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:13,567
Security?

312
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:16,778
Wouldn't want the guys
coming back, would you?

313
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:18,446
For the nun,

314
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,948
or for you.

315
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,715
Here are the soiled undergarments
and the nun's habit.

316
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,509
They're to be taken by you for evidence.

317
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:44,306
Now, black pubic hair
other than the patient...

318
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,017
was found during comb inspection.

319
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,144
Here are the samples of that.

320
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:53,106
There was trauma to the vaginal mucosa...

321
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,567
with multiple lacerations...

322
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,236
that appear to be made with a sharp object,

323
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,989
in which the hymen
membrane was broken.

324
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:06,411
It was stated that this
object was a crucifix.

325
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,790
Trauma consistent
with multiple penetration.

326
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:13,877
Three-centimeter laceration.

327
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,587
Let the Mets be uplifted.

328
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:18,048
Let the Mets have a nice dinner at home.

329
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,342
Let the Mets look
at the post-game highlights...

330
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:23,053
and see base hits all over the place.

331
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:26,556
One bullet has been dodged!

332
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:31,102
Just a couple more to go,
and I'll tell you something right now.

333
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:35,607
The longer this series goes,
the longer this series goes,

334
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:40,362
the Dodgers will get awfully tight,
and if it somehow gets to a Game 7...

335
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,879
You girls know you're driving
with a taillight out?

336
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,882
- Really?
- Yeah.

337
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:03,009
No, we didn't know.

338
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:04,344
But thank you for telling us.

339
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:07,263
Let me see your license and registration.

340
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:17,357
- Where's your license?
- Actually, I don't have my license with me.

341
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,526
- You don't?
- No.

342
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:23,655
- Do you have a driver's license?
- No.

343
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:26,491
You don't have it with you?

344
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,035
Whose car is this?

345
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,162
Listen, this is our father's car.

346
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:33,581
We don't have a license.

347
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34,999
Yeah?

348
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:39,003
Does he know you got it?

349
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,256
Yeah.

350
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,632
He does?

351
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,970
Does he know you got the car?

352
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,763
Well, not exactly.

353
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:52,148
- You being bad girls?
- But it is our dad's...

354
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,018
You being bad girls?

355
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:57,397
Where are you coming from?

356
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:00,692
New Jersey.

357
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:01,943
Yeah?

358
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:04,571
Got any drugs in the car?

359
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,156
- No.
- No.

360
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,533
- No drugs?
- No.

361
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,535
- Of course not.
- Where were you tonight?

362
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:13,538
We were at the Kat Club.

363
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,540
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:18,460
Yeah. We were at the Kat Club. Big deal.

365
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,588
I should take you in for driving
without a license and registration.

366
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,883
You know that, don't you?
That's a serious thing.

367
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,803
Have to call your father up.

368
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:31,890
How do you feel about that?

369
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,975
Don't do that.

370
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,518
Yeah?

371
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:39,731
What were you girls doing at the,
what was it, the Kit Kat Club?

372
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:44,068
Get a little stoned there?
Come on. I'm not going to...

373
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:46,029
I'll do the right thing
if you do the right thing.

374
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:47,739
I know what it's like
to get stoned a little bit,

375
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,866
to get high a little bit.

376
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:54,078
You're getting stoned there?
Have any grass there? Coke?

377
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:56,790
- We smoked a little grass.
- Yeah?

378
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:00,794
How would your father feel
if he knew you were here now?

379
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:02,670
You won't tell him.

380
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:06,341
Well, that depends.
What do you think about that?

381
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,594
A couple of very beautiful girls,
you know that?

382
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:12,138
Come on. Give us a break.

383
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:20,438
Couldn't you just give us a warning
for the taillight and let us go home?

384
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:25,568
Well, you know something?
Two such beautiful girls like you,

385
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:27,779
I could give you a warning.

386
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:30,365
You want a warning?

387
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,952
Well, here's the warning.

388
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,412
You do something for me,
and I'll do something for you.

389
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:38,623
What do you say about that?

390
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,543
You do something for me,
and your father won't find out...

391
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:44,879
you took his car
and you're driving without a license.

392
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:50,385
You got a boyfriend?

393
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,763
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.

394
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:55,515
You don't?

395
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:59,394
I'll tell you something right now.
Now listen up to me, okay?

396
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:02,313
I'm going to take you down to
the precinct house and call your father.

397
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,815
You hear me?

398
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:07,151
- You hear me?
- You can't do that.

399
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,654
What will you do for me if I don't do that?

400
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,614
Whatever you say.

401
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:14,075
- Yeah?
- You can't call our father.

402
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,504
You ever suck a guy's cock?

403
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,591
Did you?

404
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,552
Look at me. You...

405
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:35,096
You ever suck a guy's cock?

406
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:40,226
I'm talking to you.
You ever suck a guy's cock?

407
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,728
Are you serious?

408
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,772
Did you? Did you?

409
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,150
- Well, yeah. So?
- Yeah?

410
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:50,528
Don't talk back. Don't talk to me that way.
You hear me?

411
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,488
Don't you talk to me that way.

412
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:54,407
I'm going to haul your ass right in.
You hear me?

413
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:55,825
I'm sorry.

414
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,750
Just let us go.

415
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:07,295
- We'll get it fixed in the morning.
- I'll let you go. I'll let you go.

416
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:09,756
Turn around. I want to see your ass.
Do you mind that?

417
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,841
Just one look at
your ass, okay?

418
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:13,259
What do you say?

419
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,768
You, come here. Look at me. Look at me.

420
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:24,354
You ever suck a guy's cock?

421
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,567
You ever suck a guy... Look at me.

422
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:31,819
You ever suck a guy's cock?

423
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:37,784
Let me see how you do it.

424
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:44,165
Show me your mouth
when you suck a guy's cock.

425
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,000
Come on.

426
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:49,545
Show me your mouth.
Show me your mouth.

427
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,751
What's the big fucking deal?

428
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,007
You've sucked guys' cocks before,
haven't you?

429
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,634
Come on.

430
00:32:57,346 --> 00:33:01,140
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
You hear me?

431
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,893
Show me how you suck a...
Just turn around.

432
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:06,562
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
I'm fucking serious.

433
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:08,481
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

434
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:12,777
It's the last time I'm going to ask you
or I'm taking you in, you hear me?

435
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:15,071
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

436
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:18,700
Show me with your mouth.
Show me with your mouth.

437
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:20,504
Come on. Spit that gum out.
Give me the gum.

438
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,161
Give me the fucking gum.

439
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,706
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

440
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:28,751
Come on. Show me. Show me.

441
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:32,380
Show me. Open your mouth.

442
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:37,218
Open your mouth and show me.
Show me. Open your mouth.

443
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:40,430
Open your mouth. That's it.
Show me, like that. Like that.

444
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:43,307
Come on, you little fuck.
Come on, you little fuck.

445
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:44,767
Show me. That's it.

446
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,252
You close your eyes
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.

447
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,980
Come on. That's it. You suck it.

448
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:52,108
You suck it up. You suck it the fuck up.

449
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,485
You suck it up. You like sucking cock?

450
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,406
Come on, baby, show me your mouth.
Show me that fucking mouth.

451
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,159
Show it to me. Yeah, that's it. That's it.

452
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:02,618
That's it.

453
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:04,621
Yeah.

454
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,586
You like sucking dick?

455
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,466
You like sucking dick, you little fuck?

456
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:21,387
You like sucking a fucking dick?

457
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:23,681
Come on. Open your mouth.

458
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:27,143
Open your mouth
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.

459
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:29,979
In your mouth,
you little fucking cocksucker.

460
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:34,442
You little fucking cocksucker,
take it in your fucking mouth.

461
00:34:34,526 --> 00:34:35,777
Come on.

462
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:44,285
Open up and take that fucking scum.

463
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,120
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

464
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,026
It's okay. He's gone.

465
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,746
Let's go.

466
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,136
Go gently with her.

467
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,652
Sister, I can't imagine
how you feel right now,

468
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:12,863
but it's very important
that we learn...

469
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,908
as much about what happened as possible...

470
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:19,620
so we can get this information out
over the police radio.

471
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:23,874
What can you tell me
about what happened?

472
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,629
Can you tell me
how many of them there were?

473
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,466
Can you tell me what color they were?

474
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:35,970
Were they black? Were they white?
Were they Hispanic?

475
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,765
Can you tell me how old they were?

476
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:45,729
Was one older than the other?

477
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:51,360
There were two of them.

478
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,737
Two young men.

479
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:58,242
What can you tell me
about the older of the two?

480
00:41:01,163 --> 00:41:04,290
Were there any distinguishing marks
or tattoos?

481
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,958
An earring?

482
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:10,421
Did he have a beard or a mustache?

483
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:17,178
Can you tell me how they were dressed?

484
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:20,848
Sister, I know this is difficult,

485
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:24,435
but I can't emphasize how important it is.

486
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:30,900
The sooner we can get this information
out over the...

487
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:33,486
Here it is, ball two from Franco,

488
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,696
and John Franco is struggling.

489
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,406
He walked Carlos Hernandez.

490
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,742
He got behind on Scioscia, who singled.

491
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:43,412
He got behind on Butler, who lined out.
It's now 2 and 0.

492
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:46,081
- Daniels in a game situation here.
- Come on, Daniels.

493
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,585
If he can work his way aboard,
then the load falls once again...

494
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:52,796
to Darryl Strawberry,
as he has a chance to play hero...

495
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,509
once again for the Dodgers,
but it's up to Daniels at this point.

496
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:58,113
- From the stretch...
- Come on, Daniels.

497
00:41:58,178 --> 00:41:59,261
Ball three!

498
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:02,223
Good eyes, good eyes.
Take it. Take your next one.

499
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:04,266
A 3-0 count now.

500
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:09,522
Daniels with Strawberry on deck.
Strawberry already with three hits tonight.

501
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:12,942
Two to nothing ballgame, ninth inning,
and there's a strike.

502
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:14,735
Three and one the count, as Daniels...

503
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:17,071
All right, all right.
Good move. Take the pitch.

504
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,906
- Eyes, eyes.
- Three and one.

505
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,791
Come on, Daniels. Eyes.
Use your fucking eyes.

506
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:22,034
Two on, one out.

507
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:23,494
Here's the 3-1 pitch.

508
00:42:23,578 --> 00:42:25,371
Ground ball to short. Could be two.

509
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,248
Flipped to second for one, relay to first.

510
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,625
- It's a double play!
- You cocksucker!

511
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:32,378
You fucking miserable fucking cocksucker!

512
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:49,311
Piece of fucking shit!

513
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:53,023
You fucking nigger! Fucking cocksucker!

514
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,162
You fucking piece of shit!

515
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:23,630
- The body of Christ.
- Body of Christ.

516
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:29,560
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

517
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:32,605
The body of Christ.

518
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:36,483
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

519
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:44,533
The body of Christ.

520
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:46,619
Congratulations, asshole.

521
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:50,873
Now you owe him 30,000.
Now what are you going to do?

522
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:52,958
I'm gonna go double or nothing
on the next game.

523
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:54,501
Double or nothing?

524
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:57,254
Come on, what are you,
out of your mind or what?

525
00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:00,174
There's no way I'm gonna let
that bastard take my money.

526
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:01,842
Take your money?
Really?

527
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:06,347
This guy's going to blow your house up
with you and everybody else in it.

528
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:08,223
There's no way LA's
going to lose this game.

529
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:12,061
They're playing at home.
Strawberry's ready to break out.

530
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,064
Fuck Strawberry.

531
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:17,483
You're gonna wind up
owing this maniac 60,000.

532
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,194
It's my business. Just place the bet.

533
00:44:21,154 --> 00:44:23,697
- Body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

534
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:32,866
The body of Christ.

535
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:40,881
- The body of Christ.
- Body of Christ.

536
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,480
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

537
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:45,594
Those boys...

538
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,056
Those sad, raging boys.

539
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,186
They came to me as the needy do,

540
00:44:55,105 --> 00:44:57,981
and like many of the needy, they were rude.

541
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:01,360
Like all the needy, they took.

542
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,030
And like all the needy, they needed.

543
00:45:07,826 --> 00:45:10,285
Father, I knew them.

544
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,166
They learn in our school,
and they play in our schoolyard,

545
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:18,168
and they are good boys.

546
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:20,129
You knew them?

547
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:23,841
Who are they, Sister?

548
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,802
Who are the boys?

549
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:30,931
What are their names, the names of these...

550
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:34,560
good boys you knew?

551
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,355
I could tell you their names now,

552
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,191
and I know you are bound
by a sacred vow...

553
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,777
to keep my secret,

554
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:46,238
but I cannot tell you their names,

555
00:45:47,115 --> 00:45:48,949
for I, too, am bound.

556
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:53,370
Jesus turned water to wine.

557
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:58,709
I ought to have turned bitter semen
into fertile sperm,

558
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:01,211
hatred to love,

559
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:05,799
and maybe to have saved their souls.

560
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:10,971
They did not love me,
but I ought to have loved them.

561
00:46:11,973 --> 00:46:14,641
For Jesus loved those who reviled him,

562
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:19,146
and never again shall
I encounter two boys...

563
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,565
whose prayer was
more poignant,

564
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:25,778
more legible,
more anguished.

565
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:28,817
Sid Fernandez and Darryl Strawberry,
a battle of wits and talent here...

566
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,945
in the bottom of the
ninth in Los Angeles.

567
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,824
Strawberry readies himself.

568
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:38,702
Fernandez checks for the sign.

569
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,663
The pitch on the way.
Swinging. Strike one.

570
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,291
One and one on Strawberry,

571
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:48,503
as Fernandez came in with that fast ball,
and Darryl could not connect.

572
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:50,130
One and one the count.

573
00:48:50,256 --> 00:48:51,840
Two outs. Bottom of the ninth.

574
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,885
For Los Angeles, men on second and third.

575
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,596
The Dodgers find themselves down by three...

576
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,641
and in need
of one of those Darryl moon shots.

577
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,769
The 1-1 pitch from Fernandez.

578
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:07,314
Swinging. Foul ball.
Off to the third base side.

579
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:13,070
One and two the count to Strawberry now
as he once again walks around,

580
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:17,366
thinks about what he might see
on this next pitch from Sid Fernandez.

581
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,869
One and two to Strawberry.

582
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:28,335
New York Mets trying to do something
that no other team has ever done,

583
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:32,756
come back from a three-nothing deficit
in a best of seven series.

584
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,635
Strawberry is ready. So is Fernandez.
Ease to the belt.

585
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,054
The 1-2 pitch to Strawberry.

586
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:41,974
On the way.

587
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:45,185
High and outside, it's now 2-2.

588
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:48,981
So the string runs a little bit longer.

589
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:54,027
The tension builds here in Los Angeles
as Strawberry and Fernandez battle.

590
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:55,862
Dodgers trying to eliminate the Mets.

591
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,951
The Mets trying hard to send this series
to a seventh and final game.

592
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:03,996
Fernandez wants to change baseballs now.

593
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:07,874
He gets another one back
from the home plate umpire.

594
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:10,877
It's now a 2-2 count in a game situation.

595
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:13,839
Once again, no team has ever come back...

596
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:16,967
from a 3-0 deficit
to come back and win a series.

597
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:19,428
That's what the Mets are trying
to accomplish here.

598
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:22,681
Strawberry, with that big year this year
for the Dodgers,

599
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:25,976
trying to continue his hot hitting
in this playoff.

600
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,230
So it's lefty against lefty,
old teammate against old teammate.

601
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:32,607
Strawberry steps in.

602
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:35,068
Fernandez to the stretch.

603
00:50:35,611 --> 00:50:36,945
The pitch.

604
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:39,823
He goes around... Did he go around?

605
00:50:40,074 --> 00:50:41,158
The appeal at third. Yes!

606
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:45,328
Darryl Strawberry,
on the check-swing, goes too far.

607
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:46,913
He strikes out.

608
00:50:46,998 --> 00:50:50,709
This game is over,
as Strawberry goes down looking,

609
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:54,629
and the Dodgers are looking at a Mets team
that has tied the series at three.

610
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:57,132
What drama on a 3-2 pitch.

611
00:50:57,216 --> 00:50:58,376
And a third base umpire said,

612
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:01,219
"Yes, sir, he did go around."

613
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:05,599
And the expression
on Darryl Strawberry's face says it all.

614
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:07,684
We're tied at three games apiece,

615
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:10,729
and the Mets win 8-5.

616
00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:14,149
This sets the scene
for one heck of a seventh game.

617
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:17,194
Pitching-wise,
it's a match made in a fan's dream.

618
00:51:17,278 --> 00:51:21,406
Imagine, one game, and it's Dwight Gooden
against Orel Hershiser.

619
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:24,159
Neither pitcher is as powerful
as he once was.

620
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:26,912
Some of their magic removed
by a surgeon's knife.

621
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:30,707
But they are still pressure pitchers
who know how to get it done,

622
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,834
possibly two future Hall of Famers.

623
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:35,837
And Game 7 certainly looks like a game...

624
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,925
I can't help you.

625
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:47,974
Hey. About time.
He finally shows up. Jesus Christ.

626
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:56,149
Hey. Yo, Lieu!

627
00:51:57,318 --> 00:51:58,652
Come here.

628
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:04,866
Hey, how you doing?
I never fucking thought you'd be here.

629
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:07,244
- How's it going?
- Fucking great.

630
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:11,248
The world is yours.

631
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,169
Hey, Tommy, can I have some drink tickets?

632
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,652
It's not like the old days.

633
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:53,373
Hello, fellas.

634
00:52:57,378 --> 00:52:59,171
Yeah, Papa.

635
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,150
Move it!

636
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,830
Help yourself out, okay?

637
00:53:40,296 --> 00:53:42,214
If you're doing a hit, do a monster.

638
00:53:42,298 --> 00:53:44,424
- Come on. Here. Do a line.
- Hey.

639
00:53:44,508 --> 00:53:46,843
Come on. Did you have...
How many drinks did you have?

640
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:48,053
Good.

641
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:11,159
Hey, you got the money?

642
00:54:13,537 --> 00:54:14,913
What money?

643
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:18,500
Stop fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

644
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:21,461
- Got it with you?
- I don't got it. Not tonight.

645
00:54:23,506 --> 00:54:24,827
You can't get blood from a stone.

646
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:27,842
Quit fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

647
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:31,388
Come on. This ain't no
fucking joke anymore, seriously.

648
00:54:33,057 --> 00:54:35,684
Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

649
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:38,895
- You're a fucking joke. You know that?
- Sweetheart.

650
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:40,855
You make me laugh.

651
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,442
- Can I get a vodka on the rocks?
- He's been waiting since the game ended.

652
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:47,612
You got me waiting here three hours
like a fucking moron.

653
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:51,074
What is this,
a fucking big game or something with you?

654
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:55,537
I'm going to win.

655
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,666
You just make sure the fucking bet's in.

656
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,209
You know, I told you once before...

657
00:55:01,294 --> 00:55:03,753
that this guy will come by your house
and blow your house up...

658
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:05,598
with your wife and kids
and everybody in it.

659
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,299
- You know that, right?
- Good. Good.

660
00:55:07,383 --> 00:55:10,218
I'll give him an extra 10 grand
for his trouble.

661
00:55:10,303 --> 00:55:11,803
- I hate that fucking house.
- Yeah?

662
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:14,407
What do you think, maybe because
you're a cop he won't kill you?

663
00:55:14,432 --> 00:55:16,016
You're this close already to death.

664
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:19,644
Hey, I've been dodging fucking bullets
since I was 14.

665
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:21,479
No one can kill me.

666
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,273
I'm blessed.

667
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,151
I'm a fucking Catholic.

668
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:30,530
How's the case going?

669
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,745
- What case?
- What case?

670
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:38,872
The case with the $50,000 reward.

671
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,123
Remember?

672
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:43,877
Yeah. We're on it big time. Lots of leads.

673
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:49,341
You can use that 50
to get yourself out of this hole.

674
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,386
The Dodgers are going to win the series.

675
00:55:53,471 --> 00:55:55,597
It's a fucking lock.

676
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:59,267
Get this, man. I was at the game today,

677
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:02,729
face-to-fucking-face with Strawberry.

678
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:05,190
And... And...

679
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:11,488
And I knew that he struck out on purpose,

680
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:16,826
and that he's saving it up
for the big one tomorrow.

681
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,330
Today, for the first time,
I understood that...

682
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:22,040
You're sick in the fucking head.
You know that?

683
00:56:22,124 --> 00:56:25,960
That it never could have gone
any other way.

684
00:56:28,547 --> 00:56:31,049
Never could have gone any other way.

685
00:56:33,427 --> 00:56:36,054
So, you just better put in my fucking bet.

686
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:39,849
$120,000 on the last game, the big one.

687
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,268
Come on. You a bookmaker fuck or what?

688
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:44,354
You know, I'll tell you the truth,
be honest with you.

689
00:56:44,438 --> 00:56:45,897
I'm fed up with this.

690
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:48,316
Here. I'm going to give you
this guy's number.

691
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:51,694
You call him yourself.
You tell him what the fuck you want.

692
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:54,072
Put your own bets in from now on.

693
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:55,323
Judas.

694
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:59,244
- You leaving the sinking ship?
- Here. Take that.

695
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:02,705
Yeah, I'll give you a sinking ship.
It ain't no joke.

696
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:05,708
Tell me something. You couldn't pay 60.

697
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:09,212
You lose, you'll be in for 120

698
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:11,631
to a fucking dago
who'll kill you for nothing.

699
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:13,466
Yeah. Keep laughing.

700
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:21,724
You're supposed to cover that,
you didn't even have the 60.

701
00:57:23,436 --> 00:57:24,936
It's now 1:00.

702
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:27,730
Better be careful.

703
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:17,947
Hey, what's up, man? Come on in.

704
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:23,953
How you feeling, man?
Come on in. Come on in.

705
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:27,499
Come on, come on.
Eat something. It's dinnertime. Come on.

706
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,585
You have to help your sister
with her homework. Come on. Hurry it up.

707
00:58:30,669 --> 00:58:32,003
Excuse me.

708
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:36,216
Make yourself at home.
Make yourself at home. Sit down.

709
00:58:43,307 --> 00:58:44,849
I know, I know.

710
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,855
Fourteen across is a three-letter word.
$30. Passing fancy.

711
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,023
- Fad.
- Fad?

712
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:53,787
- Would you please spell it, please?
- F-A-D.

713
00:58:53,817 --> 00:58:55,860
- Are you sure?
- I think so.

714
00:58:56,695 --> 00:58:58,446
All right. Continue.

715
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:00,949
Number 17 across.

716
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:05,912
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.

717
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,707
This is a fluffy mass, as in smoke.

718
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:13,336
A fluffy mass, as smoke.

719
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:17,048
The clock's running.
Remember, you can use your scratch sheet.

720
00:59:17,132 --> 00:59:18,258
You can confer with one another,

721
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:20,593
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.

722
00:59:20,678 --> 00:59:22,178
Because it sometimes helps.

723
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:25,640
Fluffy mess... I'm sorry.
It goes to Team B.

724
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:28,059
You, too, can use your scratch sheet,

725
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:30,270
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.

726
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:32,021
Dodgers are going to win tomorrow.

727
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:33,523
Yes, I know.

728
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:38,861
A five-letter word. $50.
The last movement of a sonata.

729
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:40,655
- Rondo.
- Would you spell it?

730
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,240
R-O-N-D-O.

731
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:44,909
All right. That's absolutely right.
Please go ahead.

732
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:46,578
Seventeen across.

733
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:51,958
Seventeen across.
A four-letter word. $40. A fluffy mass.

734
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:54,043
There's 30 G in there, so be careful.

735
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:55,753
- Flow?
- Can you spell that?

736
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:03,553
- All right, number seven across.
- Seven across.

737
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:06,180
Seven across. A three-letter
word for $30...

738
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:18,151
- All right, seven down.
- Seven down.

739
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:23,990
Give me the definition, in three words,
of a river in central China.

740
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:27,035
- I know this.
- Central China.

741
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,581
- Fifteen seconds... Ten seconds left.
- Han. H-A-N.

742
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,834
That's absolutely right, Charlie.
Congratulations.

743
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:38,463
- All right, the next choice, please.
- Seventeen across.

744
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:43,259
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.

745
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:45,136
This is a fluffy mass,

746
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:47,764
as in smoke. A fluffy...

747
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:51,017
- Are you going to be all right, man? Yo.
- Yeah.

748
01:00:53,187 --> 01:00:54,771
- You sure?
- Yeah.

749
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:58,024
I got it. I got it. I...

750
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,193
I tell you, man, you better take it easy.

751
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:02,362
A fluffy mass... I'm sorry.

752
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,574
You take care, man.

753
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:54,302
Large?

754
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,054
I want my money.

755
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,807
It's still my money.

756
01:05:01,685 --> 01:05:04,937
If you want a chance
to have any part of it, shithead,

757
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,899
you will take my bet...

758
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:13,696
for $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

759
01:05:15,365 --> 01:05:17,575
What about the money you owe me
from yesterday's game?

760
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:19,869
Fuck yesterday's game!

761
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:23,915
The series is seven games, not six!

762
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:28,336
Put in my bet!

763
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:31,672
I'll think about it.

764
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:33,758
There's nothing to think about.

765
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:37,136
Either you put in my bet,
or you get nothing.

766
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:40,306
- Really?
- Yeah.

767
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:44,268
Really, I'm no fucking asshole.

768
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:46,771
I'm a fucking cop!

769
01:05:47,189 --> 01:05:51,359
All right. You meet me tomorrow
in front of the Garden, 33rd and 8th.

770
01:05:51,443 --> 01:05:52,985
You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.

771
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:43,345
There we go.

772
01:08:30,268 --> 01:08:32,144
It's a beautiful vein.

773
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:03,759
All right.

774
01:09:10,225 --> 01:09:11,559
In it goes.

775
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:47,720
Vampires are lucky.
They can feed on others.

776
01:09:47,804 --> 01:09:50,139
We got to eat away at ourselves.

777
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:55,895
We got to eat our legs
so we got the energy to walk.

778
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,857
We got to come so we can go.

779
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:02,401
We got to suck ourselves off.

780
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,656
We got to eat away at ourselves
till there's nothing left but appetite.

781
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:12,912
We give and give,

782
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:16,582
and give crazy.

783
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:19,752
You have to give to make sense?
Ain't worth it.

784
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:24,757
Jesus said 70 times 7.

785
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:32,723
No one will ever understand why...

786
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,475
Why you did it.

787
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:37,895
They'll just forget about you tomorrow,

788
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:40,564
but you got to do it.

789
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,025
Hershiser leans in for the sign.

790
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:46,612
Ease to the belt. His pitch to Bonilla.
Ball, outside.

791
01:10:46,947 --> 01:10:49,365
Orel Hershiser does not
have his good stuff.

792
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:52,034
He has struggled the entire four innings.

793
01:10:52,118 --> 01:10:53,577
Dwight Gooden leads off third.

794
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:56,038
Vince Coleman on first,
dancing back and forth,

795
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:57,414
trying to distract Hershiser,

796
01:10:57,499 --> 01:11:00,876
who's having enough trouble
concentrating on his pitches at this point.

797
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:03,545
Ease to the stretch.
Here's the 1-0 pitch to Bonilla,

798
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,173
and Bonilla rips it down
the third base line.

799
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:09,551
It's rolling toward the corner.
Gooden scores easily.

800
01:11:09,636 --> 01:11:11,720
Now the ball's bouncing around
in the corner,

801
01:11:11,805 --> 01:11:14,765
and Coleman is tearing around third.
He'll score.

802
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:18,477
Bonilla around second, holds up,
goes back into second with a double.

803
01:11:18,561 --> 01:11:21,063
The Mets lead 5 to 0.

804
01:11:21,648 --> 01:11:22,815
Five to 0, and you got to wonder...

805
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:25,567
if the Dodgers can ever recover
from this deficit.

806
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:27,569
That should be it for Hershiser.

807
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:30,656
In fact, Tommy Lasorda's
coming out of the dugout right now.

808
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:34,118
Before he even reaches the mound,
he has motioned to the bullpen,

809
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:37,913
and in, in relief, comes Ramon Martinez.

810
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:42,751
Lasorda using every arm he has available
to try and win this series.

811
01:11:42,836 --> 01:11:45,212
Meanwhile, the game competitor...

812
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:36,722
Listen to me, Sister.

813
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:40,601
Listen to me good.

814
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:45,105
The other cops will just put these guys
through the system.

815
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:49,360
They're juveniles.

816
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:51,153
They'll walk.

817
01:12:52,572 --> 01:12:53,781
Get it?

818
01:12:55,492 --> 01:13:00,496
But I'll beat the system and do justice.

819
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:03,749
Real justice.

820
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,211
For you.

821
01:13:10,256 --> 01:13:12,466
I have already forgiven them.

822
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,511
Come on, lady.

823
01:13:16,096 --> 01:13:19,014
These guys put out cigarette butts
on your...

824
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:25,646
Get with the program.

825
01:13:32,737 --> 01:13:34,321
How could you...

826
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:39,827
How could you forgive these mother...

827
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:44,623
These... These guys? Excuse me.

828
01:13:48,294 --> 01:13:49,795
How could you?

829
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:55,634
Deep down inside, don't you want them
to pay for what they did to you?

830
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:00,389
Don't you want this crime revenged?

831
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,479
I've forgiven them.

832
01:14:17,782 --> 01:14:18,949
But...

833
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:22,744
Do you have the right?

834
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:27,541
You're not the only woman in the world.

835
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:30,752
You're not even the only nun.

836
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:40,304
Your forgiveness
will leave blood in its wake.

837
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:45,726
What if these guys do this to other nuns?

838
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:50,355
Other virgins?

839
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:55,527
Old women who'll die from the shock?

840
01:14:57,363 --> 01:15:01,241
Do you have the right
to let these boys go free?

841
01:15:04,787 --> 01:15:07,122
Can you bear the burden, Sister?

842
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:12,836
Talk to Jesus.

843
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:15,547
Pray.

844
01:15:21,804 --> 01:15:24,223
You do believe in God, don't you?

845
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:32,397
That Jesus Christ died for your sins?

846
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,645
What?

847
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:59,276
You got something
that you want to say to me?

848
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:01,445
You fuck.

849
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:04,990
You rat-fucker.

850
01:17:05,074 --> 01:17:06,325
You rat-fuck!

851
01:17:19,005 --> 01:17:20,505
Here's your...

852
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:31,350
What?

853
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:35,437
Say something. I know.
You're just standing there.

854
01:17:46,616 --> 01:17:48,492
What am I going to do?

855
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,833
You gotta say something!

856
01:17:57,585 --> 01:17:59,002
Something!

857
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:01,380
You fuck!

858
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:06,301
You fucking stand there,
and you want me to do every fucking thing?

859
01:18:07,053 --> 01:18:09,262
Where were you?

860
01:18:09,555 --> 01:18:12,057
Where the fuck were you?

861
01:18:12,392 --> 01:18:14,559
Where were you?

862
01:18:18,022 --> 01:18:20,524
Where the hell were you?

863
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:35,039
I...

864
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:45,382
I'm sorry.

865
01:18:46,926 --> 01:18:49,469
I'm so sorry!

866
01:18:50,722 --> 01:18:52,806
I'm sorry!

867
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:57,602
I did so many bad things!

868
01:18:59,021 --> 01:19:01,022
I'm sorry!

869
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:10,657
I tried to do...

870
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:17,247
I tried to do the right thing,

871
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:21,376
but I'm weak. I'm too fucking weak!

872
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:26,465
I need you to help me.

873
01:19:28,134 --> 01:19:29,801
Help me!

874
01:19:32,597 --> 01:19:35,098
I need you to help me.

875
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:41,146
Forgive me.

876
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:43,732
Forgive me, please.

877
01:19:44,567 --> 01:19:46,318
Forgive me, Father.

878
01:20:18,518 --> 01:20:19,518
Quite a match-up here.

879
01:20:19,602 --> 01:20:24,439
Ramon Martinez against Howard Johnson,
the power pitcher and the fastball hitter.

880
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:28,401
Vince Coleman is leading off third base.
Bobby Bonilla off first.

881
01:20:28,653 --> 01:20:31,196
HoJo has not had much
success against Martinez.

882
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,032
I stole it from my husband's shop...

883
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:39,120
so's I could return it
to where it ought to be.

884
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:41,289
It's a holy thing.

885
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:43,375
A holy thing.

886
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:48,004
- Which way is it?
- The boys right across the street there.

887
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:50,215
Julio and Paulo.

888
01:20:50,675 --> 01:20:52,300
It's a holy thing.

889
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,761
- A holy thing.
- Martinez challenged HoJo...

890
01:20:54,846 --> 01:20:58,431
with his best, his
fastball, and HoJo set...

891
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:09,818
Me, like everybody else, had high hopes
for the Dodger club.

892
01:21:10,903 --> 01:21:15,574
There's a great deal of talent here, but
they just can't seem to keep it together.

893
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:25,125
Freeze.

894
01:21:25,626 --> 01:21:27,043
Go ahead
and keep your hands in front of you.

895
01:21:27,128 --> 01:21:29,379
Keep your hands out in front of you.
Get out of here.

896
01:21:30,256 --> 01:21:34,718
Way back, it may go. Gone!
A home run for Mike Scioscia.

897
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:36,261
You, get out.

898
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:40,056
Well, Scioscia seemed to wait on the pitch,
drove it the other way.

899
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:43,018
Good piece of hitting
by the Dodger veteran.

900
01:21:43,102 --> 01:21:45,061
And the remaining Dodger fans,

901
01:21:45,146 --> 01:21:47,522
well, they finally have something
to cheer about.

902
01:21:47,607 --> 01:21:52,027
The Dodgers must've been wondering
if they could do anything right today.

903
01:21:59,952 --> 01:22:01,202
Put them on.

904
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:03,288
Lock it.

905
01:22:15,968 --> 01:22:17,969
- What's your name?
- Julio.

906
01:22:19,347 --> 01:22:21,348
- What's your name?
- Paulo.

907
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,392
David Cone is on, in relief,
for the New York Mets.

908
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:26,478
Upside and high, ball one.

909
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:31,149
Sid Fernandez and Pete Schourek
are both getting ready in the bullpen.

910
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:34,778
Cone knows, with this big lead,
he has to throw strikes.

911
01:22:35,446 --> 01:22:38,531
Here's a pitch on the way,
breaking ball over called strike.

912
01:22:38,616 --> 01:22:40,825
Jose appeared to be taking...

913
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:45,872
Put your hands up there
where I can see them.

914
01:22:46,624 --> 01:22:51,628
He had a bunt hit in the opening game
of the series.

915
01:22:56,133 --> 01:22:59,469
And the pitch is thrown outside and high.
Ball two.

916
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:03,098
Jose seemed to be swinging away,
but wisely he laid off.

917
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:06,017
Now David behind,
and the count two and one.

918
01:23:06,102 --> 01:23:09,270
Up by seven runs,
David just wants to throw strikes.

919
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:12,273
Nothing's been real easy
for either team in the series.

920
01:23:12,358 --> 01:23:16,069
Cone into the windup. Bunted! Handled
easily, though. Throw to first base.

921
01:23:16,153 --> 01:23:17,237
Give me a light.

922
01:23:17,446 --> 01:23:20,782
And now the Mets need just one more out.

923
01:23:20,866 --> 01:23:23,827
You know, on the replay, you can see
that ball bounce right on the plate,

924
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,787
making for the easy play.

925
01:23:25,871 --> 01:23:27,914
A lot like Coleman's hit in the fourth,

926
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:31,251
but Coleman's ball must've gone
30 feet in the air.

927
01:23:31,836 --> 01:23:36,172
Now it's going to be Lenny Harris
representing the Dodgers' final hope.

928
01:23:36,424 --> 01:23:37,757
Harris, at .225...

929
01:23:37,842 --> 01:23:38,883
Hold it.

930
01:23:40,052 --> 01:23:42,053
You want some good shit?

931
01:23:42,138 --> 01:23:43,499
- Yeah.
- Pitch thrown to Len Harris.

932
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:45,390
Swing and a miss. Strike one.

933
01:23:45,474 --> 01:23:49,352
Harris, like many of these Dodgers,
came out on fire when the series opened,

934
01:23:49,437 --> 01:23:51,479
but seems to have just disappeared.

935
01:23:51,564 --> 01:23:55,191
Of course, Met pitching has had a lot to do
with that disappearance.

936
01:23:55,276 --> 01:23:58,820
In the clutch,
the Mets pitchers just could not be denied.

937
01:23:58,904 --> 01:24:02,657
Mets are now all standing
on the dugout steps in anticipation.

938
01:24:02,742 --> 01:24:04,325
Pitch thrown is ball one.

939
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:08,329
Lenny Harris thought about it, he laid off.
And the count's even at one and one.

940
01:24:08,414 --> 01:24:10,832
At this point, well,
it looks like the Met fans...

941
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,126
Put your hand up there where I can see it.

942
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,502
Here at Dodger Stadium.

943
01:24:14,587 --> 01:24:17,547
You can see pockets of Met rooters
all around the stadium,

944
01:24:17,631 --> 01:24:19,174
and they're already celebrating.

945
01:24:19,258 --> 01:24:22,385
Foul ball coming back and out of play.
Now David Cone...

946
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:24,429
- Give me a light.
- ...needs one more strike...

947
01:24:24,513 --> 01:24:28,183
to complete the most amazing comeback
in playoff history.

948
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:31,561
I'll never forget the '86 championship
against the Astros,

949
01:24:31,645 --> 01:24:34,022
but this one has to be the best.

950
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:37,317
Everyone, but everyone,
had counted the Mets out,

951
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:40,570
and now they're just one strike away
from winning it all.

952
01:24:40,654 --> 01:24:44,199
You know, this whole thing
is really unbelievable.

953
01:24:44,283 --> 01:24:48,286
Here we go. One and two the count.
Cone has his sign.

954
01:24:49,163 --> 01:24:51,206
The windup and the pitch on the way.

955
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,625
Strike three called! The Mets win it.

956
01:24:54,293 --> 01:24:58,671
Harris doesn't like it, but it's all over.
The Mets have won the championship,

957
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:02,008
and the Mets are the first team ever
to come back from a 3-0 deficit...

958
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:05,887
to win a playoff or a World Series.
The Mets are on the field.

959
01:25:05,971 --> 01:25:08,723
Jeff Torborg in the middle,
a very happy man.

960
01:25:08,808 --> 01:25:10,934
What a job he's done for the team.

961
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:12,310
- Out the door.
- Dwight Gooden gets the victory...

962
01:25:12,394 --> 01:25:16,231
with an aid and assist from David Cone
in the eighth and ninth innings.

963
01:25:16,315 --> 01:25:20,610
Well, you can't believe it.
The Mets are going on to the World Series.

964
01:25:21,737 --> 01:25:22,987
The Mets make history.

965
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:26,407
Not only have they won
the National League Championship Series...

966
01:25:26,492 --> 01:25:28,952
with this 8-1 victory over Los Angeles,

967
01:25:29,036 --> 01:25:32,747
they've become the first team
to come back from the brink of elimination,

968
01:25:32,832 --> 01:25:34,415
down three games to none,

969
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,669
and win the series
by taking four straight games.

970
01:25:37,753 --> 01:25:41,756
I'd say that that's highly impossible,
but it's possible. They've done it.

971
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:46,427
This miracle comeback stands side by side,
in the annals of this team,

972
01:25:46,512 --> 01:25:49,931
with all the exploits
of the 1969 Miracle Mets...

973
01:25:50,015 --> 01:25:54,811
and their World Series Championship,
and the 1986 World Series win over Boston.

974
01:25:58,023 --> 01:25:59,983
You raped a holy thing.

975
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:02,652
You destroyed that young girl,

976
01:26:03,696 --> 01:26:05,488
and she forgives you.

977
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:09,617
You hear that? She forgives you.

978
01:26:10,035 --> 01:26:11,870
You fucking heroes.

979
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:17,709
You like holding her down
and shoving your dick into her...

980
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:20,336
while she couldn't do nothing about it?
Did you like that?

981
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:24,174
Watch this, motherfucker.
Here. Watch this, you cocksucker!

982
01:26:24,258 --> 01:26:26,885
Look at that.
You can't do a thing about that, can you?

983
01:26:26,969 --> 01:26:30,388
Can you? Look at me.
Can you? Can you, fuck-face? Can you?

984
01:26:30,723 --> 01:26:34,350
Go ahead. Move.
Move, you cocksucker. Move.

985
01:26:34,435 --> 01:26:36,811
I'd like to blow your fucking face apart.

986
01:26:38,397 --> 01:26:43,193
You fucking scumbags.

987
01:26:46,488 --> 01:26:48,281
And she forgives you.

988
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:53,244
How could she forgive that?

989
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:58,208
How could she forgive
you slimy little bastards?

990
01:27:01,962 --> 01:27:04,005
How could she forgive a thing like that?

991
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:09,862
All passengers westbound,

992
01:28:09,947 --> 01:28:14,742
Los Angeles, San Diego, now boarding.

993
01:28:17,204 --> 01:28:19,080
Attention, passengers.

994
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:24,377
Last call for southbound
I-95 Scenic Cruiser.

995
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,504
All aboard.

996
01:28:53,866 --> 01:28:56,784
If you think you're not
getting on this bus,

997
01:29:01,915 --> 01:29:03,833
you're dead wrong, man.

998
01:29:10,883 --> 01:29:12,717
There's no fucking way...

999
01:29:13,385 --> 01:29:14,785
that you're going to miss this bus.

1000
01:29:39,912 --> 01:29:42,413
You get on this fucking bus, man,

1001
01:29:45,459 --> 01:29:48,544
'cause your life ain't
worth shit in this town.

1002
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:48,873
Hey, cop!
