00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:04,248


3
00:00:56,744 --> 00:01:00,422
"It prefers nobility to brutality.

4
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:06,430
"Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

5
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,263
"History remembers the battle
and forgets the blood.

6
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:21,109
"Whatever history remembers of me,
if it remembers anything at all...

7
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:25,818
"it shall only be a 
fraction of the truth.

8
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,990
"For whatever else I am,
a husband, a lawyer...

9
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,577
"a president...

10
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:38,794
"I shall always think of myself
as a man who struggled against darkness.

11
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,719
"I leave in your trusted hands,
my dear friend Henry...

12
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:51,472
"this record that begins
when I was just a boy."

13
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,561
Get on down there. Hurry it up!

14
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:02,613
Please, sir, no.
There's been some kind of mistake.

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,234
I ain't no slave.

16
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,982
Let them go! Aaron!

17
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,115
Go back inside!

18
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,741
Let them go!

19
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,867
Will!

20
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,499
- Quiet!
- He's my friend!

21
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:14,787
Look away, Abraham.

22
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:15,956
It's not our place.

23
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:17,660
Look away.

24
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:36,929
Abraham!

25
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,355
Thomas, help them!

26
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,610
Leave him alone!

27
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,323
Are you all right?

28
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,828
Did you strike my friend here?

29
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,073
He was beating my son!

30
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,704
Did you strike him, Lincoln?

31
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,793
They're not slaves, and you know it.

32
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,036
I suggest you get back to your work

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,047
before you find yourself
led away in chains.

34
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:06,295
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves.

35
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,506
Very well, then.

36
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:11,136
Since you're all so 
concerned with freedom...

37
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:15,394
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.

38
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,638
And the debt you've been working off...

39
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,064
I'd like it paid in full with interest.

40
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,900
Now, please.

41
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:32,657
If you get one more penny
from me, Mr. Barts...

42
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,160
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it.

43
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:41,750
All right, Mr. Lincoln.

44
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,217
There are other ways to collect a debt.

45
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,112
No!

46
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,066
What's happening to her, Father?

47
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,943
Please help her!
Please, I beg of you.

48
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:54,785
You've got to do something, Father.

49
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:58,493
Easy, child.

50
00:04:58,611 --> 00:04:59,904
Look away, Abraham.

51
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:04,955
I've never seen anything like this.

52
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:06,578
Strange.

53
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,423
You promise me.

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,881
Let's step outside.

55
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:20,516
I'm sorry, I don't know what ails her.

56
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:24,603
Abraham,

57
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,520
come and lie next to me.

58
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,407
I've been writing, Mama.

59
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:47,502
"Days are swift as an Indian arrow...

60
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:51,166
"flying like a shooting star.

61
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:55,003
"The present day is here...

62
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,719
"and then slides away in haste...

63
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:04,269
"that we can never say is ours...

64
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,186
"but only say...

65
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:09,358
"is passed. "

66
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:15,653
Mother?

67
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:18,953
Mother?

68
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:29,080
Lincoln narrating: "Mama once told me 
that I hadn't cried when I was born.

69
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,211
"That I'd simply opened my eyes...

70
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:36,091
"looked at her smiling face...
and smiled back.

71
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,675
"My light was gone."

72
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,633
- I don't know how he did it-
- Abraham...

73
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,260
you promise me...

74
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:48,683
You promise me you won't go
and do anything foolish.

75
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:56,437
Lincoln continues: "Nine years later,
my father joined her in death.

76
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,150
"No longer bound by my promise...

77
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:04,238
"I tried to fortify the nerve
to pursue my vengeance."

78
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:11,745
Haven't you had enough?

79
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,094
A boy only gets this drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl...

80
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,680
or kill a man.

81
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:38,239
Adam, let me explain.

82
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:39,825
Last one, Barts.

83
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,072
I'm not coming up here to clean up
your messes anymore.

84
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,744
Yes, sir. I promise.

85
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:52,920
Every so often, I think about what
it would be like to be in the South.

86
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,874
So, where's Henry?

87
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,504
Yes, sir.
We've been looking all over, sir.

88
00:07:57,623 --> 00:07:58,964
Searching high and low.

89
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,507
Low is more likely.

90
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,214
Just find him, Barts.

91
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:07,099
Oh, and send a fresh crop south.

92
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,601
We have a lot of mouths to feed.

93
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,013
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,197
"Yes, sir, no, sir.
High, sir, low, sir. "

95
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:47,681
For my mother.

96
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,402
That was unlucky.

97
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,687
Might have put me out of my misery.

98
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,364
Where the hell are you running to?

99
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,826
Don't much like chasing chickens.

100
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:08,204
Little boy, all grown up.

101
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,656
Come to avenge his dear momma.

102
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:15,167
There are two kinds of men, Mr. Lincoln.

103
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,503
Those that have the guts
to pull the trigger...

104
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,923
and those who do not.

105
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:23,343
Powder, patch, ball.

106
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,670
Don't mess it up.

107
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,431
You weren't asleep that night.

108
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,556
Were you?

109
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,352
You dropped the ball, Mr. Lincoln.

110
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,613
Your mama's blood was sickening sweet.

111
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:44,693
I hope yours tastes better!

112
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:11,013
(Hears woman screaming)

113
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,184
Might I suggest that we begin by...

114
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,024
closing the door?

115
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,858
Yeah, I'm sorry.

116
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,033
I didn't see anything!

117
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,498
Should we dive right in?

118
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:47,211
Or are you finding Gabrielle's
egress too distracting?

119
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,046
I'm sorry, sir, but who are you?

120
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,505
Who I am is Henry Sturges.

121
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,050
And where you are is my home.

122
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:58,101
And what happened...

123
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,015
I saved your life...

124
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:04,149
during your rather pathetic attempt
at taking another's.

125
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,735
What were you doing there, and...

126
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,736
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?

127
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:12,404
How?

128
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:16,069
I watched this boy carry out
his first long-awaited mission.

129
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,448
Drunk, might I add.

130
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:22,866
And I think, "You have wasted
your time watching this one, Henry.

131
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,792
"He's not a promising recruit.

132
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,049
"He is just a selfish boy
with his heart set on vengeance. "

133
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:36,547
And I realized,
"This boy is a goddamned idiot!"

134
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,096
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire. "

135
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,434
A vampire?

136
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,650
Yes. Immortal, blood-sucking demons.

137
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,734
Fortunately for you, Mr. Lincoln...

138
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,855
hunting them is something of a hobby.

139
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,440
But vampires are just myths.

140
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:54,571
Myths don't beat you senseless

141
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,406
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.

142
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,533
Thank you.

143
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,952
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.

144
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,416
They exist in every city
and every state...

145
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,415
in the Union.

146
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,914
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

147
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,462
I could pay you to kill him!

148
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,635
My services are not for sale.

149
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,507
And the word you are looking for
is "destroy".

150
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:20,590
It is quite a feat to kill that
which is already dead.

151
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,143
But you don't understand.

152
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:28,481
My mother was murdered.

153
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:33,486
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer...

154
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:36,109
so what?

155
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:39,363
How will that honor her memory?

156
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:43,031
How will that benefit the next boy
whose mother is taken?

157
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,373
If vengeance is all you seek...

158
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,128
seek it elsewhere.

159
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:51,416
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.

160
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,420
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance...

161
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,629
and commit to the life of a hunter?

162
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,763
You will have no friends...

163
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,262
no family.

164
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:04,516
Lincoln narrating: "I told him 
what he wanted to hear.

165
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:08,229
"But all I cared about was killing
 the monster that took my mother."

166
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,401
I'm in.

167
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:14,899
Scottish Highland pistol.

168
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,274
And if one barrel isn't enough...

169
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,190
seven should do you.

170
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,526
The blunderbuss.

171
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,579
And if you lose your ball...

172
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:26,500
you can always stuff your pocket watch
down the end of it.

173
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,199
So, Abe...

174
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,044
which one takes your fancy?

175
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:36,087
Actually, I haven't had the 
best of luck with shooting irons.

176
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,884
But...

177
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:42,884
I was a rail splitter.

178
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:55,399
I would like you to chop this tree down
with a single swing.

179
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:56,979
That tree?

180
00:15:57,353 --> 00:15:59,441
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

181
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,987
But it isn't a tree.

182
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,744
It's what you hate most in the world.

183
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,413
So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln...

184
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,077
what do you hate?

185
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,418
I hate Jack Barts.

186
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,874
Then strike him down.

187
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,260
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

188
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,636
Tell me what you hate.

189
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,600
I hate that my mother was taken away.

190
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,018
Inadequate.

191
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:31,892
I hate that we were afraid.

192
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,064
And?

193
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,768
That my mother and father,
everyone that we knew...

194
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,062
lived in fear.

195
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,528
Pathetic.

196
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,532
I hate that I was too small.

197
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,534
- Too weak.
- Yes.

198
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,322
- And that you failed...
- Yes!

199
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:46,700
- ... to protect her.
- Yes!

200
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,749
And that you let her die.

201
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,748
Yaaahhh!!!

202
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,338
Power, Lincoln...

203
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,130
real power...

204
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:05,633
comes not from hate,
but from truth.

205
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,857
Before you protect others
from darkness...

206
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,985
you must first be able
to protect yourself.

207
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,323
Your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible.

208
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,952
You must have the ability
to fight blind.

209
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,115
To see, without seeing.

210
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:34,115
(The sounds of punches, bodies falling)

211
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,388
Again.

212
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,576
Lincoln: "In the weeks that followed...

213
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:16,335
"Henry endeavored to impart a lifetime
of vampire-hunting secrets.

214
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,503
"Their ability to adapt to sunlight.

215
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,419
"Their power to render
themselves invisible.

216
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:25,217
"But most of all, he taught 
me how to destroy them."

217
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,589
When Judas betrayed Jesus...

218
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,560
his reward was 30 pieces of silver.

219
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:34,470
At that moment, those pieces
became a symbol of betraying God.

220
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,018
Of evil.

221
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,893
And silver became a curse...

222
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,777
upon the cursed.

223
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,775
You will never see a vampire
with silver on his person.

224
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,242
Nor see them reflected in mirrors.

225
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,289
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.

226
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:53,291
The one thing he can never possess.

227
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:54,413
Barts!

228
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,203
And the only thing that
renders him powerless.

229
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,294
Henry, Jack Barts!

230
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,294
I give you the targets.
That was our deal.

231
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:06,504
This is not only
about Jack Barts.

232
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,015
Vadoma, a ruthless enforcer.

233
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:12,257
And her brother.

234
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,304
I've seen him before.

235
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:16,265
I saw him with Jack Barts.

236
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,770
They call him Adam.

237
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:23,602
He, from whom all others are made.

238
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:26,023
Vampires have been in
the New World for centuries.

239
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:31,944
Slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers.

240
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:36,031
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves...

241
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,959
the dead saw a sinister opportunity.

242
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,836
They built an empire in the South.

243
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,087
But, in recent years,
they pressed north...

244
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,178
leaving death in their wake.

245
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,972
It falls to us, Abraham...

246
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,017
the hunters,
to keep the balance.

247
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:59,640
To ensure that this remains
a nation of men...

248
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:01,729
and not monsters.

249
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,901
What we do,
we do not for one man...

250
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,604
but for the good of all mankind.

251
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,780
Lincoln: "Henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder.

252
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,321
"No attachments.
No distractions.

253
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,663
"No friends or family.

254
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,916
"Besides, who could I trust?

255
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:24,292
"Anyone in this well-mannered city
might very well be one of them."

256
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:25,967
Son of a bitch!

257
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:35,893
If I ever see you here again,
I will have your balls as a coin purse!

258
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,070
Good afternoon, sir.
Joshua Speed at your service.

259
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,738
Abraham... ah, Lincoln.

260
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,074
I need a bit of help.

261
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,402
All right.

262
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,327
Well, a friend in need
is a friend of Speed.

263
00:20:58,529 --> 00:20:59,740
What can I get for you?

264
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:02,581
I don't suppose you know
of any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?

265
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:04,873
What sort of room are
you looking for, Mr. Lincoln?

266
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,002
Well, a cheap one...

267
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,508
as I have spent all of my money
on law books

268
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:08,749
and have none to spare at the moment.

269
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:12,171
Now, as you say you have none,
am I to take your meaning as "cheap"...

270
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,337
or "free of charge"?

271
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:14,588
Well, on credit.

272
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,884
I don't think you'll find
such a room in Springfield.

273
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,723
People here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated.

274
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,103
Good day.

275
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,695
There is one room, Mr. Lincoln.

276
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,580
I was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate...

277
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:44,118
and am, therefore,
in need of a replacement.

278
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:45,577
There's a room upstairs.

279
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:49,130
It isn't much, but I suppose
it could be had on credit...

280
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,466
if the tenant were willing
to work here in return.

281
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,212
Lincoln writing: "Dear Henry...

282
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,468
"life in Springfield is
less than desirous.

283
00:21:58,673 --> 00:21:59,681
"Fear not.

284
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:03,305
"My pittance of a salary doesn't allow me
to deviate from your rules...

285
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:05,481
"No friends, no family.

286
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:10,517
"And certainly, no woman would find me,
and my existence, enticing."

287
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,157
Excuse me.

288
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:21,822
Excuse me,
I'll be needing these.

289
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,322
Just one second, ma'am.

290
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:27,786
Well, you needn't call me ma'am
as if I'm some haggard spinster..

291
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,336
I'm sorry, ma'am.

292
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,759
Madam... I mean, miss.

293
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,674
I'm Abraham... ah, Lincoln.

294
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:40,977
Mary Todd.

295
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:44,518
Darling.

296
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,392
There you are.

297
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:50,606
You mustn't flit from
store to store so quickly.

298
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,573
Well, perhaps if you didn't stop to jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...

299
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:55,074
I could say the same for you.

300
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:59,319
Stephen Douglas.
How do you do?

301
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:02,407
Abraham... Lincoln.

302
00:23:04,614 --> 00:23:07,164
Are you a voting man, Mr. Lincoln?

303
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,535
I...

304
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,962
How do you feel about
keeping slavery out of Illinois?

305
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,336
I'm running for the legislature.

306
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:14,341
I'm sure he'd love to hear
your campaign speech...

307
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:16,260
but Mr. Lincoln was just about
to attend to my list.

308
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:17,966
We were talking, dear.

309
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,972
Slavery, it's a complicated issue.

310
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:22,887
I couldn't disagree with you more,
Mr. Douglas.

311
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,101
Mr. Douglas, Miss Todd.

312
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:32,982
You have met my new associate, Abraham.

313
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,442
A letter came for you.

314
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,161
Sturges: "Dear Abe.

315
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,127
"Your prescription awaits you
at the local pharmacy.

316
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,744
"Ask for Aaron Stibel, Junior."

317
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,624
Mr. Lincoln?

318
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:54,914
I'm so sorry.

319
00:23:58,418 --> 00:23:59,426
Good day of work, Abraham.

320
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,754
Thank you.

321
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,435
Sturges: "But don't forget...

322
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,443
always have a contingency plan."

323
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:52,270
Aaron Stibel Junior?

324
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,438
Yes?

325
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:42,694
That's it. Oh, that's tight.

326
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:04,012
Don't worry. It will only 
hurt for a second or two.

327
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:05,723
Did you eat today?

328
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,877
Lincoln: "I had killed a monster.

329
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,879
"And I would kill again.

330
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:44,168
"But no amount of death
could make me forget."

331
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:00,477
Merciful Christ, Lincoln,
what happened to your face?

332
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,857
Don't worry, I'll still be able to work.

333
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:02,984
Work?

334
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,438
To hell with work.

335
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,777
We got invited to a ball.

336
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:11,862
It could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.

337
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,707
This suit makes me look ridiculous.

338
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:14,913
Nonsense.

339
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:17,910
But that hat makes you look ridiculous.
Come on.

340
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:24,923
Come on, come on.
Look, there she is.

341
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:26,512
Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed.

342
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:28,512
Pleasure to see you.
Mary, you look lovely.

343
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:29,720
He's still missing.

344
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:30,846
Who's that?

345
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:32,007
Aaron Stibel.

346
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:33,140
Junior or Senior?

347
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:34,979
Ah, Junior.

348
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:37,563
- Who is that man?
- I don't know.

349
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,775
Mr. Douglas, you know Senator Nolan,
of course.

350
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:50,033
Ah yes, Stephen. Good to see you.

351
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,158
Have you heard this news?

352
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,494
Ah yes, yes, we're looking into it.

353
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,581
Rest assured, this kind of lawlessness...

354
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:58,282
won't stand in the 
noble state of Illinois.

355
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:10,838
It's called a dance.

356
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:14,810
If we were meant to sit alone,
they would've called it something else.

357
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:18,265
Yes, I suppose they would have.

358
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:21,348
Come, Mr. Lincoln.

359
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,977
You'll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer.

360
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:30,775
I'm sure you're a very nice man,
Mr. Lincoln...

361
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:32,950
but you're a...

362
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,785
A shopkeeper, in a borrowed suit.

363
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:39,166
No, it's not a matter of means.
Really, no.

364
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:41,288
I came to Springfield
looking for someone different.

365
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:45,550
Someone whose life was a 
bit more adventurous, and well...

366
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:48,458
My apologies, I'm never this-

367
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,591
Honest?

368
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:50,717
Rude.

369
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,555
Miss Todd, may I speak candidly?

370
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:55,056
I, too, came here to better myself.

371
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,225
That's why I've taken an interest
in the law...

372
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:02,098
and why, if I may be so bold,
I have taken an interest in you.

373
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:05,319
And as for the adventure
that you seek...

374
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:08,398
I suspect that few men
could ever hope to provide that for you.

375
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:11,533
Least of all your fiancé
Stephen Douglas.

376
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:15,575
Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.

377
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:19,577
Miss Todd, you have no idea.

378
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:24,662
Sturges: "Dear Abraham...

379
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:27,414
"I've made a deposit at the local bank.

380
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:31,251
"Be careful, it can quickly disappear."

381
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,593
Lincoln writing: "Henry, there are 
more than I ever thought possible...

382
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:13,964
"Pharmacists, innkeepers, pastors.

383
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:17,550
"It's more than a man can bear."

384
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,580
Well, I see I'm
such interesting company.

385
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:42,704
I'm sorry.

386
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:47,746
I've been working nights.

387
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:51,212
Really? Is that true?

388
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:55,093
Do you really want
to know the truth, Mary?

389
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,684
Each and every night...

390
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,473
I go out...

391
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:09,391
hunting vampires.

392
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:20,575
Well, how do you hunt these vampires?

393
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,033
With an axe.

394
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:27,368
A special silver axe, of course.

395
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:28,702
Of course.

396
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,997
And how many would
you reckon you've killed?

397
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,171
Five. No... six.

398
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:40,680
I have killed six vampires.

399
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:42,892
My goodness!

400
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:50,856
Abe!

401
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:57,563
Here I thought you were an honest man.
Really!

402
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:01,563
(Lincoln making barking noises)
Raf! Raf! Raf!.. Raf! Raf!

403
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,623
Well, I had a wonderful day, Abe.

404
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,548
As did I, Mary.

405
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:32,609
Miss Todd, you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness.

406
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:36,105
Mr. Lincoln, you have no idea.

407
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:43,454
Sturges: "You will have no friends, 
no family."

408
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:49,623
I, ah... should be going. It's late.

409
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,128
Lincoln: "How could I bring her into this world?

410
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,130
"A world of demons, of danger."

411
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:00,805
Good night, then, Lincoln.

412
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:03,964
Good night, Mary.

413
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:05,341
Happy hunting.

414
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:11,732
Lincoln: "If I truly cared for her...

415
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:14,642
"the kindest thing I could do...

416
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,312
"was walk away."

417
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:06,568
This hunter is another 
of Henry's disciples.

418
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,039
They say he's a madman.

419
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,827
I can't wait to meet him.

420
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,302
A stock boy, reading a law book.

421
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:27,551
- What?
- You studying to be a lawyer?

422
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,053
As a matter of fact, I am.

423
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:34,310
All right, what about a little test?

424
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:37,276
What's the law for free slaves
in the North?

425
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,858
According to the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1793...

426
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:43,819
enforcing Article four, section two,
of the United States Constitution...

427
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,987
"All runaway slaves must
be returned to their owners. "

428
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,659
However, personal liberty 
laws state that...

429
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,331
"Anyone who is born free...

430
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:53,202
"cannot be taken under this act. "

431
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,078
I heard a good woman once say...

432
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:57,252
"Until all men are free...

433
00:34:57,452 --> 00:34:58,958
"we're all slaves. "

434
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:03,250
Will?

435
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,885
Will Johnson!

436
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:08,260
How did you...?

437
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:09,886
I was back home...

438
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,430
and heard you moved here.

439
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,388
Studying to be a lawyer.

440
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,272
That's good. I'm in 
need of a good lawyer.

441
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,101
What, are you in some kind of trouble?

442
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:19,725
I was freeing slaves down South
on the railroad...

443
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:21,980
hoping to find my brother down there.

444
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,988
Some bounty hunters got after me.

445
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,156
Said I was a runaway.

446
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,242
I need a writ, Abe...

447
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,782
saying I was born free.

448
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:31,910
You know, Will...

449
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,416
Come on.

450
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,954
Hey.

451
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,210
Speed, this is Will Johnson.

452
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:40,255
Will Johnson, my oldest 
cousin in the world.

453
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:43,885
The store isn't going 
to run itself, Abe.

454
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:46,964
I'll have him back as soon as 
possible, Mistah... Speed.

455
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:48,295
I promise.

456
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:52,012
You're getting tall, Abe.

457
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:54,219
Look like you still
don't eat much, either.

458
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:56,145
You still afraid of the dark, too?

459
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,063
Not so much anymore.

460
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:00,102
That's him, Abe.

461
00:36:01,015 --> 00:36:02,486
That's the guy that's been chasing me.

462
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:04,988
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...

463
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:06,741
I'm sure we can work this out.

464
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:09,276
Now I suggest you walk away, son.

465
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:12,490
No, sir, I suggest you do.

466
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,177
I've sent word to Senator Nolan.

467
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,095
He'll have you out soon.

468
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:31,595
You're far too kind, Miss Todd.

469
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:34,800
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.

470
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,727
I think common-looking people
are the best in the world.

471
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,523
That's why the Lord
makes so many of them.

472
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:44,899
I just thank God he was there.

473
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:48,652
But I won't always be there.

474
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,197
Mary...

475
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:55,745
what if something was going on,
something terrible...

476
00:36:56,654 --> 00:37:01,957
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it?

477
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,625
What would you do?

478
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,338
Well...

479
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:11,546
I wouldn't back away from what's right
just because it's hard.

480
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:17,099
My father used to say,
"Plant your feet and stand firm.

481
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:21,519
"The only question is
where to put your feet. "

482
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,569
We may fail in this fight.

483
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,653
We may only shatter
the tranquil veil of oppression...

484
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:33,244
but we must not be deterred!

485
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:37,412
For ours is a just and noble cause.

486
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:39,073
The cause of freedom.

487
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:42,210
The very cause upon which
our founding fathers built...

488
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:44,460
this great nation!

489
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:54,139
A voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop.

490
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,424
I'm actually studying to be a lawyer.

491
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,230
Well, Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time
you thought about politics.

492
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,816
I can connect you with the right people.

493
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,771
Thank you, Senator Nolan.

494
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:12,199
- A pleasure young man.
- The same.

495
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:14,283
You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln.

496
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:20,040
I sent you to Springfield
to hunt vampires...

497
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:21,447
not to chase votes.

498
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:24,669
Lesson one, always have 
a contingency plan.

499
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,125
If vampire hunting doesn't pan out...

500
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:27,715
I need a career to fall back on.

501
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:30,213
I'm being serious.

502
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,134
So am I, Henry.

503
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,469
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

504
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:36,639
Every letter, every name...

505
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,515
but never the letter I wait for,
and never the name I want most.

506
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:44,357
When do I get to kill Jack Barts?

507
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,362
Barts knows about Mary.

508
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,029
It's time.

509
00:38:58,234 --> 00:38:59,242
Abraham...

510
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:01,787
Be careful.

511
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:33,498
Abraham-fucking-Linc...

512
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:35,129
Yaah!

513
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:36,357
Missed again!

514
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:39,991
I hope you're better with an axe
than you were with a gun.

515
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,293
Come on, Lincoln!

516
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:59,301
Catch me before I get to Mary.

517
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,012
Catch me if you can, boy!

518
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:27,823
There's thousands of us here.

519
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,621
He won't stop until this 
whole country is ours.

520
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:36,663
And they'll be coming for you now.

521
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:41,379
Ask your friend, Henry.

522
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,939
You shut your mouth, you stupid whore.

523
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,773
Give me what I need, or 
I'll knock your teeth out.

524
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:24,720
You lying son of a bitch.

525
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:36,972
God damn it!

526
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:40,476
No, Abe, stop!

527
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:46,190
You weren't ready to know.

528
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,034
What, that you are a vampire?

529
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:50,120
You are not the only one...

530
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,830
who has lost everything to vampires.

531
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:03,006
Just because the carriage stops...

532
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:07,137
doesn't mean we have to.

533
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:13,888
Get in the carriage.

534
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,394
Take this.

535
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:21,768
Run. Just run.

536
00:45:27,898 --> 00:45:31,135
Aaaahhhh!!!

537
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:16,302
Her soul was pure.

538
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:19,723
But yours, Henry...

539
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:39,241
It's one of God's little tricks.

540
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:43,541
Vampires cannot kill their own kind.

541
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:46,756
Only the living can kill the dead.

542
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,920
Welcome to the family.

543
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:09,734
You can't save the world,
and the ones you love, Lincoln.

544
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:12,105
You need to make a choice.

545
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:16,738
I'm sorry...

546
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,664
but goodbye.

547
00:47:58,234 --> 00:47:59,642
Yah!

548
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:00,742
Abe!

549
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,119
Mary!

550
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:03,660
What on earth are you doing?

551
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:05,709
Come on in.

552
00:48:05,823 --> 00:48:07,377
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

553
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:08,500
Abe?

554
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:10,954
It's nothing.

555
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:13,376
Abe, I know when you're lying.

556
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:14,750
What are you hiding from me?

557
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:16,085
All right.

558
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:20,302
I didn't want to tell you this way.
This is not the way that I planned it.

559
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:21,928
But if you really must know...

560
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:35,612
Mary Todd...

561
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:40,743
will you make me the happiest of men?

562
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:10,685
And do you, Abraham...

563
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:13,605
promise to love her,
comfort her...

564
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:16,905
be honorable and honest
with her in all things...

565
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:18,859
in sickness and health...

566
00:49:19,063 --> 00:49:21,115
till death do you part?

567
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,201
I do.

568
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,746
Then by the power vested
in me by almighty God...

569
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,416
and the great state of Illinois...

570
00:49:28,614 --> 00:49:29,789
I now pronounce you...

571
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:31,789
man and wife.

572
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:34,340
You may kiss the bride.

573
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:45,430
Your mother would be so proud.

574
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:46,556
Thank you, Will.

575
00:49:46,674 --> 00:49:47,932
I'm happy you could be here.

576
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,688
You're the only family I have.

577
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:52,269
Except for this one.

578
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,360
Congratulations.

579
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:57,566
May I introduce Mr. Henry Sturges.

580
00:49:57,769 --> 00:49:59,441
My wife, Mary.

581
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,149
And my dear friend, Will Johnson.

582
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,741
Heavens, Mr. Sturges, you're 
as chilly as the winter wind.

583
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,111
Henry, please.

584
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,122
I'm afraid that's a hazard
of carrying one's own bottle.

585
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,918
Well, you know what they say,
"Cold hands, warm heart. "

586
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:13,333
Yes, but I highly doubt that.

587
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,123
Mr. Sturges is a business associate.

588
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:17,084
Yes, I thought we could 
talk a little business.

589
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:18,213
Of course.

590
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:19,625
If you'll excuse me.

591
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,049
What the hell are you doing here?

592
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,848
Be cautious, Abraham.

593
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:33,814
One forgets how easily we can lose
the most precious things.

594
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:38,027
They don't even know who I am.

595
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:19,104
Go upriver.

596
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:24,696
Invite this Mr. Lincoln
to join us at the plantation.

597
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:28,657
We're going to throw a ball
in his honor.

598
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,205
What makes you think he'll accept?

599
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:36,170
I think we can find a way to tempt him.

600
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:45,510
It's a good book. It's good.

601
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:56,764
Get him!

602
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,023
Abe.

603
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:01,185
We've got a problem.

604
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:06,279
They took Will.

605
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,493
What are you going to do?

606
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,663
I'm going to accept his invitation.

607
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,376
Lincoln: "Speed deserved to know the truth
of what we were about to face.

608
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,169
"I told him everything.

609
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:28,221
"Not knowing if he would believe me
or think me mad.

610
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:31,517
"Not knowing if he would have the courage
to face the monsters...

611
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,726
"that I had come to know."

612
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:36,938
You and me, Abraham,
together we can accomplish anything.

613
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:03,204
There are no slaves.
Where are they?

614
00:53:04,288 --> 00:53:06,543
I was just wondering that.

615
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:43,670
Something isn't right about this, Abe.

616
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:44,795
Yeah.

617
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,926
I don't know how to dance.

618
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,754
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

619
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,430
Wait here.

620
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,102
Ladies and gentlemen...

621
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,057
dinner is served.

622
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:58,055
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln.

623
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:01,425
Bravo. You're even 
better than I'd heard.

624
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:04,810
A shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men...

625
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:06,731
but I needed to know
if you're up to the task.

626
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:08,400
What do you want with me?

627
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:11,397
To see you liberated.

628
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,531
To see you rise up and 
destroy your oppressor.

629
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:17,114
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

630
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:18,619
Men have enslaved each other...

631
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:21,912
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.

632
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:25,499
I've seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

633
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,798
Seen Christians...

634
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:36,382
thrown to lions with my own eyes.

635
00:56:37,251 --> 00:56:42,008
And I've seen Africans
sell their own kind to Europeans

636
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:47,103
May I share one of the revelations
of my 5,000 years?

637
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:50,859
We're all slaves to something.

638
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,236
I, to eternity.

639
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:56,531
You, to your convictions.
Others, to the color of their skin.

640
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,532
All I ever wanted...

641
00:56:58,731 --> 00:57:02,409
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place.

642
00:57:03,611 --> 00:57:07,621
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry...

643
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:10,333
who enjoy living in the dark.

644
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:12,584
And as you're doubtless aware...

645
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:15,836
I cannot personally destroy him,
nor he I.

646
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,263
You, Mr. Lincoln...

647
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,100
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance...

648
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:28,016
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

649
00:57:28,803 --> 00:57:30,773
All I ask...

650
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,065
is for you to break your chains.

651
00:57:36,644 --> 00:57:37,902
Kill your master.

652
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,814
Be free.

653
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,193
And if I refuse?

654
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,037
Then you go on your merry way.

655
00:57:46,654 --> 00:57:50,248
After I make you one of us, and...

656
00:57:51,617 --> 00:57:53,788
spoon-feed you your friend.

657
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:58,754
Now, a simple "yes" or "no"
will suffice.

658
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:01,591
Kill Henry...

659
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,005
save your friend.

660
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,889
Feel free to take your time to decide.
Five...

661
00:58:08,176 --> 00:58:09,184
four...

662
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,393
three...

663
00:58:12,013 --> 00:58:13,021
two...

664
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:16,059
one.

665
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,059
Speed from a distance: "C'mon! Yeah!
Get up! (Horse whinnies)

666
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,160
Come on!

667
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,097
This way.

668
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,837
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.

669
00:59:25,253 --> 00:59:26,261
Come quickly.

670
00:59:40,351 --> 00:59:42,024
People getting killed every day.

671
00:59:42,687 --> 00:59:43,944
Slaves disappearing.

672
00:59:44,188 --> 00:59:46,443
Some people talk
about monsters and demons.

673
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:54,036
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

674
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,625
How can I assist you
on this beautiful day?

675
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:58,119
We're looking for three men.

676
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:00,629
You know, I did see someone
run down that way.

677
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:03,629
"Ding!"

678
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,971
You're welcome to come in if you like.

679
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,806
Our service is about to begin.

680
01:00:10,048 --> 01:00:11,341
Right, let's keep going.

681
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,320
I take it y'all came from up North?

682
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:24,861
Yes, ma'am.

683
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:27,648
Well, I suggest you get back there
as fast as you can.

684
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,031
There's a war coming.

685
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,994
A war for the soul of the country.

686
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,998
Going to be all colors of blood spilled.

687
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,341
Our nation was built
on the backs of slaves

688
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:44,593
Their labor, their blood.

689
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,555
More blood than you 
could possibly imagine.

690
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:50,433
I have seen this horror
of the South firsthand.

691
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,510
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the Blacks.

692
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:58,265
I say that if the people
of this great nation want slavery...

693
01:00:58,471 --> 01:00:59,942
then let them have it.

694
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,820
The demon of slavery
is tearing our country apart.

695
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:07,116
We must stand up.
We must stand strong and fight.

696
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:11,026
Fight for the very soul of our nation.

697
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:14,781
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves!

698
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:21,005
You cannot take on slavery, Abraham.

699
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,875
You cannot take on the whole South!

700
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:25,499
- Why, because of Adam?
- No.

701
01:01:25,623 --> 01:01:26,964
Are you afraid of him?

702
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,963
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years...

703
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,258
and you take that away,
then no one is safe.

704
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:35,600
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.

705
01:01:36,718 --> 01:01:37,726
A great man once said...

706
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:39,564
"What we do,
we do not for ourselves...

707
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,064
"not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind!"

708
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:44,186
Not all mankind, Abraham.

709
01:01:44,308 --> 01:01:45,649
Abe?

710
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,992
May I have my husband back?

711
01:01:51,858 --> 01:01:53,945
He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.

712
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:58,999
Lincoln: "Henry only saw the 
struggle his way.

713
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:03,167
"But I began at last to see it another.

714
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,833
"To see and to feel
the even greater issues at stake.

715
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:11,597
"So, he and I would go our separate ways.

716
01:02:12,045 --> 01:02:13,931
"As the Bible says...

717
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,511
"the time had come for me
to put aside childish things

718
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,104
"I would fight not with an ax...

719
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:23,352
"but with words and ideals.

720
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,184
"For a time...

721
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,645
"they proved a stronger weapon."

722
01:02:31,487 --> 01:02:40,833
Crowd chanting: "Lincoln! Lincoln!
 Lincoln!..."

723
01:02:43,538 --> 01:02:47,169
In compliance with a custom as 
old as the Government itself, 

724
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:51,169
I appear before you to take,
in your presence...

725
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:54,555
the oath prescribed by
the Constitution of the United States...

726
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,592
to be taken by the president...

727
01:02:56,714 --> 01:03:01,305
before he enters on
the execution of this office.

728
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:05,271
The question of slavery is better settled
with a pen than with a sword.

729
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,398
Fire!

730
01:03:24,242 --> 01:03:25,499
Lincoln: "Through twists of fate...

731
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:27,789
"I found my self at 50 years of age...

732
01:03:27,912 --> 01:03:32,503
"the father of a nation that
was tearing itself apart...

733
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,927
"while trying to be
the father to a boy...

734
01:03:35,128 --> 01:03:38,342
"not much older than I was
when I lost my mother."

735
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,388
Three thousand more dead.

736
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:57,988
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

737
01:03:58,109 --> 01:03:59,450
I'm not hungry, thank you.

738
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,867
You have got to eat, Abe.
You're only human.

739
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,468
Come along, Willie.

740
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:16,712
Willie.

741
01:04:24,177 --> 01:04:25,470
Willie.

742
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:39,735
If you do this, there is 
no turning back, Abe.

743
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:42,408
I know.

744
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,246
I'm trying to protect the freedom
of a nation.

745
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:52,373
Lincoln: "If this war is truly a stand
against evil...

746
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:54,965
"then let it stand for something.

747
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,344
"If it is a war for the freedom of man...

748
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:01,558
"why not give all men
a reason to fight it?"

749
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:04,851
"All persons held as slaves...

750
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,897
"within any state
or designated part of a state...

751
01:05:08,012 --> 01:05:10,267
"the people whereof
shall be in rebellion

752
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,858
"against the United States
shall be then...

753
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,487
"... and henceforward shall be free."

754
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:27,120
Good morning.

755
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,549
Precious little one...

756
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:41,672
what's your name?

757
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:42,840
Willie.

758
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,011
And your father? What's his?

759
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:46,972
Abraham.

760
01:05:49,216 --> 01:06:05,972
(Inaudible Dialog)

761
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:08,949
What a beautiful silver sword.

762
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:20,387
How is our little soldier faring?

763
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:34,984
I've never seen anything like it.

764
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,237
I'm sorry.

765
01:06:38,436 --> 01:06:40,939
I don't know what ails your boy.

766
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:10,827
Abe.

767
01:08:12,905 --> 01:08:14,542
Mary's calling for you.

768
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:40,475
I'm so sorry, Abraham.

769
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:46,403
Why didn't they take me?

770
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:48,783
Because they know...

771
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,578
it is a fate much worse than death.

772
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:54,657
Mary...

773
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:59,461
is inconsolable.

774
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,007
She says she doesn't want
to go on without him.

775
01:09:04,123 --> 01:09:05,677
There is a way, Abraham.

776
01:09:06,959 --> 01:09:09,428
You know that I can restore the dead.

777
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:11,971
Do it.

778
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:18,687
Do it.

779
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:20,147
Mary...

780
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:21,565
Do it!

781
01:09:24,185 --> 01:09:25,822
Your journal...

782
01:09:27,271 --> 01:09:29,407
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket...

783
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,532
I know I shouldn't have, Abe, but
I needed to know what you were hiding.

784
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:35,160
If what you say is true...

785
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,035
I beg you...

786
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:40,545
give us our little boy back.

787
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:45,421
Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy.

788
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,383
He would be something else,
something terrible.

789
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,221
Trust me, you don't want that.

790
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,389
You're asking me to trust you?

791
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,059
After you lied to me
for all these years.

792
01:09:55,174 --> 01:09:57,725
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.

793
01:09:57,844 --> 01:09:58,971
And how did that work out?

794
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,065
You did this, Abe!

795
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:04,352
You did this!
You brought this on him!

796
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:06,196
You brought this on our boy!

797
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:14,777
Let me go to them.

798
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,830
Make a truce with Adam.

799
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,663
We must stop this war.
Willie's death is just the beginning.

800
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,585
Don't you dare say his name.

801
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,587
I warned you.

802
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,210
You didn't heed me.

803
01:10:25,747 --> 01:10:28,712
How many more boys will have to die
before you listen to me?

804
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,056
These boys are dying in vain.

805
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:42,982
We should pull the troops back.

806
01:10:44,265 --> 01:10:47,563
Abraham, this war has 
cost us countless lives...

807
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:49,525
not to mention millions of dollars.

808
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,279
I thought we were going
to make this country great...

809
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,119
not tear it apart.

810
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:57,951
This is the only way we can 
save the country now, Speed.

811
01:11:00,615 --> 01:11:02,667
Send in troops.

812
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:12,637
Union troops are flooding
onto the field.

813
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:15,466
We are now outnumbered...

814
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:18,685
and ill-equipped compared to the North.

815
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:22,099
We will support you...

816
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:25,773
but you will need to support us.

817
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,481
No, thank you.

818
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:30,820
Rest assured, Mr. Davis...

819
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:34,492
you'll have as many of my kind
as you need.

820
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:58,012
Fire!

821
01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:02,850
Fire!

822
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:16,367
Ready!

823
01:12:16,858 --> 01:12:17,866
Aim!

824
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:22,823
Here they come!

825
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:25,916
Fire!

826
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,299
Why did they drop their rifles?

827
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:44,226
Fire!

828
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:26,263
It's the first day of Gettysburg.

829
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,393
It's been a disaster.

830
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,069
I don't think the army
can survive another.

831
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:36,940
If the rebels break through,
they'll be here... in days.

832
01:13:40,358 --> 01:13:43,620
The generals think we 
should evacuate Washington.

833
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,790
Run the war from New York or...

834
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:49,253
Boston, if need be.

835
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,290
You have to win this war.

836
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,799
If you don't, then all of it...

837
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,471
Then our son's death
will have been for nothing.

838
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:01,425
How can I win a war...

839
01:14:01,629 --> 01:14:03,765
when I can't even protect my own family?

840
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,389
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.

841
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:12,232
When our bullets are useless, our 
bayonets are powerless as this fork!

842
01:14:12,432 --> 01:14:13,523
This...

843
01:14:20,481 --> 01:14:21,490
Will!

844
01:14:21,607 --> 01:14:22,699
Speed!

845
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,495
This. This is what we need.

846
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,074
A fork?

847
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:30,659
Silver.

848
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:32,832
Okay, okay.

849
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:35,091
How much do we need?

850
01:14:35,955 --> 01:14:37,248
All of it.

851
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:01,067
And why tell me this, Mr. Speed?

852
01:15:01,272 --> 01:15:02,695
Why betray your friend?

853
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:06,446
He is my friend, but I 
love this country even more.

854
01:15:06,778 --> 01:15:11,084
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.

855
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,544
You've done the right thing.

856
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,551
I know.

857
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,215
32, 33, 34, 35...

858
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,639
That is a lot of silver, Abe.

859
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,979
Now, how are we going to
get all this there?

860
01:15:53,491 --> 01:15:55,247
I'm sorry, Mary.

861
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:02,842
I'm sorry I've kept you 
in the dark all these years.

862
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,432
I need you, Mary.

863
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:23,280
I've waited a long time
to hear you say those words.

864
01:16:38,244 --> 01:16:41,376
I want you to leave Washington, Mary.

865
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:43,836
Miss Tubman,
please have some tea.

866
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,587
I very much appreciate you coming
to speak with me today.

867
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:49,136
Oh, yes.

868
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:52,474
Things have not been easy,
what with my...

869
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,179
The death of my son and the war.

870
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,226
I need to get out of Washington.

871
01:16:58,431 --> 01:17:00,103
And I need a lot of help.

872
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,294
This war ends tonight.

873
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,131
And with it...

874
01:18:11,212 --> 01:18:13,134
our millennia of darkness.

875
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,559
We have to do this on our own.

876
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,479
No one can know what's on that train.

877
01:18:17,677 --> 01:18:20,311
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys at Gettysburg...

878
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:21,557
the war is over.

879
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:29,742
It's time we had a nation of our own.

880
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:33,991
Come...

881
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:36,871
we have a train to catch.

882
01:18:37,697 --> 01:18:40,117
It's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg.

883
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:43,955
Eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living...

884
01:18:44,829 --> 01:18:46,170
or the dead.

885
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:17,990
Is everything all right, Speed?

886
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,160
I just can't believe
you're still writing in that book.

887
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,498
It's all in here, Speed.

888
01:19:24,702 --> 01:19:25,995
The good with the bad.

889
01:19:48,309 --> 01:19:49,401
What's this?

890
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:51,781
They're fleeing the nest.

891
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,698
Leaving Washington free for us.

892
01:20:09,288 --> 01:20:10,546
Look at me.

893
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:14,802
I said look at me.

894
01:20:14,854 --> 01:20:16,422
(Train whistles in the distance)
Leave her.

895
01:20:17,005 --> 01:20:18,725
Don't want to miss this train.

896
01:20:29,976 --> 01:20:30,984
Let's go.

897
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:50,543
Henry, what the hell are you doing here?

898
01:20:50,663 --> 01:20:52,918
I just wanted to see how far 
your foolishness would take you.

899
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,215
I don't have time to argue!

900
01:20:54,334 --> 01:20:56,421
I didn't come here to argue with you.

901
01:20:56,544 --> 01:21:00,257
I came here to tell you that
your dear friend Speed back there...

902
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:01,639
is a traitor.

903
01:21:03,426 --> 01:21:05,894
He betrayed you, Abe.
Speed is leading you-

904
01:21:06,012 --> 01:21:07,815
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

905
01:21:13,186 --> 01:21:15,025
That's all according to plan.

906
01:21:21,186 --> 01:21:25,025
(Hears thumping on the roof)

907
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:05,332
You must get off this train.

908
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:07,368
No, you must get off this train.

909
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,542
This is not your war, Henry.

910
01:22:51,284 --> 01:22:52,411
They're here, Abe.

911
01:22:52,618 --> 01:22:53,627
A whole heap of them.

912
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:55,508
We can't let them stop this train.

913
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:56,998
You go through there
and you're dead.

914
01:22:57,832 --> 01:22:59,469
Get out now,
it's your last chance.

915
01:23:04,005 --> 01:23:05,013
Did you load that thing?

916
01:23:07,633 --> 01:23:09,555
We've got to keep them
away from the locomotive.

917
01:26:10,858 --> 01:26:13,077
Why don't you let him go, Lincoln?

918
01:26:13,277 --> 01:26:15,329
Emancipate yourselves.

919
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,001
I will never follow you.

920
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:19,452
You don't have to follow me, Abe.

921
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:21,462
I have the train.

922
01:26:21,661 --> 01:26:23,084
I have the silver.

923
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:25,506
Soon I'll have the whole country.

924
01:26:25,707 --> 01:26:29,669
I'm going to destroy the 
myth of Abraham Lincoln...

925
01:26:29,877 --> 01:26:32,511
so that history will forever know you
not as a man...

926
01:26:33,131 --> 01:26:34,970
but as a monster!

927
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:18,165
(Sturges starts laughing)

928
01:27:38,363 --> 01:27:40,165
Lincoln set us up.

929
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:42,414
We've been tricked, Adam.

930
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:45,874
There is no silver on this train.

931
01:28:05,765 --> 01:28:06,773
Abe!

932
01:28:16,025 --> 01:28:17,199
Abe!

933
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:20,416
Abe!

934
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:35,884
Hello, Speed.

935
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:37,762
Where is the silver?

936
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,889
Silver?

937
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,558
Should be here.

938
01:28:41,676 --> 01:28:43,313
Why did you lie to me?

939
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:46,816
To get you all in one place...

940
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:48,225
to finish you.

941
01:28:48,433 --> 01:28:49,643
Speed?

942
01:28:51,352 --> 01:28:53,073
Nooooo!!!

943
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,795
Mr. President!

944
01:29:57,085 --> 01:29:59,588
There is nowhere left to run, Lincoln.

945
01:30:01,422 --> 01:30:02,715
Where is it?

946
01:30:02,924 --> 01:30:04,395
Where is the silver?

947
01:30:09,013 --> 01:30:10,224
Right here!

948
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,037
Thank you, Henry.

949
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,168
I suppose some vampires can be trusted.

950
01:32:02,043 --> 01:32:04,214
As can some men, Abraham.

951
01:32:05,922 --> 01:32:07,891
If the train was a decoy...

952
01:32:09,258 --> 01:32:10,302
where is the silver?

953
01:32:11,552 --> 01:32:13,355
This isn't the only railroad.

954
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,524
A wise man once taught me...

955
01:32:18,726 --> 01:32:21,941
"Always have a contingency plan."

956
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:27,611
Get me more!

957
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:29,954
Bayonets.
Bayonets for Springfield muskets.

958
01:32:30,071 --> 01:32:31,661
Springfield muskets!

959
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:36,077
Five-pounders and grenades are in
the second wagon in the back.

960
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:37,495
Go now, go now.

961
01:33:34,427 --> 01:33:35,435
Fire!

962
01:33:45,563 --> 01:33:49,027
Lincoln: "Four score and seven years ago...

963
01:33:49,192 --> 01:33:52,289
"our fathers brought forth
on this continent...

964
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:56,200
"a new nation conceived in liberty...

965
01:33:56,407 --> 01:33:58,709
"and dedicated to the proposition...

966
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:02,920
"that all men are created equal.

967
01:34:03,623 --> 01:34:06,720
"Now we are engaged
in a great civil war...

968
01:34:06,918 --> 01:34:10,299
"testing whether that nation
or any nation...

969
01:34:10,588 --> 01:34:12,925
"so conceived and so dedicated...

970
01:34:13,049 --> 01:34:15,350
"can long endure.

971
01:34:21,933 --> 01:34:23,523
"It is for us, the living, rather...

972
01:34:23,726 --> 01:34:25,529
"to be dedicated here...

973
01:34:25,728 --> 01:34:29,322
"to the unfinished work
which they who fought here...

974
01:34:29,524 --> 01:34:32,110
"have thus far so nobly advanced.

975
01:34:32,902 --> 01:34:35,832
"It is rather for us
to be here dedicated...

976
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:39,209
"to the great task remaining before us...

977
01:34:39,409 --> 01:34:43,501
"that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause...

978
01:34:43,705 --> 01:34:47,501
"for which they gave the 
last full measure of devotion...

979
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:51,010
"that we here highly resolve
that these dead...

980
01:34:51,212 --> 01:34:54,095
"shall not have died in vain...

981
01:34:54,298 --> 01:34:57,146
"and that this nation, under God...

982
01:34:57,343 --> 01:35:00,024
"shall have a new birth of freedom...

983
01:35:00,221 --> 01:35:01,348
"and that government...

984
01:35:01,556 --> 01:35:06,610
"of the people, by the people,
for the people...

985
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:10,449
"shall not perish from the earth."

986
01:35:25,246 --> 01:35:27,216
Lincoln: "Our enemies have made their exodus.

987
01:35:28,082 --> 01:35:29,375
"Some back to Europe...

988
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,680
"some to South America and the Orient.

989
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,511
"They've seen that America shall
forever be a nation of living men...

990
01:35:38,426 --> 01:35:41,523
"a nation of free men."

991
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:45,565
We make rather a good team,
you and I.

992
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:49,566
One can't help but think of all the good
we could do if we had more time.

993
01:35:50,855 --> 01:35:51,863
Limitless time.

994
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:52,989
Mary: Lincoln!

995
01:35:53,107 --> 01:35:57,782
Yes, well, time waits for no man.

996
01:35:58,071 --> 01:35:59,910
We're going to be late for the theatre.

997
01:36:04,243 --> 01:36:06,165
Hold onto this for me, Henry.

998
01:36:13,711 --> 01:36:15,218
Mary, darling...

999
01:36:15,755 --> 01:36:17,807
have you seen my hat?

1000
01:36:18,007 --> 01:36:20,262
It's on your desk in the office.

1001
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:24,399
Have you seen my hat?

1002
01:36:24,597 --> 01:36:27,278
Abraham, let me make you immortal.

1003
01:36:27,475 --> 01:36:29,147
Let us fight through the ages,
side by side.

1004
01:36:29,268 --> 01:36:31,570
Vampires are not the only 
things that live forever.

1005
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:53,463
Sturges: "History prefers legends to men.

1006
01:36:54,252 --> 01:36:57,384
"It prefers nobility to brutality.

1007
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:00,645
"Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

1008
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,851
"History remembers the battle...

1009
01:37:04,053 --> 01:37:05,809
"and forgets the blood.

1010
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:10,312
"However history remembers me,
if it does at all...

1011
01:37:11,686 --> 01:37:15,826
"it shall only remember
a fraction of the truth."

1012
01:37:41,049 --> 01:37:42,092
One more.

1013
01:37:45,845 --> 01:37:49,772
A guy only gets that drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl, or kill a man.

1014
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:53,072
So, which is it?

1015
01:37:53,582 --> 01:37:56,835
