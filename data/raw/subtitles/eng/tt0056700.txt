1
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,209
Early in the 1800s,

2
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,679
the fearful sounds of war once
again shook the heart of Europe.

3
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,124
Not far from
the field of battle,

4
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:50,028
there was another sound...
Soft and gentle...

5
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,564
Yet it has echoed down the years

6
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,500
to be heard long after
the guns were stilled

7
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,569
and the battles forgotten.

8
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,707
If you listen closely,
you can hear it... Now.

9
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,169
Ahem!

10
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:19,444
Well, grimm, how goes
the work today?

11
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,279
Mr. Gruber!
Forgive me.

12
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,281
I didn't know you were here.

13
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,350
And does my presence
disturb you?

14
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,852
Your hands are trembling.

15
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,287
My brother has not been feeling well,
Mr. Gruber.

16
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,689
His health is really not...

17
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,958
And still he continues to work.

18
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,527
What heroic devotion to duty!

19
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,095
It's... nothing.

20
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,497
On the contrary, grimm.

21
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,898
On the contrary.

22
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,534
His grace the Duke
will be most grateful...

23
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,871
And find ways to show it.

24
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,141
Uh, may I examine
the fruits of your labor?

25
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,575
But it isn't complete.

26
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,145
Wouldn't you rather wait
until the entire manuscript...

27
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,580
No. No.

28
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:05,390
"And as he fell,
he ceased to be a frog

29
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,061
and turned into a prince
with beautiful, kind eyes."

30
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,865
And where does this event occur

31
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,234
in the Duke's
family history, hmm?

32
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,336
Well, I... I heard
this little story,

33
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,006
and while it was
fresh in my mind,

34
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,608
I thought I'd borrow
just a few minutes.

35
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,609
Borrow?

36
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,678
Borrow.

37
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,712
You call it borrowing, do you?

38
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,814
Stealing!

39
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,916
You are stealing from the Duke,

40
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,518
who is paying you to
write his family history.

41
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,587
When you steal from the Duke,

42
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,189
you are committing a crime...

43
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,758
For which he could
put you behind bars

44
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,059
like any other thief!

45
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,597
Uh, need I say more, gentlemen?

46
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,482
Don't be angry, Jacob.

47
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,785
Anger poisons the mind
and sours the stomach.

48
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,687
Wilhelm, these are
perilous times.

49
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,623
Work is hard to find
and money is scarce.

50
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,225
I swear... word of honor.

51
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,693
I'm a reformed man.

52
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,562
You have a responsibility
to your wife, your children.

53
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,297
You're right, absolutely.

54
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,933
You see, I heard this wonderful,
wonderful story

55
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,568
from the old flower vendor...

56
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,637
I don't want to hear it.

57
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,066
About this beautiful
young Princess

58
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,440
playing with a golden ball.

59
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,108
The ball falls into the well,

60
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,510
and she thinks it's lost...

61
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,878
When suddenly, a frog offers

62
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,546
to fetch it up for her,

63
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,182
but only if she'll invite the
frog to dinner, and then...

64
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,251
Wilhelm!

65
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,387
Off in the clouds again.

66
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,056
The poor moonstruck ninny.

67
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,293
The whole world on fire,
and he can't even smell the smoke.

68
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,996
Forgive me, ladies,
but I do smell the smoke...

69
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,831
And the gunpowder.

70
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,233
True, the whole world is at war.

71
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,035
Blood is flowing everywhere.

72
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,104
Wilhelm!

73
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,938
Real blood, ladies.

74
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,474
Not dragon's blood,
which isn't harmful,

75
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,477
nor witch's brew,
which can turn an old hag

76
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,345
into a beautiful young Princess.

77
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,714
That is my world, dear ladies.

78
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,717
If you prefer yours,
I beg you keep it...

79
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,654
With my fond blessings
and a cordial good-day.

80
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,289
Wilhelm!

81
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:21,359
I honestly believe
his mind is going.

82
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,929
Gone, my dear, never to return.

83
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,165
That was the last gasp
from the old Wilhelm.

84
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,767
From now on, you'll see.

85
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,068
Jacob!

86
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,637
Jacob grimm!

87
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,240
You see what he wants.
I'll go and buy the bread.

88
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,008
All right, but hurry.
We're late already!

89
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,243
Jacob!

90
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,778
Come here!

91
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,747
Mr. Grimm! Don't you
want to buy a Rose?

92
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,516
No. No, no,
thank you.

93
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,786
I have another one for you,
Mr. Grimm, a darling story...

94
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,220
No, no more stories.

95
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,457
About a funny little man
who spins gold out of straw.

96
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,594
Spins gold out of straw?

97
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,598
No. No, no.

98
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,571
How does it go?

99
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,075
A pretty girl is locked
in the king's castle.

100
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,612
"Spin this straw into gold,"
he says, "or you will die."

101
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,847
Such a sweet story.

102
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,016
Yes, yes.
Go on, go on.

103
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,584
That's a little better.

104
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,586
Now, if you could
possibly manage

105
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,989
to look a little
less gloomy, eh?

106
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,291
If you called me to
criticize my appearance...

107
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,993
No, my friend Jacob, no.

108
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,961
Your gloominess
is only a symptom.

109
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,696
Now the diagnosis:

110
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,832
Too much work, no pleasure,

111
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,233
too many hours alone.

112
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,568
Look, I feel fine.

113
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,036
Don't be absurd.

114
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,971
Symptom, diagnosis...

115
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,773
And now, the cure.

116
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,208
I must...

117
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:47,712
Miss Greta Heinrich,
may I present Mr. Jacob grimm.

118
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,648
I don't believe it...

119
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,750
A man so young?

120
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,518
Why, I saw you on the street,

121
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,454
and it never entered my mind
that you could be Jacob grimm,

122
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,791
the author of all these
marvelous works!

123
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,994
Well, I... That is
not precisely true.

124
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,863
I collaborate with my brother.

125
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,965
Ah, the married brother, yes.

126
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,466
You will be thrilled to know

127
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,602
that miss Heinrich has
bought one of your books...

128
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,104
One that you wrote
all by yourself.

129
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,106
I can't wait to read it!

130
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,643
<i>Legal antiquities?</i>

131
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,412
A marvelous choice.

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,082
Old laws are so much
nicer than new ones.

133
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,418
I told miss Heinrich
if she waited,

134
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,987
the author would write
something in the book.

135
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,289
Yes, but...
What shall I write?

136
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,291
Anything.

137
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,861
Respectfully...

138
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,431
Sincerely...

139
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,533
<i>Affectionately...</i>

140
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,938
Would it be all right
if I just signed my name?

141
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,406
Oh, of course.

142
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:52,644
It's not the words,
but the thought that counts.

143
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,579
Miss Heinrich is
visiting from Berlin

144
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:55,747
with her aunt.

145
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,050
Doesn't know a soul in town.

146
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,854
There are many
young people here.

147
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,622
She won't be lonely.

148
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,197
Well, thank you,
Mr. Grimm. You're very kind.

149
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,265
Not at all.

150
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,835
Jacob!

151
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,404
Jacob, look,
I want to talk to you!

152
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,339
My brother Wilhelm,
miss Greta Heinrich.

153
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,440
Delighted.

154
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,675
Mr. Grimm.

155
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,843
Wilhelm.
Stossel.

156
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,712
I do hope we'll see
each other again.

157
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,947
It's inevitable.

158
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,048
Oh, really?

159
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,716
In such a small town,

160
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,018
one's always seeing
everyone else.

161
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,287
Oh. Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

162
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,356
Good-bye.

163
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,556
Good-bye, miss Heinrich.

164
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,127
Thanks very much for coming in.

165
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,628
Good day,
Mr. Stossel.

166
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,734
Well, what's the matter?

167
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,303
Your muttonhead brother. I
introduce him to a charming girl

168
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,740
who goes out of her way
to buy one of his dull books.

169
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,509
To<i> you</i> they may be dull.

170
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,977
To everyone!
Look here.

171
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,812
<i>German grammar, volume 1.</i>

172
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,747
German grammar, volume 2.

173
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,749
<i>Analysis of German grammar.</i>

174
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:05,850
Pfff!

175
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,419
As a good friend,
I give them space.

176
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,955
As a better friend,
I say to you:

177
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,590
Write books people will buy!

178
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,626
Write about girls!

179
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,994
Oh, about... you mean...

180
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:19,764
No, I mean about...
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

181
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,167
But what do I know about girls?

182
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,746
Nothing. About
everything that's important,

183
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,436
you know nothing.

184
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,706
Stossel, don't you dare
talk to my brother like that!

185
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,609
Jacob is the wisest,
most kind, most generous...

186
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,244
Where is the bread?

187
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,646
The bread? Oh, yes.

188
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,448
Jacob, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

189
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,883
So you bought another story

190
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,318
from that villainous
flower vendor,

191
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,086
and the bread money is gone.

192
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,889
Just this once, if you will lend
me some money, I promise...

193
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,691
Well, I swear...

194
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,694
Word of honor, never again.

195
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:58,002
You see? He's
a prince among men!

196
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,538
He's a fool!

197
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,875
Next to you,
the biggest fool in the world!

198
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,211
But it's not too late to change.

199
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,379
For me, for your dearest friend,

200
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,082
please...
Write about girls.

201
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,252
Jacob, write about girls...

202
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,032
We are already 57 minutes late.

203
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,101
I hope you have an explanation.

204
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,271
Have you ever known me when
I haven't had an explanation?

205
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,806
Look, the reason we're late...

206
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,075
Is we stopped to buy our roses.

207
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,343
<i>We</i> stopped?
<i>Our</i> roses?

208
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,345
After all, you paid for them.

209
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,648
Besides, you stopped to force
your attentions on a pretty girl.

210
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,350
I paid for the bread.

211
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,752
Oh, no, no.
I insist, I insist.

212
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,221
You take half the
credit for the roses...

213
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,457
And half the blame
for being late.

214
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,525
Daddy, daddy!

215
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,094
Wait till you hear
what happened!

216
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,462
Come on! Come on!

217
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,530
Oh... oh!

218
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,267
Oh, help! Help, help!
Savages! Mad dogs!

219
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,570
Help! Save me!
Ooh! Aha, aha!

220
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,339
Now, my little pretties,
it's my turn!

221
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,742
I'll make you pay
and pay dearly!

222
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,510
I'll grind your bones

223
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,613
and snip off his arm!

224
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,284
And for you, my dear,

225
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,618
I have other plans.

226
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,587
Where have you been...

227
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,523
For one whole hour that
dinner's been kept waiting?

228
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,959
What kept you?
What's this, Wilhelm?

229
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:31,729
A tribute to your kind,
sweet, gentle, beauteous...

230
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,731
Where's the bread?

231
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,434
Bread? What bread?

232
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,538
Children, go and wash
your hands, will you?

233
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,008
I gave you money for bread,

234
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,177
instead of which you
come back with... shh!

235
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,380
What am I to do? I don't have two children,
I have...

236
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,649
Jacob, you should know better.

237
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,685
We've barely enough money for...

238
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,119
For bread.

239
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,690
You didn't forget the bread.

240
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,859
No, dorothea, he didn't forget.

241
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,194
And don't you forget...

242
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:07,198
Man does not live
by bread alone.

243
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,334
That's a strange
sentiment from you.

244
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,171
It's not from me.
It's from the Bible.

245
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,173
And from stossel's bookshop.

246
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,777
You see, a young lady came in
and bought one of his books today...

247
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,813
Asked him to write in it.

248
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,182
A very beautiful
young lady, eh, Jacob?

249
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,683
I... I didn't notice.

250
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,452
Well, she obviously noticed<i> you.</i>

251
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,054
What was her name?
Do I know her?

252
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,056
Um...

253
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,624
Rita Albrecht.

254
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,326
Greta Heinrich.

255
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,495
You see, that's our Jacob boy...

256
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,431
Can't remember a face,
but never forgets a name.

257
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,267
If dinner is ready,
why don't we eat?

258
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,169
Oh, right away.

259
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,674
They're lovely.

260
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,909
They're just lovely.

261
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,480
It's my turn.

262
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,215
It is not!
It's my turn.

263
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,683
It was your turn yesterday!

264
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,318
No, it was<i> your</i> turn yesterday.

265
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,153
How could it be your turn today

266
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,421
if it was yours yesterday?!

267
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,655
Children!

268
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,192
You may share the honor.

269
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,229
Bless us, o lord,
and these, thy gifts,

270
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,399
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

271
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,834
Gruber... that shriveled husk!

272
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,837
He doesn't know the
meaning of the word "happy."

273
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,740
And as for our gracious patron,
the noble Duke...

274
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,876
Someone might hear
you and tell him.

275
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,944
Good! It might
reduce his bloated ego.

276
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,681
Might also throw us out of this house,
which he gives us rent-free.

277
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,283
Might also put you in jail.

278
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,218
You're right...
And so are you.

279
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,754
The Duke doesn't want scholars,
he wants toadies...

280
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,357
To sing the glories of
his illustrious name...

281
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,361
So that he can be a toady
to the king of prussia.

282
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,230
However, we need the money,
so to work.

283
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,666
No, Jacob, I'll go to work.

284
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,602
I'm going to make up
for the borrowed time.

285
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,704
Don't look so surprised.

286
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,440
I'm a reformed man.

287
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,647
Well, don't disturb
the children.

288
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,252
The children would be
wise not to disturb<i> me.</i>

289
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,825
What was he doing to make gruber angry,
hmm?

290
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,695
Jacob, what was he doing?

291
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,666
Just being himself.

292
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,206
Not here.

293
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,809
Now, let me see...
They must be there.

294
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,846
Fooled you!
We fooled you!

295
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,549
Shh! Now, that's enough.
Into bed. Come on.

296
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,185
And to sleep, instantly.
Come on, come on.

297
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,020
We want a story.

298
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,488
No, absolutely not.

299
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,257
Oh, papa, just one?

300
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,092
No. No more stories.

301
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,995
No more stories?!
Not<i> never?</i>

302
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,864
"Not never"?
Not<i> ever.</i>

303
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,267
You should be studying
your grammar.

304
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,569
"Not never"! Why,
that's atrocious grammar.

305
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,104
Well, grammar's too hard.

306
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,739
Nothing's too hard,
son, nothing.

307
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,542
If you want it badly
enough, you'll get it.

308
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,843
Now, remember the woodsman?

309
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,689
What he wanted was
impossible. Nevertheless, he...

310
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:41,713
What woodsman?

311
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,981
Well, you know... the woodsman

312
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,715
who lived in the forest
all alone.

313
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,651
What did he want so badly?

314
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,619
How did he get it?

315
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,389
Well, it happened that on
a day... a very special day...

316
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,558
He decided to embark
on a great adventure,

317
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,227
a journey far from the
forest that was his home.

318
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,796

Come in.

325
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,620
Good morning, dear gypsy!

326
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:23,955
I've come to bid...

327
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,923
Bid me good-bye.

328
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,592
Who told you?

329
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,193
The cards.

330
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,829
Who else would ever speak to me?

331
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,332
What else did they tell you?

332
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,601
That your purse is empty...

333
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,970
And your heart's
full to overflowing.

334
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,205
With love for you!

335
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:45,276
No, not for me,
but for the king's daughter...

336
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,012
The loveliest flower
in all the land.

337
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,215
And you hope to win this flower.

338
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,484
I shall try.
Good-bye, gypsy.

339
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,620
Woodsman, wait!

340
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,189
I have something for you.

341
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:03,127
No one has ever given me
a word of kindness but you.

342
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,829
When others have scoffed,

343
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,398
you alone have smiled.

344
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,767
Give me one smile in return,
and I'll be happy.

345
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,802
That you shall have...

346
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,472
And something more.

347
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,744
Hold out your hand.

348
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,313
Hold out your hand!

349
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,549
Now you see it...

350
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,418
And now you don't.

351
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,453
My hand!

352
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,423
Take this cloak of invisibility.

353
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,359
It will hide you
from men's greed

354
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,129
and protect you from their envy.

355
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,798
Will it help me
to win the Princess?

356
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:45,002
That you'll never know
until you try.

357
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:52,176
You'll need this, too.

358
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,882
Thank you.

359
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,299
Bye, gypsy!

360
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,204
♪ I dream of
winning a Princess ♪

361
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:23,374
♪ dreaming
a Princess is mine ♪

362

363
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:34,485
♪ dreaming with love

364
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:49,867
He bows very well, doesn't he?

365
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,870
Oh, very well, indeed!

366
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:56,974
Stop it, stop it,
stop it. That's enough.

367
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,576
Who are you?

368
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,745
No, no, no, let me guess.

369
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,814
You are a prince in disguise.

370
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,050
Duke?

371
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,184
Baron?

372
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,053
Varlet?

373
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,122
Knave?

374
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,456
Your majesty...

375
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,625
I'm just a humble woodsman.

376
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:18,396
Oh, that's wonderful!
That's marvelous!

377
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,563
A woodsman!

378
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,434
That means that you are
accustomed to the ax!

379
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,536
Ha! "To the ax"!

380
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,419
Uh, the rules.

381
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,256
Ahem.

382
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,357
"He who..."

383
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,591
Discovers how my daughter...

384
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,904
"Walks holes
through her slippers

385
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,194
every night..."

386
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,096
Without telling me
how she does it.

387
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,964
I tell you, another
pair every night.

388
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,167
It costs me a fortune!

389
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,902
Uh, proceed.

390
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,671
"He who discovers the
why and wherefore..."

391
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,106
Gets half my kingdom.

392
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,408
Oh, yes... and the Princess, too.

393
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,845
Now... tell him
the bad part.

394
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,214
"Whoever shall
try and fail..."

395
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,616
As all others have
tried and failed,

396
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,486
shall have his head separated
from his body for evermore.

397
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,488
Aah!

398
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,926
That's the good part, really.

399
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,328
But please, my daughter's
very sensitive.

400
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,996
Promise you won't tell her?

401
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,499
Cross my heart and hope to die.

402
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,267
Oh, delicious!

403
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,336
Ha ha! Delightful!

404
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,911
Ha! Good luck, woodsman,
but remember...

405
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,681
Don't lose your head!

406
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,917
Ha ha! "Don't lose
your head"!

407
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:22,553
Ooh, he is
the handsomest by far!

408
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,955
Don't you want to look,
your highness?

409
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,726
Certainly not. Fetch
the sleeping potion.

410
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,537
Good evening, woodsman.

411
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,238
You may rise.

412
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,944
Here's some warmth for the long,
cold night ahead.

413
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,317
Is something wrong?

414
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:58,389
Yes. Yes,
I expected you to be beautiful.

415
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,723
Am I not?

416
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,426
Oh, no, Princess.
You're divine.

417
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,170
Well, uh... Cheers!

418
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,313
Ahh!

419
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,382
Well, we certainly don't get

420
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,518
wine like this in the forest!

421
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,186
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

422
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,422
Well, good night, woodsman.

423
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,994
Excuse me.

424
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,273
Pleasant dreams, woodsman.

425
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,749
Don't forget...
Return before dawn!

426
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:02,853
Or the king will
surely find out.

427
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,772
Aah!

428
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,832
Coachman!
Have you seen him?

429
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,567
A man with a mask.

430
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,903
No, Princess,
I have seen no one,

431
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,616
but there is another man
waiting at the castle

432
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,040
that you must marry
if you are late.

433
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,087
Giddyap!

434
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,030
Giddyap!

435
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,465
Hah!

436
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,870
Giddyap!

437
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,672
Hah!

438
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,352
Hah! Hah!

439
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,150
Hah!

440
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,320
Hah! Hah!

441
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,459
Pllllt!

442
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,124
Giddyap!

443
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,359
Hah!

444
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,350
You tried and you failed.

445
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,918
How sad. Too bad.

446
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:15,986
Get to work.

447
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,487
Just a moment!

448
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,022
Your majesty,

449
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,358
I know how the Princess
wears holes in her slippers.

450
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,693
I don't believe it... not a word!

451
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:28,331
<i>Princess!</i>

452
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,433
Where does she walk?

453
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,436
Nowhere. She
dances... All night.

454
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,312
Fiddlesticks!

455
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,381
Alone in her bedroom?

456
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,016
No. She goes through
a hidden door

457
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,451
and then rides this carriage...

458
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,253
Ooh! Ooh!
I've got you now.

459
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,288
I know every hidden
door, secret room,

460
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,990
and sliding palace in the panel.

461
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,692
Uh, panel in the pal...

462
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,561
Botheration!
Off with his head!

463
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,232
Wait a minute, now!

464
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,733
Unh! Unh!

465
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,435
Now, wait a minute!

466
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,804
Let me explain! You wouldn't... oh,
yes, you would!

467
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,875
I'm the king, you fool!

468
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,411
Now, let me show you.

469
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:24,154
Nobody tells me anything!

470
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,823
You see? He guessed
your secret...

471
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,359
Every night,
dancing and prancing!

472
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:33,062
I'd love to dance,
but nobody asks me.

473
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,998
Well, a bargain is a bargain,

474
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,634
so now we'll have
a great big party!

475
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,203
There'll be no party! I
shall never marry him!

476
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,039
Tut, tut, tut, tut,
my girl. You're not the king.

477
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,341
You're only a Princess,
which isn't as good.

478
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,577
Besides, I gave my word.

479
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,913
And last night,
I gave my heart...

480
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,347
To a stranger.

481
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,508
And they lived
happily ever after.

482
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,906
Shh!

483
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:39,122
Well... I gave them
a severe talking-to

484
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,757
about their grammar.

485
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,191
Mm-hmm.

486
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,228
Well, I told them one story.

487
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,063
A story that will
give them nightmares?

488
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,232
Oh, no, no, it was
a beautiful story...

489
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:50,945
About the dancing
Princess and the woodsman.

490
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,368
You mean the tailor.

491
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,738
Tailor? The way you heard it,
it was a tailor?

492
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:59,042
The way I heard it,
you were a reformed man.

493
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,510
Well, you aren't.

494
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,580
You're absolutely
beyond redemption.

495
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,383
All I can say for you is...

496
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,118
I love you.

497
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:17,894
I, uh...
I have work to do.

498
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,834
The work is almost done.

499
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,269
Go to bed.

500
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,974
What is your object...
To make me feel guilty?

501
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:35,211
My object is to finish this
wretched thing on time.

502
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,779
Mm-hmm.

503
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,116
By the way...

504
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,785
You remember the story
of the dancing Princess.

505
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:45,688
Whom did she marry...
A woodsman or a tailor?

506
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,889
A farmer.

507
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,658
A farmer?

508
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:52,929
An honest, conscientious,
hardworking farmer.

509
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,199
A farmer.

510
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,967
It was a fisherman.

511
00:43:58,036 --> 00:43:59,535
A fish...

512
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,371
How do you know?

513
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,706
Because I'm a man
of infinite wisdom

514
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:06,309
who has heard the story
a thousand times.

515
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:07,610
But that's terrible!

516
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,713
Tailor, woodsman,
farmer, fisherman.

517
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,382
4 different versions.

518
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,783
Now, isn't that terrible?

519
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,619
It is terrible.
Come on.

520
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,588
You know, that proves my point.

521
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,556
These stories
should be written down.

522
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,625
Better you should
write about girls.

523
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,733
Talking about girls,
this Greta Heinrich...

524
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:31,802
Yeah?

525
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,337
Will you tell her
something for me?

526
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:37,974
Wilhelm!

527
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:39,442
We'll be late!

528
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,644
I'll be there!

529
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,079
I'll be delighted!

530
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,784
It was a delicious
dinner, Mrs. Grimm.

531
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,385
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

532
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:50,853
Won't you sit here,
miss Heinrich?

533
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,321
Oh, thank you.

534
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:03,966
We hope, miss Heinrich...
Jacob and all of us...

535
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,935
That you like our town.

536
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,837
Oh, I do.

537
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,639
The people are so friendly.

538
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,108
It must seem very quiet to you

539
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,476
after living in Berlin.

540
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,912
Still,
we hope... Jacob and all of us...

541
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,547
That you won't hurry away.

542
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:20,216
Well,
it was to have been just a short visit,

543
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,885
but I wouldn't mind
staying indefinitely.

544
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,000
Wilhelm, it's getting late.

545
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,388
Thea, get the children.
It's time to go to bed.

546
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:27,023
Now, say good-night
to miss Heinrich.

547
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,191
Good night, miss Heinrich.

548
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:29,259
Good night, uncle Jacob.

549
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:30,259
Good night, uncle Jacob.

550
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:31,328
That's right.

551
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,795
Come on, off you go to sleep.

552
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:33,996
Run along.

553
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,265
Your children
are charming, Mr. Grimm.

554
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:38,034
Thank you.

555
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,603
Children are a speciality
of the grimm family.

556
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:43,239
We hope that yours will be equally as,
uh...

557
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,743
Yes, well, uh...
Ahem.

558
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,912
It's getting late. I think I'll go on up,
too.

559
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,049
Oh, stay! And talk
awhile with us.

560
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:55,952
Tell miss Heinrich
one of your stories.

561
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,121
Wilhelm has a very
fertile imagination.

562
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,189
Oh, really?

563
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,990
Oh, yes. You would
hardly believe

564
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,658
what fantastic thoughts
occur to him.

565
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:03,760
Go ahead, Wilhelm.

566
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,562
Let us have one of your stories.

567
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,333
Funny... I just can't
seem to remember any.

568
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,436
Oh, they come and go, slip away.

569
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,104
It's a pity there isn't

570
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,973
someone to write them down.

571
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,908
Oh, well.

572
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,544
Good night...
Good night.

573
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:30,686
It was most kind of you
to take pity on a stranger

574
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:32,188
and invite me here.

575
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:37,160
To be honest,
it was not I who invited you.

576
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,728
I thought...

577
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,631
Well, that is, I was
given the impression

578
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,299
that it was your idea.

579
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,500
Say yes!

580
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,302
In all honesty, no.

581
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,237
It's a rare experience,
Mr. Grimm,

582
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,073
to meet a man so honest.

583
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,143
I shan't inquire whether
you wish to take me home,

584
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,711
but since it's getting late...

585
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,380
But, uh, honesty, miss Heinrich,

586
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:59,348
requires the whole truth.

587
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,517
Although it was not my idea,

588
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:05,021
I'm very glad
you were invited here...

589
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:08,558
Equally glad that you accepted.

590
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:12,161
Tell me about
your work, Mr. Grimm.

591
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,596
Oh, I...

592
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,531
No, Jacob!
Don't, please!

593
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,467
I'd like to ask you a question,
miss Heinrich...

594
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:22,205
A rather personal question.

595
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,941
How did you like my book?

596
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,043
Oh, I was enchanted.

597
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,544
Enchanted?

598
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:30,880
By <i>legal antiquities?</i>

599
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,815
Oh, well, the subject
isn't important.

600
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:35,484
I beg your pardon?

601
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,464
What enchanted me was the
tremendous knowledge and intelligence

602
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,655
it took to write such a book.

603
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:44,694
Forgive me, Mr. Grimm,
but I must be honest, too.

604
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:48,164
You are a brilliantly
fascinating man.

605
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,365
Nonsense!

606
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:50,633
I'm a conscientious scholar

607
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:53,469
dedicated to his
work, that's all.

608
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,538
Aah!

609
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:01,811
<i>Gruber!</i>

610
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,147
Your grace,
if this portrait is to grace the cover

611
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,883
of your grace's family history,

612
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:09,819
may I ask that your
grace face this way...

613
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,087
And smile?

614
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:15,758
Gruber!

615
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:17,460
Sir?

616
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,762
You've finished reading it,
your grace?

617
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:21,264
Have the brothers grimm

618
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,165
done you proper justice,
your grace?

619
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,034
Are you pleased, your grace?

620
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:28,638
You're very good at asking
questions. Now answer one:

621
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,140
<i>Do I look pleased?!</i>

622
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,241
Ooh!

623
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,844
Get those brothers
and bring them here!

624
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,057
Stossel!

625
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,760
You've always been a good,
true, loyal, and dear friend.

626
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:52,261
Uh, good morning, dear ladies.

627
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,398
Now I'm going to give
you a chance to prove it.

628
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,167
May I prove it later? I'm
waiting on these dear ladies.

629
00:48:58,236 --> 00:48:59,735
What are they looking for?

630
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,337
Mr. Stossel
knows my tastes.

631
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,439
Who doesn't?
Ah! Just the thing.

632
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:05,174
<i>History of the hundred
years' war...</i>

633
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,376
Every page reeking
with blood and Gore.

634
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,945
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

635
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,446
Really, Wilhelm, come on!

636
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:13,316
Listen! We've just finished
writing the Duke's family history.

637
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,585
Now I can concentrate on
collecting and writing stories!

638
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,853
Stories about girls?

639
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,655
Oh, stossel, you worry me.

640
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:22,124
A priceless literary
heritage is dying.

641
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:24,193
Now, listen, if these
wonderful fairy tales

642
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,695
aren't written down
and published,

643
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:26,896
they'll soon be forgotten.

644
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,898
Now, look, you know
a man called vantino.

645
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,444
Vantino,
yes... the foremost publisher of Berlin.

646
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,734
That's right.

647
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,836
A good, true,
and loyal friend. Yes, yes.

648
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:37,106
I'm sure he'd agree that
you are a complete loony.

649
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,774
Who'd want such a book?

650
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,210
Anyone with a desire
to be happy.

651
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:43,045
<i>I</i> would.

652
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,114
<i>They</i> would!

653
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,415
They? Who are they?

654
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,185
You, you, you,
and you. Come on! Come inside!

655
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:54,223
Really, they should lock him up.

656
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,125
Shh! Now... Now,
don't be frightened.

657
00:49:56,194 --> 00:50:00,663
I just want to ask you: Do
you want a book of fairy tales?

658
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:01,732
No, sir.

659
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,299
Of course you do!
Why not?

660
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:04,433
I can't read.

661
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,402
Well, you can hear,
can't you? Yes.

662
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,471
All right, then...

663
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,206
Ah, ah! Come here!

664
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,909
Wilhelm, what are you doing?

665
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,084
Sit down.

666
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,619
Madam...

667
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,988
My<i> dear!</i>

668
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,158
If you please.

669
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,561
And not another word
out of anyone!

670
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,263
Now, listen...

671
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,935
Once upon a time...

672
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,271
There was a cobbler...

673
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,207
An old, old cobbler.

674
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:48,411
He had snowy-white hair,

675
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:51,147
a big, thick mustache,

676
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:55,151
and bushy eyebrows riding
on a sea of wrinkles.

677
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:02,658
He worked very hard,
day in and day out.

678
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,996
But for various reasons,
his customers were not pleased.

679
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:24,780
Cobbler!

680
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,215
Yes? The mayor!

681
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,017
Are my shoes ready?

682
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,351
Not yet, your excellency.

683
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,786
Not yet?!

684
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,122
Why, the king's Christmas
party is tomorrow afternoon.

685
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:36,358
If my shoes aren't ready,
it will go hard with you!

686
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,360
To be sure, your worship, but...

687
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,764
No buts! I shall return
tomorrow morning... Early!

688
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:47,369
I'll try my very best.

My slippers, they are finished,
dear cobbler?

698
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,559
Are they? Are they?
Are they?

699
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,929
Regretfully, I've been so busy...

700
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,466
Without my slippers,
how am I to dance for the king?

701
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:52,168
I'll try, your ballerina ship.

702
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:56,105
If I do not dance,
the king will be mad with rage.

703
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,008
And I would hate to see you...

704
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:02,144
Boiled in oil.

705
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,346
Ah...

706
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:07,716
I would not care
much for that myself.

707
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,830
Cobbler!

708
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,471
Your... your hunting boots,
I know, but...

709
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,674
They're not quite
ready yet. I hope...

710
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,376
If they're not by tomorrow,

711
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,413
instead of hunting wild pig
for the king's table...

712
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:40,816
I'll be hunting tame cobbler.

713
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,284
You understand?!

714
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,354
Yes, your marksmanship.

715
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,429
Aah...

716
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,618
I suppose you're going to
the king's birthday party, too.

717
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,119
No.

718
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:19,288
We came to sing for you.

719
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:20,456
Why?!

720
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,624
'Cause you like us.

721
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,626
Do not!

722
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,628
Why don't you, um...

723
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,730
Get jobs or get married?

724
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:30,532
Nobody asked me.

725
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,035
Well, then, go and see
your good-luck elf.

726
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,437
They handle those
things for you.

727
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,873
Orphans don't have
good-luck elves.

728
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,508
Nonsense!

729
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,710
<i>Everybody's</i> got good-luck elves!

730
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,312
If you don't believe in them,

731
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,214
they won't come to you.

732
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:48,217
I'll, uh... I'll tell you
about it sometime.

733
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,219
Now, go home.
I'm busy...

734
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,588
Very, very busy.
Go home.

735
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,937
You do like us, don't you?

736
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,507
Do<i> not.</i>

737
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:12,875
Do, too.

738
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,143
Do<i> not!</i>

739
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,178
You've got to,

740
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:18,947
'cause nobody else does.

741
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,482
Ah! Ah!

742
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,884
Well, I'm up.

743
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:02,024
All right!
I said I'm up!

744
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:06,195
But... why?

745
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,331
What?

746
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,600
Why, what?

747
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,435
Why am I up?

748
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,038
Um, ask him.

749
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,743
Hey, why am I up?

750
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,778
How should<i> I</i> know?

751
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,214
Why am I up?

752
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,119
Because it's Christmas Eve.

753
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,455
Aha!

754
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:34,857
I've got it!

755
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,459
He's got it!

756
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,495
He can have it!

757
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,030
Christmas is the time
for good cheer.

758
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,799
Good cheer is what we bring,

759
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,534
because we're good-luck elves.

760
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:48,437
I'd rather be a bad-luck elf!

761
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:50,406
Why?

762
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,208
'Cause he gave me a crooked mouth,
<i>that's</i> why!

763
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:55,310
Don't you like your mouth?

764
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,311
No!

765
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Then keep it shut!

766
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,649
Unless those shoes
are finished by morning,

767
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,818
he's in terrible trouble!

768
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,654
Good!
Serves him right!

769
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,423
Get to work.
Everybody!

770
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,259
Get to work.

771
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,927
Begin.

772
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,762
Get busy.

773
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:15,264
Commence!

774
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:16,632
Go!

775
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,167
What's wrong?

776
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,769
How do you fix shoes?

777
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:23,105
Ah... ooh.

778
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:26,041

Cobbler! Open up!

Blast you, cobbler!
My hunting boots!

Open up!
Cobbler!

850
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,187
Open the door!
I need my shoes!

851
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:34,656
Oh, my dancing slippers!
They<i> must</i> be ready!

852
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:36,658
Uh, ladies and gentlemen...

853
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:39,428
Your worship,
your ballerina ship,

854
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,229
your marksmanship...

855
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,665
Um,
I'm afraid you're not going to like

856
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,400
what I have to tell you.

857
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,335
Just what do you mean by<i> that?</i>

858
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:50,172
Well, uh, you see, it's, um...

859
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,340
Ahem.
It's Christmas.

860
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,409
And, uh, some people...

861
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,912
Little people, but very,
very important people...

862
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,748
Were forgotten, so
I decided that, uh,

863
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:02,651
since it<i> was</i>
Christmas that I would...

864
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,394
Oh!

865
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:14,229
How beautiful!

866
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,797
Wonderful!

867
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:18,900
Good and sturdy,
cobbler! Ha ha...

868
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,302
You had me worried,

869
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,803
old rogue!

870
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:24,072
There you are, my man!
Well done! Heh heh!

871
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,474
Thank you.

872
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,809
Twice your usual price, cobbler,

873
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:30,045
and a merry Christmas to you.

874
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,481
Well, a merry Christmas
to you, your lordship.

875
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,483
I shall dance like a Princess,

876
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:36,718

it's all because of you.

877
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,755

01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:32,601
Yes.

902
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:33,669
Where's Jacob?

903
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:34,736
In the park with Greta.

904
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:36,171
Would you like...

905
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,973
Would you like
a whole<i> book</i> of stories?

906
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Uh-huh.

907
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,709
You would?
You really would?

908
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:41,810
Oh, marvelous, marvelous!

909
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,144
Bless you!

910
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,213
Just a minute.

911
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,481
How much money have you got?

912
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,716
None.

913
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,417
You?
None.

914
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:50,418
How about you?

915
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,153
One kreutzer.

916
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,555
One kreutzer.

917
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,090
Out, out!
All of you!

918
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,559
Now, stossel!

919
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:59,961
Write about girls, please?

920
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,530
Wilhelm, the Duke wants
to see you<i> and</i> Jacob!

921
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,099
Oh, but where is Jacob?

922
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,234
In the park with Greta.

923
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,004
Oh, yes, yes!
That's right!

924
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,073
Oh, can't you think
of anything except money?

925
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,942
And<i> girls,</i> at your age... really!

926
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,377
Wilhelm!

927
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:17,513
Oh...

928
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,863
Jacob!

929
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,197
Jacob!

930
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,477
Jacob! The Duke...
He sent for us!

931
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:39,935
Excuse me, Greta.
But-mbut you're not Greta.

932
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,836
I thought you said you were t

933
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,573
terribly sorry

934
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,375
excuse me
um.

935
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:16,104
I khangt e qec@iemee

936
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,106
well, the question?

937
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,941
Will you marry me?

938
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,509
When?

939
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:23,511
"When"?
You mean you will?

940
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,013
Well, of course!

941
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:26,614
Without even thinking?

942
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:29,184
Oh, Jacob,
the first time I saw you,

943
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,953
I knew I was going
to fall in love with you.

944
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,822
Amazing.

945
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,524
I<i> have</i> fallen in love with you,

946
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,626
and more than anything
in the world

947
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,862
I would like to marry you.

948
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:43,398
Are there any more questions?

949
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,201
Just one...

950
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,802
May I kiss you?

951
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:49,637
Of course.

952
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,072
Very well.

953
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,927
Jacob! Jacob,
the Duke...

954
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,229
He wants to see us right away!

955
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,775
Excuse me,
Greta. We are going to be married.

956
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,432
I'm terribly
sorry. Come on!

957
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,167
Ma-married?

958
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:20,335
Oh! Oh, that's
wonderful!

959
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:21,936
Oh! Oh!
I'm so pleased!

960
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:23,872
Mmm! Come on!

961
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,845
Correct me if I'm wrong.

962
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:33,748
By the terms of your
contract, you guaranteed

963
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,785
to write a complete and
accurate history of my family:

964
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,186
Notable deeds,

965
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,789
meritorious service
in war and peace, et cetera.

966
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:41,990
That is correct.

967
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:44,025
I said correct me if I'm wrong.

968
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,362
Said family history to be
dedicated and presented

969
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:50,265
to his majesty,
the king of prussia...

970
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,134
On the forthcoming
anniversary of his coronation.

971
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,540
What are you doing?

972
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:01,810
Um... just sneezing,
your grace.

973
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,079
Don't touch that.
It's priceless.

974
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:06,147
Yes, sir.

975
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:09,050
Uh, this is
the complete history?

976
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,152
Yes, your grace,
and may I point out

977
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,720
that we finished two days early?

978
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,322
May<i> I</i> point out
you've chopped off

979
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,491
one whole branch of my family...

980
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,759
The rheinburg branch...

981
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,761
Represented by my third cousin,

982
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,663
baron ulrich of rheinburg?!

983
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,831
Yes, sir, but I thought...

984
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,099
I don't pay you to think!

985
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:25,167
I pay you to write!

986
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,668
Uh, in point of fact, sir,

987
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,636
you haven't paid us at all.

988
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,774
Ah! The minstrel
speaks...

989
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:36,244
That tale-teller,
who steals my time

990
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:37,779
to collect frogs and dogs,

991
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:39,180
hags and dragons!

992
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,015
Haven't paid you, eh?

993
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:43,818
Have I given you a house
for 6 months, renthfree?

We'll be back at work
first thing in the morning.

1003
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,228
First thing in the morning,

1004
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:29,330
you'll take the boat
to rheinburg.

1005
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,499
In the cathedral archives,

1006
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:33,668
you'll find all names and dates.

1007
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,971
Baron ulrich himself
will correct all lies.

1008
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,008
But... but this is very
difficult for us, sir.

1009
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,177
We have only two days
left and I doubt

1010
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:43,678
that we can finish on time.

1011
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,780
Oh, you will,
because if you don't,

1012
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,415
I will throw you
out of your house

1013
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,184
and into debtors' prison,

1014
01:09:49,252 --> 01:09:51,519
where I will make it
difficult for you

1015
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,389
beyond anything you can
possibly imagine!

1016
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,026
What are you doing?!

1017
01:09:58,094 --> 01:09:59,861
I'm... I'm so sorry, your grace.

1018
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:00,862
Go!

1019
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,363
Purely unintentional,
your grace.

1020
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,399
Go! I apologize, your grace.

1021
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:05,467
Go!

1022
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:08,870

Go directly to the church

1043
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,591
and talk to the priest
in charge of the archives.

1044
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,759
Look! It's
a festival tree!

1045
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,027
It<i> is</i> a celebration!

1046
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:29,197
Pardon me, but what
are we celebrating?

1047
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:30,698
I said what are we celebrating?

1048
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,033
It's a wine festival.

1049
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:34,702
It's a wine festival!
Did you hear that?

1050
01:14:34,771 --> 01:14:35,848
And did you hear what<i> I</i> said?

1051
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:38,439
Yes. Go to the church,
talk to the priest,

1052
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,275
collect all important data on the
rheinburg branch of the family...

1053
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,544
Especially anything relating
to the king of prussia...

1054
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,646
And report back here
at 5:00.

1055
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:47,882
Thank you very much!

1056
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:49,984
Here you are. Not
at all. Not at all.

1057
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:51,452
Thank you very much!

1058
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,956
It's a pleasure. It's an
absolute pleasure. I...

1059
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:57,024
The<i> boat</i> leaves at 5:00.

1060
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,826
We must be on it.
Remember<i> that.</i>

1061
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,862
Don't worry. I never
forget a thing.

1062
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,600
Wilhelm!

1063
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:06,868
Thank you, sir.

1064
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,536
Thank you.

1065
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,438
I'm very grateful, father.

1066
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:46,547
It's been a pleasure
delving into the past with you.

1067
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,509
You were bored
to death, Mr. Grimm,

1068
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,177
and I respect you for it.

1069
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:53,548
Nothing is quite so dull as digging
up obscure names and dates

1070
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:56,250
which should be allowed
to rest in oblivion.

1071
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,488
Give me young,
<i>living</i> voices singing Mozart.

1072
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:36,190
Father.

1073
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:38,359
Pay no attention.
Today is Friday.

1074
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:39,860
Friday?

1075
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,563
Oh, yes, yes.
So it is.

1076
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:51,606
Every Friday, long
as anyone can remember,

1077
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:55,209
the children of rheinburg have
been invited to visit otta richte.

1078
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,545
There are some
who call her a witch.

1079
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,081
Do you believe
in witches, Mr. Grimm?

1080
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,382
Witches?

1081
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,751
Oh,
you don't? I should have thought you did.

1082
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,753
Well, uh...

1083
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:07,254
Yes. As a matter
of fact, I, uh...

1084
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:08,889
She's no witch.

1085
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,726
She only has the power
to bewitch and beguile,

1086
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:15,062
create a world of beauty
that even Mozart would envy.

1087
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,765
She tells the most wonderful
fairy tales ever heard.

1088
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,200
Fairy tales!

1089
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,068
Is, um, is<i> that</i>
where they're going?

1090
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,738
Ahem. Shh.

1091
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,276
Father...

1092
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,911
When I was his age,

1093
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,514
I used to do the same
thing every Friday.

1094
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,616
I'd gladly do it
again right now,

1095
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:37,518
but it's too late.

1096
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:40,221
Only children are invited.

1097
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:42,790
Um...

1098
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,692
Well, I... I must be going.

1099
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:46,861
You've been most helpful.
A million thanks.

1100
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,362
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

1101
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,565
What do you want?

1102
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:05,800
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1103
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:07,513
My name is Wilhelm grimm.
I've heard that you...

1104
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,603
You have heard that
I'm a witch, I suppose,

1105
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:11,450
and you've come to scoff
and jeer, like everybody else.

1106
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:12,807
No, quite the contrary.

1107
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,042
If I may, I'd very much
like to come inside...

1108
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:16,043
I won't have it.

1109
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,411
Go away.

1110
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,679
Oh!

1111
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:21,816
Your foot is in my door.

1112
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:24,385
Yes, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

1113
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,587
Might I just come in
and sit quietly and listen...

1114
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:28,022
Children only.

1115
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,590
Oh, but I'm much
younger than I look.

1116
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:30,659
Uh, people tell me...

1117
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,836
You, little monkey...
You were late.

1118
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:44,071
My mama made me take a nap.

1119
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,940
Well, I hope it did you good.

1120
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:48,776
Now, my young scamps,

1121
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:49,845
what shall we have?

1122
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:55,716
Settle down, settle down.

1123
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,487
Which of you would
like to laugh today?

1124
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,126
I can see you'd rather
I made your blood run cold.

1125
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,929
Yes! Scary,
scary story!

1126
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,133
Very well. A scary story
it shall be.

1127
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,635
Shh.

1128
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:22,009
Once upon a time...

1129
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,647
Long, long ago
in a faraway land,

1130
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:30,351
there lived a huge
and fearful dragon.

1131
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:34,388
He was as tall as the tallest
tree in the forest.

1132
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:37,825
When he walked,
it was an earthquake!

1133
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:41,829
When he breathed, a forest fire.

1134
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:45,099
All the people lived in terror
of this monstrous beast

1135
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:48,702
who had invaded their land
from no one knew where.

1136
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:52,006
He ate up their crops,
devoured their cattle,

1137
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:55,276
and carried off all the young
children to his lair.

1138
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:56,510
What for?

1139
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,279
Dessert.

1140
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:00,347
Oh.

1141
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,815
Didn't anyone try to stop him?

1142
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,250
Of course, they did!

1143
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:05,286
King sent north, south,
east, and west,

1144
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:07,388
offering half his kingdom
to anyone who would

1145
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:09,690
come and slay
this horrible beast.

1146
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:12,626
Many came to try
and earn the reward,

1147
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:14,995
but the dragon sizzled them...

1148
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:17,131
Then he frizzled them.

1149
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,799
Then he gobbled them up!

1150
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:22,903
And he picked his teeth
with their bones.

1151
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:28,809
Now it happened,
one fine day, that two men...

1152
01:22:28,878 --> 01:22:30,911
A knight named Ludwig

1153
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,813
and his servant hans...

1154
01:22:32,882 --> 01:22:36,917

All right, lad.
In you go.

1185
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:16,016
I'll stay here
and protect your rear.

1186
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:18,452
That will take a bit of doing.

1187
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,734
Go on, go on!

1188
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:45,746
Go on, you silly sausage!

1189
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,406
Is he there?

1190
01:25:12,475 --> 01:25:15,175
Speak up, pudding brain!

1191
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:18,779
Oh, he seems
to have gone, master!

1192
01:25:18,848 --> 01:25:19,848
Aha!

1193
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:22,716
Well, let me at him!

1194
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,291
Charge!

1195
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:44,739
Ouch!

1196
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:05,826
Are you sure he's gone?

1197
01:26:05,895 --> 01:26:09,263
I've looked all over
the cave, master.

1198
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,131
Well, help me up!

1199
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:16,703
Ow! Oh!
Fat feet!

1200
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:21,842
No doubt the filthy beggar
took one look at me

1201
01:26:21,911 --> 01:26:25,345
and realized he'd
met his match. Ha!

1202
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:31,919
Right now, he's probably 100 leagues
from here running for his life. Ha!

1203
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:37,024
It's a pity, in a way.

1204
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:40,894
I should enjoy puncturing
the ugly brute.

1205
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:43,063
Ee ee ee!

1206
01:26:43,132 --> 01:26:44,132
Ee ee!

1207
01:26:45,134 --> 01:26:46,134
Aahh!

1208
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:10,757
Hans, kill him!

1209
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:12,059
Yes, master!

1210
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,580
Aahh!

1211
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,588
Ha ha ha ha!

1212
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:47,094
Charge! Ah!

1213
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:49,930
Huh?

1214
01:27:49,999 --> 01:27:51,398
Ah!

1215
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:59,039
Yaaa! Ha! Ha!

1216
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,842
Hans, kicking:
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1217
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,111
Don't anger him!
Just kill him!

1218
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:16,189
Ah!

1219
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,459
Uh! Ah!

1220
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:29,736
Ah! Whoa!

1221
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,673
Ooh ooh!

1222
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:42,082
Ooh woo!

1223
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:45,485
Whoa!

1224
01:28:49,124 --> 01:28:50,324
Whoa!

1225
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:20,487
Ow!

1226
01:29:42,111 --> 01:29:43,810
Uh!

1227
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,017
Aah!

1228
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,558
Hmm.

1229
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:26,686
Ah! Hans! Do something,
you bumbling booby! Ooh ooh!

1230
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:29,223
Umph!

1231
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:10,197
Watch out, master!
Here I come!

1232
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:17,337
Oh oh! Ah ah ah!
Whoa! Ah ah!

1233
01:31:17,406 --> 01:31:19,473
Master, don't leave me!

1234
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:23,877
I'm not leaving you, crybaby.

1235
01:31:23,946 --> 01:31:26,680
I'm going for help.

1236
01:31:26,748 --> 01:31:30,617
Oh! Ooh! Ah!

1237
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:36,723
Whoa! Whoa!
Ah ah! Whoa!

1238
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,391
Whoa! Ah ah!

1239
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:42,496
Whoa! Whoa!

1240
01:31:43,866 --> 01:31:45,632
Ah ah!

1241
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:50,036
Oh! Whoa!
Whoa ho!

1242
01:31:50,105 --> 01:31:56,343
Ooh! Whoa!
Oh oh! W-Whoa!

1243
01:31:56,411 --> 01:31:58,778
Oh oh! Whoa!

1244
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:10,257
Ooh! Ooh! Ow!

1245
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:16,497
Whoa oh!

1246
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:22,369
Yoo-hoo.

1247
01:32:26,642 --> 01:32:28,241
I say. Help.

1248
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,377
Here now, dragon. Oh!

1249
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:34,848
I'm not as tasty as I look.

1250
01:32:36,018 --> 01:32:37,018
Aah!

1251
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,929
Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah!

1252
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,180
Oh, no!

1253
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:11,319
Uh!

1254
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:15,555
Oh oh oh! Aah!

1255
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:44,310
M-m-m-master!

1256
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:55,221
Help.

1257
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:57,524
Master!

1258
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,359
What is it?

1259
01:34:59,428 --> 01:35:02,295
The dragon is dead!

1260
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,330
Dead?

1261
01:35:05,834 --> 01:35:08,301
Are you sure that he's
not just pretending?

1262
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:11,938
Oh, I... I... i'd bet my life on it.

1263
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:14,941
Oh... well, we can't
claim the reward

1264
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:17,444
without the creature's
head, can we?

1265
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:19,245
I'd be more than happy...

1266
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:21,147
No. No. Give me
the sword.

1267
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,817
If you want something done right,
I say, do it yourself.

1268
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,185
Stand back, lad.

1269
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,777
Ooh. Well, hans...
You must be tired.

1270
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:52,812
Rest here awhile.

1271
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:54,848
Have a drink of water.

1272
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,051
Oh, thank you,
master. You're very kind.

1273
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,586
But after you, sir.

1274
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:03,256
No! No, no. A good commander
always looks after his men first.

1275
01:36:03,325 --> 01:36:04,457
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1276
01:36:04,526 --> 01:36:06,192
Oh, thank you, sir.

1277
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:31,751
Oh! Oh, no!

1278
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:40,293
Is it too blood-curdling,
children?

1279
01:36:40,362 --> 01:36:41,895
Shall I stop?

1280
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,296
No! It's only
make-believe.

1281
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:44,397
Please!
Don't stop!

1282
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:47,867
Don't stop.
Please. Go on.

1283
01:36:47,936 --> 01:36:54,507
Very well. So... Because he feared that
someone might discover it was the servant

1284
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:57,243
and not the master
who had slain the dragon,

1285
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:02,482
greedy Ludwig killed hans and
buried him under the apple tree.

1286
01:37:06,121 --> 01:37:08,099
Anna, voice-over: While Ludwig
went on to claim the reward

1287
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:09,956
and dwell in a fine castle,

1288
01:37:10,025 --> 01:37:12,559
good hans lay
beneath the ground.

1289
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:17,130
Spring passed, and the earth's
breast was warmed

1290
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,098
by summer's gentle touch.

1291
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:24,671
Autumn came, painting the leaves
with rainbow colors.

1292
01:37:26,942 --> 01:37:29,075
The north wind brought
winter into the land,

1293
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:33,546
covering it with an icy
blanket of purest white.

1294
01:37:33,615 --> 01:37:39,485
And then it was spring again.
Spring... a time of awakening.

1295
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:42,222
With the dragon gone,
everyone felt safe again,

1296
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:44,457
and the countryside flourished.

1297
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:48,695
And so, one fine day, a Shepherd
with his flock passed by the apple tree.

1298
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:50,997
Suddenly, he saw something
at his feet.

1299
01:37:51,066 --> 01:37:52,999
"With a bit of carving,"
the Shepherd thought,

1300
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:55,935
"I could make a fine flute to
play on and soothe my flock."

1301
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:59,539
Straight away, he took out his
knife and began to whittle holes.

1302
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:17,690

why my presence was
requested here?

1307
01:38:37,846 --> 01:38:40,580
I have discovered a
new musical instrument

1308
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:42,749
which I thought might amuse you.

1309
01:38:44,152 --> 01:38:46,019
As ruler of half your kingdom,

1310
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:49,355
I would like to remind you
that I simply loathe music.

1311
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:53,559
As ruler of the other half...

1312
01:38:53,628 --> 01:38:56,496
I suspect that you
will change your mind.

1313
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:58,464
Uh, Shepherd,
will you play us a tune?

1314
01:38:59,834 --> 01:39:03,469
Thank you so much.

Your majesty,
it was an accident.

1325
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:56,789
You see, my sword slipped, and poor
hans happened to be directly underneath.

1326
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:59,492
Because it was poor
hans who slew the dragon

1327
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:01,294
and not you, isn't that so?

1328
01:40:01,363 --> 01:40:05,198
Yes, he<i> was</i> holding the
sword when it entered the beast.

1329
01:40:08,036 --> 01:40:10,770
Mercy, your majesty! I
didn't know what I was doing!

1330
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:12,772
Mercy, I beg of you!

1331
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:15,775
The court will pass sentence.

1332
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:26,552
You have been found guilty

1333
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:32,291
of the crimes of greed,
treachery, and murder.

1334
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,793
The penalty is...

1335
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:34,862
Wait!

1336
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,497
Don't do anything hasty!

1337
01:40:37,565 --> 01:40:40,466
I'm sorry I did it.
Truly sorry.

1338
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:41,634
I really am!

1339
01:40:50,879 --> 01:40:53,746
Ooh!

1340
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:59,152
Well, fancy that!

1341
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:03,790
My boy, you are just in time

1342
01:41:03,858 --> 01:41:07,126
to hear sentence
passed on an evil person.

1343
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:10,563
Hans! Don't let
them kill me!

1344
01:41:10,632 --> 01:41:12,732
If you'll overlook that
one little incident...

1345
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:14,934
I was always a good
master to you! Heh heh!

1346
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,271
It's true, your majesty.

1347
01:41:18,339 --> 01:41:20,573
He was a good master.

1348
01:41:20,642 --> 01:41:23,376
Any bit of old clothing
he couldn't use,

1349
01:41:23,445 --> 01:41:24,777
he'd give it to me.

1350
01:41:26,114 --> 01:41:28,414
And on a cool, bitter night,

1351
01:41:28,483 --> 01:41:32,752
he'd let me sleep next to his nice,
warm horse.

1352
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:36,889
And any scrap of food
his dogs wouldn't eat,

1353
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:38,658
he'd let me have them.

1354
01:41:39,928 --> 01:41:42,495
I implore you, your majesty.

1355
01:41:42,564 --> 01:41:44,030
Spare his life.

1356
01:41:44,099 --> 01:41:46,365
So be it.

1357
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,034
His life shall be spared.

1358
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:50,970
Thank you, your majesty.

1359
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,406
Well, help me up, crumpet face!

1360
01:41:53,475 --> 01:41:54,807
Wait!

1361
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:56,509
I have not finished.

1362
01:41:56,578 --> 01:42:00,413
You, Ludwig,
shall spend the rest of your life

1363
01:42:00,482 --> 01:42:02,014
as servant to hans.

1364
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:03,816
Oh, no!

1365
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:05,218
Come here, my boy.

1366
01:42:12,327 --> 01:42:13,626
Hans...

1367
01:42:13,695 --> 01:42:16,362
Hereafter to be known

1368
01:42:16,431 --> 01:42:19,499
as sir hans, the dragon killer.

1369
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:22,168
Yay! Yay!

1370
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:43,857
Oomph!

1371
01:42:52,634 --> 01:42:54,433
Don't you worry, sir.

1372
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:59,338
I'll be just as good a master
to you as you were to me.

1373
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:03,075
Thank you, sir hans.

1374
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,986
Yay!

1375
01:43:14,055 --> 01:43:16,822
...another one
like this!

1376
01:43:16,891 --> 01:43:19,325
Tell us another one.

1377
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:20,660
No, no.

1378
01:43:20,728 --> 01:43:22,361
It's getting late.
You must go home.

1379
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,829
No! Please!

1380
01:43:23,898 --> 01:43:27,266
No! No arguments
now. Off you go.

1381
01:43:27,335 --> 01:43:28,768
Bye, auntie Anna.

1382
01:43:28,836 --> 01:43:29,969
Good-bye, my boy.

1383
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:31,204
Bye, auntie Anna.

1384
01:43:34,242 --> 01:43:36,709
Good night, dear.
Good night.

1385
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:40,413
Good-bye, auntie Anna.

1386
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:41,825
Good-bye, my boy. Look after the girls now,
won't you?

1387
01:43:41,849 --> 01:43:43,282
Good-bye.

1388
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:44,584
Good-bye, my dear.

1389
01:43:51,459 --> 01:43:52,558
Hmm.

1390
01:43:57,865 --> 01:43:59,131
Hmm.

1391
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:04,136
Hmm.

1392
01:44:04,205 --> 01:44:05,304
What is it?

1393
01:44:05,373 --> 01:44:06,839
What's the matter?

1394
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:09,342
Nothing.
It will pass.

1395
01:44:15,283 --> 01:44:16,882
Hmm. Thank you.

1396
01:44:16,951 --> 01:44:18,384
I'll go and fetch a doctor.

1397
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:21,053
No, no. Get me
a hot cup of tea.

1398
01:44:23,391 --> 01:44:24,590
Uh...

1399
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:37,837
And have some yourself.

1400
01:44:37,905 --> 01:44:39,338
You're soaking wet.

1401
01:44:39,407 --> 01:44:40,473
Thank you.

1402
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:47,546
Ah.

1403
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,515
I told you to go away.

1404
01:44:49,584 --> 01:44:51,450
What were you doing outside?

1405
01:44:51,519 --> 01:44:52,785
Listening.

1406
01:44:55,523 --> 01:45:00,026
You know... You shouldn't
live here all alone.

1407
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:01,694
I'm not alone.

1408
01:45:01,763 --> 01:45:04,163
Death's been my
companion for some time now.

1409
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:08,401
You've many good years left.

1410
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:11,137
I shall only regret
leaving the children.

1411
01:45:11,205 --> 01:45:13,572
But they'll remember me
because of my stories,

1412
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,941
like their parents before them.

1413
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:19,445
Those stories don't just
belong to a few children.

1414
01:45:19,514 --> 01:45:22,014
They belong to children
all over the world,

1415
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:25,384
now and forever after.

1416
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:27,386
I like you, Wilhelm grimm.

1417
01:45:27,455 --> 01:45:29,322
Enough to tell me
some more stories?

1418
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:31,190
But there are so many of them.

1419
01:45:31,259 --> 01:45:34,393
There's one about a little boy
that was no bigger than my thumb.

1420
01:45:34,462 --> 01:45:35,895
Then there's
the poor little girl

1421
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:38,798
whose face was always
covered in cinders.

1422
01:45:38,866 --> 01:45:41,901
And the other one,
whose skin was as white as snow.

1423
01:45:43,471 --> 01:45:45,905
Would you like
another cup of tea?

1424
01:45:45,973 --> 01:45:49,008
No. No, just
the stories.

1425
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:16,435
...when she saw
the blind prince,

1426
01:46:16,504 --> 01:46:18,771
she wept for joy.

1427
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,140
Two of her tears
fell into his eyes,

1428
01:46:21,209 --> 01:46:24,276
and suddenly,
he was able to see.

1429
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:34,320
The boat... It must
be getting late.

1430
01:46:34,389 --> 01:46:36,889
I really must go.

1431
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:38,324
How can I ever thank you?

1432
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:40,626
You have. You have.

1433
01:47:59,674 --> 01:48:00,473
Jacob, I...

1434
01:48:00,541 --> 01:48:02,274
The boat waited 10 minutes.

1435
01:48:02,343 --> 01:48:03,809
I went to the church.

1436
01:48:03,878 --> 01:48:05,344
I lost all track of time.

1437
01:48:05,413 --> 01:48:07,346
They told me you'd left
over an hour ago.

1438
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,316
That's true.
I did.

1439
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,019
Jacob, listen.

1440
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:18,657
I... I found this
wonderful old woman.

1441
01:48:18,726 --> 01:48:20,159
The stories she tells...

1442
01:48:20,228 --> 01:48:21,760
What... if only you
could have seen

1443
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,896
the happy faces
of those children

1444
01:48:23,965 --> 01:48:27,366
with their eyes wide
and their souls warm.

1445
01:48:27,435 --> 01:48:31,504
Look. These...
These are pure gold.

1446
01:48:31,572 --> 01:48:33,539
You can't realize
how valuable they are.

1447
01:48:33,608 --> 01:48:35,374
We have worked over 6 months

1448
01:48:35,443 --> 01:48:37,376
on the Duke's family history.

1449
01:48:37,445 --> 01:48:39,478
Unless it's delivered
tomorrow, we won't be paid.

1450
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,046
That's how valuable they are.

1451
01:48:41,115 --> 01:48:44,016
But we'll get there somehow.

1452
01:48:44,085 --> 01:48:47,119
We can hire horses...
Or a coach.

1453
01:48:47,188 --> 01:48:50,322
We might even be able to
catch them on the next landing.

1454
01:48:54,395 --> 01:48:55,828
What's the matter?

1455
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:57,363
Where is it?

1456
01:48:57,431 --> 01:48:58,931
Where's the manuscript?

1457
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,136
I don't know. I...

1458
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:07,273
I must have... I slipped
while crossing the river.

1459
01:49:07,341 --> 01:49:09,208
You fool!

1460
01:49:09,277 --> 01:49:10,776
6 months...

1461
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:12,578
Thrown away.

1462
01:49:12,647 --> 01:49:16,282
Our whole career ruined!
But these are safe!

1463
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,083
Jacob, forgive me.

1464
01:49:18,152 --> 01:49:20,085
Ask the Duke to forgive you.

1465
01:49:20,154 --> 01:49:20,920
You've always
an explanation ready!

1466
01:49:20,988 --> 01:49:22,454
Go on! Explain
to the Duke!

1467
01:49:22,523 --> 01:49:24,990
But this time it's up to you,
because I won't be there.

1468
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:26,792
I'm not going back.

1469
01:49:26,861 --> 01:49:29,595
What? But... but
where will you go?

1470
01:49:29,664 --> 01:49:32,731
Wherever I can
find work by myself!

1471
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,233
I can't work
any longer with you.

1472
01:49:34,302 --> 01:49:36,468
You ruin everything you touch.

1473
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,544
I know you don't mean it.

1474
01:49:45,613 --> 01:49:47,746
You-you're very angry
and you've every right to be,

1475
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:52,051
but... well... We need you,
all of us.

1476
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:54,453
I've got needs of my own!

1477
01:49:54,522 --> 01:49:58,457
A wife, a home,
and time to do work that's important!

1478
01:49:58,526 --> 01:50:00,926
I'll never have anything
as long as I'm tied to you!

1479
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:05,698
Jacob! Jacob...

1480
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,367
I'm sorry, Wilhelm.

1481
01:50:08,436 --> 01:50:10,970
But I'm much more
sorry for your family,

1482
01:50:11,038 --> 01:50:13,472
with nothing
to live on but dreams.

1483
01:50:40,034 --> 01:50:43,335
It's not enough
to lose the manuscript,

1484
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:47,006
not enough to Rob me
of my gift to the king.

1485
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:48,974
Here's my poetry!
Step on it!

1486
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:51,176
Wipe your boots on my face!

1487
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:53,345
You and your
illustrious brother.

1488
01:50:53,414 --> 01:50:57,449
You are very pleased
to see me made ridiculous.

1489
01:50:57,518 --> 01:50:59,084
No, sir.

1490
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:01,220
And you mustn't
blame my brother.

1491
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:02,888
I'm entirely responsible.

1492
01:51:02,957 --> 01:51:04,890
Do you hear that?

1493
01:51:04,959 --> 01:51:07,126
He's a man of honor,
our minstrel.

1494
01:51:07,194 --> 01:51:09,628
Takes full responsibility
for the crime.

1495
01:51:09,697 --> 01:51:13,799
Brings to mind the old
saying "honor among thieves".

1496
01:51:13,868 --> 01:51:16,101
What shall I send to the
king of prussia instead?

1497
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:18,037
A pretty basket full
of frogs and dogs

1498
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:19,471
and hags and dragons?

1499
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:25,010
Your grace... May I
please be excused?

1500
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:27,813
Full responsibility you'll
take and full punishment.

1501
01:51:27,882 --> 01:51:29,682
To begin, you get no money!

1502
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:31,784
I expect none, sir.

1503
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:35,187
Well what do you expect? Answer!

1504
01:51:35,256 --> 01:51:37,856
Your grace,
I... I can't think. I...

1505
01:51:37,925 --> 01:51:42,861
I could punish you in a way
you couldn't even imagine.

1506
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:46,165
Fortunately for you,
I'm a civilized man.

1507
01:51:46,233 --> 01:51:48,934
I'm very glad to hear that.

1508
01:51:49,003 --> 01:51:50,836
Listen to him.

1509
01:51:50,905 --> 01:51:53,105
Detect a note of sarcasm!

1510
01:51:53,174 --> 01:51:54,673
Unmistakably, sir.

1511
01:51:56,777 --> 01:51:58,377
It wasn't meant to be.

1512
01:51:58,446 --> 01:52:02,514
For 6 months,
I've given you a house rent-free.

1513
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:05,818
You owe me that rent,
and you'll pay!

1514
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:06,985
I'll try, your grace.

1515
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:08,387
You will not try, you'll pay.

1516
01:52:08,456 --> 01:52:10,255
I'll give you 3 days.

1517
01:52:10,324 --> 01:52:11,690
3 days?

1518
01:52:11,759 --> 01:52:15,260
If not, you'll be evicted
and sent to debtor's prison!

1519
01:52:20,167 --> 01:52:24,169
Your grace. I can't.
It's impossible.

1520
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,638
Not in 3 days.

1521
01:52:26,707 --> 01:52:29,775
Please wait!
Your grace!

1522
01:53:04,378 --> 01:53:06,111
How is he, doctor?
Is he better?

1523
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,447
I can't truthfully
say he's better.

1524
01:53:08,516 --> 01:53:09,915
I can only say he's no worse.

1525
01:53:09,984 --> 01:53:12,084
No, not just words, doctor.
I want to know the truth.

1526
01:53:12,153 --> 01:53:14,419
In the morning,
we shall all know.

1527
01:53:14,488 --> 01:53:15,821
He's been ill before.

1528
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:17,556
Not this ill.

1529
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:20,292
Not for such a long time.

1530
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:21,393
Come.

1531
01:53:22,596 --> 01:53:24,429
Such a fool, he is!

1532
01:53:24,498 --> 01:53:25,731
So little strength,

1533
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,233
and he throws it away
chasing daydreams.

1534
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:30,302
My father is<i> not</i> a fool.

1535
01:53:30,371 --> 01:53:31,537
Oh, no, darling.

1536
01:53:31,605 --> 01:53:35,040
What Mr. Stossel means
is that it's foolish

1537
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:37,876
for your father to give
so much of himself,

1538
01:53:37,945 --> 01:53:40,712
to... to be so unselfish.

1539
01:53:40,781 --> 01:53:42,414
That's what I mean.

1540
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:44,917
The whole world should
be made of such foolishness.

1541
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:46,351
It's late. It's time for bed.

1542
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,053
Greta, would you..

1543
01:53:48,122 --> 01:53:49,788
Oh, of course.

1544
01:53:49,857 --> 01:53:51,323
Good night.

1545
01:53:51,392 --> 01:53:53,492
Come along, children.

1546
01:53:53,561 --> 01:53:55,861
Children don't understand.

1547
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:58,764
We scold most
the ones we love best.

1548
01:54:01,202 --> 01:54:04,870
Mama? Will it help
if we pray for papa?

1549
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:06,972
Yes, my darling.

1550
01:54:16,217 --> 01:54:19,818
Mr. Gruber...

1551
01:54:19,887 --> 01:54:21,320
Come in.

1552
01:54:25,893 --> 01:54:27,392
I bring a communication
from the Duke

1553
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:28,927
regarding your husband.

1554
01:54:28,996 --> 01:54:30,896
That's very thoughtful
of his grace.

1555
01:54:30,965 --> 01:54:33,899
Mrs. Grimm,
the communication is an order

1556
01:54:33,968 --> 01:54:35,879
to evict your husband and
his family from this house.

1557
01:54:35,903 --> 01:54:37,569
Evict?

1558
01:54:37,638 --> 01:54:39,972
A man who may
never see tomorrow?

1559
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,473
You can't do that.

1560
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:45,444
I must. Unless he's able
to pay 6 months' rent.

1561
01:54:45,512 --> 01:54:47,546
He's not able to sit up,
to raise his head.

1562
01:54:47,615 --> 01:54:49,481
The Duke has given the order.

1563
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:51,650
May I give you an order,
Mr. Gruber?

1564
01:54:53,254 --> 01:54:55,387
Jacob! Oh...

1565
01:54:57,057 --> 01:55:00,792
Tell his benevolent highness
he will get his money.

1566
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:02,227
Darling!

1567
01:55:04,498 --> 01:55:07,032
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

1568
01:55:07,101 --> 01:55:11,336
May I ask<i> when</i> the Duke
will receive the money?

1569
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,438
As soon as I sell my library.

1570
01:55:13,507 --> 01:55:16,541
Sold. You'll get your money in the morning,
gruber.

1571
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:19,378
Or would you prefer to
put me in debtor's prison?

1572
01:55:19,446 --> 01:55:20,746
Now please understand.

1573
01:55:20,814 --> 01:55:22,447
I'm only obeying
the Duke's orders.

1574
01:55:22,516 --> 01:55:24,116
We do understand.

1575
01:55:24,184 --> 01:55:25,550
If there were no Duke,

1576
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:27,119
there would be no gruber.

1577
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:28,187
Exactly.

1578
01:55:28,222 --> 01:55:29,788
If there were no dogs,

1579
01:55:29,857 --> 01:55:31,423
there would be no fleas.

1580
01:55:31,492 --> 01:55:32,958
This way.

1581
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,233
Jacob...
Don't go!

1582
01:55:41,302 --> 01:55:43,001
I'm... I'm here.

1583
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:44,736
Please. Come back, Jacob.

1584
01:55:44,805 --> 01:55:45,904
I'm right here, Wilhelm.

1585
01:55:45,973 --> 01:55:48,140
Come back.
Forgive me.

1586
01:55:49,643 --> 01:55:51,343
You've got to listen.

1587
01:55:51,412 --> 01:55:52,344
Can you hear me?

1588
01:55:52,413 --> 01:55:53,679
Forgive me.

1589
01:55:53,747 --> 01:55:55,981
I won't go away.

1590
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:59,451
When you are well,
we... we'll start working again,

1591
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,286
just as before.

1592
01:56:01,355 --> 01:56:03,855
I... I promise you.

1593
01:56:03,924 --> 01:56:08,226
Just... just get well,
Wilhelm.

1594
01:56:37,257 --> 01:56:40,659
It's gone.
The manuscripts.

1595
01:56:40,728 --> 01:56:44,062
I'll find it...
I'll find it...

1596
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,446
Jacob?

1597
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:04,583
Dorothea?

1598
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:06,818
Who is it?

1599
01:57:09,623 --> 01:57:13,091
Is this the residence
of Wilhelm grimm?

1600
01:57:15,596 --> 01:57:18,196
I'm... Wilhelm grimm.

1601
01:57:18,265 --> 01:57:19,197
Who are you?

1602
01:57:19,266 --> 01:57:20,532
I'm a...

1603
01:57:21,969 --> 01:57:24,202
Giant.

1604
01:57:24,271 --> 01:57:27,072
Don't be absurd.

1605
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:29,341
There are no giants.

1606
01:57:29,410 --> 01:57:32,477
Tsk tsk tsk.

1607
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:35,647
He's a lot sicker
than we thought.

1608
01:57:35,716 --> 01:57:38,517
We? Who's we?

1609
01:57:38,585 --> 01:57:40,886
Friends of mine.

1610
01:57:40,954 --> 01:57:43,622
Go away.

1611
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:45,457
I'm dying.

1612
01:57:45,526 --> 01:57:46,925
Everybody knows it.

1613
01:57:46,994 --> 01:57:48,827
You stop that.

1614
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:52,064
My friends are pulling
at my trouser leg.

1615
01:57:52,132 --> 01:57:53,698
They want to see you.

1616
01:57:53,767 --> 01:57:56,435
I don't want to see anybody.

1617
01:57:56,503 --> 01:57:59,471
Tired...

1618
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:01,706
Very tired.

1619
01:58:01,775 --> 01:58:05,010
Easy, you overgrown ox!

1620
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:08,080
That's<i> him?</i>

1621
01:58:08,148 --> 01:58:11,817
Please... go away.

1622
01:58:11,885 --> 01:58:16,521
I want to sleep.

1623
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:20,892
You be quiet now.
He says he's dying.

1624
01:58:20,961 --> 01:58:23,028
We must be respectful.

1625
01:58:23,097 --> 01:58:26,565
Why? Why? Is he
respectful to us?

1626
01:58:26,633 --> 01:58:28,967
Please leave me alone.

1627
01:58:29,036 --> 01:58:31,770
You see? You see?
No respect at all!

1628
01:58:31,839 --> 01:58:33,738
He's mean and selfish!

1629
01:58:33,807 --> 01:58:35,440
You're a nasty little man.

1630
01:58:35,509 --> 01:58:37,542
Nasty little man!

1631
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:40,512
I am only nasty to
them what's nasty to me!

1632
01:58:40,581 --> 01:58:42,481
And nobody is nasty to me

1633
01:58:42,549 --> 01:58:43,982
until I'm nasty to them first...

1634
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:47,185
And that includes everybody!

1635
01:58:48,322 --> 01:58:49,654
He thinks he's clever

1636
01:58:49,723 --> 01:58:51,423
because he can spin
gold out of straw!

1637
01:58:51,492 --> 01:58:53,859
Can he... Really
do that?

1638
01:58:53,927 --> 01:58:57,896
Stop talking about me! When
people talk about me, my beard itches,

1639
01:58:57,965 --> 01:59:00,532
and I can't stand
an itchy beard!

1640
01:59:00,601 --> 01:59:03,101
He has quite a temper,
hasn't he?

1641
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,203
Yes, and he really enjoys it!

1642
01:59:05,272 --> 01:59:08,106
Why you little pipsqueak,

1643
01:59:08,175 --> 01:59:11,176
I could crush you under my foot!

1644
01:59:11,245 --> 01:59:14,679
Do you... what is
your name, anyway?

1645
01:59:14,748 --> 01:59:16,381
I don't know.
What<i> is</i> my name?

1646
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,983
How should I know?

1647
01:59:18,051 --> 01:59:19,985
You see?
"How should I know?"

1648
01:59:20,053 --> 01:59:21,853
He doesn't care
whether we live or die!

1649
01:59:21,922 --> 01:59:23,622
All he's interested
in is himself.

1650
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:25,557
And anybody who's only
interested in himself

1651
01:59:25,626 --> 01:59:27,993
is not interested
in anybody else, too!

1652
01:59:28,061 --> 01:59:31,396
I... don't know...

1653
01:59:31,465 --> 01:59:33,865
What you're talking about.

1654
01:59:33,934 --> 01:59:37,669
What he means, Mr. Grimm,
is that our lives depend on you.

1655
01:59:37,738 --> 01:59:40,705
If you die, we'll never be born.

1656
01:59:40,774 --> 01:59:43,475
We will never be born?

1657
01:59:45,245 --> 01:59:46,645
Oh, now, stop that!

1658
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:50,615
You promised if I brought
you along you wouldn't cry.

1659
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:53,585
They're very sentimental,
Mr. Grimm.

1660
01:59:53,654 --> 01:59:57,289
And I'm... I'm so tired.

1661
01:59:57,357 --> 01:59:59,658
I have no more life left in me.

1662
01:59:59,726 --> 02:00:00,926
Well, if you're going to die,

1663
02:00:00,994 --> 02:00:03,061
the least you can do
is give us names.

1664
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,863
Please, Mr. Grimm...

1665
02:00:04,932 --> 02:00:05,932
Would you?

1666
02:00:05,999 --> 02:00:08,133
Without names, we're nobody.

1667
02:00:08,202 --> 02:00:10,168
We're nothing!

1668
02:00:10,237 --> 02:00:14,372
Please give us names.

1669
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:19,010
Please.

1670
02:00:19,079 --> 02:00:21,513
Would that be asking too much,
Mr. Grimm?

1671
02:00:21,582 --> 02:00:23,515
Well...

1672
02:00:23,584 --> 02:00:27,986
Since you're...
No bigger than my thumb,

1673
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:32,857
we'll call you...
Tom thumb.

1674
02:00:32,926 --> 02:00:35,360
Tom thumb?
Tom thumb!

1675
02:00:35,429 --> 02:00:36,728
Hooray, I got a name!

1676
02:00:36,797 --> 02:00:38,697
Tom thumb!

1677
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:47,472
Your... face is dirty.

1678
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,608
It's from cinders.

1679
02:00:49,676 --> 02:00:52,510
Then you should be called...

1680
02:00:52,579 --> 02:00:56,081
Cinder... Ella.

1681
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:58,316
Cinderella.

1682
02:00:58,385 --> 02:01:00,252
I like that very much,
Mr. Grimm.

1683
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,320
Thank you.

1684
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:04,723
And I?

1685
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:09,160
You're... white as snow.

1686
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:13,298
You're snow white.

1687
02:01:13,367 --> 02:01:15,100
Thank you,
Mr. Grimm.

1688
02:01:15,168 --> 02:01:17,469
Thank you,
Mr. Grimm.

1689
02:01:17,537 --> 02:01:18,970
Hansel...

1690
02:01:20,207 --> 02:01:21,506
Hansel.

1691
02:01:21,575 --> 02:01:23,341
Gretel.

1692
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:24,776
Gretel.

1693
02:01:24,845 --> 02:01:26,745
Mr. Grimm?

1694
02:01:26,813 --> 02:01:29,714
This is easy.

1695
02:01:29,783 --> 02:01:31,416
You're...

1696
02:01:31,485 --> 02:01:34,552
Little red riding hood.

1697
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:36,488
Thank you,
Mr. Grimm.

1698
02:01:36,556 --> 02:01:37,722
What about me?

1699
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:38,957
You forgot about me?

1700
02:01:39,026 --> 02:01:40,558
Don't I get a name?

1701
02:01:40,627 --> 02:01:42,460
Rumpel...

1702
02:01:44,197 --> 02:01:46,331
Stilt... skin.

1703
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,900
Why, that's ridiculous.

1704
02:01:48,969 --> 02:01:50,869
Whoever heard of such a name?

1705
02:01:50,937 --> 02:01:52,804
Rumpel... uh, rumpel...

1706
02:01:52,873 --> 02:01:55,140
What does it mean, anyway?

1707
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:59,244
I... I can't see you.

1708
02:01:59,313 --> 02:02:03,048
All things die
differently, Mr. Grimm.

1709
02:02:03,116 --> 02:02:05,350
We die like dreams,

1710
02:02:05,419 --> 02:02:07,786
fade into forgetfulness.

1711
02:02:07,854 --> 02:02:10,689
No... don't.

1712
02:02:10,757 --> 02:02:12,891
You mustn't.

1713
02:02:12,959 --> 02:02:15,293
We haven't much more time.

1714
02:02:15,362 --> 02:02:18,163
When you reach
your last heartbeat,

1715
02:02:18,231 --> 02:02:19,998
we reach ours.

1716
02:02:20,067 --> 02:02:24,069
But it... it isn't fair.

1717
02:02:24,137 --> 02:02:28,139
Why must this be
on my conscience?

1718
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:29,774
Say good-bye.

1719
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:32,444
Good-bye, Mr. Grimm.

1720
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:33,845
Good-bye.

1721
02:02:33,914 --> 02:02:36,281
And thank you,
Mr. Grimm.

1722
02:02:39,252 --> 02:02:41,186
Come back.

1723
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:44,956
Didn't you forget something?

1724
02:02:47,227 --> 02:02:48,960
Bye.

1725
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:54,199
Tell them to come back.

1726
02:02:54,267 --> 02:02:55,900
Tell them!

1727
02:02:55,969 --> 02:02:59,671
Only you can call them back.

1728
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,539
Only you.

1729
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:03,341
Wait!

1730
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:06,044
Only you...

1731
02:03:06,113 --> 02:03:07,045
Don't leave me!

1732
02:03:07,114 --> 02:03:08,913
Only you...

1733
02:03:08,982 --> 02:03:10,148
Where are you?

1734
02:03:10,217 --> 02:03:13,151
Only you...

1735
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,286
Where have you gone?

1736
02:03:18,959 --> 02:03:20,458
Wilhelm!

1737
02:03:25,766 --> 02:03:27,132
Dear!

1738
02:03:30,704 --> 02:03:32,570
Don't go in. I'll go.

1739
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:34,072
Jacob, I've got to.
Please let me.

1740
02:03:44,918 --> 02:03:48,319
It's gone!
The fever's gone!

1741
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:51,156
What's this?

1742
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:57,495
"Once upon a..."

1743
02:03:59,132 --> 02:04:02,967
"Once upon a time,
there was a tiny little boy.

1744
02:04:03,036 --> 02:04:06,571
His name was Tom thumb."

1745
02:04:11,912 --> 02:04:13,912
Of course it's
difficult for him.

1746
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:15,447
By his own admission,

1747
02:04:15,515 --> 02:04:17,148
the Duke is a civilized man,

1748
02:04:17,217 --> 02:04:19,451
and if we go on paying our rent,

1749
02:04:19,519 --> 02:04:21,119
he will graciously permit us

1750
02:04:21,188 --> 02:04:22,887
to go on living in our house.

1751
02:04:22,956 --> 02:04:24,367
Of course, he's raised
the rent, but...

1752
02:04:24,391 --> 02:04:26,691
Well, that has
a strange sound to it...

1753
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:29,928
As though you plan to
go on living there, too.

1754
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:35,767
When my brother was ill,
I made him a promise...

1755
02:04:35,836 --> 02:04:38,837
That I would stay
and work with him.

1756
02:04:38,905 --> 02:04:42,140
You also made a promise to me.

1757
02:04:42,209 --> 02:04:44,242
They are very different.

1758
02:04:44,311 --> 02:04:45,910
One is...

1759
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,745
You might call it a duty,

1760
02:04:47,814 --> 02:04:50,515
but it's much more.

1761
02:04:50,584 --> 02:04:52,650
The other much less?

1762
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:54,719
No, darling.

1763
02:04:54,788 --> 02:04:59,190
But, I... I have only
so much money,

1764
02:04:59,259 --> 02:05:01,493
and the family has
to be taken care of.

1765
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:04,929
But it's<i> his</i> family,
Jacob, not yours!

1766
02:05:04,998 --> 02:05:06,431
He's my brother.

1767
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:08,233
Does that give him a claim

1768
02:05:08,301 --> 02:05:10,134
on your whole life?

1769
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:16,140
I know he needs you,
but so do I.

1770
02:05:16,209 --> 02:05:18,576
Oh, it's humiliating to beg.

1771
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:22,313
But I don't care.

1772
02:05:22,382 --> 02:05:23,748
With you I have no pride.

1773
02:05:30,524 --> 02:05:32,790
If only you would wait awhile.

1774
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,893
How long is a while?

1775
02:05:34,961 --> 02:05:36,694
A month? A year?

1776
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,031
I don't know.

1777
02:05:40,133 --> 02:05:41,799
Forever?

1778
02:05:45,672 --> 02:05:47,305
Greta, I love you.

1779
02:05:49,075 --> 02:05:51,509
You love me and I love you,

1780
02:05:51,578 --> 02:05:54,779
and there's nothing more
to say, is there?

1781
02:05:57,083 --> 02:06:00,118
Well, there's nothing
to be gained

1782
02:06:00,186 --> 02:06:03,221
by tormenting each other.

1783
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:04,889
I'm going home.

1784
02:06:04,958 --> 02:06:06,024
Wait, I...

1785
02:06:06,092 --> 02:06:08,293
I'll take you.

1786
02:06:08,361 --> 02:06:11,763
Not my aunt's home.

1787
02:06:11,831 --> 02:06:14,065
My home...

1788
02:06:14,134 --> 02:06:15,967
In Berlin.

1789
02:06:16,036 --> 02:06:18,136
Good-bye, Jacob.

1790
02:06:31,585 --> 02:06:33,985
Jacob! Where have
you been?

1791
02:06:34,054 --> 02:06:35,587
Have you had supper?

1792
02:06:35,655 --> 02:06:38,590
I wasn't hungry.
I felt like walking.

1793
02:06:44,631 --> 02:06:46,431
This is for you.

1794
02:06:48,234 --> 02:06:51,002
Your flower vendor
drives a hard bargain.

1795
02:06:51,071 --> 02:06:53,571
Still, it's quite a good story.

1796
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:56,574
It's about a... about a tailor,

1797
02:06:56,643 --> 02:06:59,410
who kills 7 with one blow.

1798
02:06:59,479 --> 02:07:01,512
7 flies, that is.

1799
02:07:01,581 --> 02:07:03,181
The townspeople misunderstand,

1800
02:07:03,249 --> 02:07:05,350
and they are amazed.

1801
02:07:05,418 --> 02:07:07,452
So am I.

1802
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,120
I thought that fairy tales

1803
02:07:09,189 --> 02:07:11,222
were just a waste of time.

1804
02:07:12,692 --> 02:07:13,791
Yes, I...

1805
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:18,930
It's true, I did feel that way.

1806
02:07:18,999 --> 02:07:21,933
How do you feel
about Greta Heinrich?

1807
02:07:22,002 --> 02:07:23,946
Miss Heinrich and I have
reached an understanding.

1808
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:25,203
I know.

1809
02:07:25,271 --> 02:07:27,138
She came to say good-bye.

1810
02:07:27,207 --> 02:07:28,473
She was crying.

1811
02:07:28,541 --> 02:07:32,010
Good-byes are sentimental
occasions for women.

1812
02:07:32,078 --> 02:07:35,580
In fact, sentiment often
blinds them to practical matters.

1813
02:07:35,649 --> 02:07:37,448
Uh-huh. Such as?

1814
02:07:37,517 --> 02:07:41,052
I need Wilhelm
to complete my work.

1815
02:07:41,121 --> 02:07:43,454
He needs my help to
complete his stories.

1816
02:07:48,895 --> 02:07:50,895
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

1817
02:07:50,964 --> 02:07:52,096
Good night.

1818
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,803
What are you doing here?

1819
02:07:58,872 --> 02:08:00,271
We'eanqna q orór

1820
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,340
papa, can we...

1821
02:08:01,408 --> 02:08:02,674
Not tonight.
Papa's too tired.

1822
02:08:02,742 --> 02:08:03,742
Oh, just one?

1823
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:05,243
Just a teeny weeny one?

1824
02:08:05,311 --> 02:08:06,511
No. You heard
your mother.

1825
02:08:06,579 --> 02:08:07,579
Come along.

1826
02:08:07,647 --> 02:08:10,181
We'll never get to hear a story!

1827
02:08:11,651 --> 02:08:15,153
Come along.
And no complaining.

1828
02:08:15,221 --> 02:08:16,554
And don't annoy your father.

1829
02:08:16,623 --> 02:08:17,655
He's been much too sick.

1830
02:08:17,724 --> 02:08:19,057
But he's better now.

1831
02:08:19,125 --> 02:08:20,591
Shh. Into bed,
I said.

1832
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:28,566
I will tell you a story.

1833
02:08:28,635 --> 02:08:30,001
You don't know any stories.

1834
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:31,169
You're wrong.

1835
02:08:31,237 --> 02:08:32,948
I just heard one today
from the flower vendor.

1836
02:08:32,972 --> 02:08:34,305
Did you pay her?

1837
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:35,907
What did it cost you?

1838
02:08:35,975 --> 02:08:37,508
What did it cost me?

1839
02:08:40,346 --> 02:08:41,679
Enough.

1840
02:10:04,164 --> 02:10:07,398
Ha ha ha ha!

1841
02:10:07,467 --> 02:10:08,833
Wilhelm!

1842
02:10:08,902 --> 02:10:10,501
What is it?
What's the matter?

1843
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:12,770
The Duke! He's here!
He's downstairs.

1844
02:10:12,839 --> 02:10:14,438
Well...
What's the trouble?

1845
02:10:14,507 --> 02:10:15,573
We pay the rent.

1846
02:10:15,642 --> 02:10:16,685
Maybe he's raising it again.

1847
02:10:16,709 --> 02:10:17,875
More likely throwing us out.

1848
02:10:17,944 --> 02:10:19,143
Why, that miserable...

1849
02:10:19,212 --> 02:10:20,411
Don't keep him waiting.

1850
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,547
You know what a temper he's got.

1851
02:10:25,685 --> 02:10:26,851
Jacob!

1852
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,319
My illustrious scholar!

1853
02:10:28,388 --> 02:10:30,054
My gifted man of letters!

1854
02:10:30,123 --> 02:10:31,389
I came here the moment I heard.

1855
02:10:31,457 --> 02:10:32,457
Heard what?

1856
02:10:32,492 --> 02:10:34,058
How are you?

1857
02:10:34,127 --> 02:10:35,726
I'm...

1858
02:10:35,795 --> 02:10:37,962
I'm very much better, thank you.

1859
02:10:38,031 --> 02:10:40,665
I am happy to present
my distinguished protege,

1860
02:10:40,733 --> 02:10:41,666
Jacob grimm

1861
02:10:41,734 --> 02:10:43,134
and his brother.

1862
02:10:43,203 --> 02:10:45,203
Mr. Vantino
from Berlin.

1863
02:10:45,271 --> 02:10:47,071
<i>The</i> vantino?

1864
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:48,706
Very honored to meet you, sir.

1865
02:10:48,775 --> 02:10:49,574
How do you do, sir?

1866
02:10:49,642 --> 02:10:50,786
Have you met our friend stossel?

1867
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:53,144
We have been in communication.

1868
02:10:53,213 --> 02:10:54,946
I know all about it.

1869
02:10:55,014 --> 02:10:55,913
All about what?

1870
02:10:55,982 --> 02:10:56,914
Silence!

1871
02:10:56,983 --> 02:10:58,082
Silence!

1872
02:10:58,151 --> 02:11:00,351
I've been commissioned
by his majesty,

1873
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:01,686
Wilhelm III,

1874
02:11:01,754 --> 02:11:02,954
king of prussia...

1875
02:11:03,022 --> 02:11:05,122
A man of honor,
courage, wisdom...

1876
02:11:05,191 --> 02:11:06,791
A man I'm humbly grateful to.

1877
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:07,792
Ahem.

1878
02:11:07,861 --> 02:11:08,861
Continue.

1879
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:10,628
To inform you gentlemen

1880
02:11:10,697 --> 02:11:12,697
that you have been
elected to membership

1881
02:11:12,765 --> 02:11:14,799
in the Berlin royal academy.

1882
02:11:14,868 --> 02:11:16,000
Did you hear that?

1883
02:11:16,069 --> 02:11:17,869
Royal academy!

1884
02:11:17,937 --> 02:11:20,037
Surprised, huh?
But not I.

1885
02:11:20,106 --> 02:11:21,739
I want you to know
I was the first

1886
02:11:21,808 --> 02:11:22,940
to recognize the talent.

1887
02:11:23,009 --> 02:11:24,609
I know all about it.

1888
02:11:24,677 --> 02:11:26,944
I told him.

1889
02:11:27,013 --> 02:11:28,312
Oh.

1890
02:11:28,381 --> 02:11:30,882
The induction ceremony
will take place in Berlin.

1891
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:32,283
I present you now

1892
02:11:32,352 --> 02:11:34,151
with your certificate
of membership.

1893
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,720
Excuse me.

1894
02:11:39,726 --> 02:11:42,393
"In recognition of the literary
and scholarly excellence

1895
02:11:42,462 --> 02:11:44,262

<i>Latin poetry..."</i>

1899
02:11:50,503 --> 02:11:51,802
Is something wrong?

1900
02:11:51,871 --> 02:11:54,572
No, it's...

1901
02:11:54,641 --> 02:11:57,775
It's just that there's no
mention of the fairy tales.

1902
02:11:57,844 --> 02:11:59,543
Fairy tales?

1903
02:12:02,582 --> 02:12:04,215
Never mind.

1904
02:12:04,284 --> 02:12:06,017
It's not important.

1905
02:12:06,085 --> 02:12:08,019
Fairy tales.
Ridiculous!

1906
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:11,889
Frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons!

1907
02:12:11,958 --> 02:12:15,393
Frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons!

1908
02:12:31,778 --> 02:12:32,778
There's a sign!

1909
02:12:32,845 --> 02:12:34,178
What does it say?

1910
02:12:34,247 --> 02:12:36,113
Berlin. We're getting
close to Berlin!

1911
02:12:36,182 --> 02:12:37,048
We're almost there!

1912
02:12:37,116 --> 02:12:38,049
Quiet, children.

1913
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:39,417
Now be quiet.

1914
02:12:39,485 --> 02:12:41,352
Let uncle Jacob read
what he's going to say.

1915
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:43,854
Uncle Jacob knows
what he's going to say.

1916
02:12:43,923 --> 02:12:45,790
"Members of the academy,

1917
02:12:45,858 --> 02:12:47,358
"I am deeply grateful
for this honor,

1918
02:12:47,427 --> 02:12:50,728
which, I regret to say,
is an outrage."

1919
02:12:50,797 --> 02:12:52,096
That's not very polite.

1920
02:12:52,165 --> 02:12:53,497
Nor sensible.

1921
02:12:53,566 --> 02:12:55,800
It's your day.
Stop resenting it.

1922
02:12:55,868 --> 02:12:57,902
Look, whatever work
we performed,

1923
02:12:57,971 --> 02:12:59,470
we performed equally.

1924
02:12:59,539 --> 02:13:00,938
Whatever honors are received

1925
02:13:01,007 --> 02:13:02,707
we should share equally.

1926
02:13:02,775 --> 02:13:04,055
You know, if you're not careful,

1927
02:13:04,110 --> 02:13:05,743
you'll also share
in my reputation,

1928
02:13:05,812 --> 02:13:07,144
such as looney, mad.

1929
02:13:07,213 --> 02:13:09,480
You're nothing of the sort.

1930
02:13:09,549 --> 02:13:12,316
Neither is Jacob, I hope.

1931
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,520
We're being honored
for your work, not mine.

1932
02:13:16,589 --> 02:13:18,322
You were right about
the fairy tales.

1933
02:13:18,391 --> 02:13:19,523
They were a waste of time.

1934
02:13:19,592 --> 02:13:21,926
A quick reading,
quickly forgotten.

1935
02:13:21,995 --> 02:13:24,495
Never mind that.
It is an outrage.

1936
02:13:24,564 --> 02:13:26,284
In my speech,
I'm going to tell them that...

1937
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:27,665
Jacob.

1938
02:13:27,734 --> 02:13:29,367
Just tell them...

1939
02:13:29,435 --> 02:13:31,569
Just tell them that
I'm your brother.

1940
02:13:55,161 --> 02:13:58,729
The Berlin royal academy
welcomes you.

1941
02:13:58,798 --> 02:13:59,798
As president of...

1942
02:14:16,482 --> 02:14:21,352
We want a story!
We want a story!

1943
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:26,524
We want a story!
We want a story!

1944
02:14:26,592 --> 02:14:29,260
Just tell them I'm your brother.

1945
02:14:29,328 --> 02:14:33,998
We want a story!
We want a story!

1946
02:14:34,067 --> 02:14:38,335
We want a story!
We want a story!

1947
02:14:41,607 --> 02:14:44,041
Once upon a time,

1948
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:47,144
there were two brothers.
