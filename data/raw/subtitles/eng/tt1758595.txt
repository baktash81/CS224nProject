1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,044
<i>It is not the horror of landmines</i>

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,327
<i>that is making the
headlines back home,</i>

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,246
<i>but reports of the Princess's
romance with Dodi Fayed.</i>

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Speculation fuelled by
the arrival last night</i>

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,043
<i>of a car similar to that
owned by the Princess...</i>

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,290
Hello, Paul.

7
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,801
Diana! Diana!

8
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,762
Ma'am, over here, ma'am.

9
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Give us a smile.
Oh, beautiful, thank you.

10
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,048
Looks like the cheque's in the post.

11
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,529
Good total, isn't it?

12
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,400
This way, please, ma'am!

13
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,606
One for me, Di!

14
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,728
Are you getting a divorce?

15
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,011
Di? Di, are you
getting a divorce?

16
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,526
Di, are you getting a divorce?
Di.

17
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,410
They're on their way through.

18
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,211
Thanks.

19
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,966
It's been a long week.
You must all be very tired.

20
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,009
Go home. And thank you.

21
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,282
Where would you like supper,
Your Royal Highness?

22
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,887
I don't want anything.
Everyone can go home. Thank you.

23
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,288
So, yes. I...
I did inflict upon myself.

24
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,403
I didn't like myself.

25
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,121
I was ashamed that
I couldn't cope with the pressures.

26
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,408
<i>So I just hurt my arms.</i>

27
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,604
<i>So I just hurt my arms
and my legs.</i>

28
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,963
There were three of
us in this marriage,

29
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,681
so it was a bit crowded.

30
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,842
<i>The most persistent criticism</i>

31
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,130
<i>is that as the marriage broke down,
you were unfaithful to your wife.</i>

32
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,887
<i>That's the persistent
criticism, is it?</i>

33
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,167
<i>That's the persistent criticism,
is it?</i>

34
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,481
And open your eyes.

35
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,211
- Would you like a pin?
- Hmm.

36
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,645
Keeps coming back.

37
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,084
- That dream I told you about.
- Falling into darkness?

38
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,489
It's not falling.

39
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,767
It's being dropped.
Someone's doing it to me.

40
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,681
And take a breath.

41
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,288
I think perhaps you're
afraid of letting go.

42
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,569
I know. I hang on to things.

43
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,883
Like my marriage.

44
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,804
You're a Cancerian.

45
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,080
You hang on to the idea of love.

46
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,289
'Cause you're so
good at giving love.

47
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,970
So you keep on giving.

48
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,401
The hard part is receiving love.

49
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,767
But if I can't receive it,
I'm back where I started.

50
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,001
And where is that?

51
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,725
On the doorstep.
A little girl waiting...

52
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,241
for her mother to return.

53
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,411
Well, perhaps that little girl should
finally stand up and walk into the garden.

54
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,802
It's been 30 years.

55
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,604
In your dream, who's pushing you?

56
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,847
That's not the point, Oonagh.

57
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,089
The point is, will anyone catch me?

58
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,082
Just use the sync.

59
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,929
Right, then.

60
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,251
I suppose it's too
late to back out now.

61
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,849
It's fine, Wills. Just take care
not to shoot any corgis.

62
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,482
I'll see you next weekend.

63
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,044
The one after.

64
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,523
Well, if that's what the
palace have decided.

65
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,604
No, it's fine with me as
long as you're happy.

66
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,689
I miss you, too.

67
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,088
I'm at the opera.
I'm having a great time.

68
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,685
I love you.

69
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,565
Bye, darling.

70
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,487
There's something coming up.
A nuclear submarine needs to be named.

71
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,481
I've indicated to the palace
you might be willing to do it.

72
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,564
Perhaps you could indicate to the
palace that I'd like to see my children

73
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,608
more than once every five weeks.

74
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,604
The submarine. In the current
situation, it would be sensible.

75
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,009
A nuclear submarine?
I want to help people.

76
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,607
It's still possible you might
be queen one day.

77
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,528
Like it or not, you'll have an army and
navy who will be helping people by...

78
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,205
Shut up!

79
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,844
Sorry, Patrick.

80
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,887
Your Royal Highness,
there's a call from Oonagh.

81
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,041
She says it's urgent.

82
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,644
There's Diana!

83
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,842
Excuse me. Intensive care?

84
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,242
- Er, second floor up on the right.
- Thank you.

85
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,404
It is, isn't it? It's her.

86
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,767
He had a haemorrhage. It sometimes
happens with bypass operations.

87
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,605
- Mrs Toffolo.
- Doctor. This is Diana.

88
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,447
Joseph's condition is
still very serious.

89
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,331
I need your permission to take him
back into theatre this afternoon.

90
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,210
Of course.

91
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,483
Do please look after him.
He is very precious.

92
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,123
He's going to be all right.

93
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,968
Yes. That man knows what
he's doing, don't you think?

94
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,763
<i>Doors opening.</i>

95
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,527
- Are you going down?
- Yes.

96
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,446
Thanks. I was, er,
just seeing Joseph.

97
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,563
He's so much better.

98
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,161
Mr Toffolo's not on that floor.

99
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,202
Right. Yes, well, I got lost
and, you know, went a bit wrong.

100
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,084
Actually, I didn't get lost. I was
snooping. Hospitals fascinate me.

101
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,249
- Doors opening.
- Are you being serious?

102
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,288
Yes. When I visit hospitals,

103
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,287
I get excited because I feel like
I can make a contribution.

104
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,170
Well, perhaps I can show you around.

105
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,929
I would adore that.

106
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,288
I don't know how to contact you.

107
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,083
Well, I'm like most people.
I've got a mobile.

108
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,081
Actually, I'm not like most people.
I have four.

109
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,008
One number would do.

110
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,849
And 1100 hours, an audience with
His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.

111
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,400
- 1300 hours, lunch...
- Paul.

112
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,165
Lunch with Clive James.

113
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,846
1500 hours, briefing here at KP
with doctors from Broadmoor

114
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,729
on patient therapies.

115
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,361
Thank you, Paul.

116
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,208
And one last thing, ma'am.

117
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,928
There's been a rumour you've
done an interview for the BBC.

118
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,130
Yes. Don't worry about that, Patrick.
Everything will be all right.

119
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
This is the Sir Reginald Wilson Ward
with ten private rooms.

120
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,441
The NHS is on this side.
Basically, we're about 50/50.

121
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,207
- Was your father a doctor?
- No. No, he ran the family business.

122
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,682
Glass bottles. But I do have an
uncle who is a heart surgeon.

123
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,764
That's Lady Di!

124
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,888
So, you followed him.

125
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,963
I follow no one.

126
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,406
But, yes, I admit, my uncle
did help to set me on my path.

127
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,682
Families can be useful.

128
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,842
And bloody irritating.

129
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,411
Perhaps I've been luckier
with my family than you have.

130
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,729
Oh, I don't know,
I've got two families.

131
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,004
How lucky is that?

132
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,246
This is pretty much
state of the art.

133
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,201
How long do heart operations go on?

134
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,011
Sometimes eight or nine hours.

135
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,367
God, how do you keep going?

136
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,526
You reach a place inside yourself
where time has no meaning.

137
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,681
You don't perform the operation.
The operation performs you.

138
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,609
I'd love to feel that.

139
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,330
And when it's over, reality is a bit
flat and you're very tired.

140
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
I bet.

141
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,805
And this is the on-call
accommodation.

142
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,724
- What, you just crash here?
- Hmm.

143
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,081
What do you eat?

144
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,600
There's a canteen on the ground
floor, but it's not open late.

145
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,845
Well, you could always pop round
the corner for supper with me.

146
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm serious. At the palace,
we stay open very late.

147
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,966
Sonia, are you sure
this is the right stuff?

148
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,249
He's a heart surgeon, right?
He'll be a healthy eater.

149
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,406
I've got conchiglie.
Shells.

150
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,327
- Aren't they harder to cook?
- No, boil and drain. Eight minutes.

151
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,961
I'll do everything else,
you just stuff it in the microwave.

152
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,560
Are you sure he's not
married or something?

153
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,402
No. I've checked him out.

154
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,927
So what is it that you like
about this man?

155
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,408
He doesn't treat me like a princess.

156
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,448
It's almost as if he doesn't
know who I am.

157
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,445
Maybe he doesn't.
He might be very badly informed.

158
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,524
- Can we be of assistance, sir?
- Yes.

159
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,966
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

160
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,805
- Are you working tomorrow?
- Not at the hospital.

161
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm writing a paper for
Monday morning.

162
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,245
It's part of my thesis.
I have to be home by midnight.

163
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,726
How do you relax doing
such a stressful job?

164
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,804
I listen to jazz.

165
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,164
I'm not sure I like jazz.

166
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,444
You should go to Ronnie Scott's.

167
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,610
I can't just go to places, you know.

168
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,451
It's not the same
listening to records.

169
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,603
Jazz is in the moment.
You have to be there.

170
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,765
- It's improvised. It's like life.
- My life is completely regimented.

171
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,321
You're told where to go
and who to shake hands with?

172
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,761
Exactly.

173
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,207
But within that framework,
you improvise.

174
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,086
You look at someone for a clue
as how to start the conversation

175
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,768
and you let it flow from there.
You improvise all the time.

176
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,684
And if you can improvise,
you'll like jazz.

177
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,002
I've got to check on the supper.

178
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,042
- Pretty hot stuff, eh?
- What?

179
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,365
You, in the kitchen.

180
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,291
Yes, hot stuff. You could say that.

181
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
Hot stuff!

182
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,924
So hearts can't actually be broken?

183
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,243
A heart can receive a shock
so violent it never recovers.

184
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,721
Yes, but can they actually break?

185
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,971
My colleagues might disagree,

186
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,284
but I believe, for instance, that
Maria Callas died of a broken heart.

187
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,161
You don't like my food.

188
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,482
No. No, it's lovely. You're obviously
a very accomplished cook.

189
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,491
Oh, come on.
What kind of food do you really like?

190
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,649
You couldn't make me a hamburger,
could you?

191
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,527
I'm not sure you can
actually make hamburgers.

192
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,561
Oh, dear.

193
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,282
I could send out for one.

194
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Very good.

195
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,483
Yes, I can see.

196
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,802
- Do you mind?
- No.

197
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,801
I bet you give your patients
lectures about that.

198
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,923
- About what?
- Smoking.

199
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,326
Well, of course.

200
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,643
- But you don't lecture yourself.
- I'm not the patient, I'm the doctor.

201
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,928
You still have to
look after yourself.

202
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,924
Tonight you've turned down
a healthy supper for fast food,

203
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,049
you've drunk a fair amount of wine
and now you're smoking.

204
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,209
Is there any more wine
or have we run out?

205
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,327
This is a palace.
We don't run out.

206
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,091
I didn't think you'd
have a television.

207
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,367
Of course. I love telly.

208
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,522
- What do you watch?
- Everything.

209
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,769
<i>Corrie. EastEnders.</i>
My favourite's <i>Casualty.</i>

210
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,320
It was on tonight so
I videoed it.

211
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,601
What?

212
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,446
<i>And it's Steve McManaman
who's turned it in.</i>

213
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,683
- They're defending too deep.
- Really?

214
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,088
Come on! Push up, push up!

215
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,082
See? That's what happens. You can't give
Liverpool that much space to play in.

216
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,850
They'll walk right through you.

217
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,288
<i>A dreadful mistake there by David Lee.
And Liverpool are in again.</i>

218
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,204
- Stan Collymore's made them pay.
- Who are the blue ones?

219
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,729
<i>Oh, dear! What a blistering turn
of pace before crossing it in.</i>

220
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,888
I don't think
I should drive home.

221
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,247
Well, the tubes are still running.

222
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,244
But if I leave my car here,
it'll be sold for scrap.

223
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,927
I was joking.
I already called for a driver.

224
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,724
The service here is rather good.

225
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,128
Well, we should really have
horse-drawn carriages at the ready.

226
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,884
The full Windsor experience.

227
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,282
I'm used to horse-drawn carriages.
We were driven to school in them.

228
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,521
In Pakistan?

229
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,042
Yes, Jhelum. Freezing cold,
huddled under blankets.

230
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,005
My friends and I, we would breathe
the cold air out through our mouths

231
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,764
and pretend we were smoking.

232
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,924
So, that's where the
bad habits started.

233
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,884
I don't have any bad habits.

234
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,041
- How do I get out?
- Oh. Erm...

235
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,251
Well, the paratroopers
are waiting for you outside.

236
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,129
They drag you to the
Tower of London,

237
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,885
where the Prince of Wales
will personally interrogate you

238
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,844
with his favourite set
of medieval torturing irons.

239
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,328
Yes. Yes, I was going
to ask about him.

240
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,768
- Don't you read the papers?
- Not those bits. Sorry.

241
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,604
Well, I'm glad somebody doesn't.
Charles and I live separate lives.

242
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,002
So it's all right me coming here?

243
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,731
More than all right.

244
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,281
I'll call you soon. If you like.

245
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,561
Yes.

246
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,043
Yes, I would like that.

247
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,164
Well, good night.

248
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,250
Good night.

249
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,644
Wonderful cooking.

250
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,562
There's no one thing called jazz.

251
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,931
Right? So when he says he likes jazz,
that's like saying, "I like food."

252
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,004
People who like different
kinds of jazz come to blows.

253
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,082
Some of these are very weird.

254
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,482
Gifts from intense young men,
some of them not so young.

255
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,324
Right, so choose something.
Anything.

256
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,601
Good, yeah. Yeah, stick it on.

257
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,648
You have to sit and listen.

258
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,405
You can't chatter through it.
They're very hot on that.

259
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,606
Sit.

260
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,530
Sit and listen.

261
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,401
Diana.

262
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,971
Surprise.

263
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,961
What are you doing here?

264
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,406
Couldn't sleep. I thought I'd
come to see if I could help.

265
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,004
It's wonderful to see you,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

266
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,571
Right. So, bugger off, basically.

267
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,450
In the nicest possible way.

268
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,844
That's all right, I'm good at that.
I've had lots of practise.

269
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,925
It's been mad in here. I was
actually going to call you tomorrow.

270
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,929
- No, stop it.
- Just one more, please.

271
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,401
- You can't do this to me.
- Just one more. Please.

272
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,006
- I know you. You're News of the World.
- You've got a good memory.

273
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,730
I remember the ones I don't like

274
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,080
and I don't do them any favours.

275
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,851
- Clive, I'll call you back.
- Clive, it's Diana.

276
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,890
- This is out of order.
- We all have a <i>job</i> to do, ma 'am.

277
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,962
I come here to visit
the terminally ill,

278
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,520
people who need someone
to sit with them through the night.

279
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,931
<i>I completely understand that.</i>

280
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,321
Yes, and I'm allowed
to do this in privacy.

281
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,482
<i>Doors opening.</i>

282
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,569
No, there isn't going
to be a divorce.

283
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,406
<i>- But our readers...</i>
- Will you please follow the rules?

284
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,644
<i>- We'll do our best, ma 'am.</i>
- Good.

285
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,049
It's official. No more pictures.
Good night.

286
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,121
Shit.

287
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,609
Look, I do a job that requires me
to be very focused.

288
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,444
It's not going to be possible
for you and I to go out together

289
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,003
to a restaurant, anywhere, without a
million people swarming all over us.

290
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,524
That may be your life,
but it can't be mine.

291
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,481
Well, that's pretty clear then.

292
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,124
I'm sorry.
I think you're wonderful.

293
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,204
If there was a way, I'd take it.

294
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,526
Yes? Do I know you?

295
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,728
I'm the girl you were
going to ask on a date.

296
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,762
- All right, sexy?
- All right, sexy treacle? Nice arse.

297
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,921
Beautiful!

298
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,925
Gorgeous!

299
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,241
You should have
been here last week.

300
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,562
Somebody should have
been here last week.

301
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,724
We had bouncers on the door
throwing people in.

302
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,122
A bloke turned up with a £20 note
and we offered him a partnership.

303
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,441
- Is this fucking mic on?
- "Is this fucking mic on?"

304
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,730
Thank you, madam.
It's always nice to meet someone

305
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,929
who's been allowed out after dark
for the first time.

306
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,571
But now I'm delighted
to introduce a young band

307
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,969
that's making a big impression
on the London scene,

308
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,646
the Dwayne Johnson Quartet.

309
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,361
Hello?

310
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,450
Where are you?

311
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,009
No, don't apologise.

312
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,290
Saving lives is a little
bit more important.

313
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,845
You know how to show
a girl a good time.

314
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,204
Listen, Hasnat,
I'd love to do that,

315
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,285
but the next few days are
going to be a little bit tricky.

316
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,050
No, I can't.

317
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,569
Just watch your TV.

318
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,286
- Thank you, sir.
- Cheers.

319
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,085
<i>Yes, I did inflict upon myself.
I didn't like myself.</i>

320
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,244
<i>I was ashamed that I couldn't cope
with the pressures.</i>

321
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,887
<i>And what did you actually do?</i>

322
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,885
<i>Well, I just hurt my
arms and my legs.</i>

323
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,528
<i>Do you think Mrs Parker Bowles</i>

324
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,843
<i>was a factor in the breakdown
of your marriage?</i>

325
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,883
<i>Well, there were three
of us in this marriage,</i>

326
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,962
<i>so it was a bit crowded.</i>

327
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,522
<i>What evidence did you have
that their relationship was continuing,</i>

328
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,962
though you were married?

329
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,000
By the change in behavioural
pattern in my husband.

330
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,884
For all sorts of reasons that
a woman's instinct produces.

331
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,483
You just know.

332
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,483
<i>Do you think
you will ever be queen?</i>

333
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,162
<i>I'd like to be queen
of people's hearts,</i>

334
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,971
<i>in people's hearts,</i>

335
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,288
<i>but I don't see myself
as being queen of this country.</i>

336
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,967
<i>I don't think many people
want me to be queen</i>

337
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,327
<i>because they have decided that</i>

338
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,165
I'm a nonstarter.

339
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,165
Why do you think
they've decided that?

340
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,330
Because I do things differently,

341
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,602
because I don't go by a rule book,

342
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,921
because I lead from the heart,
not the head,

343
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,207
and albeit that's got me
into trouble in my work,

344
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,885
<i>I understand that,</i>

345
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,643
<i>but someone's got to go out there
and love people and show it.</i>

346
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,125
<i>I sit here with hope
because there's a future ahead,</i>

347
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,486
<i>a future for my husband,</i>

348
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,362
<i>a future for myself
and a future for the monarchy.</i>

349
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,168
<i>Your Royal Highness, thank you.</i>

350
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,169
- That's put the mockers on that, then.
- I suppose it has.

351
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,643
So, what have we got?

352
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,485
These are the transcripts of
the LBC early morning phone-in.

353
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,484
The women are very strong for you.
The men about 50/50.

354
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,326
Yes, I've analysed the TV pundits
and that trend carries through.

355
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,081
Please.

356
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,368
Good morning, Patrick.

357
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,366
Now, I suggested
you show the tape to a lawyer.

358
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,523
I offered to open up a formal
dialogue with Buck House.

359
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,523
I begged you to give
me a preview

360
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,571
so that we could build some
firewalls before the shelling began.

361
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,204
Now, you see, you keep telling me
everything's going to be all right.

362
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,881
Well, it's not all right,
it's all wrong.

363
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,602
I've been trying to reopen doors
and you've shut them.

364
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,406
Personally, I have been placed
in an invidious position.

365
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,723
I have no alternative
but to offer my resignation.

366
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,047
Since I haven't the faintest idea how
to manage this maelstrom you created,

367
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,282
I would like that resignation
to have immediate effect.

368
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,970
Well, Patrick.
You've been a rock.

369
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,161
What will you do?

370
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,170
Get a new rock.

371
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,083
Hello?
Yes, tell me what you thought.

372
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,446
I see.

373
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,845
Sonia. So what did you think?

374
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,840
I'll call you back later.

375
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,329
Everyone thinks I screwed up.

376
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,287
- I had to hit back. -Hitting
back is a short-term tactic.

377
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,362
What was your strategy?

378
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,650
I don't think I do strategy.

379
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,446
If your intention was to avoid a
divorce, you've achieved the opposite.

380
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,128
My parents divorced.

381
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,568
I made a vow to myself never to put
my children through the same thing.

382
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,241
So why would you do
something so drastic?

383
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,887
My boys need to see me happy.

384
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,767
It's time. I have to move on.

385
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,928
So you didn't screw up.

386
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,084
Because now you'll be free.

387
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,522
Here, cover yourself with this
blanket and lie down in the back.

388
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,361
That way, the security guards don't
know more about my life than I do.

389
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,722
- Have you done this before?
- Mind your own business.

390
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,490
- Suspension's very low.
- Explosive device?

391
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,649
Nah, too bulky. We're looking
at about 80 kilos there.

392
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,164
That'll be a Pakistani
heart surgeon, then.

393
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,330
I think we fooled them.

394
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,251
- Were you all right in there?
- Breathing was impossible.

395
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,408
Oh, come on,
that's just a detail.

396
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,046
I love feeling your hand there.

397
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,922
That day when I first saw you
was so powerful.

398
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,130
I don't think I've ever been
so struck by someone.

399
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,326
What do you mean?

400
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,726
It was like...
nothing could distract you.

401
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,850
You were just doing your job
without any sense of self.

402
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,884
- I'm a doctor.
- Yes, I know. But...

403
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,882
I can see how much love
you put into it.

404
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,323
Love is a garden.

405
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,570
If you can't smell the fragrance,
don't come into the garden of love.

406
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,127
- Who said that?
- Rumi.

407
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,126
Persian poet. 13th century.

408
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,242
"The garden of love."

409
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,971
I like that.

410
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,325
What happened here?

411
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,290
She stepped on a mine.
She was pregnant.

412
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,643
So, she... Did she lose the baby?

413
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,731
Yes. Because of that problem.

414
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,208
She's Helena.

415
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,647
- How old is she?
- Seven.

416
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,169
She went out to fetch water
and stood on a landmine.

417
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,128
Her intestines were blown
out of her body.

418
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,691
You Okay?

419
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,243
Sr.

420
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,009
Ma'am, a government minister
at home has called you a loose cannon

421
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,483
for supporting this campaign.
Do you have any reaction?

422
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,528
I'm only trying to
highlight a problem

423
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,410
that's going on all around
the world, that's all.

424
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,960
It's been said that
you're aligning yourself

425
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,846
with Labour Party policy.
Do you think that's wise?

426
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,407
Labour?
I don't know what...

427
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,049
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is a humanitarian mission.

428
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,809
It's enough to make you
burst into tears, that.

429
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,049
But who said I'm a loose cannon?

430
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,764
Mr Wonderful, come in.
Mr Wonderful. This is Angola calling.

431
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,689
<i>My darling,
they're attacking you.</i>

432
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,728
<i>Earl Howe, the junior defence
minister, called you...</i>

433
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,928
A loose cannon, yes, I know.

434
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,567
But did they print the
pictures of the kids

435
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,881
with all their arms
and legs blown off?

436
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,561
<i>No. They're making it look like
a routine hospital visit.</i>

437
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,091
Bastards! What shall I do?

438
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,006
<i>Use your power. You're the most
famous woman in the world.</i>

439
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,607
<i>You don't have to follow royal family
rules any more. You're divorced.</i>

440
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,365
<i>So think differently.
Improvise.</i>

441
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,891
Right.

442
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,646
Improvise.

443
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,050
Clear!

444
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,521
I have to do this by myself.

445
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,249
If I go with you, it gives them
the chance to belittle me.

446
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,167
Okay. Just keep to the path.
No veering left or right. Yeah?

447
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,331
All right.

448
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,011
Good luck.

449
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,283
What's all the fuss?
They've cleared this field already.

450
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,250
An Oxfam worker was killed
doing this three months ago.

451
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,842
Three weeks ago, that walk
would have been impossible.

452
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,161
I'd have been blown up
many times over.

453
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,728
Soon, all this land can be farmed again
and children can play in the fields.

454
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,284
But clearance is a lengthy
and hazardous process.

455
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,528
Humanity's only defence against landmines
is to stop manufacturing them.

456
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,526
Thank you.

457
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,763
There's something coming, fellas.

458
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,211
Is there?

459
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,771
Blimey.

460
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,764
Thank you, Charlie.

461
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,528
God, I missed you so much.

462
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,210
My beautiful.

463
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,570
I'm so proud of you.
You did it.

464
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,244
- It's all down to you.
- No.

465
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,289
Why do smokers always
smoke after sex?

466
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,805
After the greatest pleasure in life,

467
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,770
it's only natural to reach out
for the second greatest.

468
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,241
You should give up.
You of all people should know that.

469
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,000
- Some people are exempt.
Bollocks.

470
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,447
Some people lead a charmed life
and I'm one of them.

471
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,481
Wall-to-wall, 22-carat bollocks.
And I lead a charmed life.

472
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,409
No, I'm an expert and you're not.

473
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,244
I'm an expert on everything.

474
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,608
I know about fashion, polo,
criminal psychology,

475
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,808
- the internal combustion engine...
- Rubbish.

476
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,762
No, it's all part of my job. Embroidery.
Erm, erm, nuclear submarines.

477
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,448
Not an O level to my name and I'm...
What's that word? Erm...

478
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,722
- I'm an om... Omnibus?
- Omniscient?

479
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,529
Yes, see, I even knew that.

480
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,046
I've seen and done everything,
much more than you.

481
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,329
- You're just a specialist and I'm...
- What's that word?

482
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,642
Shut up.

483
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,726
Multiple choice. Is it dilettante,
polymath or ectomorph?

484
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,122
You're laughing at me. You can't
even speak proper English.

485
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,682
- I don't have to, I'm not English.
- Oh, you're so smug.

486
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,641
All you know about is
football and jazz and...

487
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,648
And saving people's lives.

488
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,685
Saving lives. That wasn't on
your list, Miss Polymath.

489
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,409
Oh, I knew it was polymath.

490
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,641
Saving people's lives.
Would you still like to see that?

491
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,291
Defib paddles.

492
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,841
Charge.

493
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,849
Shoot.

494
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,487
All right, everyone, close him up.

495
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,964
Thank you.
Once again we are the champions.

496
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,969
Your patient today, how bad was he?

497
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,130
He would have died
tomorrow or maybe the day after.

498
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,241
Now, he'll have another ten years.

499
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,527
You have power over death.

500
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,884
A doctor's triumphs are only temporary.
I learnt that from Victor Chang.

501
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,482
- The man you studied under in Sydney?
- Yes.

502
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,004
Now, he treated the whole patient
and without any ego.

503
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,003
With love, as you said.

504
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,528
So what happened to him?

505
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,520
Six years ago he was ambushed
for money on his way to work.

506
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,010
He refused to pay so the guy
shot Victor twice in the head.

507
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,280
"Where you are,
death will find you,

508
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,170
"even if you are in towers
built up strong and tall."

509
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,041
That's from the Quran.

510
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,927
I studied Islam a few years ago when I
was preparing for a trip to Pakistan.

511
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,530
See? I was getting ready for you
before I even knew you.

512
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,884
- Whose car is this?
- My butler's.

513
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,531
- What's your butler driving?
- My Audi.

514
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,406
Lucky butler.

515
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,050
- Where are we going?
- To the very edge of the kingdom.

516
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,082
Come on. Look at this.

517
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,806
- Now be careful.
- Oh.

518
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,602
You've brought me to
the end of the world.

519
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,520
Ah.

520
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,402
I'm going to Australia.

521
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,887
Why are you running
away from me?

522
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,123
The Victor Chang Institute
is doing a fundraiser.

523
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,881
I'm making the keynote speech.

524
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,450
- You're doing this for me?
- For us.

525
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,166
The world is ours.
This world and the world beyond.

526
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,924
I never think about
the world beyond.

527
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,647
You sleep with the Quran
at your bedside.

528
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,089
- Habit. Hardly ever read it.
- I know you do.

529
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,847
Islam is very important to me.

530
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,486
To me it means the constant
reformation of one's character.

531
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,487
Well, I believe in that.

532
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,924
I've been reforming my character
since I was seven

533
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,809
and it's finally getting
me somewhere.

534
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,443
Your divorce has put things
on a different footing.

535
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,081
- You mean with your family?
- Yes. A barrier has come down.

536
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,369
Well, barriers coming down is good.

537
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,845
Last one back to the car's
a squashed tomato.

538
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,087
- Look.
- What?

539
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,123
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

540
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,166
Your Royal Highness, it's been
an absolute pleasure.

541
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,482
Yes, they are a little rowdy.

542
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,488
<i>It was the social
event of the year</i>

543
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,364
<i>for the cream of Sydney society.</i>

544
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,201
<i>The opportunity to meet the
Princess of Wales at a charity ball</i>

545
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,521
<i>at a cost of £300 a head.</i>

546
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:27,643
<i>It has been said that for evil to
triumph, good men must do nothing.</i>

547
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:35,044
<i>Tonight we give heartfelt thanks
that a good man, Dr Victor Chang,</i>

548
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,369
<i>did a great deal,</i>

549
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,202
<i>and of that we can all be thankful</i>

550
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,809
<i>as we look forward to the future.</i>

551
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,042
<i>Doors opening.
Lift going up.</i>

552
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,043
That's him! That's him, look.

553
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,201
- Him?
- Yes!

554
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,086
Nice one.

555
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,567
What are we going to do?

556
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,683
Well, our objective
is to protect Hasnat.

557
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,605
So we rubbish the story.

558
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,321
- But they'll find out eventually.
- Well, we're buying time.

559
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,608
That's what we need, isn't it?

560
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,567
Talk about putting two and two
together and making five.

561
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,768
No, not a word.
Not a word of truth.

562
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,768
Officially I'm furious.
It's upsetting for Wills and Harry.

563
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,243
Unofficially, well, to be honest...

564
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,121
I mean, Richard, we're laughing
ourselves silly over this.

565
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,281
For God's sake.

566
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,167
What do I look like?
One minute everyone's pointing at me

567
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,686
because I'm sleeping
with the Princess of Wales.

568
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,206
Next thing she denies it all
and I'm the hospital joke.

569
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,170
- I was just trying to protect you.
- Protect?

570
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,489
Well, I knew you'd be upset.
That's why we rubbished the story.

571
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,008
Rubbish? Yes, good choice of word.
That's exactly what I felt like.

572
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,162
You can't object to being
on the front pages

573
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,006
and then complain when I protect you
from looking like Casanova.

574
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,320
You've blown our cover.

575
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,131
Well, it can be dealt with.
I'm good at handling the press.

576
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,851
- Oh, magnificent.
- Now I'm clear on what you want.

577
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,849
How could it not have been clear?

578
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,530
I am a surgeon!

579
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,490
I can't work with the paparazzi
sticking their cameras in my face.

580
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,564
Well, if you'd had to put up with
what I've had to put up with.

581
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,883
Exactly. I don't have to put up with it.
And I don't want to put up with it.

582
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,290
So what are you saying?

583
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,369
I'm saying there's no future.

584
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,724
The way your life is,
the way my life is...

585
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,406
It's pointless.

586
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,003
<i>- Hello, Dr Khan?</i>
- How did you get this number?

587
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,890
<i>- Would you like to make a comment?</i>
- How did you get this number?

588
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,327
<i>Is it all rubbish?
Will you be giving a quote on...</i>

589
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,730
The lights are on.

590
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,162
Sonia, it's me.

591
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:42,087
I'm sorry. I know it's 3:30
in the morning, but could you talk?

592
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,563
I'll never be happy again.

593
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,445
- It's the end, I just know it is.
- But I know it isn't.

594
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,966
You haven't gone this
far for nothing.

595
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,721
Oh, nobody goes this
far for nothing.

596
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,531
Come on.

597
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,765
Good morning, may I speak
to Hasnat Khan, please?

598
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,922
He's in the cardiac surgical unit.

599
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,207
<i>- Can you hold?</i>
- Yes, I'll hold.

600
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,487
<i>- I'm sorry, Dr Khan's not available.</i>
- He's not available?

601
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,804
What do you mean, he's not in?
Or he's in but not available?

602
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,482
Morning, love.
Can I have a word with Dr Khan, please?

603
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,404
- He's in the surgical unit.
<i>- They're very busy, I'm afraid.</i>

604
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:25,806
Yes, but it's rather urgent.
Me name's Rita. Rita Johnson.

605
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,846
Hasnat, it's me.

606
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,246
Hasnat!

607
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,730
Hasnat!

608
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,006
Hasnat!

609
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,688
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

610
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,763
I want to say this.

611
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,802
Yes, I've been a mad bitch.
Yes, I've been a stalker,

612
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,601
and, yes, worst of all, I put
on a crummy Liverpool accent

613
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,728
just to get your attention.

614
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,531
But I was provoked.

615
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,244
And I want to say if I upset you,
it was because, I don't know,

616
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,608
I was trying to celebrate you
and protect you at the same time

617
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,126
and those two things got confused.

618
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,289
But I think I have a
right to be confused

619
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,569
when I'm up against
a gorgeous creature like you.

620
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,127
Plus, I'm a princess
and I get what I want.

621
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,884
<i>- It was 5:00 in the morning...</i>
- The people have spoken.

622
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,488
I like the way Blair walks.
Like he's crossing a bridge.

623
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,090
He's what this country needs.

624
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,204
Yes, it is.

625
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,926
But I think we need to think
about beyond this country.

626
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,929
My work is here.

627
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,522
Well, only until you finish your PhD

628
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,564
and then we could pretty
much live anywhere.

629
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,689
- People...
- People have hearts everywhere.

630
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,240
- Yes, they do.
- Hearts that need repairing.

631
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,166
Exactly. America. Australia.

632
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,688
- See my point?
- Hmm.

633
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,923
If I could just get the boys away
from here for some of the time.

634
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,245
Somewhere warm.

635
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,926
<i>- The party that belongs to...</i>

636
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,768
There's been a communication
from my family.

637
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,200
Saying what?

638
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,807
Saying, "You are 36. This is beyond the
age when you are expected to marry."

639
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,684
- Haven't you escaped all that?
- The press stirred it up.

640
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,364
The Patan man is expected to marry

641
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,841
a woman who will run
an extended household.

642
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,321
A woman who will live
with the husband's family.

643
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,129
Someone from within the clan.

644
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,883
And what about you?
What are your feelings?

645
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,689
I want to save people's lives.

646
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,482
Hasnat,
I asked about your feelings.

647
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,606
I love you.

648
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,970
But do you want us to be together
in spite of all our problems?

649
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,844
- Do you want to make this work?
- Yes, I do.

650
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,081
- Then it's time I met your family.
- Are you serious?

651
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,641
Mmm-hmm.
I think I should go there

652
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,848
and they can get a good look
at who I really am.

653
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,729
Okay.
Then we'll go out there together.

654
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,849
Hasnat, we can't go together.

655
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,003
We'd be on the front page
of every newspaper in the world.

656
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,682
I'll go. Alone.

657
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,609
It doesn't matter how much
you charm the rest of the family.

658
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,729
The mother is the only one that counts.
She's the key.

659
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,449
And a tough nut to crack.

660
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,730
She's an educated woman from a
generation where such a thing is rare.

661
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,206
I would say two things.
Don't try to impress her,

662
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,330
and don't imply you're as close
to her son as you obviously are.

663
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,283
- Thank you. For you.

664
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,525
Diana, I'd like to introduce you
to Hasnat's father, Rasheed.

665
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,648
- Welcome, my dear.
- Hello.

666
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,526
Now then, Diana.
How good are you with names?

667
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,045
Diana, this is Hasnat's mother,
Naheed.

668
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,445
Lovely to meet you.

669
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,211
Thank you.

670
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,764
Sir Cyril Radcliffe.

671
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,851
An Englishman by that name
is given five weeks

672
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,801
to decide the fate of
90 million people.

673
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,209
And who advises him?
Mountbatten.

674
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,484
Your former husband's
favourite uncle.

675
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,811
Muslims go one way,
Hindus and Sikhs the other.

676
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,681
Six million people crossed the new
border, both ways, mostly on foot.

677
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,844
Inevitably, there are
clashes and massacres.

678
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,002
One million people died.

679
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:48,329
I was 16 and I can't
forget or forgive.

680
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,291
I'm sorry.

681
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,930
Yes, the English always say sorry
so beautifully.

682
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,481
It's a power cut.

683
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,327
- Right then.
- Come on, Diana!

684
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,601
Ready?

685
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,601
Oh!

686
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,087
- That was fun.
- Well done.

687
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,605
Diana, I want you to meet
Hasnat's grandmother, Nanny Appa.

688
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,051
Hello.

689
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,601
She says that you are
a young lioness.

690
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,603
You must forgive me.

691
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,161
I can't help saying my
piece about the British.

692
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,089
Now everyone please,
try very hard to relax.

693
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,931
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

694
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,525
God, it was magical. It was... It was like
a dream of how life should really be.

695
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,047
Children and grownups
and grandparents living together.

696
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,849
One big family.

697
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,607
And you know what your grandmother
called me? A young lioness.

698
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,881
Well, she's right, as always.

699
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,123
Hmm. Perhaps that's the future.

700
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,641
Being lions?

701
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,364
No. Living abroad.

702
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,929
But that's impossible.
My work, your boys.

703
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,847
Yes, I know my boys.
But anything's possible, isn't it?

704
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,046
We just have to make it possible.

705
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,446
Yes.

706
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,043
- Yes?
- Yes.

707
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,963
- Yes.
- Yes.

708
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,920
Diana!

709
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,769
<i>All of us, if we're
lucky, grow old.</i>

710
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,001
But in the future,

711
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,607
old people will make up a much larger
percentage of the population.

712
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,890
<i>The old, and that will include me,
will be weak but we won't be rare.</i>

713
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,811
<i>This will be the final
battles of our lives</i>

714
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,487
<i>and we must fight them by
establishing a habit of respect</i>

715
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,250
<i>for the older generation.</i>

716
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,126
<i>And by keeping our own skills fresh,
so that when we're in our 90s,</i>

717
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,362
<i>we can still be active, contributing
members of our communities and families.</i>

718
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,566
<i>Thank you.</i>

719
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,084
Bravo!

720
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,042
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- Thank you.

721
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,681
- Professor.
- Please, call me Christiaan.

722
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,127
Christiaan. Diana.

723
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,082
I want to tell you
something confidential.

724
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,367
I'm very good at keeping
secrets, except my own.

725
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,289
I'm in love with a heart surgeon.

726
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,005
He's still finishing his PhD
but I believe he's a man of genius.

727
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,411
What's his training?

728
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,326
He was a favourite pupil of Victor
Chang's. He's now with Professor Yacoub.

729
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,129
Well, that's some reference.

730
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,090
I want to marry him,
but he's a very private man.

731
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:42,769
We can't cope with England, so we're
thinking seriously about living abroad.

732
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,965
- You want me to find him a job?
- Yes.

733
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,924
<i>It was my son, William,</i>

734
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,961
<i>who suggested I should clear a load
of frumpy old frocks out of my closet</i>

735
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,888
<i>and give the proceeds to
the AIDS Crisis Trust charity.</i>

736
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,760
<i>I hope you've all remembered
your chequebooks for the garage sale.</i>

737
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,810
<i>Sony, auction.</i>

738
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:31,962
<i>And maybe some big laundry bags
so you can carry your clothes home.</i>

739
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,927
<i>Now I'm not going to stay and
watch you, and embarrass you,</i>

740
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,209
<i>but please, be generous</i>

741
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:47,365
<i>because there are so many people who
need you to be generous. Thank you.</i>

742
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,280
Hello?

743
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,927
This is Diana.
We just landed.

744
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,008
So tell me, how did it go?

745
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,886
What?

746
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,207
Five and a half million dollars?

747
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,006
Yes!

748
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,281
A written request for my CV from the
world's most famous heart surgeon,

749
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,725
to go with my job application.

750
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,890
There's been a slight mistake.

751
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,569
Did I apply for a job in Boston?

752
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,122
- Funny, I don't remember it.
- Things have got ahead of themselves.

753
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,170
Funnier still, I actually seem
to have got the job.

754
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,642
We talked about living abroad.

755
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,246
But we weren't really talking
about living abroad.

756
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,722
You are a wonderful doctor.
I was simply using my connections.

757
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,723
I don't want anything from you!

758
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,568
I've worked long and hard
to get myself a life.

759
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,961
Don't go and reorganise
it without asking!

760
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,204
I was trying to find a way
for us to be together.

761
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,282
Someone has to do something.

762
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,762
If you don't understand how I feel
about my work, how can we be together?

763
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,801
Yes.

764
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,203
- Boss, I don't know if you want this...
- They're not so bad, your security.

765
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,280
At least they've stopped
making jokes about my car.

766
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,486
Thank you, Paul.

767
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,603
The big one supports
Queens Park Rangers.

768
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,968
I've never met anyone who genuinely
supported Queens Park Rangers.

769
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,690
Hasnat!

770
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,362
I can't seem to live without you.

771
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,526
And yet the complications
of trying to find some way

772
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,525
of actually living with
you are just beyond me.

773
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,403
The Barnard thing.
You were trying to find a way.

774
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,209
I'm so sorry.

775
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,528
- Afternoon, Queens Park Rangers.
- Sir.

776
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,206
Hasnat, we're all very proud
of your achievements.

777
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,882
You're a brilliant doctor,
a shining light.

778
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,325
- What did the family think of Diana?
- The family loves Diana.

779
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,568
But it's a big question.

780
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,486
Should the most famous woman in
the world become part of our family?

781
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,726
And what's the answer?

782
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,608
Hasnat, you have been
blessed twice by God.

783
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,321
You have a calling as a doctor
and a wonderful girlfriend.

784
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,725
But is it possible to have both?

785
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,968
I've known you since you were a child.
You're a private person.

786
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,969
Do you really think you
can work as a doctor

787
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,445
when you are so much
in the public eye?

788
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,404
On the other hand,
if you were to marry Diana,

789
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,121
it would be a great thing for Pakistan
and for the whole Muslim world.

790
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,160
What did my mother think?

791
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,601
Your mother will never
give her approval.

792
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,603
Diana is a divorced
woman and a Christian.

793
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,444
In the long journey of life, from time
to time, we come to a fork in the road.

794
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,163
Hasnat,
it is time for you to choose.

795
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,803
- You make it sound so simple.
- Life is simple.

796
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,329
I love her so much.

797
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,764
See you in four weeks.

798
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,405
Bye, Mum.

799
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,884
This must be the only park
we haven't visited in London.

800
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,008
We've done all the others.

801
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,130
Well, clockwise or anticlockwise?

802
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,045
I don't mind.

803
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,690
Long day.
It was hot in the hospital.

804
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,601
It gets dangerous,
dodging the food trolleys

805
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,048
trying to finish their rounds
before the ice cream melts.

806
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:59,003
If it were just one thing,
I know we could find a way.

807
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,760
So my trip to Lahore was a failure.
I didn't win them over.

808
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,442
It's not to do with winning them over.
You can win anyone over.

809
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,524
But your family don't want
me to be your wife.

810
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,571
That's no surprise. I've never
once been accepted by a family.

811
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,166
Not my own. The one I married into.

812
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,648
When I think of the word, I shudder.

813
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,848
My family haven't said that.

814
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,884
But your mother won't
give us her blessing.

815
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,251
That dream that you have
of sitting in a compound in Lahore

816
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,561
surrounded by children
is impossible.

817
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,846
Why?

818
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,121
Because if I marry you, I have to
marry the whole world as well.

819
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,802
We can't simply be
a man and a woman.

820
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,201
But you must have known
that from the start.

821
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,567
When you fall in love, you just
keep going despite warning lights.

822
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,447
So now you've had the best of what's
on offer, you're just gonna clear off?

823
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,249
That's not true.
I've struggled to see

824
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,400
how I could marry the most
famous woman in the world.

825
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,922
But I'd be giving up the very
thing that defines me.

826
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,090
I want to make it work.
I can't stop loving you.

827
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,962
They always say that
when they're saying goodbye.

828
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,610
I'm not saying goodbye.

829
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,887
Except Charles.
I'll give him that.

830
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,760
- Don't bring him into it.
- Why not? You belong with him now.

831
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,723
You're on the list labelled
"the past". Aren't you?

832
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,485
I don't want to see it like that.

833
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,084
Then why call me in the middle of
the night to this godforsaken park

834
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,130
- to give me my marching orders?
- That's a bit dramatic.

835
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,121
Dramatic? Dramatic.
My whole life has been dramatic.

836
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,571
It's been full of the sound
of people shutting doors on me.

837
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,127
You say you love me,
you'll always love me.

838
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,647
Well, there's about five billion people
on this planet who can say that.

839
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,043
But is there one

840
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,327
who can stay with me?

841
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,529
Is this fucking mic on?

842
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,486
- I'm not saying it's over.
- Yes, you are. You just can't say it.

843
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,128
- I'm not saying it's the end.
- Have the courage. Go on, say it.

844
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,487
- I'm not saying it's the end.
- Yes, it is.

845
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,006
Okay, I'll say it. It's over!

846
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,689
Don't follow me.

847
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,161
Diana!

848
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,201
Bloody hell!

849
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,325
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am...

850
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,927
Boss, this won't take long.
People are unhappy

851
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,526
with the way things have been going
over the last few weeks.

852
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,927
Members of your staff feel
that they've been exposed

853
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,083
to situations that carry with them
an element of danger.

854
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,248
We'd like you to consider strategy.

855
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,210
There's a feeling there's no clear
direction at the moment.

856
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,446
You should perhaps...

857
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,370
Also, er, you've received
an offer from Dodi Fayed

858
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,251
to join him again on the Jonikal.
This time, just you.

859
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,886
Say yes.

860
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,209
So, where are we going?

861
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,408
Sardinia. Cala di Volpe.

862
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,922
Fox Creek. I'm very fond of foxes.

863
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,525
- Why so?
- They're like me.

864
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,769
We've all escaped from the Windsors.

865
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,850
- Hello?
- Jason Fraser.

866
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,486
What's happening?

867
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,606
- Where are you?
- Here.

868
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:10,367
- Where's here?
<i>- You know I love foxes.</i>

869
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,089
Work it out, handsome.

870
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,686
<i>Pronto?</i>

871
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,201
I've got something big.
Can you be somewhere this moment?

872
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,841
- Morning.
- Good morning. You sleep well?

873
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,369
What's the matter?

874
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,249
What is she up to?

875
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,487
There's no time to get
the Americans involved.

876
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,485
- Oslo's the last conference.
- But America signing would be huge.

877
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,769
- There are too many sticking points.
- There's basically only three.

878
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,241
Exemption for the border
between North and South Korea,

879
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,688
a delay in the treaty's implementation
and the whole smart mines issue.

880
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,807
Smart mines?

881
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,724
They blow themselves up within
seven years so the land is safe.

882
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,041
It means redefining
what a land mine is.

883
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,201
Stop the bus.

884
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,446
Your son?

885
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,811
<i>Kindly leave a
message after the beep.</i>

886
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,362
<i>Hasnat, it's me.</i>

887
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,123
<i>It's me.
I really want you to call me.</i>

888
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,367
<i>I mean really, really.</i>

889
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,165
Call me.

890
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,765
Hello?

891
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,608
Dodi.

892
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,966
The falling dream, I still get it.
But it's different these days.

893
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,685
How is the dream different?

894
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,410
Well, I don't know.
I suppose... I suppose it's...

895
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,569
Something I enjoy now.

896
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,689
I don't feel the need to be
caught any more.

897
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,606
So maybe it's not falling,
maybe it's more like flying.

898
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,122
When you first came to me, you told
me your quest was a spiritual one.

899
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,250
Well, we've danced with it a few
years and now the road is clear.

900
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,402
Your life is ahead of you.

901
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:38,280
With your talent and power,
you can do anything.

902
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,886
Does it feel right for you
to be going on this trip

903
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,769
now that you feel differently?

904
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,004
I've got to have a bit of fun, don't I?
And the boys are away so...

905
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,526
You're not going 'cause
you feel lonely?

906
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:07,286
Oonagh, now that I've been loved,
I don't feel lonely any more.

907
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,205
Go, go, go!

908
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,288
- Yeah?
- Hello, handsome.

909
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,800
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm looking right at you.

910
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,010
- Did you get some more shots?
<i>- Oh, yeah. Plenty.</i>

911
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,129
Good. Well, that's enough now.

912
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,404
<i>I'll see you back in London.</i>

913
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,489
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

914
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:17,122
<i>I really want you to call me-
I mean really, really.</i>

915
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,524
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

916
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:28,089
<i>I really want you to call me-
I mean really, really.</i>

917
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,609
Are you ready?

918
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,604
Hello, Paul.

919
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,003
Yes, has he rung?

920
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,329
Are you sure?

921
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,727
<i>This is Diana.
I can't take your call right now.</i>

922
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,165
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

923
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,081
Yes?

924
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:40,922
<i>We don't know if
Lady Di was dead or not.</i>

925
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,483
<i>And we... We just, er,
know she is dead</i>

926
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,928
<i>in the hospital La Pitié-Salpetriére
in Paris.</i>

927
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,001
<i>From the poet Rumi.</i>

928
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,005
<i>"Somewhere beyond right
and wrong there is a garden.</i>

929
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,128
<i>"I will meet you there."</i>

930
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:57,728
<i>"Somewhere beyond
right and wrong there is a garden.</i>

931
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,802
<i>"I will meet you there.</i>

932
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,362
<i>"I will meet you there."</i>
