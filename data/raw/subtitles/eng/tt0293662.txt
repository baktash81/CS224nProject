1
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,083
Go, go, go, go, go!

2
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,418
Move it, move it.

3
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,045
Move it! Let's go.

4
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,548
- Move, move!
- In the car.

5
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:48,386
Let's go.

6
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:49,679
There's four of you.

7
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,057
You can count. I'm impressed.
Now drive!

8
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:53,975
Rule one. Never change the deal.

9
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,269
The deal was transportation...

10
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:58,313
for three men with a combined
weight of 254 kilos.

11
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:00,774
Yeah, well this is a new deal.

12
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,359
An extra 80 kilos means...

13
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:04,945
we will not make your destination
on the gas I have allotted.

14
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:06,405
So, we'll stop and get more gas.

15
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,948
Every stop we make exposes us.

16
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,702
Every exposure increases
the risk of getting caught.

17
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,913
An extra 80 kilos means the Kony
shock absorbers I installed...

18
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:15,457
for this job will not give us
the ability...

19
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,376
to outmaneuver any police that
might be chasing us.

20
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:22,298
Which means if there is a chase,
we lose our advantage.

21
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,925
Which also increases
the possibility of getting caught.

22
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,843
I don't want to get caught.

23
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:28,554
You don't want to get caught.

24
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:29,889
Just drive the car, man,

25
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,431
or you're gonna catch a bullet
to the brains.

26
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,475
And who's going to drive?

27
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:34,100
Shoot this asshole! I'll drive.

28
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:37,104
Not without the ignition code,
you won't.

29
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:45,322
Three men. 254 kilos.

30
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,491
That was the deal.

31
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,584
Three men. 254 kilos.

32
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,086
Seat belts.

33
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:05,175
Shit!

34
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,427
Sh... shit!

35
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:44,633
See what I mean about the shocks.

36
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,181
Now it's time.

37
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,862
- Look out!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

38
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,368
One way, one way!

39
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,379
Look out, man! Look out!

40
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:24,550
Whoo-hoo!

42
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,563
Yes!

43
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,231
- Yeah!
- Yes!

44
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,068
Go, go, go!

45
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,000
No...

46
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,085
Shit!

47
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,327
- Aargh...
- No, no, no!

48
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,955
If you don't mind, I just
conditioned the leather back there.

49
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,460
Take us to the drop point.

50
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,795
Not yet.

51
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:56,897
Hello.

52
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:58,439
- The cops! The cops!
- The cops now!

53
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,025
What are you doing?
Don't stop now.

54
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,152
- Do something.
- Come on, do something.

55
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,280
- What are you thinking?
- What are we doing now?

56
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:07,699
Don't even think it, man.

57
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,994
No, nooooo!!

58
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:10,953
Don't do this.

59
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,831
- No! No!
- No, no, no, no, no!

60
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,064
Your gun, please.

61
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,245
- You gave me too much.
- I need you to take us to Avignon.

62
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,457
The deal was this far, no further.

63
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,085
The deal is the deal.
Rule number one.

64
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,294
Rules are meant to be broken.

65
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:19,796
Not mine.

66
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:23,925
Let's go.

67
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:26,469
Get in the car.

68
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:28,430
Come one, hurry!

69
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:30,683
Move it!

70
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:15,521
...really I did.

71
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,483
Oh yeah, well, how come you don't
have your yellow card with you?

72
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,944
Well, I, I... must've left it
back in Nam on the base.

73
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,740
Yeah, they all say that. "Left it
back in Nam on the base." Uh-huh.

74
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,657
Let me show you what we do
to people who left it...

75
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:27,868
back in Nam on the base.

76
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,537
Oh, no. Please let go of me!
Where are you taking me?

77
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,623
You gotta be punished for not
carrying your shot record...

78
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,625
on you. It's a fate
far worse than death.

79
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,209
Oh, hell, no...

80
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,968
...the Argentinian government"
reaffirmed its commitment...

81
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:46,845
to meeting the IMF started
this year.

82
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,848
And yesterday in Nice
four men robbed...

83
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,893
the Alliance Investment
Corporation.

84
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,354
One man died on the sidewalk.

85
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,064
The others were apprehended
early this morning...

86
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:00,235
when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street in Avignon...

87
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,737
and ran into a taxi cab.

88
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,573
The police said, were it not
for the poor driving habits,

89
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,993
the 20 million euros in bearer
bonds would have been cashed...

90
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,162
and gone by this afternoon.

91
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,749
And in other news,
the stock market closed...

92
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:20,923
I always say the way a man treats
his car is how he treats himself.

93
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,842
I'd say that's probably true,
Inspector.

94
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,556
You have a good sense of humor
for a foreigner, Monsieur Frank.

95
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,266
Like the French, sly wit.

96
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,811
Just the right amount of flavor.

97
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:34,604
Been out driving?

98
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,481
Until they pass a law,
says I can't.

99
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,608
Do you want to come in
for a coffee?

100
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:43,446
Thank you, but I have a lot
of stops to make. 88 to be exact.

101
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:45,449
That's a lot of stops.

102
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,328
A lot of 1999 black BMW 735s...

103
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:53,665
with 0-6 on their license plates
to check out.

104
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,628
Ah, it's a very popular car
with a certain type down here.

105
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:58,963
You've seen them.

106
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,300
They come over from Italy
in those very expensive suits,

107
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,594
and the young pretty girls
with the big jewelry...

108
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,346
and too much make-up.
Very...

109
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,015
Mafia.

110
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,518
There was a robbery.
A getaway.

111
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:15,980
Some very fancy driving.

112
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:20,485
By someone in
a 1999 black BMW 735?

113
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:23,237
Yeah, with 0-6 on the plate.

114
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:26,700
You have been in the city lately?

115
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,118
Not for a while.

116
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,786
I love Nice.

117
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,414
The food. The way they grill fish.

118
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,335
No place else in France
does it the way they do in Nice.

119
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,502
And the women.

120
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,381
I prefer the women there.

121
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,596
They are more complicated
than the local variety,

122
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,389
don't you think?

123
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,561
I don't particularly like
complicated.

124
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,228
You like to keep it simple.

125
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:55,813
Why are you so interested?

126
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:59,360
Oh, you know... uh,
ever since I'm a little boy,

127
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:02,195
military people have always
intrigued me.

128
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,656
I'm ex-military.

129
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:06,241
I'm an ex-little boy.

130
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,541
Sure you don't have time
for a coffee?

131
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:19,381
Everything is always so neat
with you, Monsieur Frank.

132
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,635
Nothing ever out of place.

133
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:25,220
I take that as a compliment,

134
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:28,348
coming from a man who pays
attention to every detail.

135
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:33,144
Maybe I'll come back later
for that coffee.

136
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,856
Door's always open to you.

137
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:51,122
Lupo gave me your number.

138
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,081
Be brief.

139
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:53,624
I'm looking for a transporter.

140
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm listening.

141
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,592
One bag. That's it.

142
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,884
Dimensions?

143
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,139
Be specific.

144
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:09,224
1 meter 50 by half a meter.

145
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,392
Weight?

146
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,394
50 kilos. Not more.

147
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,023
Destination?

148
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:20,110
24 Rue de Luxembourg.
You're delivering to Mr...

149
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,155
Rule two. No names.

150
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,284
Time of pickup?

151
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,536
7 o'clock in the morning.
At the front door.

152
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:36,377
A package. 1 meter 50 by 50.
50 kilos. 250 kilometers.

153
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:39,089
Traveling within the speed limit.
One stop for refreshments.

154
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:42,633
40,000.
Half now, half on delivery.

155
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:44,469
Delivery will be at noon.

156
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,637
If no one is there,
it is not my responsibility.

157
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,807
I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal,

158
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,477
the terms of that deal cannot
be changed or renegotiated.

159
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:52,644
Another rule?

160
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,146
It's rule number one.

161
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:56,440
Do we have a deal?

162
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,282
You're very precise.

163
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,992
Transportation is
a precise business.

164
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:10,685
Flat.

165
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,375
Hi.

166
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,965
Now, don't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

167
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,342
I'm just gonna make a hole
so you can drink.

168
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:42,385
That's all I'm gonna do.

169
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,053
Please. Please!

170
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:45,221
Please, come on.

171
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,404
Come on, drink.

172
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,325
Slowly.

173
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,755
OK, OK, that's enough.

174
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,424
Good girl.

175
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,010
I'm going to take the tape off.

176
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,637
If you scream, I'll have
to kill you. Understand?

177
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,184
I have to pee.

178
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,271
You want me to do it in your car?

179
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,651
OK.

180
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,913
I'm gonna take my knife now,
so don't scream, OK?

181
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,289
It's to cut you free.

182
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,338
You don't need your mouth to pee.

183
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,640
You have one minute.

184
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,061
Fifty-five,

185
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,354
fifty-four,

186
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,064
fifty-three,

187
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:55,524
fifty-two,

188
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:06,369
Breaking the rules, Frank.
Not good to break the rules.

189
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:15,753
Fifteen.

190
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,925
Seven...

191
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:25,388
two...

192
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:27,892
Time's up.

193
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:33,105
Don't make me drag you out.

194
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,037
Shit!

195
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,793
No, please, no.

196
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,298
Rule three.
Never look in the package.

197
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:42,594
Hope you enjoyed your pee,
'cause it's your last on this trip.

198
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,920
You see what comes
of breaking the rules?

199
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,022
Jerk!

200
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:58,674
You're late.

201
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,384
Ran into a little problem.

202
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,764
Nothing serious?

203
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:09,061
Nothing serious.

204
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:23,909
You open the package?

205
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Rule three.

206
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,079
Never open the package.

207
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:29,539
I like that.

208
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:31,166
Rules.

209
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,753
You can't get anything done
in a world without rules.

210
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,755
You're a foreigner, right?

211
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:39,758
It's a nice little thing you've
got going for yourself here.

212
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:43,096
High class. Good reputation.

213
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:45,390
I didn't get your name.

214
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:48,101
Rule two. No names.

215
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:49,936
Of course.

216
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:03,951
You don't count it.

217
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,413
Why? Should I?

218
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,414
No. No.

219
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:10,916
That concludes the deal.

220
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:18,466
You know, I was wondering,

221
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:23,471
if you wouldn't mind
transporting something for me.

222
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:28,143
That's what you do, right?
You deliver, no questions asked.

223
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:32,981
Why not?

224
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,195
Weight?

225
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,783
Maybe a kilo.

226
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,618
Destination?

227
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:48,539
Grenoble. 306 Rue Du Lac.
A Mr....

228
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,001
Oh, right. I forgot.

229
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,669
Rule two.

230
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:15,358
I like him.

231
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:50,917
What the f...?!

232
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,660
Where is he?

233
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:53,983
You're like dog shit.
You're everywhere.

234
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:58,822
Yeah, I know. I know you wanna pee.
All you wanna do is pee.

235
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,541
Shit.

236
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,978
Frank, you stupid shit.

237
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:59,157
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

238
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,283
No long speeches.
Just keep it simple. Got it?

239
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:06,789
Who are you?

240
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,084
My name is Lai.
I come from Ch...

241
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:14,298
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

242
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,965
Nothing more, nothing less.

243
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,967
Do you wanna try again?

244
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:23,849
What kind of shit am I in?

245
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:27,186
Deep shit. Very deep shit.
Those guys...

246
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:29,228
Sorry, sorry, I won't say anyth...

247
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,346
Bon appétit.

248
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,598
Where are you going?

249
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,183
To bed.

250
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,228
I can't think straight
when I'm tired.

251
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:09,897
A good night's sleep,
I always see things better.

252
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,065
Can I leave?

253
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,566
Be my guest.

254
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,438
Hey.

255
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,191
Are you comfortable?

256
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:15,611
- Boss...
- Shh. Save your strength.

257
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,324
Just tell me. Who did this?

258
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,160
The transporter.

259
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,206
The transporter's dead.

260
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:27,290
He's not.

261
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:34,214
Believe me.

262
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:38,177
I believe you.

263
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,388
And the police?

264
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:42,515
They were here?

265
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:43,641
No...

266
00:37:44,184 --> 00:37:45,643
You told them nothing, right?

267
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:47,353
Right.

268
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:49,021
Of course.

269
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,651
You couldn't talk.

270
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:55,863
Yeah.

271
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:02,119
Let's keep it that way.

272
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,767
I picked them
from the garden outside.

273
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:05,976
I hope you don't mind.

274
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:09,856
I didn't know if you like
coffee or tea.

275
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:11,524
So I made both.

276
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:27,208
I hope you like, uh,

277
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,918
Mad-e-leines...

278
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:31,338
Try one.

279
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,301
Careful!

280
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:37,761
It's hot.

281
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,139
Good?

282
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,606
Let me.

283
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,277
I like it quiet in the morning.

284
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:55,363
Yes. Quiet in the morning.

285
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,949
Me too, me too.
I'm the same way.

286
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,033
I like very quiet.

287
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:03,662
Sorry.

288
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,046
Are you looking for milk?

289
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,008
Uh, there's milk at the door.

290
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:17,219
Stay, stay. I'll go.

291
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:24,518
Hi.

292
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:28,855
And you are?

293
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:31,108
The new cook.

294
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:33,193
Is Monsieur Frank in?

295
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:36,405
Ah, Monsieur Frank.

296
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:39,409
Is your invitation for coffee
still open?

297
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,703
Sure, come on. Please, sit.

298
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:45,332
Madeleine?

299
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,499
Homemade?

300
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:47,876
Yes.

301
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:49,711
I'll bring some more.

302
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,837
Ah...

303
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:54,174
My mother used to make
fresh madeleine every morning.

304
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:58,553
I smell them and my whole childhood
comes back in one big flood.

305
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:00,096
Like Proust.

306
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,141
You ever read Proust,
Monsieur Frank?

307
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,891
No.

308
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:04,894
Ah. He's fantastic.

309
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,896
Memory like a steel trap.

310
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:09,565
He would have been a great cop.
A real detail man.

311
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,399
Milk?

312
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:11,233
Please.

313
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:14,111
Thank you.

314
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,407
I used to have
a memory like Proust.

315
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,785
Like a filing cabinet up there.

316
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:23,497
I would see something
and remember it like that.

317
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,123
Like, uh, license plates.

318
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,626
I could see a plate and
it was printed in my head.

319
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:31,129
Now I need all the help I can get
remembering...

320
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,423
whose plate goes with whose car.

321
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:35,884
Like uh, this one.

322
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:39,764
It's mine.

323
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:42,099
Ah! Memories.

324
00:41:42,226 --> 00:41:44,643
So, where's the rest of the car?

325
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:46,354
I was hoping you could tell me.

326
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,271
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

327
00:41:48,357 --> 00:41:50,316
I went down to Frejus
to pick up a few things.

328
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,859
When I came out of the market,
it was...

329
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:52,735
Gone?

330
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,612
Did you report it?

331
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:57,115
It's the first on my list
of things to do today.

332
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:00,118
It's a long walk from Frejus.
How did you get home?

333
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,161
I brought him.

334
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:06,417
I saw him walking
along the dark road.

335
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:08,252
A risky thing.

336
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,962
Picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

337
00:42:12,006 --> 00:42:13,966
He had a kind face.

338
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,263
I didn't see a car outside.

339
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,389
It's in the garage.

340
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,266
- May I see it?
- Uh-huh.

341
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:39,993
Whew! Wow.

342
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,833
Ah. Pretty nice car for a cook.

343
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:50,504
Hey, some people have a problem
with the Germans.

344
00:42:50,964 --> 00:42:52,006
They're too aggressive.

345
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:54,341
They take up the best beaches
in summer.

346
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:56,676
They can't cook worth a damn.

347
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:03,726
I say anyone makes such great cars
can't be all bad.

348
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,687
I would say your intuition
worked out very well...

349
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:08,398
for Monsieur Frank, Mademoiselle.

350
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:11,860
Worked out for both of us.

351
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:17,365
Bon!

352
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:20,619
My intuition says
this is probably...

353
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:23,205
a good time for me
to go file my report.

354
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:24,999
Where's the rest of my car?

355
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:27,542
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

356
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:30,087
It was blown to pieces
at a rest stop.

357
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:34,425
What's left of it
is down at the lab.

358
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,052
They're trying to separate...

359
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:40,223
what was left of the two cops
in the trunk from the rest of it.

360
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:44,352
But you wouldn't know anything
about that.

361
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,353
No.

362
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,480
Sorry to interrupt.

363
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:50,066
Thank you for the coffee
and... the memories.

364
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,901
Come back any time.

365
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:53,779
Would you mind walking me?

366
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:55,029
No.

367
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:57,324
You have always been very quiet...

368
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:59,284
about your business,
Monsieur Frank.

369
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,204
I appreciate that.
Less work for mother.

370
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:06,251
But this business at the rest stop,
this is not very quiet.

371
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:08,586
I don't suppose you would like
to tell me something...

372
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,462
besides a stolen car story?

373
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:12,340
If I had one, I would.

374
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,091
Well, may I suggest...

375
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,052
that when the two of you show up
in my office after lunch,

376
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:21,266
you have one... a better one
than you currently have.

377
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:31,443
You are the one he wants
to see, not me.

378
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:32,652
Quiet!

379
00:44:33,113 --> 00:44:34,947
Please, I have to think.

380
00:44:35,282 --> 00:44:37,241
You were supposed to think
last night.

381
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:39,994
Yeah, well, last night,
I had nightmares.

382
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:42,788
About a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life,

383
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:43,872
screwed it all up.

384
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:45,291
Everything she touched broke,

385
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:48,377
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

386
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:49,962
OK. Sorry.

387
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:53,591
I'm still wondering...

388
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:56,970
if I wanna know everything
or nothing about you.

389
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:06,479
What?

390
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:08,607
Just the quiet.

391
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,650
I thought you like quiet.

392
00:45:14,155 --> 00:45:15,990
Yeah, not this quiet.

393
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:37,470
Are you OK?

394
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:38,262
No.

395
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:39,806
Good. Let's go.

396
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:50,567
Go, go, go!

397
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,041
No! Don't stay there!

398
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,115
Frank!

399
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:38,743
Come on, give me your hand!

400
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,228
Come on.

401
00:47:06,605 --> 00:47:08,107
Come on, get in, get in!

402
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,275
No! No!

403
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,109
Get in!

404
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,073
Lai, look. Come on.
You wanna die?

405
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:17,450
Get in.

406
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:42,225
Calm down. OK?

407
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,979
Don't worry. You OK?

408
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:47,440
Stay here.
I'm coming back.

409
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:49,776
No! Wait, wait!

410
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:04,165
Put it on.

411
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:08,170
You OK?

412
00:48:08,587 --> 00:48:09,963
Sure? OK.

413
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:11,507
Let's go.

414
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:52,446
Frank?

415
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,073
Is this your house?

416
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,578
Frank?

417
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,288
Yeah, guess.

418
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:05,626
Frank!

419
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:15,803
Should mind my own
goddamn business.

420
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,975
Simple rule, simple little rule.

421
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,605
There's gotta be some dry clothes
in this house.

422
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,982
Don't open the package.

423
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,195
Nothing but trouble
if you open the goddamn package.

424
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,156
Frank...

425
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,620
What are you doing?

426
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,497
Making up for the trouble.

427
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:48,964
Wait, wait.

428
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:51,507
- Why are you making...?
- No more questions.

429
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:57,137
Wait. I don't like it
when things get complicated.

430
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,057
You like things simple.

431
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:00,976
Very simple.

432
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:21,330
I'm not so clear about the house.
Could you explain?

433
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,250
Mmm. One more time.
After I left...?

434
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,044
After you left, we went for a walk
on the beach. Had a swim.

435
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,921
Where again?

436
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:28,963
Past the point.

437
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,716
Anyone else swimming at that time?

438
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:31,465
No.

439
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:33,259
Did you see anybody else swimming?

440
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:34,720
No. No one.

441
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,848
So, you took a walk,

442
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,060
had a swim on a beach where
no one else was swimming,

443
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:43,562
past the point,

444
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:47,274
where you can't see or be seen
from the beach on either side,

445
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,985
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

446
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:54,698
That's the point of a romantic
swim. Who wants witnesses?

447
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:58,411
And then?

448
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:00,747
Then we came back to the house
and found it on fire.

449
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,707
Just like that? On fire?

450
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,125
Yes.

451
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:09,213
And the 5,000 rounds of spent ammo
my men found all around the house?

452
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:10,631
Maybe they had the wrong house.

453
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:15,094
Monsieur Frank, people with
this kind of firepower...

454
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,140
do not make mistakes
about who they visit.

455
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:21,101
Who would want you this dead?

456
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:22,936
I don't know.

457
00:52:23,145 --> 00:52:24,772
Any problems with a client?

458
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:27,149
I don't have clients. I'm retired.

459
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:29,903
I live on my army pension.
You know that.

460
00:52:29,986 --> 00:52:31,571
You have all the facts
of who I am and who I was.

461
00:52:31,654 --> 00:52:32,821
You've had them for years.

462
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,532
Any enemies you can think of?

463
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:35,700
People from the past?

464
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:37,827
I left the past behind
when I moved here.

465
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:42,582
Hmm. A past like yours,
you never leave behind.

466
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:47,796
I'll just be a moment.

467
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,297
Don't leave.

468
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:04,814
What are you doing?

469
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:08,025
Computers know everything.
You just need a password.

470
00:53:08,193 --> 00:53:10,736
What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.

471
00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:12,363
You're always complaining,

472
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,199
except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

473
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:29,464
Uh-huh.

474
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:33,260
Aaahh...

475
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:40,810
La, la, la...

476
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:42,185
Hello!

477
00:53:43,062 --> 00:53:43,813
See?

478
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,376
So, where will you be staying?

479
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:05,335
I don't know.

480
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:08,045
My cousin has a small hotel.

481
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:11,383
Thanks. But we'll manage.

482
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,428
Without money,
it would be hard. Here...

483
00:54:15,013 --> 00:54:17,848
It's not much but at least
you won't go hungry.

484
00:54:18,183 --> 00:54:19,434
Thank you.

485
00:54:32,448 --> 00:54:34,574
- Where are you going?
- Going to see that guy.

486
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:35,783
Good luck.

487
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:36,951
One minute.

488
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:38,662
You're not coming?

489
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:39,621
No.

490
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,581
But he blew up your car.

491
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,082
I'll buy a new one.

492
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:45,710
- He burned your house.
- I'll rebuild it.

493
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,087
He tried to kill you!!

494
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:48,796
And as far as he now knows,
he succeeded.

495
00:54:48,924 --> 00:54:50,298
Look. I'm gonna give you
some advice.

496
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:52,384
I don't know what you were into.
I don't care what you were into.

497
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:54,011
But whoever wanted you dead
thinks you are dead.

498
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:57,056
You have a free pass to start over.
Here's the advice.

499
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,807
Start over!

500
00:55:05,024 --> 00:55:07,442
There are 400 people...

501
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:11,571
dying in a container on a ship.

502
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:16,076
My father,

503
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:18,411
My sisters...

504
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:22,083
The ship arrives today.

505
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,335
They will make my father a slave.

506
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:31,591
The only one who knows
the container number is that guy.

507
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:33,970
You're very good.

508
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:36,097
What do you mean?

509
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:38,057
The moment you saw
those pictures in my house,

510
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,184
you were setting me up
to get involved in this.

511
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:42,728
Breakfast. Giving the excuse
to the cop to help me.

512
00:55:42,981 --> 00:55:44,815
One lie after another.

513
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,859
Not everything is a lie.

514
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,778
Name one thing that isn't.

515
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:57,703
What happened in the house
between us.

516
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,873
That was not a lie.

517
00:56:04,169 --> 00:56:08,506
You were a soldier.
Your job was to save people.

518
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:09,924
Past tense.

519
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:11,341
What does that mean?

520
00:56:11,509 --> 00:56:13,677
It means I got tired of seeing
my best efforts get turned...

521
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:17,056
into bullshit by the same people
who pay me to do the job.

522
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:18,349
No one cared.

523
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,853
This time, I care.

524
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:39,705
Hey. Thank you.

525
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,052
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour.

526
00:56:52,302 --> 00:56:53,887
No phone calls for half an hour.

527
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:56,764
Hello. Surprise!

528
00:57:04,148 --> 00:57:04,939
Sit.

529
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:19,372
Put your hands where
I can see them.

530
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:22,208
So, before we get to the heart
of the matter,

531
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:25,586
I have one question for you.
Why did you try to kill me?

532
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,088
You lied to me.

533
00:57:27,215 --> 00:57:29,841
You opened the package.
You broke the rules.

534
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:30,925
Your rules.

535
00:57:31,093 --> 00:57:34,261
What did you expect me to do?
Recommend you for another job?

536
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,517
What's the ship number?

537
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,272
Mr. Transporter,

538
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:47,526
we can both agree I answered
your first question politely.

539
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:52,865
I won't answer any more.
So I suggest you kill me right now.

540
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:56,451
And go screw yourself.

541
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:00,540
I can't find anything.

542
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:09,048
Oh, poor Frank...

543
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:12,136
What did she tell you? We're
smuggling people in containers?

544
00:58:12,595 --> 00:58:15,304
I tell you,
Lai is the perfect name for her.

545
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:16,806
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.

546
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:19,852
Your father's here. He'll really
get a kick out of this.

547
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:21,645
I thought your father was
in the container.

548
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,564
Yes... I, I mean no.

549
00:58:23,982 --> 00:58:26,442
There are 400 people
in that container.

550
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:28,735
Stay where you are!

551
00:58:28,987 --> 00:58:31,738
She's a real heartbreaker,
isn't she, Frank?

552
00:58:34,617 --> 00:58:35,827
Ten seconds. Two choices.

553
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:38,163
The information on the paper
or your brains on the desk.

554
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:39,997
Now tell me I'm lying.

555
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:41,958
- Nine, eight...
- Lai. Lai!

556
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:42,833
Give me the gun.

557
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,626
I don't know
what you're talking about.

558
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:48,757
...five, four, three, two...

559
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:51,217
One. Shoot.

560
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:56,682
Lai!

561
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:08,777
Would I kill my own daughter?
Lai.

562
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:12,239
Come on, now.

563
00:59:13,492 --> 00:59:14,700
Put it down.

564
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,497
We'll talk.

565
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,460
She thinks we're smuggling people
in containers.

566
00:59:25,046 --> 00:59:26,338
I don't know where you get
these ideas.

567
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:27,464
Stay away!

568
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:34,721
Would you kill your own father?

569
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:39,851
Please. I'm begging you.
Stop what you are doing.

570
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:43,064
I do what I do.
I am who I am.

571
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:47,776
I will never change.
So if you could kill me, kill me.

572
00:59:48,195 --> 00:59:51,489
But if you don't,
get this gun out of my face!

573
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:55,910
Give me.

574
00:59:56,704 --> 00:59:57,578
No!

575
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,749
I know he's innocent.
Oh, you have such a good heart.

576
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:05,087
Always interested in saving
innocent people.

577
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:06,755
Well, here's your big chance.

578
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:08,048
Drop your gun...

579
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:10,676
and you will save one.

580
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,725
- Kill him!
- No!

581
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,145
The police are on the way up.

582
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:23,939
- What now?
- Take her.

583
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:29,070
Send in Lee.
I need him to wrap something up.

584
01:00:45,547 --> 01:00:48,632
Just for the record. There aren't
400 people in that container.

585
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,468
Only 395 made it here alive.

586
01:00:52,804 --> 01:00:53,762
Frank!

587
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:00,102
Inspector. Am I glad you're here.

588
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:02,147
What is this?

589
01:01:02,355 --> 01:01:04,316
This man used
my partner's daughter here...

590
01:01:04,442 --> 01:01:05,817
trying to blackmail us.

591
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:08,485
Luckily my security got
the drop on him.

592
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,741
I want to press charges.
Kidnapping. Extortion. Assault.

593
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:14,117
I know this man.

594
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:18,163
I suppose, in your business,
you have to know all types.

595
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:22,167
Now should I call my lawyer?

596
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:24,003
We'll handle it.

597
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:32,510
I'll expect all of you down at
my office to give your statements.

598
01:01:32,678 --> 01:01:36,515
As soon as I contact my lawyer,
we'll be more than happy to oblige.

599
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:46,609
Oh... Hmmm...

600
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,413
The doctor said you will have
a headache for a few days...

601
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:00,749
and then everything will go back
to normal.

602
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:01,958
Where are they?

603
01:02:02,126 --> 01:02:06,798
I think you should be more
concerned with where you are.

604
01:02:08,717 --> 01:02:12,053
What got into you?
You were always so careful.

605
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,596
I've got to get out of here.

606
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:16,015
Oh... with the charges they filed,

607
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:19,060
you will not be getting out
for a very long time.

608
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,521
Assaulting a distinguished...

609
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,731
member of the international
business community,

610
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:26,567
kidnapping his daughter,
extortion...

611
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:31,281
I'm sorry, Frank,
I would like to help you.

612
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:34,158
But if you continue
with the same old story,

613
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:36,870
"I am retired,
living on a pension..."

614
01:02:38,206 --> 01:02:41,333
I need fresh, Frank.
I need new.

615
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,211
For once I need the truth.

616
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:48,257
OK.

617
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,511
They're smuggling people.

618
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:54,388
From Asia. Through Marseilles.
In containers.

619
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,059
You know this for fact?

620
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:00,103
The girl told me.

621
01:03:00,438 --> 01:03:01,271
You believe her?

622
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:02,689
Yes.

623
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:05,525
In French we have a saying.
"Never believe the cook."

624
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:08,946
She's not the cook.

625
01:03:09,363 --> 01:03:11,866
Oh. I suspected.

626
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,244
You know, Frank,
no one is perfect.

627
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:16,620
So you're saying
you're gonna do nothing.

628
01:03:16,747 --> 01:03:20,291
No, I'm saying I'm going
to start an investigation.

629
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,460
And in the meantime
the 400 people in that container...

630
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:23,627
could be dead already.

631
01:03:23,754 --> 01:03:26,673
But what am I supposed to do?
There are laws.

632
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:27,674
Did it ever occur to you...

633
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,176
that sometimes you have to make
your own law?

634
01:03:29,302 --> 01:03:30,176
Like you do?

635
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,804
At least with me it doesn't take
twelve months to get the job done.

636
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:36,600
Oh, yes, I know. That's what I
admire about you, Frank.

637
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:40,395
All that army training.
All that sneaking around.

638
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:44,149
A man like you could probably
resolve this case in how long?

639
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,902
Twelve hours?

640
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:47,611
Less.

641
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:50,656
Less? Impressive.

642
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:53,493
You would be the perfect man
for the job.

643
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:56,036
Yes. If I were out.

644
01:03:56,245 --> 01:03:58,872
Yes. If you were out.

645
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:21,896
Anybody moves and I kill him.

646
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:03,274
If this is how you transport,
I'm amazed you get any work at all.

647
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,359
Come on, give me a hand.

648
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:16,412
Maybe I should go with you?

649
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,707
Thanks. But, uh...
I'm better alone.

650
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,253
That is a very small boat
to fight a very big war.

651
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,337
Yep.

652
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:26,756
It's a good boat.

653
01:05:26,883 --> 01:05:28,633
Frank, here.

654
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:31,219
You'll need it.

655
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,225
Or, maybe not.

656
01:07:04,568 --> 01:07:07,195
Shipment's cleared.
Here's the paperwork.

657
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,198
Take the highway all the way
to the first exit Lyon.

658
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:11,950
Go straight to the warehouse.

659
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:14,285
We'll be right behind you
just in case.

660
01:07:30,887 --> 01:07:33,014
Hey! We are ready to go.

661
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,564
Lai, dear...

662
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,658
I spent thousands of dollars
for you to go to school...

663
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:53,160
and learn English.

664
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,412
The least you can do is speak it.

665
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,496
I hate you.

666
01:08:00,794 --> 01:08:02,920
I'm still your father.

667
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:06,424
Get her out of here!

668
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:27,528
Give me a minute.

669
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:29,030
Aaaagh...

670
01:08:55,016 --> 01:08:56,059
Keep him alive.

671
01:09:39,605 --> 01:09:40,647
Let's go.

672
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:39,542
No, don't.

673
01:10:42,129 --> 01:10:43,171
Let's go.

674
01:17:18,753 --> 01:17:19,669
Bitch!

675
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:06,718
Good morning. You lost?

676
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,222
I'm looking to do
a little sightseeing.

677
01:18:10,723 --> 01:18:12,057
This plane is not for tourists.

678
01:18:12,309 --> 01:18:13,266
Ha, ha.

679
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:16,395
I'm not a tourist.

680
01:18:40,422 --> 01:18:42,464
Call this guy
and tell him to meet me.

681
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:43,632
Sure.

682
01:18:44,092 --> 01:18:45,217
Where?

683
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,969
Down there.

684
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,876
Here.

685
01:19:23,966 --> 01:19:24,799
Careful!

686
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:10,180
Move up.

687
01:20:34,123 --> 01:20:34,873
Now!

688
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:28,241
Get closer.

689
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:34,958
- Steady!
- No, Dad, stop!

690
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:40,922
Get away!

691
01:24:07,013 --> 01:24:08,055
Down!

692
01:24:19,776 --> 01:24:21,276
Hands on your head.

693
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:23,446
Move.

694
01:24:26,116 --> 01:24:27,283
Watch her.

695
01:24:27,451 --> 01:24:29,952
If she moves or I don't return,
shoot her.

696
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,665
To the water.

697
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:36,794
I'm really not in the mood
for a swim.

698
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:37,795
March!

699
01:24:40,757 --> 01:24:44,009
So how did a lowlife like you
end up with my daughter?

700
01:24:44,301 --> 01:24:46,260
I found her in a bag.
Isn't that where you left her?

701
01:24:46,346 --> 01:24:48,472
You know nothing. Move!

702
01:24:53,062 --> 01:24:55,562
You got involved with
the wrong girl, you dumbshit.

703
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:59,317
The delivery will be made.
My daughter will get over it.

704
01:24:59,443 --> 01:25:01,903
If I'm lucky, maybe
she'll see the light.

705
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:10,912
Yeah, if she's lucky, maybe
you'll get hit by a truck.

706
01:25:10,996 --> 01:25:12,455
What do you know?

707
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:14,624
I know she'll never stop
being who she is.

708
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:17,168
Means she'll never be you
or anything like you.

709
01:25:17,336 --> 01:25:20,506
She'll come around.
But you won't be here to see it.

710
01:25:21,007 --> 01:25:22,007
No!

711
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:35,605
I guess she won't be
coming around after all.

712
01:25:38,109 --> 01:25:39,067
Turn around!

713
01:25:39,192 --> 01:25:40,777
I'd rather see it coming.

714
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:42,696
Makes no difference to me.

715
01:26:08,599 --> 01:26:12,852
He was a bastard.
But he was still my father.

716
01:26:27,285 --> 01:26:29,328
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

717
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:37,251
I guess I underestimated you.
