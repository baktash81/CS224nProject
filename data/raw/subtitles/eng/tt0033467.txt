00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,560
<i>Legendary was the Xanadu...</i>

4
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.</i>

5
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>Today almost as legendary
as Florida's Xanadu...</i>

6
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,840
<i>...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.</i>

7
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,640
<i>Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...</i>

8
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
<i>...was commissioned and successfully built.</i>

9
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,120
<i>One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...</i>

10
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,680
<i>...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.</i>

11
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,040
<i>Contents of Xanaduâ€™s palace:</i>

12
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,120
<i>Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.</i>

13
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,280
<i>A collection of everything.</i>

14
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,480
<i>So big it can never
be catalogued or appraised.</i>

15
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,240
<i>Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.</i>

16
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,560
<i>Xanadu's livestock...</i>

17
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,880
<i>...the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea,
the beast of the field and jungle...</i>

18
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,280
<i>...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.</i>

19
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,640
<i>Like the Pharaohs...</i>

20
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
<i>...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.</i>

21
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,560
<i>Since the Pyramids...</i>

22
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
<i>...Xanadu is the costliest monument...</i>

23
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>...a man has built to himself.</i>

24
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,840
<i>Here in Xanadu last week...</i>

25
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.</i>

26
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,920
<i>A potent figure of our century...</i>

27
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,080
<i>...America's Kubla Khan:</i>

28
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
<i>Charles Foster Kane.</i>

29
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,440
<i>Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.</i>

30
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,040
<i>Kane's empire, in its glory...</i>

31
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...</i>

32
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,600
<i>...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.</i>

33
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>The first of grocery stores, paper mills...</i>

34
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.</i>

35
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,480
<i>An empire through which for 50 years...</i>

36
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
<i>...flowed in an unending stream...</i>

37
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,240
<i>...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.</i>

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,640
<i>Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.</i>

39
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,080
<i>How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...</i>

40
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,840
<i>...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:</i>

41
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,920
<i>The Colorado Lode.</i>

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...</i>

43
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
<i>... Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...</i>

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,040

45

<i>...recalls a journey he made as a youth.</i>

46
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

48
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,040
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,680
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,440
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,760
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,040
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,760
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,640
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,920
...American traditions of private property...

56
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,280
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,040
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,520
<i>That same month in Union Square....</i>

59
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,200
<i>The words "Charles Foster Kane"...</i>

60
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,640
<i>...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.</i>

61
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,120
<i>He is today what he has always been
and always will be: a fascist.</i>

62
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,360
<i>And still another opinion....</i>

63
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
<i>Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...</i>

64
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,680
<i>...opposed participation in another.</i>

65
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,560
<i>Won the election
to one American president at least.</i>

66
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
<i>Spoke for millions of Americans.</i>

67
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,720
<i>Was hated by as many more.</i>

68
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,440
<i>For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...</i>

69
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,840
<i>...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.</i>

70
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.</i>

71
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,320
<i>Often support, then denounce.</i>

72
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
<i>Twice married, twice divorced.</i>

73
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,080
<i>First to a president's niece...</i>

74
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,120
<i>...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.</i>

75
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,120
<i>Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.</i>

76
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,720
<i>Sixteen years after his first marriage...</i>

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
<i>...two weeks after his first divorce...</i>

78
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,280
<i>...Kane married Susan Alexander...</i>

79
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,480
<i>...singer, at the Town Hall
in Trenton, New Jersey.</i>

80
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,280
<i>For wife two,
one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...</i>

81
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,640
<i>...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.</i>

82
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>Cost: $3 million.</i>

83
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,040
<i>Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
half-finished before she divorced him...</i>

84
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,040
<i>...the still unfinished...</i>

85
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
<i>...Xanadu.</i>

86
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
<i>Cost: No man can say.</i>

87
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,080
<i>Kane, molder of mass opinion
though he was...</i>

88
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,800
<i>...in all his life
was never granted elective office...</i>

89
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
<i>...by the voters of his country.</i>

90
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
<i>But Kane papers were once strong indeed...</i>

91
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
<i>...and once the prize seemed almost his.</i>

92
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,360
<i>In 1916, as independent candidate
for governor...</i>

93
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,760
<i>...the best elements of the state
behind him...</i>

94
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,440
<i>...the White House seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career...</i>

95
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,280
<i>...then suddenly, less than one week
before election...</i>

96
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
<i>...defeat.</i>

97
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,360
<i>Shameful, ignominious.</i>

98
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
<i>Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U.S...</i>

99
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,080
<i>...forever cancelled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.</i>

100
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>Then, in the first year
of the Great Depression...</i>

101
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,680
<i>...a Kane paper closes.</i>

102
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,320
<i>For Kane, in four short years, collapse.</i>

103
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,680
<i>Eleven Kane papers merged,
more sold, scrapped.</i>

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,040
Is that correct?

105
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

106
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,160
<i>-Read the Inquirer.
-How were business conditions in Europe?</i>

107
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

108
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,760
With great difficulty.

109
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,800
Are you glad to be back?

110
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

111
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,600
Always been an American. Anything else?

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

113
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,120
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

114
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

115
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

116
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,240
...that would mean the end of civilization.

117
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,560
<i>Kane helped to change the world...</i>

119
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,240
<i>...but Kane's world now is history...</i>

120
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,560
<i>...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...</i>

121
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>...outlived his power to make it.</i>

122
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,600
<i>Alone in his never-finished,

123
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,120
<i>...aloof, seldom visited,
never photographed...</i>

124
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.</i>

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,840

128
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,680
<i>Then last week, as it must to all men...</i>

129
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,080
<i>...death came to Charles Foster Kane.</i>

130
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,800
News on the March.

131
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,920
That's it.

132
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
-How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,840
-Seventy years in a man's life.
-That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,520
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,600
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,040
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,400
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,600
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,560
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,000
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

143
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,080
-Maybe he didn't.
-All we saw was a big American.

145
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,080
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,640
I tell you, a man's dying words--

147
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,640
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

148
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,080
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,120
"Rosebud."

150
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,920
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

152
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
-But who is she?
-What was it?

153
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,280
Here's a man
who could've been president...

154
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,560
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

155
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,080
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

156
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,320
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,720
-What does that mean?
-A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,040
-That didn't come in.
-But what was the race?

159
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
Rosebud.

160
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,160
-Thompson.
-Yes.

161
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,080
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,840
Don't you think right after he's dead--

163
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,440
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,280
That manager of his....

166
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

167
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,840
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
-That's right.

169
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,200
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

170
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,080
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,280
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

172
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,840
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

175
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
Miss Alexander.

176
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,440
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
I want another drink, John.

178
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,880
-I'll have a highball, please.
-Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,520
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Think again.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

184
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,560
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd--

185
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
Get out of here.

186
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
Get out!

187
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
-Sorry.
-Get out.

188
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,400
-Maybe some other time.
-Get out.

189
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,040
Gino.

190
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,440
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

192
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,560
Okay.

193
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,200
-Another double?
-Yeah.

194
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,800
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,200
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,680
She's....

197
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,920
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,240
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any--

199
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,640
-Hello.
-Sooner.

200
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,280
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,880
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
They're expecting me.

206
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,040
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,440
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

209
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,280
-Hey....
-John.

210
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,760
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,560
"Rosebud"?

213
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,200
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

215
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,640
...l asked her.

216
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,200
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,280
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,000
...about the conditions
under which you may...

219
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,080
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,720
-l remember them.
-Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,200
-All I want is an hour--
-Under no circumstances...

222
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,880
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,080
That's all right. I'm just looking for--

224
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,840
Jennings.

225
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,080
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,800
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,560
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

228
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,000
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,080
Thank you.

231
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,160
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
Come on, boys.

233
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,160
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

236
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,520
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,960
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,280
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,800
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,600
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,520
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

243
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,760
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind....

244
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,680
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

245
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,520
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,000
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

247
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,400
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
-He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,160
-"The bank's decision in all matters--"
-l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--

249
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
-Stop this nonsense.
-We're a bit uneducated--

250
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,520
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

251
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,920
"...his places of residence, is to be final."

252
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,400
-The idea of a bank being the guardian--
-Stop this nonsense, Jim.

253
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,320
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

254
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,880
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

255
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,040
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
-Right here.

256
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,440
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

257
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,560
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father--

258
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,120
The sum of $50,000 a year...

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,280
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

260
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,400
...and thereafter to the survivor.

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,760
-Let's hope it's all for the best.
-It is.

262
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

263
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,720
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

264
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

265
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,840
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

266
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,520
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

267
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,760
...he is to come into complete possession.

268
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,080
Charles!

269
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

270
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,200
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

271
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,840
I've got his trunk all packed.

272
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,040
I've had it packed for a week now.

273
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,880
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

274
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,160
I'd have brought him here with me, but....

275
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,520
-Charles.
-Look, Mom.

276
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,080
You'd better come inside.

277
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,040
-That's quite a snowman.
-l took the pipe out of his mouth.

278
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
Did you make it yourself?.

279
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,040
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

280
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,280
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

281
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,680
-Hello.
-How do you do, Charles?

282
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,280
He comes from the East.

283
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
-Pa.
-Hello, Charlie.

284
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,000
Charles.

285
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,040
Yes, Mommy.

286
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,480
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

287
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,280
You'll be leaving on number 10.

288
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,440
That's the train with all the lights on it.

289
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
You going, Mom?

290
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,680
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll....

291
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
Where am I going?

292
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,680
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

293
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
He certainly is.

294
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,200
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

295
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,400
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
-We have to stay here, Charles.

296
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,280
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

297
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,640
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

298
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,920
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

299
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,280
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

300
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,680
-...and you ought to get--
-You won't be lonely.

301
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,080
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

302
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,960
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am l?

303
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,520
-What do you say? Let's shake.
-Why, Charles.

304
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,280
-Why, you almost hurt me.
-Charlie!

305
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,760
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

306
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,760
Mom!

307
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,040
-You got to go.
-Jim!

308
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

309
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,920
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

310
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
-That's what you think, is it?
-Yes.

311
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,000
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

312
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,160
Well, Charles...

313
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,560
-...Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

314
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,040
And a happy New Year.

315
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
In closing...

316
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,160
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

317
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,800
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

318
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,280
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

319
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,720
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

320
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,720
-Got that?
-"The world's sixth largest private fortune."

321
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

322
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,040
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

323
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,680
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

324
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,880
-"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
-It's from Mr. Kane.

325
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,240
-Go on.
-"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

326
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,280
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

327
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,480
Not interested?

328
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,920
<i>"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.</i>

329
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,760
"A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

330
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,120
"Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

331
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,560
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.

332
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,600
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

333
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,200
"Traction Trust exposed."

334
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,800
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."

335
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,080
<i>"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."</i>

336
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,440
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

337
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,360
<i>"Inquirer wins slum fight."</i>

338
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,360
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

339
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,480
"Copper robbers indicted."

340
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,400
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

341
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,000
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

342
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,320
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

343
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,240
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

344
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,080
-...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
-Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

345
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,600
Can you prove it isn't?

346
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

347
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
-Mr. Leland.
-Hello.

348
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

349
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,880
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

350
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,640
<i>He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.</i>

351
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,680
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...

352
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,360
"...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

353
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,160
"There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

354
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,560
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

355
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,280
-That's fine.
-l like it myself. Send it right away.

356
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,600
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

357
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,440
<i>The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.</i>

358
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,680
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

359
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,200
You're still the college boy, eh?

360
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,880
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

361
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,640
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

362
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,400
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

363
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,360
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

364
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,520
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

365
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,200
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

366
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,680
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

367
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

368
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,680
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

369
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,480
<i>On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.</i>

370
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,480
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

371
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,680
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

372
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,160
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

373
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

374
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,880
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

375
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,680
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

376
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,560
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

377
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

378
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
That would be too bad.

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,040
I saw your financial statement today.

380
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,000
-Oh, did you?
-Tell me, honestly...

381
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,320
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

382
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,320
<i>...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?</i>

383
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

384
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,680
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

385
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,880
At the rate of $1 million a year...

386
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,360
...Iâ€™ll have to close this place in 60 years.

387
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,080
"With respect to the said newspapers...

388
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,520
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...

389
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,000
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

390
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,120
"...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

391
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,960
"...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

392
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,720
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto--"

393
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,000
-Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.

394
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

395
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,960
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,240
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

397
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,280
You're too old to be called anything else.

398
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,480
You were always too old.

399
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,640
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

400
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,400
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives--"

401
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,040
My allowance.

402
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,840
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

403
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,440
"...measure of control.
Measure of control."

404
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,040
And we shall seek your advice.

405
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,240
This depression is temporary.

406
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,040
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

407
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,600
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

408
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,040
We never lost as much as we made.

409
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

410
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,560
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....

411
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,160
To buy things.

412
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,440
To buy things.

413
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,160
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

414
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,320
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

415
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,160
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

416
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,360
...if I hadn't been very rich...

417
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
...l might have been a really great man.

418
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,320
Don't you think you are?

419
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,320
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

420
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,400
What would you like to have been?

421
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
Everything you hate.

422
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,520
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

423
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,240
-Itâ€™s 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
-Yes, ma'am.

424
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,800
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

425
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-No.

426
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
-You're not Rosebud, are you?
-What?

427
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,040
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

428
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

429
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,560
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

430
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,960
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

431
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,040
We thought maybe.... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

432
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,600
-...as he was dying.
-That "Rosebud"?

433
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,040
Maybe some girl?

434
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,280
There were a lot of them in the early days.

435
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

436
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,680
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--

437
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,360
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,000
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

439
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,760
You take me.

440
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,680
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

441
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,960
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

442
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,680
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

443
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,200
A white dress she had on.

444
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,640
She was carrying a white parasol.

445
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,320
I only saw her for one second.

446
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,640
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

447
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

448
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,480
-Who else have you been to see?
-Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

449
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
Susie?

450
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
Thank you.

451
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,080
I called her myself the day after he died.

452
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,720
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

453
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,080
-She couldn't even come to the phone.
-Iâ€™ll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

454
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,080
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

455
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,760
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

456
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,720
You were with him from the beginning.

457
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,960
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

458
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,240
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

459
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,440
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

460
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,800
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
-He made an awful lot of money.

461
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,560
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

462
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,080
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

463
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,680
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

464
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,840
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

465
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,280
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

466
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,400
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

467
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,600
Harvard?

468
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,240
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

469
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,800
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,520
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

471
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,720
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

472
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,920
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

473
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,720
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

474
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,440
<i>...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.</i>

475
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,200
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

476
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,160
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

477
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,720
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

478
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,400
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

479
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,880
-Jedediah.
-After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,760
Excuse me, sir, but l....

481
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,840
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

482
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,480
<i>Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.</i>

483
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,720
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,560
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
-How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,440
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,640
-It is dramatic critic, right?
-That's right.

487
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,200
-Are they standing for me?
-You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Standing?

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,080
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

490
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,440
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

491
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,480
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
-The new publisher.

492
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,760
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

493
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,040
-l didn't know your plans.
-l don't know my plans myself.

494
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,600
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
-No?

495
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,560
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
-Mr. Bernstein.
-Yes, Mr. Kane.

497
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

498
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,120
-Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
-How do you do, Mr. Carter?

499
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
-Mr. Carter.
-How do you do?

500
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,200
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
-Stein.

501
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,800
-Kane.
-Mr. Carter, is this your office?

502
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,840
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

503
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,200
-Excuse me.
-But I don't think I understand.

504
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,440
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

505
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,360
Live here? Yes?

506
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,280
-Excuse me.
-But a morning newspaper, after all--

507
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
Excuse me.

508
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,960
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

509
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,240
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

510
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,720
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
-24?

511
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,040
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

512
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,760
It's impossible....

513
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,640
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

514
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,280
You certainly aren't.

515
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,080
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

516
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,040
-You still eating?
-Iâ€™m still hungry.

517
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
<i>Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...</i>

518
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,560
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

519
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,080
<i>She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?</i>

520
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,880
We're running a newspaper...

521
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,800
-Iâ€™m absolutely starving to death.
-...not a scandal sheet.

522
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,800
That's all right.

523
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,680
<i>Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.</i>

524
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?</i>

525
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,720
The news wasn't big enough.

526
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,360
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

527
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,880
-That's right!
-The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--

528
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,080
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

529
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,920
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

530
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,720
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

531
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,880
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

532
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,200
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

533
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,120
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

534
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,880
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

535
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,000
<i>...the Inquirer will have him arrested.</i>

536
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,400
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from....

537
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,840
-Central Office.
-The Central Office.

538
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,480
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

539
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,280
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

540
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,600
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

541
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,800
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper--

542
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

543
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,640
Goodbye.

544
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,040
Paper! Read all about it!

545
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,080
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

546
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,520
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

547
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

548
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,920
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

549
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,600
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

550
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,200
-Tired?
-A tough day.

551
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,800
-A wasted day.
-Wasted?

552
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,720
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

553
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,280
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

554
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,400
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

555
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,960
<i>I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...</i>

556
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,840
...as the gas in that light.

557
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
What are you going to do, Charlie?

558
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,200
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

559
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,000
I've got it all written out here.

560
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,440
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

561
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
These'll be kept.

562
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,320
"Iâ€™ll provide the people of this city...

563
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,120
"...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

564
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
-"l will also provide--"
-That's two sentences starting with "l."

565
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,040
People will know who's responsible...

566
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,040
<i>...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.</i>

567
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,360
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

568
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,120
"l will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

569
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,720
"...as citizens and as human beings."

570
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,600
Signed:

571
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,480
"Charles Foster Kane."

572
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,920
-Can I have that, Charlie?
-Iâ€™m going to print it.

573
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,360
Solly!

574
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,400
Yes, Mr. Kane?

575
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,160
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

576
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
This morning's front page?

577
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,720
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

578
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,520
-Yes.
-Go down and tell them.

579
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,840
All right.

580
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,680
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

581
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,480
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

582
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,480
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

583
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,840
-A document...
-Sure.

584
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

585
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
...and my first report card at school.

586
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,680
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

587
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,280
<i>-This little pilgrimage will do us good.
-The Chronicle's a good newspaper.</i>

588
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,280
<i>Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.</i>

589
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.</i>

590
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,200
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
-You're right.

591
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,600
<i>You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?</i>

592
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,320
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years?

593
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,720
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

594
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,920
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

595
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

596
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,240
<i>Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.</i>

597
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
<i>Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.</i>

598
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,080
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

599
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,800
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

600
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,160
684,132.

601
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,480
Right.

602
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,560
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

603
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

604
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,440
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

605
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,440
I now realize I can't.

606
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

607
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,280
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

608
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,320
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

609
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,280
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

610
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
And I've only been buying for five.

611
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,880
-Promise me, Mr. Kane.
-l promise, Mr. Bernstein.

612
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,680
-Thank you.
-Mr. Bernstein?

613
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,840
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

614
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,640
And now, gentlemen!

615
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
Your complete attention, if you please.

616
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,440
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

617
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,320
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

618
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,280
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

619
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>The Inquirer already has.</i>

620
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,080
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

621
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,040
I'm not overdressed.

622
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,200
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

623
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,360
Let's have the song about Charlie.

624
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,680
-Is there a song about Charlie?
-Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

625
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

626
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,560
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

627
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,120
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

628
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
"There is a man, a certain man

629
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,400
"And for the poor you may be sure
that he'll do all he can

630
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,880
"Who is this one? This favorite son

631
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,760
"Just by his action

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,000

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,320

635
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,760
"Iâ€™ll bet you $5 you're not alive

636
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,720
"What is his name?

637
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,200
"Itâ€™s Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

638
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,960
"He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane"

639
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,880
-isnâ€™t it wonderful? Such a party.
-Yes.

640
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,640
What's the matter?

641
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,960
"Who says a miss was made to kiss

642
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,160

645
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,160
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"

646
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,400
<i>Bernstein, these men
who are now with the Inquirer...</i>

647

<i>...who were with the Chronicle

Oh, mama, please.

649
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,280
-Give me that.
-What? The blonde?

650
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,840
-No, the brunette.
-Where did you learn that, Charlie?

<i>Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...</i>

652
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,160
<i>...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...</i>

653
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,400
...as they are now to our policies?

654
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,120
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

655
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
They got work to do, they do it.

656
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,440
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

657
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,600
<i>Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?</i>

658
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,480
Certainly not.

659
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,280
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

660
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,120
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

661
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,160
Without his knowing it.

662
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,880
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

663
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,800
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
-What?

664
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
-From Paris, France.
-What?

665
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,680
-From Paris, France.
-Come on in.

666
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,280
"Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run"

667
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,520
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

668
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

669
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,880
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

670
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,600
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along....

671
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,840
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

672
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,440
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

673
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,440
Yes.

674
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,000
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

675
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,480
"World's biggest diamond."

676
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,800
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

677
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,320
He ain't.

678
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,480
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

679
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,880
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

680
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

681
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,560
<i>"...from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer."</i>

682
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
Here he comes!

683
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,720
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

684
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,240
-l know I've a moustache.
-It looks awful.

685
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,760
Have we got a society editor?

686
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,640
-Right here, Mr. Kane.
-Miss Townsend is the society editor.

687
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,280
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

688
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,360
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

689
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,480
I got a little social announcement.

690
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,360
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

691
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,160
...social announcement.

692
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,680
<i>Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer--</i>

693
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,160
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, l....

694
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,960
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

695
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,520
Goodbye.

696
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,280
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

697
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,240
Hey, everybody, look out here.

698
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,240
Let's go to the window.

699
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,240
-Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
-Yes, Ms. Townsend?

700
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,040
This announcement:
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

701
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,520
"...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

702
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,320
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."

703
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,840
Come on.

704
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,920
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

705
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,920
President's niece?

706
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,400
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

707
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,720
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

708
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,360
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

709
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
It didn't end very well, did it?

710
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,160
It ended.

711
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,560
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

712
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,240
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

713
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,840
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about....

714
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,320
Yes?

715
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,840
Maybe that was something he lost.

716
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,880
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

717
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,680
You ought to see Jed Leland.

718
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,800
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

719
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,800
You take the Spanish-American war.

720
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,120
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

721
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,080
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

722
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,240
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

723
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,160
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

724
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,200
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

725
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,800
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

726
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,800
Maybe even he's dead.

727
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,560
In case you'd like to know...

728
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,480
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

729
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,000
You don't say. I had--

730
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,840
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just....

731
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,400
Just old age.

732
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,400
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

733
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,760
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

734
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,040
That's my curse.

735
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,480
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: memory.

736
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,040
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

737
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,240
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

738
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

739
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,800
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

740
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,120
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

741
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,320
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

742
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,080
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

743
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,360
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

744
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,320
I changed the subject, didn't l?

745
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,720
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

746
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,280
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

747
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,000
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

748
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,760
But he kept it to himself.

749
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,640
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

750
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,560
He just left you a tip.

751
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,360
He had a generous mind.

752
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

753
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,320
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

754
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,880
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

755
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,280
I suppose he died without one.

756
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,960
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

757
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,720
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

758
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,920
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

759
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,480
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

760
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,560
-Sorry, Mr. Leland.
-Never mind.

761
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,080
-What do you know about Rosebud?
-"Rosebud"?

762
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,120
His dying words: "Rosebud."

763
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,480
<i>I saw that in the Inquirer.</i>

764
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,360
<i>I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.</i>

765
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,800
Anything else?

766
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,360
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

767
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,440
I was very graceful.

768
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,640
-We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
-What was she like?

769
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,080
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

770
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,120
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

771
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,520
After the first couple of months...

772
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,720
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

773
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,880
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

774
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,320
-You're beautiful.
-l can't be.

775
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,040
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

776
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,600
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

777
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,440
-I've never been up this late.
-Itâ€™s a matter of habit.

778
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,360
-What will the servants think?
-That we enjoyed ourselves.

779
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,840
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

780
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,520
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

781
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,200
I absolutely adore you.

782
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,800
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

783
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,560
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

784
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,880
What time is it?

785
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,080
I don't know. It's late.

786
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,200
It's early.

787
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,960
Charles....

788
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,360
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

789
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,160
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

790
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,440
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

791
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,400
<i>My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.</i>

792
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,160
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

793
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,680
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

794
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,640
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

795
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,800
-You mean Uncle John.
-l mean the President of the United States.

796
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,280
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

797
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,600
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

798
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,320
-This whole oil scandal--
-He happens to be the President, not you.

799
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,040
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

800
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,200
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

801
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,680
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

802
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,920
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

803
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,480
Does he have to?

804
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,480
Yes.

805
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,840
-Really, Charles, people will think--
-What I tell them to think.

806
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,840
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

807
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,720
He married for love.

808
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,920
Love.

809
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
That is why he did everything.

810
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,120
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

811
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,080
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

812
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,200
All he wanted out of life was love.

813
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,080
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

814
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,360
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

815
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,000
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

816
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,920
Very dearly.

817
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,720
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

818
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,760
-How about his second wife?
-Susan Alexander?

819
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,600
You know what Charlie called her?

820
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,440
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

821
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,280
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

822
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,920
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

823
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,720
That first night, according to Charlie...

824
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,000
...all she had was a toothache.

825
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,200
What are you laughing at, young lady?

826
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,640
-What's the matter with you?
-Toothache.

827
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,400
-What?
-Toothache.

828
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,760
Toothache?

829
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,000
You mean you've got a toothache.

830
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,640
-What's funny about that?
-You're funny, mister.

831
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,160
-You've got dirt on your face.
-Not dirt, it's mud.

832
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,440
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

833
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,440
What's that, young lady?

834
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,960
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

835
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,240
...l could get you some...hot water.

836
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,920
All right, thank you very much.

837
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,600
Do I look any better now?

838
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,200
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
-What you need is to get your mind off it.

839
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,160
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

840
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,280
-...when I have a gentleman caller.
-All right.

841
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,360
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

842
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,320
-l surely have.
-Why don't you try laughing at me again?

843
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,320
-What?
-Iâ€™m still pretty funny.

844
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,880
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

845
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,880
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

846
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,240
Look at me.

847
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,720
See that?

848
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,080
What are you doing?

849
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

850
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,360
That's it, smile.

851
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,560
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

852
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,720
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

853
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,960
That's it!

854
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,080
-Is it a giraffe?
-No, not a giraffe.

855
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,920
-l bet it is.
-What?

856
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
Well, then it's an elephant.

857
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,800
-Itâ€™s supposed to be a rooster.
-A rooster!

858
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,920
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

859
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,520
-No, I'm not a magician.
-l was just joking.

860
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,200
You really don't know who I am?

861
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,240
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

862
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,600
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

863
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,760
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

864
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,120
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

865
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,800
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

866
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,040
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

867
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,160
I know too many people.

868
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,520
I guess we're both lonely.

869
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,640
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

870
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,840
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

871
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,040
I was just joking.

872
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,480
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

873
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,480
...in search of my youth.

874
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,960
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

875
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,400
There wasn't any other place to put them.

876
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,360
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

877
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,560
A sort of sentimental journey.

878
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,240
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

879
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,280
Me?

880
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,680
-How old did you say you were?
-l didn't say.

881
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,360
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

882
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,640
-How old?
-Pretty old.

883
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
-How old?
-Twenty-two in August.

884
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,720
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

885
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,120
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

886
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,800
-Is that what you want to do?
-No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

887
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,960
-That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
-What happened to the singing?

888
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,880
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

889
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,120
Imagine.

890
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,440
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

891
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,320
Yes.

892
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,960
-Have you got a piano?
-A piano?

893
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,640
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

894
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,640
-Would you sing for me?
-You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

895
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,040
Yes, I would.

896
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,920
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

897
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,640
No, that's all gone.

898
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,200
All right.

899
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,880
Let's go to the parlor.

900
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,480
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine

901
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,200
"l have sworn it

902
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,760
"For weal or woe

903
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,400
"Yes, Lindor

904
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,040
<i>"Lo giurai</i>

905
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,160
<i>"La vincerÃ³"</i>

906
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,240
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

907
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,440
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

908
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,280
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

909
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,760
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

910
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,000
...who entered upon this campaign....

911
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,960
<i>...with one purpose only:</i>

912
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,200
<i>To point out
and make public the dishonesty...</i>

913
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,040
<i>...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...</i>

914
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,480
<i>...now in complete control
of the government of this state.</i>

915
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,520
<i>I made no campaign promises...</i>

916
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,480
<i>...because, until a few weeks ago,
I had no hope of being elected.</i>

917
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,040
<i>Now, however, l have something more
than a hope.</i>

918
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,560
<i>Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.</i>

919
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,600
<i>Every straw vote...</i>

920
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,400
<i>...every independent poll shows
that l will be elected.</i>

921
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,440
<i>Very well.</i>

922
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,240
<i>Now l can afford to make some promises.</i>

923
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,240
<i>The workingman and the slum child...</i>

924
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,200
<i>...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.</i>

925
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,640
<i>The decent, ordinary citizens know
that Iâ€™ll do everything in my power...</i>

926
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,720
<i>...to protect the underprivileged,
the underpaid, and the underfed.</i>

927
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,680
-Mother, is Pop governor yet?
-Not yet, Junior.

928
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,640
<i>I'd make my promises now...</i>

929
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,280
<i>...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.</i>

930
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,520
<i>But here's one promise Iâ€™ll make...</i>

931
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,520
<i>...and Boss Jim Gettys knows Iâ€™ll keep it.</i>

932
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,480
<i>My first official act
as governor of this state...</i>

933
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,560
<i>...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...</i>

934
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,240
<i>...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.</i>

935
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,520
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

936
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,320
-Gettys isn't even pretending.
-Pop.

937
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,440
-Hello, son.
-He isn't just scared, he's sick.

938
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,240
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

939
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,560
-Did you like your old man's speech?
-l could hear every word.

940
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,200
-Hello, Emily.
-Hold it.

941
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,320
-Great speech, Mr. Kane.
-Wonderful.

942
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,600
Will you get us a taxi?

943
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,720
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

944
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,680
Good night, Father.

945
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,760
Goodbye, son.

946
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,320
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

947
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,480
There's a call I want you to make with me.

948
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,360
-It can wait.
-No, it can't.

949
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,040
What's this all about, Emily?

950
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,240
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

951
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,240
-Where are you going?
-Iâ€™m going to "185 West 74th Street."

952
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,520
If you wish, you may come with me.

953
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,000
I'll come with you.

954
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,320
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

955
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,720
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

956
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,160
Charlie.

957
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,600
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

958
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,320
He's been saying the most terrible....

959
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,080
Mrs. Kane.

960
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,360
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

961
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,280
I'm Jim Gettys.

962
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes?

963
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,220
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

964
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,460
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

965
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,180
Charlie, the things he said to me....
He threatened to--

966
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,980
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

967
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,700
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

968
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,660
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

969
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,300
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

970
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,260
-He wanted to get her to come here--
-What does this note mean?

971
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,860
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking--

972
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,580
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
-She don't know.

973
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,420
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

974
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,660
-Emily, this gentleman--
-Iâ€™m not a gentleman.

975
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,580
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

976
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,180
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

977
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,260
You see, my idea of a gentleman....

978
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,620
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

979
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,020
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

980
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,860
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

981
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,180
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

982
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,060
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
-We're talking now about what you are.

983
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,660
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

984
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,820
-He said unless you--
-That's what I said.

985
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,700
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

986
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:07,380
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

987
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,540
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

988
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,980
What story?

989
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,780
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
-There isn't any story!

990
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,980
Shut up.

991
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,100
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

992
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,660
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

993
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,460
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

994
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,420
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

995
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,260
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

996
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
What about me?

997
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:44,260
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went--

998
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,020
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

999
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,740
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1000
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
You can't tell me the voters of this state--

1001
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:56,260
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1002
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,700
I am interested in our son.

1003
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,820
-Charlie, if they publish this story--
-They won't.

1004
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,100
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1005
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,620
Are you coming, Charles?

1006
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,100
No.

1007
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,940
I'm staying here.

1008
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,900
I can fight this all alone.

1009
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,540
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1010
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:35,380
Too late? For what?

1011
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,580
For you and this public thief...

1012
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,100
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1013
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,860
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1014
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,340
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1015
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,740
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1016
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:58,860
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1017
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,420
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1018
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,700
-Iâ€™ve got nothing to say to you.
-You're licked--

1019
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,020
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1020
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:18,740
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1021
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,620
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1022
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,260
-And you'll get more than one lesson.
-Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1023
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,860
Don't worry about me!

1024
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,220
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1025
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,900
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1026
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,820
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1027
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:45,700
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1028
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,940
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1029
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,940
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
-Yes, thank you.

1030
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,140
-Good night.
-Good night.

1031
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,300
<i>Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.</i>

1032
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660
-Paper?
-No, thanks.

1033
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:34,660
With a million majority
already against him...

1034
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,060
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1035
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,620
...Iâ€™m afraid we got no choice.

1036
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,060
This one?

1037
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,020
That one.

1038
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,180
Good night again.

1039
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,220
-Is there anything I can--
-No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1040
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,980
You better go home and get some sleep.

1041
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,460
You, too.

1042
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,500
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1043
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,060
-Hello, Jedediah.
-Iâ€™m drunk.

1044
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:10,500
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1045
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,380
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1046
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,860
I'm not interested.

1047
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:26,620
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1048
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,380
All right.

1049
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,180
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1050
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,980
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1051
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,580
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1052
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,860
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1053
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:48,180
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1054
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,460
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1055
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,020
...as a reward for services rendered.

1056
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,380
-Jed.
-You remember the workingman?

1057
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,620
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1058
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,260
...if it'll do any good.

1059
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,620
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1060
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:08,460
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman--

1061
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,380
Go on home.

1062
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,180
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

1063
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,100
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1064
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:22,100
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1065
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,420
When your precious underprivileged
really get together....

1066
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,740
Oh, boy....

1067
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,340
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1068
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,260
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1069
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:42,380
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1070
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,700
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1071
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,740
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1072
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,940
You may not always be so lucky.

1073
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,140
You're not very drunk.

1074
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Drunk, what do you care?

1075
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,300
You don't care about anything except you.

1076
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,860
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1077
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,700
Only you want love on your own terms.

1078
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,660
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1079
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,100
-Let me work on the Chicago paper.
-What?

1080
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,980
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1081
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,860
I am drunk.

1082
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,220
I want to go to Chicago.

1083
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,140
You're too valuable here.

1084
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,100
-There's nothing left for me to do--
-All right, you can go to Chicago.

1085
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,380
Thank you.

1086
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,860
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1087
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,900
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1088
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:57,380
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1089
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,580
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1090
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,540
-Anytime you say.
-Thank you.

1091
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,780
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1092
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,540
His own.

1093
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,340
<i>Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.</i>

1094
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,060
-What's that, young man?
-Are you through with politics?

1095
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,700
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1096
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,660
We're going to be an opera star.

1097
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,500
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1098
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,940
We certainly are.

1099
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,820
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1100
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,380
That won't be necessary.

1101
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,180
No, no, no!

1102
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,820
Places, please!

1103
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,580
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1104
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,980
-And we've covered it from the news end.
-And the social.

1105
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,940
How about the music notice?

1106
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,940
Yes, it's already made up.

1107
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,540
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1108
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:42,020
-Enthusiastic?
-Yes, sir.

1109
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,700
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1110
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,100
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1111
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,900
The music notice on the front page?

1112
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,500
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1113
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,100
The dramatic notice.

1114
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:02,580
-Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
-Yes, we're waiting for it.

1115
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,260
-Where is he?
-Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1116
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,220
Mr. Kane.

1117
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,980
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1118
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,180
...haven't spoken together for years.

1119
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,260
-You don't suppose--
-There's nothing to suppose.

1120
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,700
Excuse me.

1121
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,540
Close the door.

1122
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,180
He ain't been drinking before.

1123
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,980
Never. We would have heard.

1124
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,180
What does it say there?

1125
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,220
The notice, what's he written?

1126
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:27,660
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1127
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,700
"...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1128
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,700
"...in a performance of...."

1129
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,100
I still can't pronounce that name.

1130
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,220
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1131
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,380
"Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to...."

1132
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,140
Go on.

1133
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,420
That's all there is.

1134
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,420
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1135
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,900
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1136
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,940
-In the opinion of this reviewer.
-l didn't see that.

1137
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:26,260
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1138
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,100
-Mr. Kane, l--
-Get me a typewriter.

1139
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,820
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1140
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,020
Hello, Bernstein.

1141
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:59,180
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Leland.

1142
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,380
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1143
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,580
-Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
-Charlie?

1144
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,580
Charlie out there?

1145
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,660
I guess he's fixing it up.

1146
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,260
I knew I'd never get that through.

1147
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,900
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1148
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,900
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1149
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,220
I guess that'll show you.

1150
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,900
Hello, Jedediah.

1151
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,420
Hello, Charlie.

1152
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,660
I didn't know we were speaking.

1153
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:15,140
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1154
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,220
You're fired.

1155
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:35,380
<i>Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland,
but why did he do it?</i>

1156
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:39,860
-How could a man write a notice--
-You just don't know Charlie.

1157
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,660
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1158
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,900
He was always trying to prove something.

1159
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,020
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1160
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,260
That was trying to prove something.

1161
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,220
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1162
01:19:55,580 --> 01:20:01,300
<i>"Candidate Kane found
in love nest with 'singer."'</i>

1163
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,460
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1164
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,580
Hey, nurse!

1165
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:08,540
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1166
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:15,940
What's it called, Shangri-la? EI Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1167
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:21,260
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1168
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:25,340
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1169
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,980
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1170
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,060
Maybe I should have.

1171
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:34,060
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1172
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,460
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1173
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:40,620
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1174
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,020
-Of course, he built the joint for her.
-That must have been love.

1175
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,020
I don't know.

1176
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,580
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1177
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,740
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1178
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,140
-Nurse.
-Yes, Mr. Leland.

1179
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,500
I'm coming.

1180
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:00,380
-There's one thing you can do for me.
-Sure.

1181
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:04,940
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1182
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:07,020
-Be glad to.
-Thank you.

1183
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,820
One is enough.

1184
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:13,460
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1185
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,460
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1186
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,580
-Iâ€™ll take your arm.
-All right.

1187
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:20,300
-You won't forget about those cigars?
-l won't.

1188
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:25,260
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1189
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,100
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1190
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,900
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1191
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,820
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1192
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,620
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1193
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:11,900
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1194
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:18,020
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1195
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,020
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1196
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,540
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1197
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,060
-The teachers got that, I didn't.
-What did you get?

1198
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:33,580
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1199
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,020
He married you, didn't he?

1200
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,380
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1201
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,740
...until it got in the papers about us...

1202
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:45,500
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1203
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,780
He was really interested in my voice.

1204
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,380
Why did he build that opera house?

1205
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,140
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1206
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,460
Everything was his idea...

1207
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,220
...except my leaving him.

1208
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,340
"Don't forget"

1209
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,820
Don't get nervous.

1210
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,540
Please. Let's come back.

1211
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:22,140
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1212
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:30,820
"Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask

1213
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,060
"Diaphragm"

1214
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,460
You're out of pitch.

1215
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,020
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1216
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,660
Impossible.

1217
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:59,500
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1218
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:04,780
<i>You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.</i>

1219
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,180
Please continue with the lesson.

1220
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,580
-But, Mr. Kane.
-Please.

1221
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:14,260
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think--

1222
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,140
You're concerned what people will think?

1223
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,580
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1224
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,980
The newspapers for example.

1225
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,860
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1226
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,300
It's all right, darling.

1227
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,660
<i>Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.</i>

1228
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,180
-How can I persuade you--
-You can't.

1229
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,380
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1230
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,340
I thought you'd see it my way.

1231
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,900
No, no, no.

1232
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,300
<i>"Ah, cruel</i>

1233
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,900

01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,700

Stop telling me he's your friend.

1255
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,260
A friend don't write that kind of review.

1256
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,620
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1257
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:58,340
<i>But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.</i>

1258
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,140
Come in.

1259
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,100
I'll get it.

1260
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,940
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1261
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,100
...but I'm not high class like you.

1262
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,300
And I never went to any swell schools.

1263
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,820
That'll be enough, Susan.

1264
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,020
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1265
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:13,540
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1266
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:16,380
Is that something from him?

1267
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:18,900
Charlie!

1268
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:23,340
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1269
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,020
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1270
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,500
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1271
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,980
What kind of firing do you call that?

1272
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:35,700
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1273
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,900
Yes.

1274
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,380
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1275
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,340
What's that?

1276
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,900
Declaration of Principles.

1277
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,020
What?

1278
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,780
What is it?

1279
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,340
An antique.

1280
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,020
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1281
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:07,220
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1282
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,380
I'm through.

1283
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,820
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1284
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,780
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1285
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:16,580
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1286
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,780
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1287
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,060
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1288
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,060
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1289
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,900
Why don't you leave me alone?

1290
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:28,580
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1291
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,700
You seem unable to understand them.

1292
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,740
I will not tell them to you again.

1293
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,340
You'll continue with your singing.

1294
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,780
Get Dr. Corey.

1295
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,020
Susan.

1296
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:19,340
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1297
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:25,180
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1298
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:30,060
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1299
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,660
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1300
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,900
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1301
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,300
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1302
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:44,420
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1303
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,220
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1304
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,860
Charlie.

1305
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,020
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1306
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,540
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1307
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:37,460
You don't know what it means
to know that people....

1308
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,580
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1309
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,060
That's when you got to fight them.

1310
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,580
All right.

1311
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,820
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1312
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:06,020
It's their loss.

1313
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,700
What are you doing?

1314
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,900
Jigsaw puzzles?

1315
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,740
Charlie, what time is it?

1316
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,740
11:30.

1317
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,260
In New York?

1318
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:44,780
I said what time is it in New York?

1319
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:48,540
- 11 :30.
- Night?

1320
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,780
<i>The Bulldog's just gone to press.</i>

1321
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,940
<i>Well, hurray for the Bulldog.</i>

1322
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:02,340
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1323
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,060
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1324
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,980
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1325
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,580
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1326
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,900
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1327
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,780
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1328
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,220
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1329
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:23,820
I'm lonesome.

1330
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:27,700
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1331
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,380
I think if you look in the west wing...

1332
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:33,420
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1333
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,940
You make a joke out of everything.

1334
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:40,900
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1335
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:44,660
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1336
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,020
Charlie, please.

1337
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,460
Our home is here, Susan.

1338
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,140
I don't care to visit New York.

1339
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,260
What are you doing?

1340
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,260
One thing I can never understand:

1341
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,420
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1342
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:49,340
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1343
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,420
You may be right.

1344
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,820
I sometimes wonder...

1345
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:57,500
...but you get into the habit.

1346
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:00,340
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1347
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,220
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,420
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1349
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:12,860
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1350
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:15,820
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1351
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:18,380
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1352
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:21,740
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1353
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:29,100
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1354
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,100
"It can't be love

1355
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:45,940
"For there is no true love

1356
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,660
"l know I've played at the game

1357
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,540
"Like a moth in a blue flame

1358
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,260
"Lost in the end, just the same

1359
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,740
"All these years

1360
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:02,580
"My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears

1361
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,780
"l wonder what it is"

1362
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:10,740
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1363
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:16,020
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1364
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:19,340
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1365
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:23,180
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1366
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,140
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1367
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,500
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:31,660
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1369
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,460
I want you to stop this.

1370
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,900
I'm not going to stop it.

1371
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,180
You never gave me anything in your life.

1372
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:40,420
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1373
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:46,820
"It can't be love"

1374
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,660
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1375
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,580
You don't love me.

1376
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,580
You want me to love you.

1377
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:08,460
Sure. "Iâ€™m Charles Foster Kane.

1378
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,020
"Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1379
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,260
"But you gotta love me."

1380
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:20,140
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1381
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,740
I'm not sorry.

1382
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,580
Mr. Kane?

1383
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,620
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1384
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:45,420
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1385
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,820
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1386
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:56,540
Yes, madame.

1387
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,740
Have you gone completely crazy?

1388
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,940
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1389
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,820
Packed your bag, sent for the car--

1390
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:06,900
And left you?

1391
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:09,020
Of course they'll hear.

1392
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,500
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1393
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,420
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1394
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,580
I won't let you go.

1395
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,180
Goodbye, Charlie.

1396
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:32,980
Susan.

1397
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:44,340
Please don't go.

1398
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,420
Please, Susan.

1399
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:57,820
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1400
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,980
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1401
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:02,980
...your way.

1402
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,500
You mustn't go.

1403
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,660
You can't do this to me.

1404
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,900
I see.

1405
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:22,220
It's you that this is being done to.

1406
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,300
It's not me at all.

1407
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,380
Not what it means to me.

1408
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,500
I can't do this to you?

1409
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:33,780
Oh, yes, I can.

1410
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:55,180
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1411
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,460
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1412
01:41:57,540 --> 01:42:00,340
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1413
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:04,020
-You're going down to Xanadu?
-Monday, with boys from the office.

1414
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,700
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1415
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,340
We run a picture magazine.

1416
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:11,940
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1417
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:13,940
You'll learn a lot from him.

1418
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,380
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1419
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,660
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1420
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,380
Don't you think I do?

1421
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,660
What do you know, it's morning already.

1422
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:37,420
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1423
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,660
Rosebud?

1424
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:50,220
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1425
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,540
How much is it worth to you?

1426
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,820
$1,000?

1427
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,300
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1428
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:10,300
-He acted funny sometimes, you know?
-No, I didn't.

1429
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,820
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1430
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:15,460
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1431
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:19,220
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1432
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,780
-Rosebud.
-Yes.

1433
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:25,660
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1434
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:29,300
-...but I knew how to handle him--
-Need a lot of service?

1435
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,300
But I knew how to handle him.

1436
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:34,020
Like that time his wife left.

1437
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,380
Rosebud.

1438
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:52,180
I see.

1439
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:55,140
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1440
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,940
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1441
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,420
He just said:

1442
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:03,540
"Rosebud."

1443
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:06,740
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1444
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:11,460
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1445
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,780
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1446
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:16,780
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1447
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:20,380
-Yes and no.
-That isn't worth $1,000.

1448
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,340
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1449
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,140
We're leaving tonight...

1450
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,820
...when we're through taking pictures.

1451
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,780
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1452
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,540
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1453
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:37,340
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1454
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,300
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1455
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,180
Better get going.

1456
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,820
-Can we come down?
-Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1457
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:55,260
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1458
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,940
Millions.

1459
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,500
If anybody wants it.

1460
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,140
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1461
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,860
-What's that?
-Another Venus.

1462
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,260
$25,000.

1463
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,820
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1464
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,980
The banks are out of luck?

1465
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:14,060
-They'll clear all right.
-He never threw anything away.

1466
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:19,100
<i>"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer."</i>

1467
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:24,340
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."

1468
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,780
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1469
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,500
He sure liked to collect things.

1470
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:29,900
Anything and everything.

1471
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,620
A regular crow, eh?

1472
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:34,300
-Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
-We got a lot of those.

1473
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:37,300
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1474
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,140
Part of a Scotch castle...

1475
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:40,980
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1476
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,740
Put all this stuff together:

1477
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:45,780
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1478
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,820
What would it spell?

1479
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:51,860
-Charles Foster Kane?
-Or Rosebud.

1480
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:55,220
-How about it, Jerry?
-What's Rosebud?

1481
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,460
That's what he said when he died.

1482
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,140
Did you ever find out what it means?

1483
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:02,340
-No, I didn't.
-What did you find out about him?

1484
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,860
Not much, really.

1485
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:08,500
We'd better get started.

1486
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:12,660
What have you been doing all this time?

1487
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:15,220
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1488
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:18,860
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1489
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,460
No, I don't think so.

1490
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,420
No.

1491
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:25,940
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1492
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:29,620
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1493
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:31,860
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1494
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,700
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1495
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:40,660
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1496
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,420
A missing piece.

1497
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,100
Come on, everybody...

1498
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:55,020
...we'll miss the train.

1499
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:59,220
Throw that junk in.

1500
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:32,200
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1501
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,720
Everything was his idea...

1502
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,520
...except my leaving him.

1503
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,320
I've got his trunk all packed.

1504
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,640
I've had it packed for a week now.

1505
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,200
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
arrival of flesh and blood.

1506
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:52,240
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1507
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,720
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1508
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,240
Who's a busy man, me?

1509
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,640
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1510
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,200
What do you want to know?

1511
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,720
We thought.... If we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying....

1512
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,280
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1513
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,680
Yes and no.

1514
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,760
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

1515
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:23,480
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."
