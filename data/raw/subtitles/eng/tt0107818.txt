00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,550
This "pestilent dust" that counselor refers to
has appeared on only three occasions.

23
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,500
Each time it was tested,
and the results, limestone.

24
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,850
It's messy,

25
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,450
but innocuous.

26
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,400
Innocuous?

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,350
Defined by Webster's as "harmless".

28
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,500
I know what it means.
May I? Thank you.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Your Honor...

30
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,050
Imagine how the children in this
neighborhood are being made to feel.

31
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,350
The constant pounding of construction
ringing in their ears,

32
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,750
as this skyscraper,
a tribute to mankind's greed,

33
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,100
grows daily,

34
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
casting an ominous shadow over their lives,

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,550
filling them with dread even as
they are surrounded by this toxic dust.

36
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,900
Your Honor, Kendall Construction

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
builds neighborhoods.

38
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,600
It doesn't destroy them.

39
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,400
Granting a restraining order
against this construction site

40
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,300
will throw 753 Philadelphians out of work,

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
and lend validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit.

42
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,950
It's an example of
the rapacious litigation

43
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,950
that today is tearing at
the very fabric of our society.

44
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,700
Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,100
You've made an articulate and
compelling presentation, Mr. Miller,

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,150
but I don't believe
you've proven irreparable harm.

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,650
Not yet, Your Honor.

48
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,900
- Is that you?
- Yeah, that's me.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,150
Miller. Yes.

50
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,300
- Hello, Iris.
- Client of yours?

51
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,000
Funny!

52
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,450
Hold on, Iris. Excuse me, sir?

53
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,300
Sir? Yo!

54
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,750
Yo!

55
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
My sons and I went
to a restaurant the other day.

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,000
We ordered coffee.

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,150
- The waiter comes up and goes...
- Here's the literature.

58
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,400
"Would you like sugar or Sweet 'N' Low?"

59
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
I said, "Do I look like I should be on a diet?"

60
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,200
Oh, God!

61
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,100
- Andy.
- Hi, doc.

62
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Your blood work came back this morning.

63
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,550
I'm going to come back in a few minutes
and talk to you about it, all right?

64
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,700
I'll be right here.

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,850
Good.

66
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,300
Hi. How are you feeling?

67
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,100
- Feeling pretty good.
- Great.

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Make a fist for me.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,050
Once more.

70
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,700
Gonna have to start looking for veins
in your feet, sweetheart.

71
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Patience, Tyrone.

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,350
Okay, okay.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Once more.

74
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,600
Hey, Andy, terrific job
on the Kendall situation.

75
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,750
- Top-notch, Mr. Beckett.
- Thanks, Kenneth, Robert.

76
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,600
- Hi, Mr. Beckett.
- Hi, Rose. Anthea.

77
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,750
Just the paralegal extraordinaire
I was hoping to see.

78
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,000
I know what that means.
The answer is no.

79
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm talking dinner at Felicia's.

80
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
I've got a class.

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,450
I've got some pretty compelling briefs
that need proofing.

82
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,350
You can exploit somebody else.

83
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,650
Since you've asked...

84
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,800
Your exam.

85
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,450
Thank you. 98.

86
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,400
98?!

87
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,500
- 98! Congratulations.
- I gotta go.

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,150
Hey! I have to pick up Amy
from her after-school,

89
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,900
but I want to talk to you
about that Hansen thing.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Give me a call. I'm going to be here.

91
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,400
And tell Amy that I loved her painting.
It's on my wall.

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,000
Hi, Andrew. Conference call's up.
The roll call just started.

93
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
Now, this is the settlement agreement.

94
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,750
The red-line copy's on your desk.

95
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,900
You need me in there?

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
No. It's 6:30. Go home.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Hello?

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
<i>Hey, Mom!</i>

99
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,650
Oh, hi, darling!
What a wonderful surprise!

100
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,300
- How are you?
- <i>Good.</i>

101
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
Well, what does Dr. Gillman say?

102
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,650
Dr. Gillman says I am fine.

103
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,450
My blood work is excellent.

104
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,700
She says my T-cells are steady.

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Honey, how about your platelets?
What did she say?

106
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,600
<i>Oh, even my platelets look good.</i>

107
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Great.

108
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,400
Mom, more importantly, how are you?

109
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,000
<i>Mom?</i>

110
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,450
I'm fine.

111
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,600
<i>And how's Dad?</i>

112
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Dad is fine.

113
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,200
And what are you doing?

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
Okay.

115
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,700
"Action for the wrongful interference

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,300
with prospective economic relations."

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,500
Okay.

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
- Andy.
- Yo?

119
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,200
Am I interrupting you?

120
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,550
In a word, Bob...

121
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,050
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

122
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,700
I was just about to take a break.

123
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,550
You're sure I'm not under-dressed for this?

124
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,750
Oh, no. No, you're not.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,050
Charles,

126
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,950
Andy has expressed a keen interest

127
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,800
in Highline Inc. versus Sander Systems.

128
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,950
Isn't that right, Andy?

129
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,400
The fate of the participants interests me.
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,300
It's an antitrust action.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,350
It is...

132
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,400
and it isn't, Charles.

133
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,750
Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

134
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,450
For me,

135
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,800
the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement.

136
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,400
Mmm!

137
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,600
Well, tell me this, Andy.

138
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,000
Which side of this conflict
would you wish to see emerge victorious?

139
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
And don't allow my close,
personal relationship

140
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,850
with Bill Wright, Sander Systems' CEO,

141
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,600
to influence your answer in any way.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,700
I'd like to see Highline win this one.

143
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,350
Oh! Why, Beckett?

144
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,550
If Sander Systems wins,

145
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,750
an energetic, young company is destroyed.

146
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,450
The laws for antitrust and copyright

147
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,300
were enacted to prevent exactly

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,700
the kind of bullshit that
Sander Systems is trying to pull.

149
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,450
Andy, you know who reps Highline?

150
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,700
Rodney Bailey.

151
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,950
Oh, I object!

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,300
Rodney Bailey,

153
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,700
who couldn't find his way
around copyright law with a map.

154
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,900
Well, apparently,

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,650
the fellas at Highline agree with you, Andy.

156
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,400
Which explains why,
as of 9:03 this evening,

157
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
right after the dessert course,

158
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,150
Highline, Incocrporated is now represented

159
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,700
by Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman,
Tetlow & Brown.

160
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,500
Outstanding!

161
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,650
And more specifically,

162
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,150
senior associate Andrew Beckett.

163
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,150
Bravo!

164
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,150
Yes!

165
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,150
Bravo!

166
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,300
Yeah!

167
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,850
Bravo!

168
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,250
- Bravo!
- Congratulations!

169
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,850
Thank you, Robert. Thank you.

170
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,700
Now, we've got to get
on Highline right away.

171
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,350
Statute of limitations. Yeah, I'm right on it.

172
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,500
Exactly. It's 10 days before we have to file.

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,350
- All right.
- Tokyo on line four, Bob.

174
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,200
Walter, thank you.

175
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Thank you.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,500
- Kenneth, thank you.
- You bet, Andy.

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,750
- Congratulations.
- Aw, thanks.

178
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,850
I'm overwhelmed.

179
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,100
What's that on your forehead, pal?

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
What? Where?

181
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,250
That, right there on your forehead.

182
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,450
Oh, I got whacked in the head
with a racquetball.

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,950
Excuse me.

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
Charles, I...

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,050
I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

186
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,800
Faith, Andy, is a belief in something

187
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,550
for which we have no evidence.

188
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,500
It does not apply to this situation.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
Well, go home.

190
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,900
Oh, no, no! Go back to work.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

192
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,250
Thank you, Charles.

193
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,100
No sweat, buddy.

194
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,350
Tommy, how are you?

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,650
<i>The Highline complaint is
right there on my desk, Shelby.</i>

196
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,950
<i>It's all set to go,</i>

197
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,300
<i>so make sure Jamey is on top of it.</i>

198
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,700
Sure, you got it. Anything else?

199
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,000
No. No, that's it.

200
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,050
I'm just going to be working out of the
house here for the rest of the afternoon,

201
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,000
so thanks a lot.

202
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,300
- Bye, bye.
- <i>Bye, bye.</i>

203
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,700
Okay, now, you're going to want
to apply this foundation

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,350
as evenly as you can.

205
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,500
- Mm-hm.
- Okay?

206
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,900
Because you don't want it to look like
you threw it on with a spoon.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,900
- Yeah.
- So over here, you try this.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
- I got it.
- Right there.

209
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,800
Chandra, you don't think this is
just a little too orange for me?

210
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,400
Well, okay, it's Tahitian bronze,

211
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,650
and that works best on these lesions, okay?

212
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,400
Think of it as the
"I just got back from Aruba" look.

213
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,850
Exactly.

214
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,850
I've called in sick for four days,

215
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,550
and now they're going to think
that I was taking a cruise.

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,800
- Fax.
- Oh, thank you, Bruno.

217
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,200
Here, okay, look...
We can try this light Egypt...

218
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,550
What?

219
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,600
Andy?

220
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,800
Excuse me.

221
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,800
Just like my cousin Fredo.

222
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,650
Hi.

223
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,950
Does anybody want a bagel?

224
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,000
You okay, Andy?

225
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,400
I think I need to go to the hospital.

226
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,500
Watch out!

227
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,600
Hello, hello.

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
It's all right.

229
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
- I'm getting out of here, all right?
- Okay.

230
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,700
- Okay? I'll talk to you later.
- Thank you, Amina.

231
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,850
Oh, one more, one more.

232
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,650
Thank you for driving like a bat out of hell.

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,950
Take it easy, all right?

234
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,200
Dr. Gillman is out of her office.

235
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,900
I told her to take a day off
and she took a day off.

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,050
Can you believe that?

237
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,300
So they took blood?
A specimen or something?

238
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Blood, yes. A specimen, I'm empty.

239
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,200
Did you find somebody to take your class?

240
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,050
Don't worry about it. Let me see.

241
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,400
Oh, you got a fever, baby.

242
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,900
Oh, there's my guy. Excuse me.

243
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,450
Doctor? Hello, hi.

244
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,300
Just one second.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,400
I came that close to not making it
into the bathroom again.

246
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,100
I almost lost it in front of everybody.

247
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,850
Well, so what?

248
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,050
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

249
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,150
I'm not ashamed, it's just...

250
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,700
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,750
Meanwhile, I want to prep you
for a colonoscopy.

252
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,850
We want to take a look inside.

253
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,150
It sounds delightful.

254
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,350
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

255
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,350
Why do you need to do this?

256
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,000
Who are you?

257
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,350
Who are you, Dr...

258
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,600
This is my partner.

259
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,750
Yeah?

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He keeps records of all my hospital visits.
It's nothing personal.

261
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,700
Oh, I'm Dr. Klenstein.

262
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,750
Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy
is not a pleasant procedure,

263
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,000
but if the KS is causing the diarrhea,

264
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,050
we've got to know about that right away.

265
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,250
Hey, no, no, no.

266
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,350
It could be parasites, an infection, I mean...

267
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,300
Reaction to the AZT.

268
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,050
All of these are possibilities,

269
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,150
but we've got to go forward...

270
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,600
Listen to me.

271
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,100
He's not going through
some painful procedure

272
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
until we've canceled out everything else.

273
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
You know what I mean?

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,400
- Listen, I'm trying to help
your partner here, okay? - Okay.

275
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,750
- And you're not a member of
his immediate family. - I'm not.

276
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,950
- I could have you removed from the ER.
- Really?

277
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,050
Look, look, look. He's upset. He's sorry.

278
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,400
No, don't apologize for me, okay?

279
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,350
Okay, he's not sorry.

280
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,900
Let's do this.

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,900
Let's find out what the blood work tells us,

282
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,400
I will try to give you a specimen.

283
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,400
Some hospital food may help me along.

284
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,950
And then we might hear from Dr. Gillman,

285
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,100
and we can start from there.

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,500
Okay? Everybody happy?

287
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,700
- All right? All right?
- Okay, yeah.

288
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll get on the lab about the blood work.

289
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,050
Thank you, doctor.

290
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,700
Oh, that's...

292
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,750
That's the third time
the office has beeped me.

293
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,800
I better go.

294
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
- Klanstein? Klenstein?
- Yeah, Klenstein.

295
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
I've got to go give them a call.

296
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,900
I want you to sit down,
and I want you to relax.

297
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,250
- I am relaxed.
- Oh, good, good.

298
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,100
Is there a phone around
somewhere nearby?

299
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
- Down the hall.
- Thank you.

300
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,200
<i>If you or someone you know has been
injured through the fault of others,</i>

301
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,900

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,150

<i>for your pain and suffering.</i>

304
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,500
- Good Lord!
- <i>I'm attorney Joseph Miller.</i>

305
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,450
Mr. Beckett's office.

306
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Shelby, it's me.
Jamey's been beeping me. So...

307
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,950
<i>Oh, I'm so glad you called, Andrew.</i>

308
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,500
Listen, I just want to let you know

309
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
we have a minor catastrophe
in the making here.

310
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,400
It's about that Highline complaint.

311
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,300
Jamey is going absolutely ballistic.

312
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,950
All right. Calm down. Put him on.

313
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,150
<i>One second.</i>

314
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
<i>Andy, this is a disaster.</i>

315
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,450
We can't find the revisions
on the Highline complaint.

316
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,100
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down, slow down.

317
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,900
Okay. I told them you were
working on it at home,

318
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,050
and it was supposed to be here this morning.

319
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,250
No, no, no, no.

320
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,300
I brought it into the office last night.

321
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I was there till 3:00 a.m.

322
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,900
There should be a copy
with corrections on my desk.

323
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,900
I'm telling you, it's not here, Andy.
Shelby can't find it, either.

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>All right.</i>

325
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,500
The hard disk on my computer.

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,300
<i>You're going to have to
print it up on the double</i>

327
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
<i>and run it through
word processing yourself.</i>

328
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay, what did you file it under?

329
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,400
<i>H-L-1.</i>

330
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,300
<i>Jamey, I don't have to remind you, do I,</i>

331
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>that we are up against the statute
of limitations on this complaint.</i>

332
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
And it runs out in...

333
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,800
in...

334
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,100
in 75 minutes.

335
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not here, Andy.

336
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
<i>Not there?! I'm on my way.</i>

337
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:51,250
Every problem has a solution.

338
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,350
Push, baby. Push!

339
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,500
Push!

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,750
Oh, it's coming!

341
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,350
Yeah, baby, it's coming!

342
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,350
It's...

343
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,200
It's a girl.

344
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,400
Oh, my God!

345
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,600
Take a picture, Joe.

346
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,650
I'm trying. I can't get the film in there.

347
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,650
Oh, my God!

348
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,900
Baby, here, baby. Help me, baby.

349
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
- Oh, look at her, look at her.
- Look at our baby.

350
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
That little, sweet little...

351
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Get her before she gets too old.

352
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,050
Oh, my God!

353
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,000
She's perfect, Lisa. She has long hair.

354
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,150
Yeah, go down to Famous
4th Street Deli, get a pound...

355
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,600
No, no. Get a Scotch salmon.
She likes that Scotch salmon.

356
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, some onion rolls, bagels.

357
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
Here, give me a call.

358
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,150
Onion rolls, bagels.

359
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,150
- Yeah, champagne, nice champagne.
- I know you!

360
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,750
- You're that TV guy!
- Yeah, like Dom Perignon.

361
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,900
I don't care how much it costs.

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
- Get some nice Dom Perignon.
- Thank you.

363
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
How much?

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,300
Oh, $100. No, don't get me Dom Perignon.

365
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,550
Get a nice Californian.
Dom Perignon's too much.

366
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,200
Get it all over here,
because she's starving.

367
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,300
No, no, Iris, not the baby. Lisa is starving.

368
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Yeah, Lisa. And Iris, Iris, Iris, Iris, listen.

369
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,000
Anybody call?

370
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,350
<i>An Andrew Beckett called.</i>

371
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,600
Beckett?

372
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,000
Who's Andrew Beckett?

373
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,650
There he is! Joseph!

374
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,500
Hey, hey, hey!

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,550
All right, look, I want you to explain
this to me like I'm a 6-year-old, okay?

376
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,500
The entire street is clear

377
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,300
except for one small area
under construction,

378
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,100
this huge hole that is clearly
marked and blocked off.

379
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
- Right?
- Yes.

380
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,000
You decide you must cross
the street at this spot, no other.

381
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,900
You fall into the hole.

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Now you want to sue the city
for negligence, right?

383
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,550
Yes. Do I have a case?

384
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

385
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Yeah, of course you've got a case.

386
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,800
Great.

387
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,150
- I want you to go with my assistant Iris here.
- All right.

388
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,800
She'll have you fill out some forms,

389
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
tell you all about our fee arrangement.

390
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,900
Of course, you know we take no cash

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
unless we get cash justice for you.

392
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,350
How's your back? You got any lower
back pain, dizziness, nightmares?

393
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,550
Funny you should mention that.

394
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,600
- Iris will take good care of you.
- I've been having some...

395
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,700
- Iris, you take good care of Mr. Finley.
- I will.

396
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,900
- Mr. Beckett's here.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

397
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
- Thank you very, very much.
- All right, take care.

398
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,500
- Mr. Beckett's here.
- Mr. Beckett!

399
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,200
Mr. Beckett, come in.

400
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,700
It's good to see you again, counselor.

401
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,100
Judge Tate.

402
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
Kendall Construction.

403
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Innocuous.

404
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,850
How are you?

405
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,100
What happened to your face?

406
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
I have AIDS.

407
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,550
Oh.

408
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,300
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

409
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,000
Can I sit down?

410
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,000
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

411
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,300
Oh, look at this.

412
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,550
You have a new baby.

413
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,300
Yeah, a little baby girl.

414
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,550
"It's a girl"!

415
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,900
Congratulations.

416
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,550
Yeah. One week old.

417
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,450
Kids are great.

418
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah, thank you, Beckett.

419
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,850
I'm real excited about it.

420
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,350
Listen, I...

421
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,100
What can I do for you?

422
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,650
I've been fired by Wyant-Wheeler.

423
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,200
I plan on bringing a wrongful termination suit

424
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,650
against Charles Wheeler and his partners.

425
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,750
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?

426
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,850
Correct. I'm seeking representation.

427
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
Continue.

428
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,000
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

429
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,000
Want to hear mine?

430
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,300
How many lawyers you go to
before you called me?

431
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Nine.

432
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,950
Continue.

433
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,700
The night before it was due,

434
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I worked on the complaint in my office.

435
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,650
I left a copy of it on my desk.

436
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,000
The next day, the complaint vanished.

437
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,150
No hard copy.

438
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,950
All traces of it

439
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,400
mysteriously gone from my computer.

440
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
<i>Miraculously,</i>

441
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,350
<i>a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute,</i>

442
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,850
<i>and we got it to court on time.</i>

443
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,800
<i>But the next day,</i>

444
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,350
<i>I was summoned to a meeting
with the managing partners.</i>

445
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,550
<i>They were waiting for me
in the conference room.</i>

446
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,150
Oh, hello, Andy. Come on in.

447
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,450
Would you mind hitting the windows?

448
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,150
Thanks. Hey, come on in, come on in.

449
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,850
Robert, Charles, Walter and Lydia.

450
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,900
Thanks for coming in.

451
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Oh, of course.

452
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,450
Andy, before we begin,

453
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,200
I'd just like to say

454
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,950
that everyone in this room is your friend.

455
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,950
I know that, Charles.

456
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,950
More than your friend.

457
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,100
Family.

458
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Charles, I must apologize again

459
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,300
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

460
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,450
That was some scary moment around here.

461
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,450
Wow! Thank God the complaint was found,

462
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,600
and no damage was done.

463
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,450
This time.

464
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,600
What about next time?

465
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,600
There won't be a next time.

466
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,950
I guarantee it.

467
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,300
It's just that something's
come over you lately, Andy.

468
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't know.

469
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,900
Some kind of stupor or fogginess.

470
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,900
Some people think you have
an attitude problem, Beckett.

471
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,400
Really?

472
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,550
Who thinks that?

473
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,400
I do.

474
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,500
Excuse me.

475
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,000
Am I being fired?

476
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Let me put it this way, Andy.

477
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Your place in the future of this firm
is no longer secure.

478
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,900
We feel it isn't fair to keep you here

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,950
when your prospects are limited.

480
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,450
And now, I don't want to rush you out.

481
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,750
We've got a committee meeting.

482
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,450
Excuse me, Charles.

483
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,600
With all due respect...

484
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
this is preposterous.

485
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
It doesn't make any sense.

486
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,750
Oh, you're right, Beckett.

487
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,500
You don't have an attitude problem.

488
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,850
Take it easy, Walter.

489
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,650
If you had lost confidence in me,

490
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,150
why did you give me the Highline suit?

491
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,950
Andy, you nearly blew the entire case,
for Christ sake's.

492
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,350
That alone is inexcusable.

493
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,400
It would've been catastrophic for us.

494
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,700
Uh-huh.

495
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,000
So you were concealing your illness.

496
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,350
That's correct.

497
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,400
All right, explain this to me
like I'm a 2-year-old, okay?

498
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,850
Because there's an element to this thing

499
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,600
I just cannot get through my thick head.

500
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,750
Didn't you have an obligation
to tell your employer

501
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,200
you had this dreaded,
deadly, infectious disease?

502
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,700
That's not the point.

503
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,500
From the day they hired me
to the day I was fired,

504
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,800
I served my clients consistently, thoroughly,

505
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
with absolute excellence.

506
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,000
If they hadn't fired me,
that's what I'd be doing today.

507
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,600
And they don't want to fire you
for having AIDS,

508
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,400
so, in spite of your brilliance,
they make you look incompetent,

509
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
thus the mysterious lost files.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

510
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,900
Correct. I was sabotaged.

511
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,700
I don't buy it, counselor.

512
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
That's very disappointing.

513
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,050
I don't see a case.

514
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
I have a case.

515
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,000
If you don't want it for personal reasons...

516
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Thank you. That's correct, I don't.

517
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,500
Well, thank you for your time, counselor.

518
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Mr. Beckett...

519
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm sorry about what happened to you.
It's a bitch, you know?

520
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,000
Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.

521
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,550
What the hell's the matter with that guy?

522
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,500
Iris, find out if Armbruster can see me.

523
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,650
Joe Miller's office.

524
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,650
Iris! Find out if Armbruster can see me.

525
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,500
- Armbruster? When?
- Sometime this afternoon.

526
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
What's wrong with him?

527
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,850
- No, right away, Iris. Right away, Iris.
- Okay.

528
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
Excuse me.

529
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,000
The HIV virus can only be transmitted
through the exchange of bodily fluids,

530
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,800
namely, blood, semen,
and vaginal secretions.

531
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,200
Right. Yeah.

532
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Yeah. Yeah, but isn't it true
that they're finding out

533
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,850
all kinds of new things
about this disease every day?

534
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,800
All right, now, you tell me today
there's no danger, go home.

535
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,650
I go home, I pick up my little baby girl,

536
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,800
then I find out six months from now
on the news or something...

537
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Whoops! Made a mistake!

538
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,300
Yeah, you can carry it

539
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,750
on your shirt, or your clothes, or...

540
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,650
What are you doing?

541
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,200
We're going to draw blood.

542
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
- Why are we going to do that?
- Joe.

543
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,150
Little Joe.

544
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,800
I've known you since you were a kid.

545
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,850
And I don't care a whit
about your private life.

546
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,500
Thanks, doc.

547
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,050
I don't need an AIDS test,
but thanks anyway.

548
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,000
Listen, just send a bill
to my office for me, okay?

549
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,050
Thanks for the information, really.

550
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
You have a problem with gays, Joe.

551
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,800
- No, not especially.
- Yes, you do.

552
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,250
- How many gays do you know?
- How many do you know?

553
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,750
- Lots.
- Like who?

554
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,300
Karen Berman.

555
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
My Aunt Teresa.

556
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,050
Cousin Tommy, who lives in Rochester.

557
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,550
Eddie Meyers from the office.

558
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,000
Stanley, the guy who's putting in
our kitchen cabinets.

559
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,350
Aunt Teresa's gay?

560
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,750
That beautiful, sensuous,
voluptuous woman is a lesbian?

561
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,200
- Duh!
- Since when?

562
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,000
Probably since she was born.

563
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Oh, man!

564
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,750
All right, well, hey, I admit it, okay?

565
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,850
I'm prejudiced. I don't like homosexuals.

566
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,150
- There, you got me.
- All right.

567
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,900
I mean, the way these guys do that... thing.

568
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,050
Don't they get confused?

569
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,100
"Oh, I don't know, is that yours?
Is that mine, huh?"

570
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
You know, I don't want to be
in the bed with anybody

571
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,500
who's stronger than me,

572
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,550
or has more hair on their chest than I do.

573
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,900
Now, you can call me old-fashioned.
You can call me conservative.

574
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,500
Just call me a man.

575
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Besides, I think you have
to be a man to understand how...

576
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
really disgusting that whole idea is anyway.

577
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

578
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,250
Well, well.

579
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,900
- Little caveman of the house.
- You damn skippy!

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,100
Here you go, baby.

581
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Just stay away from your Aunt Teresa too,
do you hear me?

582
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,750
- Joe, don't say that to her.
- Think about it.

583
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,550
Those guys pumping up together,

584
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,100
trying to be macho and faggot
at the same time.

585
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,850
I can't stand that shit.

586
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,400
Hey, I'm being totally honest with you, okay?

587
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,900
Oh, yeah, you are.

588
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,450
All right, I've got a question for you.

589
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:30,650
Would you accept a client,
if you were constantly thinking,

590
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,750
"I don't want this person to touch me.

591
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,100
"I don't want him to even breathe on me"?

592
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,250
Not if I was you, honey.

593
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,400
That's what I'm talking about.

594
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
- Mm-hm.
- What?

595
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,900
Ho, ho, ho!

596
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,950
Merry Christmas!

597
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,100
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

598
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,650
Ho, ho, ho!

599
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,900
Hey, Merry Christmas.

600
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Merry Christmas, sir.

601
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,100
Ho, ho, ho!

602
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,000
- Thanks...
- Happy New Year.

603
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,800
You're the...

604
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,250
- ...the TV guy.
- TV guy.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Sir?

606
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
This is the supplement.

607
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
You're right.

608
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,500
There is a section on
HIV related discrimination.

609
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,050
Oh, thank you.

610
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,500
Thank you very much.

611
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,950
We do have a private
research room available.

612
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,050
I'm fine right here. Thank you.

613
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,550
Excuse me. Do you know where I can
find the State vs. Murdock case?

614
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,500
- Just a moment. I'll be right with you.
- Okay. Thanks.

615
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,500
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

616
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
No.

617
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,300
Would it make you more comfortable?

618
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,600
Oh...

619
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,850
Beckett, how you doing?

620
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,200
Counselor.

621
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,850
Huh.

622
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,450
Whatever, sir.

623
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,000
Excuse me.

624
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,500
Who'd you get?

625
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,700
What?

626
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,050
Did you find a lawyer?

627
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,850
I'm a lawyer.

628
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey, how's your baby?

629
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,950
Oh, yeah, she's...

630
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,650
She's wonderful, great.

631
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,650
What's her name?

632
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,700
Larice.

633
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,850
That's a beautiful name.

634
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,500
Named her after my sister.

635
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,300
Look, I'm...

636
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,200
How'd they find out you have the AIDS?

637
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,800
One of the partners noticed
a lesion on my forehead.

638
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,050
But how do you go from...

639
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,900
How do you go from a lawyer
spotting a lesion,

640
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,250
which could've been anything,

641
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,050
to the partners deducing
that you have AIDS,

642
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,100
and terminating you
on the basis of that conclusion?

643
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,900
That's a good point.

644
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,700
The partner who spotted the lesion,

645
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,450
Walter Kenton,

646
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,900
worked for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm in D.C.

647
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,450
A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,

648
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:12,100
she showed lesions on and off
for the better part of two, three years.

649
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,950
She says it was common knowledge
around the office

650
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,950
that her lesions were caused by AIDS.

651
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,950
But they didn't fire her.

652
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,300
No.

653
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,450
They did not fire her.

654
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,650
- So, you got a relevant precedent?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,350
- The Arline decision.
- Arline?

656
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,250
Supreme Court.

657
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,500
"The Federal Vocational
Rehabilitation Act

658
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,500
"of 1973 prohibits discrimination

659
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,350

"but rather on their membership

"in a group with assumed characteristics."

676
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,950
Charles Wheeler!

677
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,300
Julius Erving!

678
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,300
By golly, am I glad to see you!

679
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,300
Ken Starr.

680
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
Ken, how are you?

681
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,500
How are you?

682
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,000
Don't worry about it.
It's only going to take a minute.

683
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,050
- Charles Wheeler. How you doing?
- Yeah!

684
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,400
- How are you?
- Very good, very good.

685
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,150
- You're welcome.
- Summons for you.

686
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,000
Take a look at it. Have a good day.

687
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,300
Hey, Dr. J., how are you?

688
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,300
I love you, man. You're the best.
You're the best.

689
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
If you ever need a lawyer for anything,
you give me a call.

690
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,200
If you slip and fall, you know,
accidents, anything, let me know.

691
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,950
See you in court.

692
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,150
- You're the TV guy.
- Yeah, the TV guy.

693
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,850
Say, Chuck, what's up?

694
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,300
Now, regarding Andy...

695
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,300
I want to know everything
about his personal life.

696
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,000
Does he frequent those
pathetic bars on Chestnut Street?

697
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,150
- Right, Charles.
- Oh, Jesus!

698
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,200
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

699
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,850
- Absolutely.
- Charles!

700
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,000
What deviant groups or organizations

701
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,000
does he secretly belong to?

702
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,300
- First thing in the morning.
- Wait a minute.

703
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,950
- Bob, what is it?
- Look...

704
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,700
Let's make a fair settlement offer,

705
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
and put this whole tragic
business behind us.

706
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,950
Bob...

707
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,200
Andy brought AIDS into our offices,

708
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,800
into our men's room.

709
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,500
He brought AIDS

710
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,250
to our annual goddamn family picnic.

711
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,500
We ought to be suing him, Bob.

712
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,650
Where is your compassion, gentlemen?

713
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,850
Bob, we gave him Highline.

714
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,500
Did Andrew Beckett say,

715
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,650
"I might not be able to serve our client

716
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,550
"to the best of my ability"?

717
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,000
He said nothing!

718
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,600
And now, discarding the trust and
affection I conferred upon him,

719
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,200
Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court,

720
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,850
to sling accusations at me,
to call me a bigot!

721
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,450
in full view of the entire Philadelphia
judicial establishment.

722
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,000
My God!

723
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,650
Excuse me.

724
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,550
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.

725
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,850
He's looking for a quick, tasty settlement.

726
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,950
A jury might decide that he has a case.

727
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,000
Wait a minute.

728
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,000
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

729
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,350
You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?

730
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,450
Holy shit! Did you, Bob?

731
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,950
No, no. Not really.

732
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,500
<i>Okay, okay, everybody...</i>

733
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,900
<i>Everybody, this is the house that I grew up in.</i>

734
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,450
<i>Bonito palacito!</i>

735
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,900
<i>Right here in the hometown
of Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.</i>

736
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,250
<i>- Very good.
- Oh, wait, here...</i>

737
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,750
<i>And here's proof.</i>

738
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,950
<i>It's... there.</i>

739
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:11,350
<i>My handprints from when
I was a cute, little boy.</i>

740
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,100
<i>Today is the 40th wedding anniversary</i>

741
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,600
<i>of my mom and dad, the Becketts.</i>

742
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,750
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

743
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,700
<i>Pretty tough life around this poverty
so many years, huh?</i>

744
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,650
<i>Well, now, those can be
some pretty mean streets.</i>

745
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,950
<i>Don't let appearances fool you.</i>

746
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,100
<i>Here's the front door.</i>

747
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,450
<i>Now, I once slammed this finger
in the front door and I broke it.</i>

748
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,300
<i>- Where's my brother?
- Hey!</i>

749
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,450
<i>Hey, there's my sister Jill, everybody.</i>

750
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,700
<i>Say hello, Alexis.</i>

751
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,000
<i>Mommy's pregnant again!</i>

752
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,200
<i>What?</i>

753
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
<i>- Yes.
- Are you really?</i>

754
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,700
<i>- Hi, Meghan.
- It's Uncle Andy!</i>

755
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,950
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

756
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,300
<i>He's out trying to get
the snow blower fixed.</i>

757
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,500
<i>It snows once in seven years,
Dad buys a new snow blower.</i>

758
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
<i>Oh, how are you?</i>

759
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,550
<i>Oh, Mom, today's a good day.</i>

760
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,200
<i>Meghan, keep that up.
You're doing a great job.</i>

761
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
<i>I got to say hello to the Brontë sisters.</i>

762
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,450
<i>How are you? Good to see you.</i>

763
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,600
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, Andy.</i>

764
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>- How are you?
- Hi.</i>

765
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

766
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,700
<i>Put me down.</i>

767
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,750
<i>♪ If you let me love you ♪</i>

768
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,550
<i>♪ It's for sure I'm gonna love you ♪</i>

769
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,850
<i>♪ All the way ♪</i>

770
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,500
<i>♪ All ♪</i>

771
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,750
<i>♪ Bud and Sarah ♪</i>

772
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,900
<i>♪ All the way ♪</i>

773
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,300
There's going to be things said at the trial

774
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,800
that are going to be hard for you to hear

775
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,500
about me and my personal life,

776
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,700
and there's going to be publicity.

777
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,600
I want to make sure
it's okay with everybody.

778
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,050
Andy, you want me to take her?

779
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,700
No, no. She's...

780
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,850
She's fine.

781
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,450
I think it's great that you're asking, Andy, but...

782
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,750
This is really your call.

783
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,850
All right. Thank you, brother.

784
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,750
Thank you.

785
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,250
Hey, you're my kid brother.

786
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,400
That's all that matters, okay?

787
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,850
To be honest,

788
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,550
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

789
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,350
They've been through so much already,

790
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:26,050
and it's possible that there are going
to be some very tough times ahead.

791
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,800
Andy, the way...

792
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,700
the way that you've handled
this whole thing,

793
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,600
you and Miguel, with so much courage,

794
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,750
I don't believe there's anything

795
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,450
that anyone could say

796
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,950
that would make us feel anything

797
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,500
but incredibly proud of you.

798
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,800
Well...

799
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,750
I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

800
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,150
You get in there and you fight
for your rights, okay?

801
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,000
Gee, I love you guys.

802
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,600
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

803
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,000
forget everything you've seen
on television and in the movies.

804
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,100
There's not going to be any
last-minute surprise witnesses.

805
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,300
Nobody's going to break down
on the stand with a tearful confession.

806
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,450
You're going to be presented
with a simple fact.

807
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,150
Andrew Beckett was fired.

808
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,500
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired.

809
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,500
Ours and theirs.

810
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,950
It is up to you

811
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,500
to sift through layer upon layer of truth

812
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,250
until you determine for yourselves

813
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,550
which version sounds the most true.

814
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,500
There are certain points
that I must prove to you.

815
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,750
Point number one,

816
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,800
Andrew Beckett was...

817
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,000
is...

818
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,300
a brilliant lawyer,

819
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
a great lawyer.

820
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
Point number two,

821
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,650
Andrew Beckett,

822
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,150
afflicted with a debilitating disease,

823
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,850
made the understandable, the personal,

824
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,450
the legal choice

825
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,000
to keep the fact of his illness to himself.

826
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,150
Point number three,

827
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,150
his employers discovered his illness.

828
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,150
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the illness I'm referring to is AIDS.

829
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,450
Point number four,

830
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,900
they panicked.

831
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,700
And in their panic, they did what
most of us would like to do with AIDS,

832
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,900
which is just get it and everybody who has it

833
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,500
as far away from the rest of us as possible.

834
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,500
Now, the behavior
of Andrew Beckett's employers

835
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,950
may seem reasonable to you.

836
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,900
Does to me.

837
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,200
After all, AIDS is a deadly,
incurable disease.

838
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,000
But no matter how you come to judge

839
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,600
Charles Wheeler and his partners

840
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,800
in ethical, moral, and in human terms,

841
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,950
the fact of the matter is,

842
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,200
when they fired Andrew Beckett,
because he had AIDS,

843
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,400
they broke the law.

844
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,500
Fact.

845
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,950
Andrew Beckett's performance on the job

846
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,650
varied from competent, good,

847
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,250
to oftentimes mediocre,

848
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,400
to sometimes flagrantly incompetent.

849
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,100
Fact.

850
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,950
He claims he's the victim of lies and deceit.

851
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,900
Fact.

852
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,500
It was Andrew Beckett who lied,

853
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,600
going to great lengths to conceal
his disease from his employers.

854
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,950
Fact.

855
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,700
He was

856
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,600
successful in his duplicity.

857
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,250
The partners at Wyant-Wheeler
did not know

858
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,350
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

859
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,100
Fact.

860
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,350
Andrew Beckett is dying.

861
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,800
Fact.

862
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,900
Andrew Beckett is angry.

863
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,350
Because his lifestyle,

864
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,250
his reckless behavior,

865
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,200
has cut short his life.

866
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,900
And in his anger, his rage,

867
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,250
he is lashing out,

868
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,400
and he wants someone to pay.

869
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,000
Thank you.

870
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,400
Andrew Beckett represented
your company in a lawsuit in 1990.

871
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,050
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

872
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,200
Were you pleased with his work?

873
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,800
We were satisfied with the outcome
of the litigation.

874
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,050
Satisfied.

875
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,350
Mr. Laird,

876
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:47,250
when I approached you
about being a witness at this trial,

877
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,750
you gave sworn testimony in a deposition.

878
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,850
Is that correct?

879
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,250
That's correct.

880
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,800
In that deposition, you said that you were...

881
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,350
"Impressed and delighted

882
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,100
"with the quality of Andrew Beckett's work."

883
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,000
Do you recall saying that?

884
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,450
In all honesty,

885
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,300
I was delighted

886
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,950
with certain aspects of Andy's efforts.

887
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,300
But in general,

888
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,250
I found the work to be

889
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,250
merely satisfactory.

890
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,000
Uh-huh.

891
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,250
Do you agree...

892
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,600
that a bologna sandwich
is a satisfactory meal,

893
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,100
whereas caviar and champagne,

894
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,500
roast duck and... baked Alaska,

895
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,750
that might be considered a delightful meal?

896
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,800
We object.

897
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,950
These gastronomical comments are
irrelevant to these proceedings, Your Honor.

898
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,600
No, they are not irrelevant.

899
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,100
Your Honor, five months ago,

900
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,000
this witness characterized
Andrew Beckett as caviar.

901
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,100
Now he's calling him
a bologna sandwich.

902
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,450
I think that the jury is entitled to know

903
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,800
what powerful force has caused him
to change his mind.

904
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,100
He hasn't changed his mind.

905
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,800
He's amplified his answer.

906
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,050
Objection sustained.

907
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,200
All right.

908
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,100
All right, Mr. Laird, explain this to me

909
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,550
like I'm a 4-year-old, okay?

910
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,200
Did Andrew Beckett win
your lawsuit for you?

911
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,700
Yes, we won.

912
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,300
Oh, congratulations.

913
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,600
That must've been a very...

914
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,650
satisfactory experience.

915
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:57,000
<b>Homophobia's got to go!
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!</b>

916
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,650
Ready, Mr. Beckett?

917
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,100
Get ready. Here they come!

918
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,750
It's Adam and Eve!
Not Adam and Steve!

919
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,100
Thou shalt not lie with mankind!

920
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Do you see this as a gay rights issue?

921
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,050
I am not political.

922
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,550
I just want what is fair, what is right.

923
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,850
But you are gay, aren't you?

924
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,500
<i>I don't see how that's any of your business.</i>

925
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,100
<i>But, yes, I am.</i>

926
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,250
- Totally irrelevant.
- It doesn't matter.

927
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,450
<i>Do you think that homosexuals
deserve special treatment?</i>

928
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,800
Hell, no!

929
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,300
<i>We're standing here in Philadelphia,</i>

930
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,300
<i>the city of brotherly love,</i>

931
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,200
<i>the birthplace of freedom,</i>

932
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,650
<i>where the founding fathers authored
the Declaration of Independence.</i>

933
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,100
<i>And I don't recall that glorious document</i>

934
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,950
<i>saying anything about
all straight men are created equal.</i>

935
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,550
<i>I believe it says,
"All men are created equal."</i>

936
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,000
Give me a goddamn break!

937
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,750
<i>As far as someone being fired
from a law firm or a business,</i>

938
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,300
<i>if we found that their action
was discriminatory,</i>

939
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
<i>they could no longer do business
with the city.</i>

940
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
<i>Thank you, mayor.</i>

941
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,050
Joe!

942
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,450
Listen, you're...

943
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,350
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

944
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah, I am, Filko.

945
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,900
I'm...

946
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm changing.

947
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,850
I'm on the prowl.

948
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,750
And I'm looking for a hunk.

949
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,500
Not just any hunk.
I mean a man, a real man like you.

950
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,800
Come on, you can tell everybody about it.

951
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,900
You know what we do.
You want to play sailor?

952
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,700
You remember?
I'm Columbus, you're the first mate?

953
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,200
Hey, knock if off! That's not funny!

954
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,050
Let me tell you something.
These people make me sick, Filko.

955
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,650
But a law's been broken.

956
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,800
You remember the law, don't you?

957
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,900
At least we agree on one thing, Joe.

958
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,050
What's that, Charlie?

959
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,500
Tutti-fruttis make me sick too.

960
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:27,650
Ms. Benedict, is it true that you
worked for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm

961
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,150
three years ago at the same time
as Walter Kenton?

962
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,000
That's correct.

963
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,000
And at that time, did Walter Kenton know

964
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,050
the KS lesions on your face and arms
were caused by AIDS?

965
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,350
Definitely.

966
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,400
I told all the partners.

967
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,500
How did Walter Kenton treat you
after you told him you had AIDS?

968
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,900
Every time he'd come in contact with me,

969
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,650
he'd get this look on his face.

970
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,200
I refer to it as the "Oh, God" expression.

971
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,650
As in, "Oh, God, here comes
that woman with AIDS."

972
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,100
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No more questions, Your Honor.

973
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,000
Ms. Benedict, how did you
contract the AIDS virus?

974
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,850
Through a transfusion.

975
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,200
I lost a lot of blood
giving birth to my second child.

976
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,050
So, in other words, in your case,

977
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,550
there was no behavior on your part,

978
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,200
which caused you to be infected
with the virus.

979
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,700
It was something that you were unable
to avoid. Isn't that correct?

980
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,300
I guess.

981
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,550
Thank you.

982
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,700
But I don't consider myself any different
from anyone else with this disease.

983
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,650
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.

984
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,050
I'm just trying to survive.

985
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,550
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.

986
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,650
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

987
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
You may step down, Mrs. Benedict.

988
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,950
Beyond noticing the marks on his face,

989
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,550
were there other things about
his appearance, Miss Burton,

990
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,550
that made you suspect
that Andrew had AIDS?

991
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, he was getting thinner,

992
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,050
and he seemed very tired sometimes.

993
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,900
But he was working so hard.

994
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,200
Still, I felt something was wrong,

995
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,700
and I can't believe that
they're trying to pretend

996
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,250
that they didn't notice anything.

997
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,350
Objection.

998
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,650
Just answer the question, please.

999
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,950
Have you ever felt discriminated
against at Wyant-Wheeler?

1000
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,600
Well, yes.

1001
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,750
- In what way?
- Well...

1002
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,400
Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia,

1003
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,100
said that Mr. Wheeler had
a problem with my earrings.

1004
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,650
Really?

1005
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,000
Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt they were

1006
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,450
too "ethnic" is the word she used,

1007
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,100
and she told me that
he said he would like it

1008
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,650
if I wore something a little less garish,

1009
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,350
a little smaller, and more...

1010
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,950
"American".

1011
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,150
What'd you say?

1012
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,050
I said, "My earrings are American.

1013
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,200
"They're African-American."

1014
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,000
Let's have order, please.

1015
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,150
Thank you. No more questions.

1016
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,150
Miss Burton,

1017
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,800
weren't you recently promoted?

1018
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,200
Yes, I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

1019
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,550
Congratulations on your unfettered
ascendancy at Wyant-Wheeler.

1020
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,350
Well, I don't know if I'd go so far
as to call it unfettered.

1021
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,000
I don't understand.

1022
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,500
How do you explain

1023
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,250
the promotion of an obviously

1024
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,900
intelligent, articulate,

1025
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
qualified African-American woman

1026
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,550
in a firm which practices discrimination

1027
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:48,750
as wantonly and consistently
as you and Mr. Beckett claim?

1028
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,150
I can't explain it.

1029
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,700
Could it be

1030
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,500
that these...

1031
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,700
instances of discrimination
are in fact misunderstandings

1032
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,900
that have been blown
completely out of proportion?

1033
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,050
I think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue somewhat.

1034
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,250
Well, thank you, Miss Burton.

1035
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,050
I'll... take that note under consideration.

1036
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,150
- How's the trial going?
- Excuse me?

1037
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,800
It's a great case. I saw you on television.
I'm a law student at Penn.

1038
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,000
- Oh!
- How're you doing?

1039
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,050
- I'm all right. How are you?
- All right.

1040
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,200
- Saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

1041
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,050
It's a good school, Penn. Good school.
What year are you in?

1042
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,150
- Second.
- Good.

1043
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,050
Listen, I just want to tell you,

1044
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,750
this case, it's tremendously important,

1045
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,250
and I just wanted to let you know
I think you're doing a fantastic job.

1046
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,300
Hey.

1047
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,100
Thank you.

1048
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,400
Look, when you graduate,
you give me a call.

1049
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,400
- Okay?
- All right.

1050
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,400
- Thank you.
- All right.

1051
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,500
- Thank you very much.
- Take it easy.

1052
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,500
- Listen, Joe...
- Yeah?

1053
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,200
Would you like to have a drink with me?

1054
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,450
I just finished a game
and I could use a beer, you know?

1055
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,500
No, I can't. You know, my wife is...

1056
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,300
I don't pick up people
in drugstores every day.

1057
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,450
What? You think I'm gay?

1058
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,050
Aren't you?

1059
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,350
What is the matter with you?
Do I look gay to you?

1060
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,200
Do I look gay to you?

1061
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
- Joe, relax.
- No, what do you mean, relax?

1062
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,700
You know, I ought to kick
your faggoty little ass.

1063
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,500
Take it as a compliment. Jeez!

1064
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,750
You know, that is exactly
the kind of bullshit

1065
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,500
that makes people hate your little...

1066
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,650
faggoty ass.

1067
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,800
You want to try and kick my ass, Joe?

1068
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,850
- Asshole!
- No, you're the asshole, buddy.

1069
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,300
Please continue, Miss O'Hara.

1070
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,200
We were going crazy
looking for this complaint.

1071
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,850
I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.

1072
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,350
Mr. Beckett was screaming at everybody

1073
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,400
and he just... he looked so freaky.

1074
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,100
And Mr. Kenton kept saying,
"You lost the Highline complaint?"

1075
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,500
And he called Mr. Wheeler,
and all of a sudden,

1076
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,950
Jamey comes in
with the complaint in his hand.

1077
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:40,500
He says, "It was in central files, Andy."

1078
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,150
Central files?

1079
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:45,200
Yes, central files is a place
where paperwork is sent

1080
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,500
when cases are closed.

1081
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,050
Well, Jamey ran it
over to the court just in time,

1082
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:55,150
and everybody just stood there,
completely wasted.

1083
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,050
And Mr...

1084
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,350
And Mr. Beckett just kept saying...

1085
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:05,100
"I'm sorry. Sorry, I don't understand this."

1086
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,100
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.

1087
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

1088
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,000
All right. Mr. Miller?

1089
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,000
- May I?
- Certainly.

1090
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,100
Thank you.

1091
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,500
You okay?

1092
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,200
Yes.

1093
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,850
You want a glass of water or something?

1094
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,100
No.

1095
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,800
Was Andy a good boss?

1096
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,350
Yes.

1097
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:52,150
He was very sweet.

1098
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,150
How would you characterize
his work as an attorney?

1099
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,950
How would I know? I just worked for him.

1100
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,750
Excuse me, Your Honor,

1101
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,700
but is this for the record?

1102
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,800
Mr. Miller, perhaps you should
return to counsel's table.

1103
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,000
Yes, sir.

1104
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,850
Miss O'Hara?

1105
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,450
Yes?

1106
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,550
Were you aware,

1107
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:32,800
at any time,

1108
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,450
of any problems that
the senior partners had

1109
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,600
with the quality of Andrew's work

1110
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,700
prior to this missing file episode?

1111
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,200
No. No, I wasn't.

1112
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,050
Thank you.

1113
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,000
No more questions, Your Honor.

1114
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,800
Is Andrew Beckett the kind of lawyer
who misplaces crucial documents?

1115
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,700
Not to my knowledge.

1116
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,250
No.

1117
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:03,000
Mr. Collins, if you wanted to
make a lawyer look incompetent,

1118
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,250
would this be a good way of going about it?

1119
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:08,950
Hiding an important document
maybe for a few hours,

1120
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:13,250
and then making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it?

1121
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,900
Why would Mr. Wheeler and
the others behave so outrageously?

1122
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,900
Because they found out Andy was sick?

1123
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,550
- He's not answering the question.
- Perhaps.

1124
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,200
We have lawyers who've had
heart attacks, ulcers,

1125
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,250
prostate cancer, leukemia.

1126
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,250
No one sandbagged them.

1127
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:32,000
Did you have something to do
with this file being lost

1128
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,650
accidentally on purpose?

1129
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,100
- Objection.
- I'll rephrase.

1130
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,550
Did you have anything to do
with this file being misplaced?

1131
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,350
Absolutely not.

1132
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,100
Are you a homosexual?

1133
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,550
What?

1134
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,900
Are you a homosexual?
Answer the question. Are you a homo?

1135
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,200
Are you a faggot? You know, a punk,
queen, pillow biter, fairy?

1136
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,300
Bootie snatcher, rump roaster?
Are you gay?!

1137
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,300
- Objection!
- Order!

1138
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,550
Order!

1139
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,000
Where did this come from?

1140
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,200
Suddenly counsel's attacking
his own witness?

1141
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:07,050
Mr. Collins' sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case.

1142
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,300
Please have a seat, Miss Conine.

1143
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:16,250
Would you approach the bench, Mr. Miller?

1144
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,350
Could you kindly share with me

1145
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:33,250
exactly what's going on inside your head,

1146
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,250
because at this moment,
I don't have a clue.

1147
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,900
Your Honor,

1148
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,600
everybody in this courtroom

1149
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,450
is thinking about...

1150
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,350
sexual orientation,
you know, sexual preference,

1151
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:54,000
whatever you want to call it.

1152
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,000
Who does what to whom
and how they do it.

1153
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,800
I mean, they're looking at Andrew Beckett.

1154
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,250
They're thinking about it.

1155
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:05,300
They're looking at Mr. Wheeler,
Miss Conine, even you, Your Honor.

1156
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,550
They're wondering about it.

1157
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:09,950
Trust me,

1158
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,450
I know that they're looking at me
and thinking about it.

1159
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,450
So let's just get it out in the open.

1160
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,600
Let's get it out of the closet.

1161
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,150
Because this case is not
just about AIDS, is it?

1162
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,300
So let's talk about
what this case is really all about.

1163
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,500
The general public's hatred, our loathing,

1164
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,850
our fear of homosexuals.

1165
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,950
And how that climate of hatred and fear

1166
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:37,850
translated into the firing
of this particular homosexual,

1167
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:43,000
my client, Andrew Beckett.

1168
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,000
Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.

1169
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,100
Very good.

1170
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,850
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind

1171
01:06:55,950 --> 01:07:01,400
to matters of race, creed, color, religion,

1172
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,700
and sexual orientation.

1173
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,500
With all due respect, Your Honor...

1174
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,250
we don't live in this courtroom,
though, do we?

1175
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,950
No, we don't.

1176
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,000
However, as regards to this witness,

1177
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,400
I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.

1178
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,500
How many weeks at a time

1179
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,000
would you be out to sea
without stopping at port?

1180
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,450
Anywhere from two weeks
to several months.

1181
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:33,550
Any women on board?

1182
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,500
Not when I was in the Navy.

1183
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,300
So, during these long voyages,

1184
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,300
months at a time out to sea,

1185
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,300
no women in sight,

1186
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,900
hundreds of hardworking,

1187
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,700
robust young men
in the prime of their lives,

1188
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,050
at the peak of their natural
appetites and desires,

1189
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,800
their God-given hormonal instincts,

1190
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,550
anything going on?

1191
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,400
Going on? Like what?

1192
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,050
Like two sailors down below
making flippy-flop.

1193
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,600
Objection.

1194
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,000
Mr. Miller.

1195
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:11,250
We had one guy like that.

1196
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,750
You haven't ruled on my objection,
Your Honor.

1197
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,250
Go on, Mr. Miller.

1198
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,300
You had one guy "like that".

1199
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
You mean a homosexual?

1200
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,500
He strutted around quarters naked,
trying to get everybody to notice him.

1201
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,150
Made everyone sick.

1202
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,750
He was destroying our morale.

1203
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,800
So we let him know this kind
of behavior was not acceptable.

1204
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,050
How'd you do that?

1205
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,350
What'd you do? Wrote him a letter?

1206
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,450
We stuck his head in a latrine
after ten of us had used it.

1207
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,750
You taught him a lesson, didn't you?

1208
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,100
Yes, we did.

1209
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,300
Just like firing Andrew Beckett
taught him a lesson.

1210
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,300
- Objection.
- I withdraw.

1211
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,100
You were aware when you worked
with Melissa Benedict

1212
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,800
that she had AIDS, is that correct?

1213
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,400
She didn't try to conceal it.

1214
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,700
So you are aware of the difference
between a bruise and a lesion.

1215
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,800
Is that correct?

1216
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,200
Beckett told me he had been hit
by a racquetball, and I believed him.

1217
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,000
Didn't you try to avoid contact
with Mrs. Benedict

1218
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,850
after you found out she had AIDS?

1219
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,750
She says, and I quote, that you...

1220
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,050
"were repulsed by her, you avoided her."
Is that correct?

1221
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:13,600
I felt, and I still feel nothing
but the deepest sympathy

1222
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,800
and compassion for people like Melissa

1223
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,500
who contracted this terrible disease

1224
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,800
through no fault of their own.

1225
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,500
Okay, don't move, now.

1226
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Okay.

1227
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:02,200
Boy! It's not going through.

1228
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,400
We may have to flush it out again.

1229
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,500
The vein's closed.

1230
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,200
We've got to call Barbara.

1231
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,250
Nurse Ratchett.

1232
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,100
Wait a minute.

1233
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,400
Yeah, tell her to come over.

1234
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,900
Look, I've...

1235
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,600
There's so much stuff
that I need to get done.

1236
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,650
Can we... Can we just skip
the treatment for tonight?

1237
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:44,050
No. No, we are not skipping this treatment.

1238
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,050
It's my arm, and it's my treatment,

1239
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,600
and I say skip it.

1240
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,000
Well...

1241
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,250
You know something?

1242
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,600
Hmm?

1243
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,900
That stuff is saving your life.

1244
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,600
What's the matter with you tonight?

1245
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,000
Close the law book.

1246
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,300
Will you just...

1247
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,100
Eh?

1248
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,300
The least you can do...

1249
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,000
is look at me,

1250
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,000
and give me a little of your time, man.

1251
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,150
You got it?

1252
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,550
You are worried...

1253
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:39,300
we don't have very much time left,
now, aren't you?

1254
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,150
No. No.

1255
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,000
Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

1256
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm going to start planning
my memorial service.

1257
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm going to start preparing
for the inevitable.

1258
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,250
Maybe you should think about it.

1259
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,000
No.

1260
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,450
No, no, no.

1261
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:49,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1262
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,650
I've got a better idea.

1263
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:09,000
- Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.
- Hey, hey!

1264
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,100
Oh, Joe Miller, counselor!

1265
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:22,600
[Introducing each other]

1266
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,100
Do you care for something to drink?

1267
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,350
I'll take care of Joe, Maria.

1268
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,700
- Okay, okay.
- Thanks very much.

1269
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,050
You're looking... alive tonight!

1270
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,750
Oh, I had a blood transfusion.
And I feel great.

1271
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,200
So, you like it? I'm a lawsuit.

1272
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,400
You get it? I'm a lawsuit.

1273
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,900
- It's not bad.
- Law-suit.

1274
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,100
- Law-suit.
- It's not bad.

1275
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,250
- What are you drinking?
- Wine is good.

1276
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,950
Can I have some of the red, please?

1277
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:54,650
So, we've got to get to this Q&A
sometime tonight, you know?

1278
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:58,400
Sure, yes. Just one problem.
I'm at a party right now.

1279
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,800
- Yes, it's fine. Whatever.
- No, no.

1280
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,000
- We'll get to it.
- Listen...

1281
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,500
- Just later, that's all.
- Thank you.

1282
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,000
Hi, Joe Miller.

1283
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:06,450
Do I know you?

1285
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,800
Ah... Lawsuit.

1286
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,500
Nice. Have fun.

- Sure.

1311
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,200
Congratulations, counselor.

1312
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,650
Congratulations?

1313
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:19,000
You've survived what I assume
to be your first gay party intact.

1314
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,350
Let me tell you something, Andrew.

1315
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:28,050
When you're brought up the way I am,
the way most people are in this country,

1316
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,550
there's not a whole lot of discussion
about homosexuality,

1317
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,400
or, what do you call it, alternate lifestyles.

1318
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,350
As a kid you're taught
that queers are funny,

1319
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:41,100
queers are weird,
queers dress up like their mother,

1320
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,750
that they're afraid to fight,
that they're a danger to little kids,

1321
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,500
and that all they want to do
is to get into your pants.

1322
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,200
And that pretty much sums up
the general thinking out there,

1323
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,800
if you want to know the truth about it.

1324
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,350
Thank you for sharing that with me.

1325
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,450
Very well. All right, let's go over this testimony.

1326
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,150
We've got a big day on Monday.

1327
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,100
Okay. First I'll ask you...

1328
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,400
"Can you describe the circumstances,
in which you joined the firm

1329
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,450
"Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman,
Tetlow & Brown?"

1330
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,300
Miller...

1331
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,200
Do you ever pray?

1332
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:25,450
Andrew, that is not the answer
to the question.

1333
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,150
But, yes, I pray.

1334
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:30,150
What do you pray for?

1335
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,850
What do you mean? I pray.

1336
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:35,350
I pray that... I don't know.

1337
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,800
I pray that my baby is healthy.

1338
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,450
I pray that my wife made it
through the delivery.

1339
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,200
I pray that the Phillies win the pennant.

1340
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,650
Now, can we go through these questions?

1341
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,300
Number one,
"Can you describe the circumstances,

1342
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,050
"in which you joined the firm

1343
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,550
"Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman,
Tetlow & Brown?"

1344
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:54,800
Can you do that for me?

1345
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,150
There's a possibility I won't be around
to see the end of this trial.

1346
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,350
Yes, I've considered that.

1347
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:09,350
I've made some provisions
in my will for some charities.

1348
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,850
Miguel will need a lawyer.
I know it's not your area.

1349
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:14,550
I know a good probate lawyer.

1350
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,200
Thank you.

1351
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,000
You're welcome.

1352
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,400
Now, can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm

1353
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,750
Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman,
Tetlow & Brown?

1354
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,800
Do you mind this music?
Do you like opera?

1355
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,900
I am not that familiar with opera, Andrew.

1356
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,000
This is my favorite aria.

1357
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:50,400
It's Maria Callas.

1358
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,500
It's Andrea Chenier.

1359
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,250
Umberto Giordano.

1360
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,250
This is Madeleine.

1361
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:09,450
She's saying how...

1362
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:17,000
during the French Revolution,
the mob set fire to her house.

1363
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,150
And her mother died... saving her.

1364
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,450
She says, "Look!

1365
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:26,150
"The place that cradled me is burning.

1366
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
"I'm alone."

1367
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,500
Do you hear the heartache in her voice?

1368
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,400
Can you feel it, Joe?

1369
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:59,000
Now, in come the strings,
and it changes everything.

1370
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:03,500
The music, it fills with a hope.

1371
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:09,250
Now, it'll change again. Listen.

1372
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,600
Listen.

1373
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:20,800
"I bring sorrow to those who love me."

1374
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Oh, that single cello!

1375
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:38,350
"It was during this sorrow
that love came to me."

1376
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:49,350
"A voice filled with harmony."

1377
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,100
"It said, live still."

1378
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,250
"I am life."

1379
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:05,950
"Heaven is in your eyes."

1380
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,000
"Is everything around you
just the blood and the mud?

1381
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,000
"I am divine.

1382
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:59,000
"I am oblivion.

1383
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,000
"I am the god

1384

"that comes down
from the heavens to the earth

1385
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:15,100
"and makes of the earth a heaven."

1386
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:31,450
"I am love.

1387
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:33,600
"I am love."

1388
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,450
Well...

1389
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,150
Hey...

1390
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,400
Geez, I'd better get out of here.

1391
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,700
Lisa's...

1392
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,500
I told her that, you know...

1393
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,150
I'll look over the Q&A.

1394
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,300
No, you're ready. You're ready.

1395
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,550
Jesus!

1396
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,500

Oh, I love you, little Larice.

Place your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1400
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,450
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,

1401
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,400
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1402
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,700
I do.

1403
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,200
Please be seated.

1404
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,800
Andrew,

1405
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,800
can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm

1406
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:07,050
Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman,
Tetlow & Brown?

1407
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:13,000
Wyant-Wheeler
aggressively recruited me.

1408
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,550
They were the most
prestigious firm in Philadelphia,

1409
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:18,250
full of opportunity,

1410
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:20,650
and I was impressed with the partners.

1411
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,400
Including Charles Wheeler?

1412
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,400
Particularly Charles.

1413
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,550
What impressed you about him?

1414
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:31,050
He was the kind of lawyer
I thought I wanted to be.

1415
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:32,750
And what kind of lawyer is that?

1416
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:36,700
Possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law,

1417
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,550
a razor-sharp litigator, genuine leader,

1418
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:44,300
gifted at bringing out
the very best in others,

1419
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,600
an awesome ability to illuminate

1420
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,050
the most complex of legal concepts

1421
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,400
to a colleague, to a courtroom,

1422
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,550
to the man in the street.

1423
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:01,350
The kind of person who can
play three sets of tennis,

1424
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,850
but doesn't sweat.

1425
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,600
Underneath an elegant surface,

1426
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:11,450
he has an adventurous spirit.

1427
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:15,700
So, in the years you worked
at Wyant-Wheeler,

1428
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,450
did you ever tell Charles Wheeler
you were gay?

1429
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:20,050
No, I didn't.

1430
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,600
Why not?

1431
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:24,750
You don't bring your personal life
into a law firm.

1432
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:27,100
You're not supposed to have
a personal life, really.

1433
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:32,100
Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles eventually,

1434
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,950
but then this... something happened

1435
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,650
at the racquet club

1436
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,650
about three and ha... three years ago.

1437
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:43,400
Somebody started telling some jokes.

1438
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:50,750
What do you call a woman
who has PMS and ESP

1439
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:52,000
at the same time?

1440
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,250
I don't know, Roger,
what do you call her?

1441
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:57,050
A bitch who knows everything.

1442
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,100
Sounds like someone I know.

1443
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:04,000
Hey, Walter, how does
a faggot fake an orgasm?

1444
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,750
He throws a quart of hot yogurt
on your back!

1445
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:12,100
That reminds me of the hairdresser...

1446
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,500
How'd that make you feel?

1447
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,850
Relieved.

1448
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,950
That I never told him I was gay.

1449
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:22,500
Just very relieved.

1450
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,500
All right.

1451
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,000
Are you a good lawyer, Andrew?

1452
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,350
I'm an excellent lawyer.

1453
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,050
What makes you an excellent lawyer?

1454
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,850
I love the law.

1455
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,350
I know the law.

1456
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:39,500
I excel at practicing.

1457
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,200
What do you love about the law, Andrew?

1458
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,050
I... Many things.

1459
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,050
What I love the most about the law?

1460
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,300
Yes.

1461
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:58,650
Is that every now and again,
not often, but occasionally,

1462
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,400
you get to be a part of

1463
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,300
justice being done.

1464
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,150
That really is

1465
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:14,300
quite a thrill when that happens.

1466
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,300
Thank you, Andrew.

1467
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:27,400
You said earlier you...

1468
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,850
aspire to be the kind of person
who had an adventurous spirit.

1469
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:33,300
Is that correct?

1470
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,250
Something like that.

1471
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,400
Do you take risks?

1472
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,900
In my work, yes, calculated risks.

1473
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,500
You have to.

1474
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,100
Did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress?

1475
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,500
That... long hours

1476
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,150
and stressful working conditions
might damage the immune system

1477
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,700
and speed up your illness?

1478
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,450
My doctor mentioned the impact AIDS...

1479
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:05,800
Excuse me.

1480
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,700
My doctor mentioned the impact stress
could have on the immune system.

1481
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,200
Have you ever been to the
Stallion Showcase Cinema

1482
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,200
on 21st street?

1483
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,900
I've been to... that...

1484
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,900
I've been to that theater...

1485
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:41,150
three times in my life.

1486
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,500
What kind of movies do they show there?

1487
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,850
Gay movies.

1488
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,350
Gay pornographic movies?

1489
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,300
Yes.

1490
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,650
Objection, Your Honor.

1491
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,100
Your honor, this line of questioning

1492
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,900
is vital to the issue of credibility.

1493
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:01,400
Let's...

1494
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,100
Let's see where this is going.
Continue, counselor.

1495
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,950
Do men have sex with each other
in that theater?

1496
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,850
Some men.

1497
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:16,200
Have you ever had sex
with anyone in that theater?

1498
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,200
I'm Robert.

1499
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,350
Andy.

1500
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:22,250
Yes.

1501
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:24,350
Once.

1502
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:25,900
When?

1503
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,900
Approximately what year
did that event take place?

1504
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I guess it was...

1505
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,350
1984.

1506
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:39,250
'84, '85.

1507
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,650
Were you aware in 1984, '85

1508
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:46,050
that there was a fatal disease
out there called AIDS,

1509
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:51,150
and that you could contract it
through sexual activity?

1510
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:56,700
I'd heard of some...
I'd heard of a thing...

1511
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,950
The gay plague, the gay cancer.

1512
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:04,750
We didn't know how you could get it,

1513
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,950
or that it killed you.

1514
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,850
Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?

1515
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:14,650
No.

1516
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,850
No, I could use some water, though.

1517
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:21,350
John, could you bring Mr. Beckett
some water please?

1518
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,150
While you were employed at Wyant-Wheeler,
you did everything you could

1519
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:33,100
to make sure no one knew that
you were an active homosexual.

1520
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,700
Is that correct?

1521
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,800
No.

1522
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,550
That's not correct. I never lied about it.

1523
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:49,250
As a homosexual,

1524
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:54,800
one is often forced
to conceal one's sexuality.

1525
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,950
Isn't that right?

1526
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:59,450
In some circumstances, yes.

1527
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:03,100
Isn't it true that you've spent your life
pretending to be something you're not,

1528
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:08,200
so much so that the art
of concealment and dishonesty...

1529
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,150
- ...has become second nature--
- Your Honor, I object.

1530
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,900
I'll withdraw it, Your Honor.

1531
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,500
Mr. Beckett, were you living with...

1532
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,700
Miguel Alvarez

1533
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,350
in 1984 or '85

1534
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:25,150
when you had your...

1535
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:29,600
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater?

1536
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,050
Yes.

1537
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:37,750
So, you could have infected him,
isn't that right?

1538
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:40,600
Miguel has not been infected.

1539
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,400
You didn't answer my question.

1540
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,100
You could have infected
Mr. Alvarez at that time.

1541
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,750
Is that correct?

1542
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:53,050
Yes.

1543
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:55,850
You've testified that
the lesions on your face

1544
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:59,100
were visible to the people
that you worked with, correct?

1545
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,850
That's right.

1546
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,000
And it's your contention

1547
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,650
that when the partners
were made aware of the lesions,

1548
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:10,450
that they leapt to the conclusion
that you had AIDS and they fired you.

1549
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,900
Is that correct?

1550
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:17,350
As painful as it is

1551
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:21,450
to accuse my former colleagues

1552
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,300
of such reprehensible behavior,

1553
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:29,050
it is the only conclusion I could come to.

1554
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:33,150
Do you have any lesions
on your face at this time?

1555
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,100
One.

1556
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,800
Here, right by my ear.

1557
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:44,700
Your Honor, may I approach the witness?

1558
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,550
Yes, you may.

1559
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,300
Remembering that you're under oath,

1560
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,300
answering truthfully,

1561
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,400
can you see the lesions
on your face in this mirror

1562
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
from three feet away?

1563
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,500
Answering truthfully.

1564
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,300
Well, at the time I was fired,

1565
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,600
I had four lesions,
and they were much bigger.

1566
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,100
Could you answer the question, please?

1567
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:38,450
Well, no. No, I can't really see it.

1568
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:41,350
No.

1569
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:44,950
No more questions, Your Honor.

1570
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:48,500
I think this would be a good time
to break for today.

1571
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,300
We can reconvene in the morning.

1572
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,100
I hate this case.

1573
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,950
Your Honor, may I have
five minutes in redirect?

1574
01:36:56,050 --> 01:37:00,100
Mr. Beckett, can you
go on for five minutes?

1575
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,350
Three minutes.

1576
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,900
Yes, yes.

1577
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,400
May I borrow your mirror, please?

1578
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,900
Andrew...

1579
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:16,150
Do you have any lesions
on any part of your body

1580
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:20,650
at this time that resemble
the lesions you had on your face

1581
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,800
at the time that you were fired?

1582
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,800
Yes.

1583
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,050
On my torso.

1584
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:30,000
Your torso. If it please the court,

1585
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,900
I would like to ask Andrew
to remove his shirt,

1586
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,500
so that, you know, everyone here

1587
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,900
could get an accurate idea
of what we're talking about.

1588
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Objection!

1589
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,650
Your Honor, it would
unfairly influence the jury.

1590
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:46,200
Your Honor, if Andrew was forced
to use a wheelchair due to his illness,

1591
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,950
would the defense ask him to park it outside,

1592
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,850
because it would unfairly influence the jury?

1593
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:53,650
Come on, we're talking about AIDS,
we're talking about lesions.

1594
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,000
Let's see what we're talking about.

1595
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,550
I'll allow it.

1596
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:01,050
Mr. Beckett, would you please
remove your shirt?

1597
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:15,550
My God, what a nightmare!

1598
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:17,350
He asked for it.

1599
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,200
Andrew,

1600
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:06,050
can you see the lesions
on your chest in this mirror?

1601
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:07,900
Yes.

1602
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,300
Thank you.

1603
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:24,950
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1604
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:26,300
I do.

1605
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,050
Please be seated.

1606
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,150
Mr. Wheeler,

1607
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:41,950
were you aware that Andrew Beckett

1608
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,900
was suffering from AIDS

1609
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,700
at the time of his departure
from Wyant-Wheeler?

1610
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,250
No.

1611
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:50,200
For absolute clarity,

1612
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:55,850
did you fire Andrew Beckett,
because he had AIDS?

1613
01:39:55,950 --> 01:40:01,000
No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett,
because he had AIDS.

1614
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:06,100
Mr. Wheeler, can you explain
in a way that leaves no doubt

1615
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,800
why you promoted

1616
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,500
Andrew Beckett through your firm,

1617
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:14,750
and then, most importantly,

1618
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:18,250
why you eventually asked him to leave?

1619
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,000
If you're the owner
of a major league ball club,

1620
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:27,050
you recruit the hot rookie,

1621
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:33,000
and Andy was tremendously
promising as a young attorney.

1622
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:36,700
Fresh out of Penn. Crackerjack.

1623
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,550
That's why we went after him,
that's why we hired him,

1624
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:44,200
and that's why we stuck with him
year after year.

1625
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,700
Why did you give him

1626
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,550
opportunity after opportunity?

1627
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:54,050
Well, when you groom someone

1628
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:58,200
the way we groomed Andy, nurturing him,

1629
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:02,750
lavishing all kinds
of special treatment on him,

1630
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:05,650
you make quite an investment.

1631
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:10,150
We were waiting for the promise
to kick in and deliver.

1632
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:14,400
But ultimately we could
no longer ignore the gap

1633
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:18,300
between the reality and the promise.

1634
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,350
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

1635
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,050
No more questions at this time,
Your Honor.

1636
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:34,150
Mr. Miller?

1637
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,700
Objection.

1638
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,000
Your Honor, objection!

1639
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,400
All right, Mr. Miller. That'll be sufficient.

1640
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,600
Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.

1641
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:47,300
You are... you are my hero.

1642
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:51,000
Andrew is right. You are the greatest.

1643
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,000
Are you gay?

1644
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,950
Objection.

1645
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:00,250
How dare you!

1646
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:03,300
Witness will kindly answer.

1647
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,700
No, I am not a homosexual.

1648
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,200
Isn't it true that when you realized

1649
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,200
Andrew Beckett, your golden boy,

1650
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,600
your future senior partner,
was gay and had AIDS,

1651
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,400
it drove a stake of fear

1652
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,950
right through your heterosexual heart?

1653
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:25,600
Remembering all the hugs
and the handshakes,

1654
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,350
the intimate moments in the sauna,

1655
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:30,650
the friendly pats on the backside
that you and Andrew exchanged

1656
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,750
like I've exchanged sometimes.

1657
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,800
It made you say...

1658
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:38,450
"My God, what does this say about me?"

1659
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:40,550
Objection, Your Honor.

1660
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:46,250
The witness will please
respond to the question.

1661
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,900
Mr. Miller, you may tap dance
around me all you wish

1662
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,500
with your innuendoes
and locker-room fantasies,

1663
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,000
but the truth still remains

1664
01:42:57,250 --> 01:43:00,500
that your client worked
when he wanted to work,

1665
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,150
telling us what he thought
we needed to know

1666
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,150
about who he really was.

1667
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,750
Andy insisted on bending the rules,

1668
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:11,200
and his work suffered
tremendously in the long run

1669
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:12,650
as a result of that.

1670
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:15,550
Well, you explain this to me
like I'm a six-year-old, Mr. Wheeler,

1671
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:17,200
'cause I just don't get it.

1672
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,850
Who makes these rules
that you're talking about, huh?

1673
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:21,400
You?

1674
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,000
Read your Bible, Mr. Miller.

1675
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,700
Old and the New Testament.

1676
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,050
Pretty valuable rules in there.

1677
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:31,200
Excuse me.

1678
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,000
Andrew?

1679
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,750
Excuse me. I can't...

1680
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,200
Andy!

1681
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,900
Excuse me. Andy!

1682
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,100
For chrissakes, somebody get a doctor!

1683
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,800
Turn over now.

1684
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,100
Call an ambulance, please.

1685
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,900
- Right away!
- Joe, Joe, Joe!

1686
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,400
- An ambulance, please!
- Just get an ambulance.

1687
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,950
Let him breathe! Let him breathe!

1688
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:59,700
Please make room for him.

1689
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,050
It's not working!

1690
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:09,850
No, it is making it worse!

1691
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:15,650
Did you notice any changes whatsoever

1692
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,200
in Andrew's appearance
over the course of the year

1693
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,950
leading up to his termination?

1694
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:24,000
Yes, I did.

1695
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,350
Were these changes for the better
or for the worse?

1696
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:31,750
Sometimes for the better,
but generally, they were for the worse.

1697
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:34,300
Mr. Seidman, what did you
think caused these changes

1698
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,100
in Andy's appearance?

1699
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,200
I was afraid.

1700
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,350
I suspected Andy had AIDS.

1701
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,150
Order. Order!

1702
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,150
Thank you. Your witness.

1703
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,250
Miss Conine?

1704
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,800
Mr. Seidman,

1705
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,250
did you share your suspicions
with Mr. Wheeler

1706
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:57,800
or any of the other managing partners

1707
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,950
at any time before the decision

1708
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,700
to fire Andrew Beckett was made?

1709
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,050
No. No, I didn't.

1710
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:09,650
I didn't mention it to anyone, not even Andy.

1711
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:14,000
I didn't even give him
a chance to talk about it.

1712
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,300
And I think I'm going to regret that

1713
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,800
for as long as I live.

1714
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,700
Any more questions, Miss Conine?

1715
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,950
That's all, Your Honor.

1716
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:26,550
Now, they are saying
that he wasn't a good lawyer,

1717
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:28,300
he was mediocre,

1718
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,250
and the fact that they gave him

1719
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:33,400
the most important lawsuit
that they ever had

1720
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,450
for one of their most important clients,

1721
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:37,650
now, they say that
that doesn't prove anything,

1722
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:40,150
because that was just a test.

1723
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,750
What'd they call it, a carrot?

1724
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:43,300
Yeah, what's up, doc?

1725
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,200
To see if he would rise to the occasion.

1726
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,250
Okay, okay, so...

1727
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,700
Say I've got to send a pilot
into enemy territory,

1728
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,150
and he's gonna be flying a plane
that costs $350 million.

1729
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:58,200
Who am I gonna put in that plane?

1730
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,150
Some rookie who can't cut the grade,

1731
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,350
because I wanna see
if he can rise to the challenge?

1732
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:07,650
Or am I gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot,

1733
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:10,650
my sharpest, my most
experienced, my top gun,

1734
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:13,200
the very best I've got?

1735
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,350
I just don't get that.

1736
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:20,700
Would somebody please explain it to me...

1737
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,150
like I'm a six-year-old.

1738
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:27,600
- Juror number six.
- I agree.

1739
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:30,100
- Juror number seven.
- I agree.

1740
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,900
- Juror number eight.
- Agree.

1741
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,350
- Juror number nine.
- I agree.

1742
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:37,300
Juror number ten.

1743
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,000
I disagree.

1744
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,900
- Juror number 11.
- I agree.

1745
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,650
- Juror number 12.
- Agree.

1746
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,650
Have you awarded any damages?

1747
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:51,150
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

1748
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,450
For back pay and loss of benefits,

1749
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:56,750
we award $143,000.

1750
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:58,600
For mental anguish and humiliation,

1751
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:01,400
we award $100,000.

1752
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,750
And for punitive damages,
we award $4,782,000.

1753
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:13,500
You may record the verdict.

1754
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,600
Everyone remain seated
until the jury is removed.

1755
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,800
How could they do that?

1756
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,000
This trial is now concluded.

1757
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,500
Congratulations!

1758
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:35,450
We'll strain ourselves getting
a reversal on this one.

1759
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:36,650
We'll get started in the morning.

1760
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,250
Well, that's that.

1761
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:40,000
Congratulations, Mr. Miller.

1762
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,150
We'll see you at the appeal.

1763
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,100
Congratulations.

1764
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,550
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1765
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:49,400
Oh, man!

1766
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,550
Thanks a lot.

1767
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:53,000
- I'll see you at the hospital.
- Okay.

1768
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,800
Oh, Mr. Miller! Hi, how're you doing?

1769
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,300
- Do you know where his room is?
- It's down the hall.

1770
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,100
The one off the lounge.

1771
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,800
Thanks.

1772
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,650
If he leaves the hospital, which is unlikely,

1773
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:17,900
don't expect him to be remotely
like he was before this crisis.

1774
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,500
He's lost the vision in his right eye,

1775
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,800
and because of the CMV,
he will not regain his vision.

1776
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,800
Next door to the right.

1777
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,600
The CMV has ravaged his body...

1778
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,100
Hi. Congratulations.

1779
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,100
Hey!

1780
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,150
Way to go!

1781
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:44,100
Man of the hour.

1782
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:53,600
Hey, Joe.

1783
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:54,650
Hi.

1784
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,850
We are so grateful to you.

1785
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,300
You were wonderful.
Thank you so much.

1786
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,000
- Can I take that?
- Yeah.

1787
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,250
- I brought some...
- Oh wonderful.

1788
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,850
- ...cheese and stuff.
- Thanks.

1789
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,500
How're you doing?

1790
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:43,750
What do you call a thousand lawyers

1791
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:46,950
chained together at the bottom of the ocean?

1792
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,950
I don't know.

1793
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:52,250
A good start.

1794
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:04,200
Excellent work, counselor.

1795
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,850
I thank you.

1796
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:12,150
It was great working with you,

1797
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,000
counselor.

1798
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,000
Well, I'd better go.

1799
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,400
Yeah, sure thing.

1800
01:50:55,450 --> 01:50:57,500
I'll see you later?

1801
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,050
Thanks for stopping by.

1802
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:09,100
I'll see you again.

1803
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:18,350
Well, I'll...

1804
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:20,600
keep it on ice for you.

1805
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,000
See you.

1806
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:28,700
Joe, I just want to say thank you.

1807
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:34,000
We really appreciate it.

1808
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,250
We'll see you again?

1809
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,500
All right.

1810
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:46,700
He's a fighter.

1811
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,000
We just want to get him home.

1812
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,150
Thank you, Joe.

1813
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:02,100
Oh, sorry.

1814
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,100
What do you call a thousand lawyers

1815
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,450
chained together at the bottom of the ocean?

1816
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,000
A good start?

1817
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,350
Very amusing.

1818
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:34,100
I'll see you tomorrow, buddy, okay?

1819
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,000
See you tomorrow.

1820
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,700
God bless you, Andy.

1821
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:54,400
Good night, son.

1822
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,500
Try to get some rest, okay?

1823
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:59,050
I love you, Andy.

1824
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:01,450
I love you too, Dad.

1825
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:07,300
See you first thing tomorrow.

1826
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:31,700
- It's okay.
- Don't worry, Don.

1827
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,600
See you tomorrow.

1828
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:34,650
It's okay.

1829
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,850
See you tomorrow.

1830
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:39,000
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

1831
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,650
It's all right. It's all right.

1832
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:43,850
It's okay. It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1833
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:52,000
Good night, my angel.

1834
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:54,400
My sweet boy.

1835
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,550
Let me help you.

1836
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,000
Miguel...

1837
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I'm ready.

1838
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,850
Hello.

1839
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:37,400
Joe, it's Miguel.

1840
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,250
Hello.
