1
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,706
Dr Gilmore, please.

2
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,041
Yes... no.
This is his wife.

3
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,964
No, I think it's the alternator.
I left it at the garage.

4
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,678
Oh, that's OK.
I'll wait.

5
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,508
Just tell him to go
ahead and fix it.

6
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,514
- Hello.
- Hello?

7
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,476
- Who's that? Mike?
- Brian?

8
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:17,431
- Mike, I'm talking to your mother.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hi, yeah...

9
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,235
Yeah, I will. I will.
OK, hang up now.

10
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,572
- I can't, I'm in a payphone.
- No, no, I'm in the city.

11
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,945
I'm in New York. The car wouldn't
start so I took the train in.

12
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,245
No, I took the train in.
Yeah. All right?

13
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,995
- OK?
- Yeah, OK. How are you'?

14
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,035
- Tell him I'm fine.
- Good.

15
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,253
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

16
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,373
Thanks. Bye.

17
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,015
Merry Christmas!

18
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,694
Is that chilli? Yeah, a little.

19
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,493
A little more chilli.

20
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,832
Thank you very much.

21
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,452
Excuse me. Could you
press four, please? Thank you.

22
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,659
You shouldn't be eating in here.

23
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,206
- People have clothes on.
- I know. I'm sorry.

24
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,275
That's good.

25
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,940
- Cash or charge?
- It's a charge.

26
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,199
OK.

27
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,600
<i>OK'?</i>

28
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,957
Here you are, sir.

29
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,882
Hey, Lasky.

30
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:35,007
Of all the places to have lunch,
tell me what we're doing here.

31
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,095
It's Christmas Eve.

32
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,142
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, right.

33
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,261
How are you?

34
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,187
- Lousy, how are you?
- Great. Let's get drunk.

35
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,101
- Are you crazy?
- I just feel good, that's all.

36
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,404
My car broke down, I got in late,
I missed Jay

37
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,154
and I have these revisions for him.

38
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,496
And I just spent a fortune buying
the wrong gifts for everybody.

39
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,164
- How's Susan?
- Great.

40
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,793
- Good.
- We're getting a divorce.

41
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,049
- Would you like a drink?
- Uh, yeah.

42
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,169
A...something... What? Um...

43
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,095
A beer. <i>I'll</i> have a beer.

44
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:22,217
Heineken, Michelob, Nielsen's, Beck's,
Bud, Coors, Miller, Miller Lite,

45
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,975
Schlitz, Guinness,
Carlsberg or Lowenbrau.

46
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,688
- Anything.
- Give me a break.

47
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,226
OK, Miller. Miller Lite.

48
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,318
No, I'm sorry. Schlitz.

49
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,109
It's no big deal. It was coming.

50
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,872
I've been seeing Carol...
over a year now. It's no secret.

51
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,037
I figure the kids, you know,
so we stuck it out.

52
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,250
This is better.
it's honest, at least.

53
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,375
- I'm sorry.
- You are?

54
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,336
- Yeah.
- Why?

55
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,427
I don't know.

56
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,891
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

57
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,852
- Where are you going?
- Acapulco. Monday morning.

58
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,357
Ooh!

59
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:13,101
- Which one is David?
- The young young one.

60
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,238
- I told you about him.
- The one from the gym?

61
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,991
Yeah. He has dark hair, big eyes.
The one with the ass.

62
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,742
- Yeah, I remember.
- He's gorgeous.

63
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,865
I remember.

64
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,826
So is this love?

65
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,585
Please!

66
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,458
- When are you coming back?
- New Year's Day.

67
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:39,301
Barry's family's coming in.
We have this dinner every year.

68
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:46,926
Well, he's still my husband. Sort of.
And it's important to him, so...

69
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,309
So, listen...
I'll call you when I get back.

70
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,857
OK. You can...show me your tan.

71
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,908
I'm not going down there
to get a tan.

72
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,869
- Bye, Molly.
- Bye.

73
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,448
Merry Christmas!

74
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,416
Merry Christmas.

75
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,842
- There you go.
- No, none for me.

76
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,427
- No?
- No coffee, no booze, no cigarettes.

77
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,552
- My assets are dwindling.
- You're not missing anything.

78
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,602
- Only pleasure.
- Oh, come on, Daddy.

79
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,640
- It's only a flu.
- The bubonic plague was only a flu.

80
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,904
- Have you seen a doctor?
- I am a doctor!

81
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,153
I could call George.

82
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:45,276
I'm fine. If you discount the angina,
the migraines and the gastritis,

83
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,998
there's nothing wrong with me.

84
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,783
- Here you go.
- Ooh.

85
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,580
Sure you don't wanna
come home with me?

86
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,250
- Christmas in the suburbs? No.
- Why not?

87
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:04,301
- I'd spoil it.
- I know. But come anyway.

88
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:10,303
I'll be fine. I'm such a pain in
the ass these clays I deserve myself.

89
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,522
What are you doing?

90
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,517
- Looking for a match.
- I can't believe this. You devil!

91
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,431
Thank you.

92
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,567
Sir? Sir, wait a minute.
You forgot something.

93
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,608
Thanks.

94
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,532
Excuse me... Excuse me.

95
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,150
Sorry,

96
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,948
Oh, shoot.

97
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,453
- Sorry.
- I'll get it.

98
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,585
- I made it worse.
- Oh, no...

99
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,748
Can I throw that?
You don't mind?

100
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,550
- I don't know.
- Come on. Just go ahead.

101
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,926
- You want a bag?
- This last-minute shopping...

102
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,423
- I have an extra bag. Take this.
- You sure?

103
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,179
- That's all right.
- Thanks a lot.

104
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,682
Watch your step.

105
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,772
- I'm sorry.
- I'll give you a hand.

106
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,655
Don't worry.
That's all right. Thanks.

107
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,773
Just put it on top, if you would.

108
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,367
Thanks.

109
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,199
Here.

110
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,075
- OK?
- Thanks a lot.

111
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,533
- Good.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.

112
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,914
It's OK.

113
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,001
Got it?

114
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,965
Hey! Wait a minute! Excuse me!

115
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,849
I think you have my book.

116
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,559
- Oh. Sorry.
- Yeah.

117
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,606
That's it. Thanks.

118
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,141
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

119
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:26,749
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake,
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake,

120
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,339
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake,
I'm awake, I'm awake!

121
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,380
Wake up!

122
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,423
All right, all right!

123
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,633
Wake up, wake up!

124
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,895
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake.
Come on, come on, come on.

125
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,347
You guys... Come on!

126
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,778
Whoa! Out! 20 more minutes.
And don't open the presents yet!

127
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,945
Don't go downstairs!

128
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,494
Merry Christmas.

129
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,371
Ho, ho, ho.

130
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,745
Don't you want to
open your present?

131
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,333
I wanna know whose idea
it was to have children.

132
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,175
- I know. Yours.
- It was yours.

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,006
Oh, God.
I must've been out of my mind.

134
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,272
OK... OK.

135
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,814
OK, let's get this show
on the road.

136
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,918
Oh, my God.

137
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,917
- No good?
- Oh, my God, no. This is beautiful.

138
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,756
- You like it?
- Yeah, this is really beautiful.

139
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,383
- You can exchange it.
- it's quite a surprise. I...

140
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,934
I wasn't expecting
anything so romantic.

141
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,889
Thank you.

142
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,641
- Merry Christmas. You like it?
- Yes.

143
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,778
OK, and this is for you.

144
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:11,853
Ooh...

145
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,322
- OK, careful, guys.
- It'll be broken by dinner.

146
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:22,279
Hey, Mike. Try to keep
all the pieces together, OK'?

147
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,789
So I don't have to look for them.

148
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,587
I just have to put this one on.

149
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,789
Is that the right one?

150
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,170
- What's this?
- Open it up.

151
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:42,394
- No, you're not right!
- What did I just tell you?

152
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:47,811
Take the decals and put them
in one spot. Put 'em in one spot.

153
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,397
I am putting them in one spot.

154
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,618
I don't get it.

155
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,789
- What's this?
- It's lovely. We can exchange it.

156
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,376
Thanks.

157
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,622
I didn't get this,
I got a book on gardening.

158
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,884
OK, everybody,
let's clean up this mess!

159
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,143
Gardens For All Seasons.
What is that?

160
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,266
Oh, no.

161
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,393
Well, it's a very nice book.

162
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,481
Oh, I'm sorry!

163
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,734
- It is.
- Honey, it's a mistake.

164
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,201
There was a man in the store...
Oh, God.

165
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,321
I'll just take it back.

166
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,870
- I'll take this sweater back, too.
- No, I told you, I like it.

167
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:53,878
- You'll never wear it.
- Yeah, you're right.

168
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,673
- But it'll look great on you.
- That's why I bought it.

169
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,803
Anyway, it's the thought that counts.

170
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,519
That's what I mean. I'll take it back.

171
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,772
- Oh, God. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

172
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,982
- We better get dressed.
- Why?

173
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,774
Irene and Phil.

174
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,657
Oh, yeah. Right.

175
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,778
Oh, no.

176
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,659
When?

177
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,617
Brunch.

178
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,159
Oh, no.

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,370
Come on. It'll be fun.

180
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,297
No, it won't.

181
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,465
You're right, it won't.

182
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,425
<i>OK, I'll call them.
I'll call them and cancel.</i>

183
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,094
No, I just thought
we could spend the clay together.

184
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,386
- Mm-hm.
- For once.

185
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,107
Irene, hi. Brian.

186
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,901
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

187
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:58,313
It's all right. If you want to.

188
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,783
Listen, Molly wants to talk to you.

189
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,120
- Brian, I said it's all right.
- it's up to you.

190
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,498
- Brian!
- You can tell her, go ahead.

191
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,502
Hi, Irene, it's me.

192
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,469
Uh-huh.

193
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,002
No, I think it's a great idea.

194
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,048
I do.

195
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,471
Uh-huh. What time is good for you?

196
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,881
OK, thanks a lot.
Will it be ready by tomorrow?

197
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,965
- Give me a call.
- OK.

198
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,207
All tickets.

199
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,462
All tickets, please.
All tickets.

200
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,717
Thank you. Thank you very much.

201
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,446
- Rizzoli's.
- What?

202
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,982
- The bookstore. Rizzoli's.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,451
I was trying to remember
where I saw you. The books.

204
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,950
Oh, my God.

205
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,408
I dropped everything.
You helped me.

206
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,454
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

207
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,628
Yes, I remember you.

208
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,671
I kept looking at you.
I knew I knew you from somewhere.

209
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,053
Yeah. You...you had
all the...packages.

210
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,383
- Yeah. I took yours.
- Yes, right.

211
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,970
I still have it, you know.
It's still there.

212
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,392
Boats - yours was boats.
Yeah, I liked it. It was good.

213
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:28,278
- Uh, anyway, I'm glad I remembered.
- I'm glad you remembered, too.

214
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,361
Very nice to see you again.
I better...

215
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,239
It was nice to see you.

216
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,204
By the way, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

217
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,126
Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas.

218
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,180
Frank. Frank!

219
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:58,305
- Yeah?
- We were talking about Houston.

220
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,762
- Texas.
- Right.

221
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:06,898
- Where the hell are you?
- I don't know. I was thinking.

222
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,481
Think about Houston.
Six months, seven at the outside.

223
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,700
- A year at least.
- 'Come in, Frank.'

224
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,152
I'm on eight. I'll be right down.

225
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:20,285
- No way, it's the same building.
- I can't, Vic, I have family.

226
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,287
- Find somebody there.
- There's nobody.

227
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,837
- There's money, work...
- I'm not finished here.

228
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,800
- I need you there.
- Let me think about it.

229
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,675
- Say yes. Think about it later.
- That's a commitment.

230
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,890
- You're a pain in the ass.
- But I'm worth it.

231
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:40,350
- Think about it, will ya?
- All right. All right!

232
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,898
- What's the problem?
- It's this seal here.

233
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,651
- All we gotta do is cut this pipe.
- Well, who authorised that?

234
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:55,700
This afternoon after four o'clock.
No, no. Grand Central to Dobbs Ferry.

235
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,615
Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah.

236
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,333
Wait a minute. OK.

237
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,214
5:10, ma...

238
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,916
5252...

239
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,626
6220...

240
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,084
6253...

241
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,212
OK, that's good. Thanks.

242
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,557
Hi!

243
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,843
Ooh... You asleep?

244
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,468
- Molly?
- Hi.

245
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,811
- Ah, it's you.
- What?

246
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,351
- Hi.
- I'm not awake.

247
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,572
- Go back to sleep.
- No, no, no.

248
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:40,659
- You been here long?
- No.

249
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,995
Just walked in.

250
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,454
- So what'd they say?
- Your mother...

251
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,130
What?

252
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,420
The flowers, every clay...
she said they made her happy.

253
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,638
Yeah, well,
I don't remember her that way.

254
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,757
I remember the fights.

255
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,558
I remember the times
I was afraid to come into the house.

256
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:06,475
But I don't really remember happy.

257
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,517
You were too young.

258
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,520
So? Going home Friday?

259
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,398
I think I'll stay here
for the weekend, torture the nurses.

260
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,318
Mm-hm. What happened?
They do the tests?

261
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,657
It's the same story.
I'm just two years older.

262
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,115
So why are they keeping you here?

263
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,703
I don't know. I guess I'm an
interesting specimen.

264
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:34,299
What do I have to do
to get a straight answer out of you?

265
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,835
Talk to my doctor.

266
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,805
I worry about you, that's all.

267
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,685
I'm waiting for the sugar.

268
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,021
It's right in front of you.

269
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,938
What's the matter?

270
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:58,861
Nothing. I'm just having
a nervous breakdown.

271
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:03,536
You deserve a nervous breakdown.
What have you been doing to yourself?

272
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,197
The worst weekend of my
entire life.

273
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,204
- What happened?
- Everything.

274
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:13,789
Carol and I were supposed to
go away for the weekend.

275
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,883
Friday, my wife calls.
Can we take the kids? She's not well.

276
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:24,351
So we cancel the weekend, take the
kids to a movie. We run into my wife.

277
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,469
She's with some man.

278
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:30,980
I get pissed off, my wife gets
embarrassed, the kids are confused.

279
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,599
Carol hits the ceiling
and throws me out.

280
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,728
Saturday night, I'm on the street

281
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,697
with two kids,
three suitcases and a dog.

282
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,485
She wants to get married.

283
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,245
- You can't, you're not divorced yet.
- I know, I know.

284
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,704
Some men are smarter about cheating.
Like you, you're smarter.

285
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:55,585
- Not smart, I just don't cheat.
- I know. See? Smarter.

286
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,638
I met a woman
on the train this morning.

287
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:08,059
I don't wanna get married again
but I don't like being alone.

288
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,557
What did she look like?

289
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,727
The woman on the train.

290
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,939
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,066
He looked nice.

292
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:26,743
He looked sort, um, sort of...

293
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,080
familiar.

294
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:35,040
That's it?
That's the whole story?

295
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:39,087
You met him at Rizzoli's three months
ago and again on the train?

296
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,009
Yeah, except...

297
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,385
just for a minute I thought...

298
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:50,601
I thought, I... It was really nothing
and I just, you know, something.

299
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,354
Sure.

300
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,101
This is nice.
When did you do these?

301
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,321
These are recent. This is,
like, last couple of weeks.

302
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:06,359
- You don't want to show these?
- No! Not yet, anyway. No.

303
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,117
OK. So, what's his name?

304
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,656
I don't know, I didn't ask her.

305
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:14,829
- Why not?
- I wasn't trying to pick her up.

306
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,795
You're incompetent.
You're incompetent!

307
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:25,512
You make everything about sex,
you realise that? Everything.

308
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:29,175
- I do my best.
- it's just a little funny story.

309
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,678
I mean, Jesus, I'm really
sorry I mentioned it.

310
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,060
- Let's just forget it, OK?
- OK, OK.

311
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,317
What are you gonna do about it?

312
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,859
What's the worst thing
that could happen? Just do it.

313
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,787
What do I do,
hang around Grand Central Station

314
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,703
then hand her some line?

315
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,741
Take her to a hotel?

316
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,205
Take her to my apartment. I'm not
using it. The sheets are clean.

317
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:05,095
'..departing from platform 25
on the upper level. 6:15...'

318
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,228
Hi, how are you? Yeah, hi.

319
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,233
Yeah, hi.

320
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:23,856
Well, hello.

321
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,072
What a surprise to see you.

322
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,653
I just happen to be
taking the same train.

323
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,614
Where you going?

324
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,950
You work in the city?

325
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:46,386
This is ridiculous. What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

326
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:56,642
'Your attention, please.
The 6:20 to Oakland...'

327
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,766
So ITY-

328
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,400
Excuse me.

329
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,137
There are some seats in the back.

330
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:25,017
Oh? Oh, no. Hi.
No, it's all right. I'm fine.

331
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:27,643
- I saw you...
- No, I'm the next stop.

332
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,571
Yeah, after this one.

333
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,406
- We're neighbours.
- Yeah?

334
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,739
- Frank Raftis.
- Hello again.

335
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,037
- Margaret Gilmore. Well, Molly.
- Uh-huh.

336
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,917
- You work in the city?
- No. I'm married.

337
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:45,456
I mean, no, I don't work.
I mean, I do work but I'm not now.

338
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,831
- I do commercial art.
- Uh-huh.

339
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:51,169
Graphics, ads, freelancing.
It's not...

340
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,427
- Do you?
- Work?

341
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,797
- In the city?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

342
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,057
No. My dad's been sick.
He's been in and out of the hospital.

343
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,679
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- He's OK. I've just...

344
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,271
been going in a lot
to see him, and...

345
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,614
- I thought about you today.
- You did?

346
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:15,568
Yeah, I mean, about seeing you again.
I mean, after so many months.

347
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,695
Yeah. I know, that was funny.

348
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,542
Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:26,084
- I'm married, too.
- Mm, well, lots of people are.

350
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,917
- I guess so.
- Is your wife the gardener?

351
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah, she is.

352
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:35,298
Dobbs Ferry, The next station is Dobbs Ferry.

00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,839
- This is you.

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,142

I wasn't trying to, you know...

358
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:54,154
- Oh, yes, I know.
- Maybe we could ride in together.

359
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,157
- Oh.

Come on, you guys, I've had it.
It's been all clay. Sit down.

368
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,702
- Listen to your mother.
- Your car's ready, they called.

369
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,335
- Can we have Burger King?
- How much is it gonna cost?

370
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,751
I was afraid to ask. We could
pick it up on the way home.

371
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,298
We'll leave it, I think...
I'll just pick it up on the weekend.

372
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,424
- OK.
- Come on. Let's go back.

373
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:06,054
Sit down. Dad's tired. You can give
him a big bear hug when we get home.

374
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,394
- Fries and chicken!
- Sit down!

375
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,439
My turn. I think it's my turn.

376
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,859
Oh, gosh.

377
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:29,703
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

378
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,964
- Well, I'm turning in.

00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,962

380
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,095
Did you let the dog out?

381
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,223
Yes. He's back.

382
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,123
- Want me to drive?
- What's the matter?

383
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,825
It's getting late.

384
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:12,039
Why didn't you take an earlier train?
You were up. You were all set.

385
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:19,042
I just don't want to
miss the train.

386
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,419
- Uh, is this seat taken?
- Yes.

387
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,843
Oh. I mean, yes.

388
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,756
Yes, it is taken.

389
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:08,218
- I didn't see you.
- I almost missed the train.

390
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,344
Well.

391
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,566
- OK?
- OK.

392
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:25,276
Mike is six. Joe is...four.
No. No, no. He's five.

393
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,613
Five now. What am I talking about?
Five last January.

394
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:32,448
And... Yeah, because we took him
to the city for his birthday

395
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,538
because the circus was in town.

396
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:39,668
Course, we have to do the same thing
for the other one for his birthday.

397
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,335
- Does he get jealous a lot?
- Mike? Yeah, all the time.

398
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,965
- At that age, you know.
- Yeah. And he's older.

399
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,930
- Isn't he?
- Yeah. They like to compete.

400
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,853
Sure.

401
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:57,232
The little one, though,
is smart, too.

402
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:02,069
He's like his mother. He sees things.
He's quick. He's fast.

403
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,575
Mike is more like me.
He's a little...

404
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,832
Well... I don't know.

405
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:38,814
I can up the fee, they'll throw in
a house. You'll be back in a year.

406
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:43,154
- I don't think so, Vic.
- What are you holding out for?

407
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,688
I just don't want to go to Houston.

408
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,066
This is a great opportunity here.

409
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,701
Let's talk about it later,
I have to make a call now.

410
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,621
Frank...

411
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,115
Seymore f-f-fell down!

412
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:39,333
Hello.

413
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,789
Yes.

414
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,209
Oh!

415
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,837
Uh, hi.

416
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,179
Yes. Yes.

417
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,940
Yeah, uh...

418
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,026
Well, yes.

419
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,156
Sure. Uh...

420
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,691
OK, yeah. Mm-hmm.

421
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,282
Yes. OK.

422
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,204
Bye.

423
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,169
- Hi.
- Hi.

424
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:32,264
- So, I was in the neighbourhood.
- So you said.

425
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:36,304
- Um, how's your father?
- Oh, he's OK.

426
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,267
- He's coming home in a few clays.
- Oh, good.

427
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,933
I know I said we could have coffee,
but I was thinking...

428
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:49,856
Well, maybe if we... If you had time,
we could have lunch or something.

429
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,861
Oh.

430
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,994
Lunch?

431
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,281
Yeah, that... Well... I don't know.

432
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,408
I mean...

433
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:05,670
- You're very beautiful.
- No, I'm not.

434
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,379
- I'm very married.
- I am, too.

435
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,887
But married people have to eat, too.

436
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,675
Yes, they do.

437
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,433
- OK.
- Yeah?

438
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,185
Sure.

439
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,303
The city was Dutch then

440
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:26,017
and they were expecting an attack
from the English in New England

441
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,986
so they built a wall for protection

442
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,446
but the bids from the private
contractors were too high,

443
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,327
so the people built it themselves.

444
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:39,948
It ran from the East River straight
to the Hudson, straight across.

445
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,323
That's why they call it Wall Street.

446
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:45,828
Oh. How do you know all that?

447
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,798
I read it on the back of this menu.

448
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,883
So what happened?
Did they attack, the English?

449
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:58,965
Yeah.

450
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:03,763
But they came from the south.
They came by boat so it was useless.

451
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,648
- The wall.
- Yeah.

452
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,444
- Yeah.
- I'm talking too much.

453
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,028
No, you're not.

454
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,322
At least I'm talking.
You're just sitting there.

455
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,320
It's true.

456
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,203
OK, I'll shut up. You talk.

457
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,753
OK.

458
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,919
Well, what do you want to know?

459
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,292
How much do you weigh?

460
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,277
Hey, Ed.

461
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,401
- Yeah, what?
- Can I ask you something?

462
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,289
- What?
- Tell me the truth.

463
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:06,246
- What?
- You think I'm good-looking?

464
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:24,138
No, we knew...we knew
before she was born, so...

465
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:28,896
They... There was an abnormality
in the blood vessels...

466
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,646
so they had to operate right away.

467
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:36,155
And she was...five clays old.

468
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,984
That was a year ago.

469
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,368
That was two years ago in March.

470
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:50,666
It was nobody's fault but Brian,
he's a doctor... It's harder.

471
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:54,663
I thought that we should
have had another one right away.

472
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,792
I thought we should have.

473
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,673
But you didn't.

474
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:06,260
No, but we will, I think we will.
it's just time.

475
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,024
Yeah. Kids.

476
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,614
Yeah.

477
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,284
We should go.

478
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,414
Yeah.

479
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,543
You wanna have another coffee?

480
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,464
OK.

481
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,227
Wait!

482
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,978
No, this one. Where you going?

483
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,968
I don't know what you've been up to
but you look terrific.

484
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,011
- I do?
- Mm-hm.

485
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,814
Well, I, uh...

486
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:36,688
Yeah, I feel good.
I've been working a lot more and...

487
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,942
I just... feel good.

488
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,190
- I haven't seen you for weeks.
- Yeah, I know.

489
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:45,741
- Who is it?
- Who is what?

490
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,574
Well, you're seeing someone,
aren't you?

491
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,287
Oh, my God, what time is it?
I just...

492
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:55,751
- I really... I have to run.
- We're having lunch.

493
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:58,632
- Sorry, I just can't.
- What's going on?

494
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,971
He's a friend, that's all.

495
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:09,094
We take the train together and...
and I like him.

496
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,218
He makes me feel good.

497
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:15,351
I like being with him
and thinking about him.

498
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,684
We just do things, you know, we...

499
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:21,654
We laugh, I mean mostly at...

500
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,615
I hardly even know him.
That's the truth.

501
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:27,992
I just like being with him,
that's all. I like...

502
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:33,531
God. I'm gonna go.

503
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,333
- Molly, listen to me.
- I don't want to listen. Sorry.

504
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,048
I'm not gonna listen. I'm going.

505
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,166
<i>I'll call you.</i>

506
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:14,452
Hi. It's me.

507
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,707
Molly.

508
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,828
Yes. Hi.

509
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,170
Yes, I decided to.

510
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:27,302
OK.

511
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,637
Where?

512
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,925
OK. Sure.

513
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:36,095
Mm-hm. Bye.

514
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:02,875
Molly.

515
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,590
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh.

516
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:10,472
- Oh.
- What?

517
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,053
- You look different.
- I do?

518
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,932
You look nice, you just
look different. You look great.

519
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,102
Maybe it's the jacket.
I had a feeling you were gonna call.

520
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:27,439
- Well, shall we 90...?
- Yeah.

521
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,742
Thank you.

522
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:44,876
- I know how to cook Chinese.
- You do? No kidding.

523
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:49,467
No, really. Moo shu pork. You just
get the buttermilk pancake mix.

524
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,386
You're putting me on.

525
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:58,718
You can't beat this guy.
There's no way.

526
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,021
- The bird wins. You lose.
- I can't believe it.

527
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:04,141
Try again.

528
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:06,901
There you go.

529
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:09,864
It's unfair, he goes ahead.

530
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:13,442
You should flip for it.

531
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,447
See who goes first.

532
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,408
He's saying, “hurry up."

533
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:26,790
- I got to go here.
- He's beating you again.

534
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,464
It's OK. Bird wins.

535
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,630
OK, I'll try...

536
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:44,562
- I look surprised.
- You look great.

537
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:48,938
I look terrible.
At least yours look like you.

538
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,736
- This looks like me?
- Yeah.

539
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:55,357
- I look like this?
- Yeah.

540
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:58,329
This isn't...this is not
the way I look.

541
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,910
Yes, it is.

542
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:04,327
- Jesus.
- They're nice.

543
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:06,454
Let me see.

544
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,103
- Hmm?
- What?

545
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:34,030
Nothing.

546
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,998
The Shaffer woman died today.

547
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,707
Oh, no.

548
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,386
The husband was there.
I made my little speech.

549
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:59,964
He kept looking at me.

550
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,102
They always look at you
as if you should have more to say.

551
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:12,060
Would you like to go to
the movies?

552
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,988
Umm... No.

553
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:24,947
- Going into town tomorrow?
- Mm-mm.

554
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:26,266
- We already did the arteriogram.
- You did?

555
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,230
- Yes. He didn't tell you?
- No, he didn't.

556
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:32,689
He's been avoiding this
for six months.

557
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:37,397
We'd like to keep him and do the
bypass but he has to agree to it.

558
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:41,243
Well, I'll talk to him.

559
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,360
He's pretty groggy right now.

560
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,579
I know. I just want to...
I just want to see him.

561
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,327
OK.

562
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:54,710
(Molly) Dr Gilmore, please.
it's his wife.

563
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:59,092
Oh, yeah.

564
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,010
No, that's OK.

565
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,842
No. No message. Thank you.

566
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:40,131
- You OK?
- Yes.

567
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,795
- You sure?
- Yes. I'm fine.

568
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:48,806
(Molly) isn't that Roosevelt Island?
(Frank) Yeah.

569
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,772
- What's the matter?
- What?

570
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:04,109
- You're thinking about something.
- Oh...

571
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:09,661
- It looks easy from here.
- What does?

572
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,492
Everything.

573
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,746
- You want to go back?
- No.

574
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:18,288
Yes. Yes, I have to go back.

575
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:26,592
I shouldn't have called you.
I'm sorry.

576
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,214
My father's in the hospital again.

577
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:32,720
And, uh... That's all. I just...

578
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,890
They have to operate.

579
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,609
No, that's not it.

580
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,865
- It's this.
- What?

581
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,917
I have to go. I...l...l do.

582
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,209
- Why?
- I can't do this.

583
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,336
I can't.

584
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:11,218
I don't know why I called you.
I didn't mean to, I just did. Stupid.

585
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,723
- Don't say that.
- I didn't want to see you.

586
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,433
Don't say that.

587
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:24,939
I have a husband. I have...I have
a...a life. I have things that I...

588
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:29,360
I have to be there.

589
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,283
I have to go.

590
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,380
OK.

591
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,299
I do.

592
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,007
OK.

593
00:52:57,094 --> 00:53:00,522
Wait for me at the station.
5:45. OK?

594
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:07,403
University Hospital, please.

595
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:09,906
Wait for me?

596
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,659
(Frank) Yeah, I know that.

597
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:23,089
Yeah, I know that. I know that
but nobody else seems to know that.

598
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,090
No, I'm just tired of saying
the same thing over and over.

599
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,559
Uh-huh.
No, I'm looking at it right now.

600
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:40,684
OK, what do you want me to do?
Well, what do you want me to do?

601
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:48,981
Look, I can't talk now.
I'm sorry, I can't.

602
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:51,275
I can't! I can't!

603
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:55,490
I'm hanging up right now.
I'm hanging up.

604
00:53:55,527 --> 00:54:00,581
(PA) 'Attention, please,
the 6:08 local express train...'

605
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,168
Taxi! Taxi!

606
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,510
(Molly) Frank!

607
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,309
Frank!

608
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:13,149
(Molly) You came.

609
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:18,075
I didn't think you were coming.

610
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,038
I love you. I do.

611
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,135
Hi. I'm almost clone.
Dinner will be ready soon.

612
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,089
No hurry.

613
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:20,674
Oh, I left the tickets for tomorrow
on the hallway table.

614
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:24,641
- What tickets?
- You're taking the kids to the game.

615
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,394
- Oh, no. I can't.
- Why not?

616
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,517
- Well, er...
- You forgot?

617
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,857
I'm stuck with Victor tomorrow.

618
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,526
- That's OK.
- Damn.

619
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:38,073
It's OK. I told them
you might have to work anyway.

620
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,906
Don't worry about it.
<i>I'll take 'em.

621
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:44,406
- Sorry.
- It's OK. I want to take 'em.

622
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:49,121
I do. I was even kind of hoping
it might turn out like this.

623
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:52,873
What's the matter?

624
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:56,756
I was thinking about Ed Lasky.
He's getting a divorce.

625
00:56:56,792 --> 00:57:01,347
- Surprise, surprise.
- He says he's not in love any more.

626
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,680
Nobody's in love any more.
So what else is new?

627
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,349
Yeah.

628
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,277
<i>I'll</i> be inside.

629
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,093
This is very...

630
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,382
Eleanor Roosevelt.

631
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,024
Oh, no.

632
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:49,207
(sighs)

633
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,394
My God.

634
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,545
What are you doing?

635
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,675
What are you doing?

636
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,106
(Car horns honk)

637
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:32,265
- Hi.
- Hi. I came in the back door.

638
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:34,636
I'm late. I was late
getting started.

639
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:38,022
- I didn't see you.
- I was waiting out front.

640
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,732
- Oh, there? I should have looked.
- It was just a few minutes.

641
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,854
Anyway. How are you?

642
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,699
You look nice.

643
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:51,871
- You wanna go?
- Where?

644
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:54,785
I don't know.
You wanna get something to eat?

645
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,743
- Sure.
- You hungry?

646
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:00,584
No but, I mean, if you're hungry...

647
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:05,921
No, I'm not... I'm not hungry.
I was thinking about you.

648
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,045
No, I'm fine.

649
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,850
- Listen, I...
- I was just...

650
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:16,971
- Go ahead.
- I was just gonna...

651
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:23,518
Well, I was, uh...
I was just thinking.

652
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:29,147
- Go on, what is it?
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

653
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:34,028
It's OK,
I was thinking the same thing.

654
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:38,789
- You were?
- Yeah, I was.

655
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:42,999
I would've called you
but how could I?

656
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:48,218
- L-l just felt, you know...
- I know.

657
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:09,859
You wanna go?

658
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:13,446
OK.

659
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:17,864
I have a...a place we can go.

660
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:22,504
OK.

661
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,377
(Door unlocking)

662
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:20,218
It's nice.

663
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:22,892
- Yeah. It's dark.
- Yeah.

664
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,960
Oh, God...

665
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,715
I'm sorry.

666
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:21,882
I'm sorry.

667
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,268
I'm sorry.

668
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,737
I'm sorry.

669
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,736
I can't.

670
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,701
I'm sorry. I can't.

671
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:11,310
(Conductor) Dobbs Ferry is our next
station stop. Dobbs Ferry.

672
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:26,452
Will I see you tomorrow?

673
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:28,657
And then what?

674
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,086
Once a week? Twice a week?

675
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,167
Then what?

676
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:16,120
(Both, laughing) Daddy!

677
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:59,683
What is it?

678
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:02,978
What?

679
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,775
The hospital called an hour ago.

680
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,597
It's such a beautiful clay,
isn't it?

681
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:39,181
I don't think I can remember
such a beautiful clay.

682
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:43,729
Trainer, T-R-A-I-N-E-R.
John Trainer.

683
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:48,818
He was in room 709
but he's not there any more.

684
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,486
No?

685
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,948
You're sure?

686
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,035
No, no, I'm just a friend.

687
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,999
OK, thank you.

688
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:12,387
(Minister) For Thine
is the kingdom

689
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:15,719
and the power and the glory,
forever and ever.

690
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,644
Amen.

691
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:20,765
Oh, almighty God,

692
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:24,102
the god of the spirits
of all flesh,

693
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:27,902
who, by a voice from heaven,
didst proclaim,

694
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,484
"blessed are the dead,
who die in the Lord.

695
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,952
"Multiply, we beseech Thee.

696
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:38,200
"To those who rest in Jesus,

697
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,121
"the manifold blessings
of Thy love,

698
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:45,879
"that the good work which Thou didst
begin in them may be made perfect

699
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:49,127
"unto the clay of Jesus Christ.“

700
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,467
(Sobbing)

701
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:55,134
Come on, darling.

702
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:00,686
- Come on, please.
- No! I don't wanna go!

703
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,397
- Molly, let's go home.
- No! No! No! No! I can't!

704
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,777
- Molly, Molly! Easy! Easy!
- No, please.

705
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:11,867
- Take it easy, Molly!
- No, no, no!

706
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:14,745
- Come on, sweetheart.
- No! No!

707
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:17,824
- Don't hold me.
- Let's sit down, hm?

708
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:19,534
Don't touch me!

709
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:25,088
Calm down! Settle down! Settle down.
Settle down. Listen to me.

710
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:28,547
You're going to be all right.
All right? Easy.

711
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,961
No. I think about him every clay.

712
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:19,226
Last thought before I fall asleep...

713
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,973
and first thought when I wake up.

714
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:28,652
I talk to myself
all clay about him. I...

715
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:33,191
Even when I'm talking to somebody
else, even talking to you now.

716
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:36,900
I talk to myself about him.

717
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,576
Brian thinks I'm ill, he thinks
it has to do with my father.

718
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:47,002
He thinks the stress and...
you know, all that.

719
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:51,708
Thinks I'm having a breakdown but I'm
not, there's nothing wrong with me.

720
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,088
Except that I love him.

721
01:13:01,298 --> 01:13:03,054
Molly, listen...

722
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:07,184
No, I know that you don't approve.
I don't approve either.

723
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:12,650
I agree with you
but that doesn't change it.

724
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:20,237
I should have slept with him,
maybe that would have made it easier.

725
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:24,791
I just think we were meant
to be together,

726
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:26,909
even though we never will be.

727
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:30,745
I just think it's the right thing.
I just think...

728
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,962
Everything else is wrong.

729
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,600
- Hey.
- Hi.

730
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,767
(sighs) I'm sorry.

731
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,435
- Boy, it's late.
- I know.

732
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:52,231
- You must be exhausted.
- Yeah. I'm tired.

733
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:55,362
- I saved you some supper.
- No. It's late.

734
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:57,363
No, it's ready. Sit down.

735
01:13:57,396 --> 01:13:59,317
It's good to see you.

736
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:03,784
- Kids OK? They asleep?
- Yeah.

737
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:13,754
Listen, I talked to Vic tonight.
I told him yes about Houston.

738
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:18,169
Oh, well... That's good.

739
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,178
It's OK with you?

740
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,796
What does it mean?
When and all that?

741
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:24,973
- As soon as we can.
- All of us?

742
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,134
Yeah.

743
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,855
School's gonna be a problem
for the kids.

744
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:31,354
Well, we'll figure something out.

745
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,066
Would you rather we didn't come?
Would you rather go alone?

746
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,988
No. No.

747
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,951
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure.

748
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,954
I'm fine, thanks.

749
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,095
What's going on?

750
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:07,101
With us, I mean.
What's the matter?

751
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,679
What is it, Frank?

752
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,568
It's nothing.

753
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,730
Oh, Christ.

754
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:25,152
- It's nothing.
- No, please don't say “nothing“.

755
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:27,778
It's hard enough just to ask.

756
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,584
You can at least,
for Christ's sake...

757
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:33,626
lie to me.

758
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:36,921
I'm not an idiot.
Don't tell me “nothing“.

759
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,552
Ann, I can't.

760
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,132
All right. Never mind.

761
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:52,145
We'll go to Houston. Fine, fine,
we'll all go to Houston.

762
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:57,063
I can hardly wait(!)

763
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,193
I met a woman on a train.

764
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:11,198
I don't know...

765
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,707
Nothing happened.
I mean, we didn't...

766
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:21,000
We never, you know...

767
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,383
It's over now. Nothing happened.

768
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,467
I'm not seeing her,
I'm not having an affair or...

769
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,637
it's nothing like that.

770
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:40,568
No...

771
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:47,744
No, it's worse, isn't it?

772
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:04,961
Look, I'm going to take
a couple of weeks.

773
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,591
<i>I'll</i> take the kids.

774
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,518
We'll go to Denver to
see my mother.

775
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,893
And then we'll see.

776
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,863
(Crossing bell ringing)

777
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:17,446
(Frank) No, I'm all packed
and ready to go.

778
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:20,206
OK, you miss me?

779
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:24,199
What do you mean “no”? No?
What kind of answer is that?

780
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,753
Well, how's your grandmother?

781
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,791
Uh-huh.

782
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:34,005
Well, give her a hug for me, OK?

783
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,554
A what? No, not a bug,
dummy, a hug.

784
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,264
Ahug! OK.

785
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,684
<i>I'll see you in a
couple of clays.

786
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,806
I love you. Bye.

787
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:50,320
Hi. Yeah, I'm just waiting
for the taxi.

788
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,237
Yeah, yeah.

789
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:54,321
Mm-hm. Yeah.

790
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:56,442
I did switch 'em off.

791
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,246
Ann, I wanted to ask you something.

792
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:00,948
OK.

793
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:05,620
Yeah, all right.
All right. All right.

794
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:08,375
<i>I'll call you as soon
as I get there.

795
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,083
OK, bye.

796
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,006
Yeah, yeah.

797
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,550
I will. All right.

798
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:19,673
If I can find it.

799
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:22,561
I will, if I can find it,
all right?

800
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,062
OK.

801
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:26,098
OK. Bye.

802
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,809
Oh,Ann! Ann!

803
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:29,519
Ann!

804
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,457
(Phone)

805
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,167
Brian!

806
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:01,554
Brian, you gonna get that?

807
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,310
Bri!

808
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:08,688
Hello.

809
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,937
(Phone)

810
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:24,409
Hello. Hello?

811
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:33,706
Yes, hi.

812
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:42,762
No. No, I... A bath,
I was...just going to take a bath.

813
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:51,691
Where are you? Are you all right?
Is anything wrong?

814
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:56,400
Yeah, yeah, I miss you.

815
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:58,903
(Exhales)

816
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,740
You do?

817
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:03,903
Well, I miss you.

818
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,030
I miss you, too.

819
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:10,744
Well, I'm going away.

820
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:14,959
I'm going away. I'm going away
to Houston. I'm leaving tonight.

821
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:19,836
I'm leaving in a few minutes...now.

822
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,964
W-where are you now?

823
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,092
Home, my house.

824
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:34,232
How have you been?

825
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:38,520
Um...

826
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,779
Uh, terrible.

827
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,413
Yeah.

828
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:49,372
Well, listen...

829
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:53,711
Ah, Christ, why do people
say “listen“ on the telephone?

830
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:55,581
What else you gonna do?

831
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,300
(Laughs)

832
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:05,923
I wanna see you.
Can I see you...before I go?

833
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:09,843
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't
call you, I know that I'm...

834
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:11,354
What?

835
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:15,181
Please, just...
I only have a few minutes.

836
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:20,110
I don't want to go. I'm turning off
lights in here, I don't know.

837
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:25,658
Please, could I see you?
Could I just see you?

838
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,743
Oh, Frank.

839
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,532
(Sighs) Frank, I ca...

840
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:37,997
- Oh, you did get it.
- Yeah, I got it. It's for me.

841
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:42,211
Can you talk?

842
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:47,840
What? Yeah, uh-huh.

843
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:55,557
(Sighs) Look, just come over.

844
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:59,901
I'm on Bradley,
it's...it's right off Clinton.

845
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,021
You know where it is.

846
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:07,405
It's 421 Bradley.
I'll wait for you.

847
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:10,993
Yeah, look, I just...

848
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:17,001
Thanks for calling me

849
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:20,795
and I really hope that everything
works out for you.

850
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,759
That's all. I...

851
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:26,881
<i>OK'?</i>

852
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:30,049
What do you mean?

853
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,851
OK. Goodbye.

854
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:06,293
Well, that's that.

855
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:53,214
- Brian?
- Mm.

856
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:55,841
- I'm gonna go see him.
- What are you doing?

857
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:58,682
He's going away.
I won't be long.

858
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:03,524
- Why are you doing this?
- I just wanna say goodbye.

- Please!
- He's going. That's it.

861
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:11,860

Uh... Yeah, is Molly there,
please?

872
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,589

01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:05,535
- Yeah, how are you?
- Great. I'm great.

I'm good. I'm not too bad.

I can't believe it was you on
the phone. What are you doing here?

893
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:14,370
I came back.

June.

900
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:35,225
Well, if the divorce comes through.
If not, we have to wait.

901
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:37,482
You're gonna be the best man.

902
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:42,355
June? <i>I'll</i> have to see
cos I got an offer on the house.

903
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:46,157
- Oh, good. Good.
- I need somebody here for the...

904
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:48,113
For the closure. Sure.

905
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:51,533
- You can do that if I'm in Houston?
- Sure, we can do that.

906
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,411
That's good.

907
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:56,248
So, this is permanent, then?
Houston?

908
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,839
Well...

909
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:04,219
What about Ann?

910
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:09,933
It didn't work out,
so she went back to Denver.

911
01:33:09,965 --> 01:33:11,970
I'm sorry.

912
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:14,096
Yeah, well...

913
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:17,725
I have the kids with me now.

914
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:21,276
So we're gonna stop off
and see her on the way back.

915
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,441
I don't know.

916
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:31,742
- Is that why you're back? The house?
- Yeah.

917
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,376
Yeah.

918
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:39,875
So, you're getting married?
Well, congratulations.

919
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:46,554
I'm gonna call you every clay from
Barbados until you take this job.

920
01:33:46,585 --> 01:33:50,263
- No, you won't.
- You're right, I won't.

921
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:57,772
Listen, Molly,
why don't you come down with us?

922
01:33:57,804 --> 01:34:00,901
- Oh, no!
- Why not? I'm sure he has a friend.

923
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:04,480
These guys always have friends.
They lift weights together.

924
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,856
- Will you stop?
- What?

925
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:09,614
Stop trying to fix me up.
I'm fine.

926
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:14,911
It's Christmas. What are
you gonna do all by yourself?

927
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:17,034
I'm fine. I'm fine.

928
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,917
Yeah. I should stay home, too.

929
01:34:22,955 --> 01:34:27,095
I don't know why I go every year,
I have such a lousy time.

930
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:31,549
The truth is, you know...

931
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,518
I don't think I like
men any more.

932
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,851
(Laughing) Oh, jeez.

933
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:40,563
Send me a postcard, OK?

934
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,526
Bye.

936
01:34:57,739 --> 01:34:59,661
You wanna try Lex?

937
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:05,087
Yeah. Same difference.
Same thing.

938
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:25,644
<i>I'll</i> get off over here.

939
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:32,035
- Keep the change.
- OK, thank you.

01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:48,195
Hi.

941
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:55,151
Jesus. Hello.

942
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,205
How are you?

943
01:36:59,236 --> 01:37:01,917
- You surprised me.
- Me, too.

944
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:04,201
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

945
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:08,084
No, good, good. You look terrific.
How are you?

946
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,041
I'm fine. How are you?

947
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,966
I'm good. Good.

948
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:14,502
When did you get back?

949
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:17,224
- Little while ago.
A few weeks ago.

950
01:37:17,254 --> 01:37:20,801
- Just in time for Christmas.
- Yeah. Christmas.

951
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:26,191
- How is it?
- Good. Good.

952
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,522
I thought about you out there.

953
01:37:28,557 --> 01:37:30,811
It was OK.

954
01:37:30,851 --> 01:37:35,360
I mean, I thought about you.
I was wondering how it was going.

955
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:40,652
It didn't turn out exactly
the way I expected but, you know.

956
01:37:41,737 --> 01:37:43,991
Mm-hm. Yeah.

957
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:49,798
I'm sorry I didn't get
to see you when you left.

958
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:53,459
I'm sorry I didn't get
to say goodbye or anything.

959
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,426
Well, that's OK.

960
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,683
I wanted to but...
I mean, I tried. I would have...

961
01:38:00,714 --> 01:38:03,051
You don't have to be
polite about it.

962
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:07,305
I'm not... I'm not being polite.

963
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:12,526
I shouldn't have called you
that night. That was a mistake.

964
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:15,738
It was a bad time. I was confused.

965
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,659
Yeah. Sure.

966
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:23,914
- How are you? You look great.
- I'm...I'm... Well, thanks.

967
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:25,867
- How's the family?
- Good.

968

Oh, no.

970
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:33,421
- How about Joe?
- He's been growing. You know kids.

971
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:37,001
- How's, uh...?
- Brian.

972
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:38,928
He's good.

973
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:43,390
We've, uh... We've been...

974
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:45,345
Well, he...he's fine.
