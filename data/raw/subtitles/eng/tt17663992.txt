00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:59,332
<i>Stab 2</i> took place in college.

883
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,706
So we think that
the killer is trying

884
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,292
That is one possibility.

885
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,512
Heroes now in college:
Check.

Suspicious new characters

and/or body count:
Check, check and check.

888
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,389
But it can't just be
about <i>stab 2.</i>

889
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,261
- Why not?
- It would make sense

890
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,828
if this were just a sequel.

891
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,307
But we're not in a sequel,

892
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,658
because nobody
just makes sequels anymore.

893
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,749
We're in a franchise!

894
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:28,317
And there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise.

895
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,450
- I had a feeling.
- Rule one:

896
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,147
Everything is bigger
than last time.

897
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:35,150
Bigger budget, bigger cast,
bigger body count.

898
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,065
Longer chases, shoot-outs, beheadings.

899
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,261
You got to top what came before
to keep people coming back.

900
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,200
- Beheadings?
- Beheadings.

901
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,725
Rule two:
Whatever happened last time,

902
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:47,772
Franchises only survive
by subverting expectations.

903
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,949
If the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds

904
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,083
with letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities,

905
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:55,780
you can bet
the opposite will be true here.

906
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:59,261
And rule three:
No one is safe.

907
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:02,177
Legacy characters?
Cannon fodder at this point.

908
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,179
Usually brought back
only to be killed off

909
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,399

910

It's not looking too good
for Gale and Kirby.

911

not even the worst part!

This is the part where she
tells us the worst part.

913
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,713
The worst part is

914
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:20,282
franchises are just
continuing episodic installments

915
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,589
Which means main characters

916
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,852

Ellen Ripley,

Tony stark, James Bond...

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,034
I mean, even Luke Skywalker...

920
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,776
All died so their franchises
could live on.

921
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,170
That means it's not
just the friend group.

922
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:41,086
Any of us could go at any time,

923

Am I gonna die a virgin?

928
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,365
That was a weird overshare.

929
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,715
But it brings us
to our current suspects:

00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,456
Ethan.

who no one suspects

932
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,938
because he's so shy and dorky.

933
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,678
Why am I on the suspect list?

934
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,029
Because I'm randomly
Chad's roommate?

935
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,944
Roommate lotteries can be juked.

936

Mm-hmm. Um, how did you come
to live with Sam and Tara?

942
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,002
I answered their ad online.

943
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,395
Okay, say no more.

944
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:31,484
You've already implicated
yourself enough.

945
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,225
It was an anonymous ad, mindy.

946
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,488
And you know we vetted her.
Plus her dad is a cop.

947
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,702
And that makes it more likely
that she's the killer,

948
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,381
because having a cop dad
is a great cover.

949
00:46:39,405 --> 00:46:41,711
Do you not remember
how these movies work, Tara?

and we have our suspects.

But wait.
What about you guys?

956
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:02,732

to rule out the four of us

in woodsboro.

958

- Agreed.
- Um, not agreed.

What if the trauma
you all went through

960

or more of you to snap?

961

Yeah, or the fame you got
from the killings

about Sam are...

Don't you fucking dare.

Through the nose.
How messed up is that?

It's pretty messed up.

And guess which patient's
notes were stolen?

976

So Sam kills her own alibi and
steals her own session notes?

977
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:02,096
Maybe.

978

Nine. I thought in the movies...

But I can say

1052
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,935
that none of us can relate
to what you are experiencing.

1053
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,333
And I'm really, really sorry
that you have to do that alone.

1054
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:03,815
[Sniffles]

1055
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:05,078
It's not your fault.

1056
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,645
[Sniffles]

1057
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,691
And I know I shouldn't care
what people think.

1058
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:14,696
It just sucks being this hated.

1059
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:20,224
[Chad]
Hey. Hey. Just a reminder,

1060
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,488
not a single person
in this room hates you.

1061
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:27,535
Okay?
We have all been through

1062
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,277
and we are
coping with it differently.

1063
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,323
But, I mean,
we moved here together

1064
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:34,368
for one very specific reason.

1065
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,285
We are a team.

1066
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,464
[Mindy] We are

1067
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:45,249
the core fucking four.

1068
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,251
- Thank you very much.
- Ah, I hate myself.

1069
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,557
You said it.[Chad]
that is what I'm talking about.

1070
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,211
It's the core four.

1071
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,300
[Mindy] Say it.[Tara] I'm not gonna say it.

1072
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:54,954
I mean, yes,
we're a team, but...

1073
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,738
[Chad]
It's got a nice ring to it.

1074
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:59,872
I've been sleeping with cute boy
from across the hall.

1075
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:05,138
- Boom!
- I fucking knew it!

1076
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:07,967
- I knew it, I knew it.
- You called it.

1077
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:10,056
I knew it from the day
you had that hickey.

1078
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,753

May we, please?

1096

You're the cop, right?

1261
01:03:19,447 --> 01:03:21,319
I did some digging
on your first two victims

1262
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:22,624

When did they start
letting children into the FBI?

1270
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,119
- I'm 30.
- Well, you look like a zygote.

1271

1277

It's called
"investigative journalism"

How didn't you find it?
Weren't you tracking them?

1279
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,708
[Kirby] I went through
their financial records

1280
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:05,580
This was not in any of them.
Doesn't make sense.

1281

Don't worry.

It's not just a theater.

1290
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:34,827

Hey, how'd they get
all this stuff?

1302
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:03,524
Isn't this evidence?

1303
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,439
[Gale] Well, cops like money,

1304
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:08,834

pretty easily.

So I can keep an eye on you, roomie.

1308
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:23,694
[Gale] The killer must have
found this place

1309
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,459
before he murdered Jason
and Greg.

1310
01:06:25,633 --> 01:06:28,593
And then he took the masks
off the mannequins.

Someone who believes that Sam
masterminded woodsboro.

[Mindy] If this were
a normal <i>stab</i> movie,

this would be the killer's lair.

1400
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,704
It'll be all, "keep him talking,
Sam. Two more minutes,

1401

1402

out there as bait.

from somewhere nearby.

You know you're not safe here.

it means you're not.[Sam] not now.

But you're smarter than this, Sam.

Grab a weapon
and clear this place yourself.

Yep, and I just made sure
I was first on the scene

1876
01:40:29,588 --> 01:40:32,069
so I could switch her body out
with a fresh one.

been counting down to, Sam.

better than anyone.

I don't know what you believe,

1896
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:24,817
but I didn't commit
those murders in woodsboro.

1897
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:26,602
We know that.
Of course you didn't.

1898
01:41:26,776 --> 01:41:30,040
You think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory?

1899
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:34,436
Come on. Who do you think
started the rumors about you

1900
01:41:36,177 --> 01:41:38,309
[Giggles]
Do you know how easy it was

1901
01:41:38,483 --> 01:41:42,313
to turn Sam
from the hero of woodsboro

1902
01:41:42,487 --> 01:41:45,490
How easy it is
to convince the world

1903
01:41:45,664 --> 01:41:49,668
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best?

1904
01:41:49,842 --> 01:41:53,063
Because it's not enough
to just kill someone these days.

1905
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:56,240
You have to assassinate
their character first.

1906
01:41:56,414 --> 01:41:59,983
So when dad here "discovers"
your horribly mutilated bodies...

[Gasps]

1908
01:42:01,637 --> 01:42:03,987
Posed with Sam
wearing her father's mask,

1909
01:42:04,161 --> 01:42:07,556
he'll say some poor dumb bastard
read on the Internet

1910
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:10,211
and took matters
into their own deluded hands.

1911
01:42:10,385 --> 01:42:13,214
Exactly! That's why
it's the perfect alibi.

1912
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:16,434
And all the best lies
are based on the truth.

1913
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:19,133
