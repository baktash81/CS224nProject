1
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,709
Master, where did this blizzard come from?

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,709
Don't believe everything you see!

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,599
But I really feel cold!

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,430
then you're already under her spell

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,279
I've lost without fighting?

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,311
The ice harpy!

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,595
Wait!

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,273
You're no match for her

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,831
Now you tell me!

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,955
You have come so far to find me

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,268
Are you not entranced by my charms?

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,637
Instead of meditating on your sins...

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,393
...you are still harming humans!

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,674
Blame those men, not me!

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,355
I was so good to each one of them

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,508
But their roving eyes strayed away from me

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,997
So they deserved it!

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,954
You're an enchantress, they were humans

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,878
You were never meant to be together

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,668
Today I'll bring it to an end

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,119
Monk, you think you can escape from my spell?

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,989
then come and get me!

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,599
Master, have you killed her?

24
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,949
I've trapped her

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,954
Confine her in the Lei Feng Pagoda

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,589
Me again?

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,710
It's me!

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,233
"Jin Shan Temple"

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,437
"Lei Feng Pagoda"

30
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,395
Trying to scare me?

31
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,434
Master wouldn't have trapped you
if you were really scary

32
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,076
We're giving you another chance

33
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,114
A chance to reflect and improve

34
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,119
if you make real progress in meditation...

35
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,271
...you'll be released

36
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,799
You, too! Study to improve yourself!

37
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,076
Hey! Hurry up back there!

38
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,113
Coming!

39
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,756
Xu Xian...

40
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,514
I shouldn't have climbed up here
to pick herbs with you

41
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,156
Be a bit more patient

42
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,159
Look! Here's one!

43
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,591
Unlike Shennong, you know the value of herbs

44
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,999
Xu Xian, you even know which flowers to eat

45
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,269
Which flowers cure which ailments

46
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,274
Do you even know what flower that is?

47
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,989
That fool is eating flowers! They have thorns!

48
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,193
He's no fool

49
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,950
He's not picking the pretty wild roses
with their thorns

50
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,713
Roses are pretty...

51
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,510
But not as pretty as me

52
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,513
You... you're more like a hornflower

53
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,838
Blowing your own horn from dawn to dusk

54
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,350
Hey, don't you even know...

55
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,676
Medicines cure some ailments

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,878
But others need liquor distilled from flowers!

57
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,032
That's absolutely right!

58
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,550
Let's keep going

59
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,836
- Alright
- Climb further?

60
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,548
Look, they're still digging for herbs

61
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,871
They'll strip the whole mountain bare!

62
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,074
I'll give them a scare!

63
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,709
What? Qingqing...

64
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,032
Xu Xian? Xu Xian?

65
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,350
He's coming to

66
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,998
Xu Xian, are you alright?

67
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,675
Xu Xian!

68
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,717
Xu Xian!

69
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,156
Where's that girl?

70
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,710
What girl?

71
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,994
Maybe you banged your head too hard...

72
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,957
Just now, in the water, a girl kissed me

73
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,870
She breathed into my mouth

74
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,269
She saved me

75
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,557
Hey! The one giving you the kiss of life was me!

76
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,031
Why did you save him?

77
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,028
You even gave his vital energy a boost!

78
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,032
Hey, I'm talking to you! What are you staring at?

79
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,309
Nothing

80
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,070
Nothing? You're smitten!

81
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,029
Master, it looks like another bat-demon bite

82
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,559
Amitabha...

83
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,597
Today is the 15th...

84
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,791
The day of the Lantern Festival

85
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,599
We have to find these demons soon

86
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,193
Or many more people will die

87
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,349
Amitabha...

88
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,399
Ferryman, wait!

89
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,589
Here!

90
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,871
We need to cross the river, ferryman

91
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,069
I'm no ferryman, but jump in

92
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,868
I hope we're not delaying you

93
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,076
Not at all! To help others...

94
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,713
...is to spend time well

95
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,275
Thank you, kind sir

96
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,150
Sir...

97
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,953
What you just said was very interesting

98
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,680
How do you use your time
when you're not helping others?

99
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,789
I'm aiming to become...

100
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,275
...a doctor of medicine

101
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,511
Good, good! Young men like us should have dreams!

102
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,152
I have one too

103
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,518
I dream of become the Abbot of Jinshan Temple

104
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,516
And where would that leave me?

105
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,275
Uh, Master... that's not...

106
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,959
I didn't mean now...

107
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,392
I mean, after...

108
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,509
After my death?

109
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,949
You want me to die?

110
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,395
No, I... I...

111
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,999
That's not what I meant, Master... I...

112
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,512
It seems you are Abbot Fahai of Jinshan Temple

113
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,514
It takes ten years of good deeds
for two people to meet

114
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,910
It's destiny that let us to be acquainted

115
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,436
Young man, you're from Hangzhou?

116
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,030
Yes, my name's Xu Xian

117
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,435
I'm a herbalist

118
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,872
Master, what are you counting?

119
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,154
How long until I die

120
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,991
Xu Xian, the weather's nice today!

121
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,557
That it is

122
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,869
Don't change the subject

123
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,350
What was your dream again?

124
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,157
No...

125
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,669
The ultimate dream

126
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,029
I don't have any dream!

127
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,314
My only dream is my wish that you...

128
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,910
White, tell us what's bothering you

129
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,191
Turtle and I can help you resolve it

130
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,673
What... do... you...

131
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,318
I want to visit the human world

132
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,873
You just want to see that flower-eating fool!

133
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,033
I'd just like to take another look at him

134
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,030
Look at what? He's just a common mortal!

135
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,997
You've been moping over him for days!

136
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,633
What's this all about?

137
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,079
She used her vital essence
to save a fool who was drowning

138
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,558
if... your... Iips...

139
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,629
Let me say it

140
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,235
if their lips met...

141
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,589
...there was a flow of vital essences

142
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,071
He's in you and you're in him!

143
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,230
Nothing so serious,
I just want to take a look at him

144
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,069
Don't give me a hard time

145
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,749
Qingqing, come with me!

146
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,756
Hey, where are you going?

147
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,632
I want to come! Take me too!

148
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,757
I will just stay here

149
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,510
See how much fun the mortal world is?

150
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,990
In a moment, get off the boat...

151
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,269
...and find him for me

152
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,793
I'll be strolling around here

153
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,109
When you find him,
bring him to the pavilion on the lake

154
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,437
Why don't you find him yourself?

155
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,589
I want to play a little joke on him

156
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,111
And see how nice he is

157
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,794
Master, it's turning!

158
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,314
then don't blow on it!

159
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,274
We'll split up to look around

160
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,430
Ah!

161
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,315
Watch out!

162
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,871
What is it?

163
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,315
A demon!

164
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,274
A demon? How do you know?

165
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,877
I'm an expert, of course I know

166
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,550
Are you going to exorcise it?

167
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,990
Shh, not so loud! It's nearby!

168
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,714
My Master and I have been tracking it for ages

169
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,717
Master says we must exorcise it today

170
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,632
Why do you have to do that?

171
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,875
Demons hurt people

172
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,834
What about demons which don't hurt people?

173
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,315
I don't know

174
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,073
Could you make friends with them?

175
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,990
Definitely not!

176
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,195
Why not?

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,598
Master only taught me how to exorcise them

178
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,396
Not how to make friends with them

179
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,872
then your Master has a problem

180
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,873
Or maybe his Master had a problem

181
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,832
Why don't I have a problem?

182
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,559
Because you absolutely don't have one

183
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,995
You're very nice

184
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,713
And very smart

185
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,559
I'd like to have a friend like you

186
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,509
I'm Qingqing

187
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,235
I'm Neng Ren

188
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,751
I'm busy, I have to go

189
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,074
Take care!

190
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,834
You are the gentleman my sister wants to see

191
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,796
Look again, do I look like a gentleman?

192
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,634
You have the wrong man

193
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,954
Can't be...

194
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,191
You're a herb-picker, aren't you?

195
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,154
Yes, but I'm not a gentleman

196
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,431
So I can't possibly be the one
your sister wants to see

197
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,070
I recognize you, you're the man who eats flowers

198
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,709
then what's my name?

199
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,636
Who am I?

200
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,032
I don't know

201
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,997
But you are the one my sister wants to see

202
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,071
It's Lantern Festival night, go and enjoy it

203
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,554
And stop bothering me

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,036
Goodnight... young miss

205
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,997
What on earth?

206
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,999
Why's it moving?

207
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,911
Stop!

208
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,315
You're a real fool

209
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,115
Where do you think you're going?

210
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,435
Sorry! Sorry!

211
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,589
I didn't do that on purpose!

212
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,639
Sit down

213
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,348
Miss, it's late and you're here alone

214
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,114
This isn't proper

215
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,078
Don't treat me as a stranger

216
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,999
You don't need to be so polite

217
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,432
No, no, I should go

218
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,349
Who built this pavilion? It's so rickety

219
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,677
Well, I think it's very nice

220
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,788
And it's a perfect spot to see the West Lake

221
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,039
I'm afraid I'm not so interested

222
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,548
And I need to get home

223
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,509
This early?

224
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,433
There's moonlight on the lake,
a pavilion in the moonlight...

225
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,155
And we're in the pavilion

226
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,036
Don't you think it's romantic?

227
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,029
I'm too busy for romance

228
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,272
What are you avoiding?

229
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,993
Why are you keeping such a distance from me?

230
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,991
Why don't you like me?

231
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,955
It's not that I don't like you, Miss

232
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,955
But someone else already has my heart

233
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,912
Miss, I'm a very poor man

234
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,069
I pick herbs for a living

235
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,911
I'm not worthy of your affections

236
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,315
then tell me about her

237
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,432
What kind of person is she?

238
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,639
I know almost nothing about her

239
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,437
I can't even recall her face

240
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,672
All I know is that she saved my life

241
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,630
That day I fell into a lake in the mountains

242
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,993
She rescued me

243
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,435
if she saved your life, you owe her a lot

244
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,672
But when I revived...

245
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,393
...she was gone

246
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,237
My friends said I'd imagined her

247
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,674
But I'm quite sure...

248
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,113
...she was real

249
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,512
Because she kissed me so deeply

250
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,512
That kiss saved my life

251
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,832
In a way, it also took my life

252
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,235
What if...

253
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,517
You could kiss her again?

254
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,273
Would you remember her this time?

255
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,191
Hello, my friend!

256
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,829
Oh, it's you... haven't gone home yet?

257
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,876
Done with your errands?

258
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,395
All done

259
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,752
It's dangerous here, you should go home

260
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,189
if it's so dangerous, you should leave too

261
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,358
I can't, I'm hunting demons

262
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,395
Know the saying?

263
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,552
"There's someone smarter than you know"

264
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,671
It applies to demons too

265
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,118
You're no match for this one

266
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,755
I advise you to give up

267
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,717
I can't, I'm sworn to obey my Master

268
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,751
We have to trap the bat-demon tonight

269
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,958
Well, if you want to kill yourself...

270
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,791
This is a very, very powerful demon

271
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,150
Not really...

272
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,035
Just a bat-demon which bit a girl

273
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,318
Ugh, she's all bloody!

274
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,595
How do you know?

275
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,355
I'm an expert too

276
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,271
I can't let it get away

277
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,950
Sorry we can't talk more, until next time!

278
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,956
No!

279
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,916
Watch out

280
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,360
Oh well, there goes another friend

281
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,399
Neng Ren of Jinshan Temple!

282
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,871
Demon hunter and enforcer of Buddha's law

283
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,833
No bluffing!

284
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,633
Master! Save me!

285
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,836
Master! Save me!

286
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,279
Master!

287
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,515
Master!

288
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,595
Look!

289
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,950
Master Fahai and Neng Ren are back

290
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,589
What's wrong with Brother Neng Ren?

291
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,153
The bat-demon poisoned him

292
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,589
Can he be cured?

293
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,199
if he's lucky...

294
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,110
What are you staring at?

295
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,349
You

296
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,073
No need to keep staring so long

297
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,153
I can't stop wondering...

298
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,313
...if this is really happening

299
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,869
What do you think?

300
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,595
That you're dreaming?

301
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,839
Someone once told me...

302
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,512
if I want to see someone,
I should keep her in my heart

303
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,108
then I'll really see her again

304
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,951
Now I know it isn't superstition, it's true

305
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,310
You're saying you did want to see me again?

306
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,592
Xu Xian, let's go on like this

307
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,639
Always together, alright?

308
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,797
Eating together, sleeping together...

309
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,074
Doing everything together

310
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,675
Won't you get tired of me?

311
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,155
Won't you?

312
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,319
But I want to take you seriously

313
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,354
I want to meet your parents

314
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,639
And when I have their permission to court you...

315
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,948
then we'll have a formal match and get married?

316
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,115
Brother! Brother!

317
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,230
Wake up!

318
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,277
The sun rose hours ago!

319
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,271
Brother, wake up!

320
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,710
What?

321
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,751
That's scary, Brother!

322
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,668
Brother! You... Your ears have grown pointy!

323
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,315
And you got fangs! So scary!

324
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,358
Brother, are you turning into a demon?

325
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,754
Master! Master! Something very bad has happened!

326
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,273
Brother Neng Ren has run away

327
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,919
Come and see! Quickly!

328
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,832
This place isn't bad, we could live here

329
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,550
Change!

330
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,798
Hey, friend...

331
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,909
You want to hang yourself?

332
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,109
Hurry away, friend

333
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,836
Death by hanging is an ugly sight

334
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,759
You'll get nightmares

335
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,915
I know!

336
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,353
After death, your body turns purple

337
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,273
Your tongue hangs loose and your eyes fall out!

338
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,117
What?

339
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,352
if you don't believe me, give it a go!

340
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,349
You don't look like you really want to die

341
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,592
You don't understand

342
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,638
I'm a demon hunter...

343
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,355
But I'm turning into a demon!

344
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,516
Just think...

345
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,878
When I meet a demon I've hunted before...

346
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,872
...I'll seriously lose face

347
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,273
if you're a demon, just be a demon

348
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,749
When one demon meets another...

349
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,433
Mostly they just nod a greeting

350
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,352
And lots of them don't have limbs

351
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,039
Who'll care about your face?

352
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,353
I'll let you in on a secret

353
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,957
Actually, I'm a demon too

354
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,119
You... you...

355
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,150
What's wrong?

356
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,196
Aren't we two the same now?

357
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,189
All demons together! Don't look at me like that

358
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,956
Since we're so close now...

359
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,273
...I'll teach you how to be a demon

360
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,836
Come on!

361
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,149
I'm gelded!

362
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,191
Come on!

363
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,430
A gelding!

364
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,390
Come on!

365
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,956
I just had chive for breakfast.
I am going to throw up!

366
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,349
Bats hang upside-down, get used to it!

367
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,839
My head will burst! It's full of blood!

368
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,750
That will make you smarter

369
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,228
I have a question for you...

370
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,918
Am I pretty?

371
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,829
Listen...

372
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,072
Right now, all I can see is stars

373
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,279
I'm seeing you upside-down

374
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,079
Pretty doesn't come into it

375
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,713
I see

376
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,712
And now, am I pretty?

377
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,038
Seeing you now... very pretty

378
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,512
So, do you get a special feeling
when you look at me?

379
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,516
Would you like to bite my neck?

380
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,911
Taste my blood?

381
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,075
Amitabha...

382
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,952
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner

383
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,790
Drink some water

384
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,672
What is this?

385
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,955
What do you think?

386
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,956
You bit my neck...

387
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,354
...ate meat and drank blood!

388
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,555
You violated the Three Taboos!

389
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,352
No more calling yourself a monk!

390
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,751
From now on, be the demon you are!

391
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,433
Liar!

392
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,318
We're there. Have we brought enough gifts?

393
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,116
Stop worrying! Come on in

394
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,115
I didn't expect your family to live in a mansion!

395
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,313
It's just a broken-down old house

396
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,919
You're here at last! You kept us waiting!

397
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,430
They're all here... this is my family

398
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,430
Go on in

399
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,429
- Go ahead
- Thanks

400
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,673
We need to hurry

401
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,836
They can't keep these forms for long

402
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,956
I know

403
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,436
I want to play too!

404
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,631
You can't take human form! Scram!

405
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,436
Hello, everyone

406
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,359
I'll make the introductions

407
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,238
This is my father

408
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,514
Hello

409
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,830
Sir, my name is Xu Xian

410
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,550
He's...

411
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,035
He's absolutely amazing!

412
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,594
You're...

413
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,192
You're just perfect for each other!

414
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,675
The perfect couple!

415
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,910
Really...

416
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,598
Really nice to see!

417
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,115
How wonderful that you are here to propose!

418
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,069
Don't worry, he's fine

419
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,236
Auspicious day for an engagement, isn't it?

420
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,316
This is... my mother

421
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,711
She's so young!

422
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,990
Really?

423
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,635
Actually, my stepmother

424
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,550
I'll introduce you

425
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,359
Googie... Googie...

426
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,032
How come you have a girl's name?

427
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,030
You misheard, it's Gugu

428
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,200
He was a chubby kid, that was his nickname

429
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,158
And it stuck

430
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,757
Hello, Gugu

431
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,870
Let's sit down

432
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,034
It's this year's latest fashion!

433
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,630
This is called Doodle-do Wine

434
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,433
It'll make you hiccup! Doodle-do!

435
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,671
My parents like you to look at them when you speak

436
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,710
Uh...

437
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,238
Aren't you here today to propose?

438
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,755
Hurry, then, we can hardly wait

439
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,877
I am Xu Xian, poor and humble

440
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
I never dreamt I'd win anyone like your Susu

441
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,069
I've come here today...

442
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,556
...because I seek your exalted permission...

443
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,672
...to marry Susu

444
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,636
Sir...

445
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,308
Although I have nothing to my name...

446
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,992
...I love Susu very much

447
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,757
No need for a dowry, just take her home! Go on!

448
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,229
I also want to say to Susu...

449
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,269
Good heavens!

450
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,758
Fine, just get on with it!

451
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,917
I want to hear what Xu Xian has to say

452
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,229
Sister...

453
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,796
Speak

454
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,909
I don't know what stroke of good fortune...

455
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,633
...allows me to make you mine

456
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,119
All it took was one kiss

457
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,438
The wheels of fate turned...

458
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,519
...and brought me to a perfect moment...

459
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,635
...of tenderness and happiness

460
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,835
From now on every moment, every second I have...

461
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,634
...I will spend...

462
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,835
...beside you

463
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,032
To make you happy

464
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,710
Why did you do that?

465
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,712
They're reverting to their true forms

466
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,069
It's bad! It's bad!

467
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,509
Fahai is here to exorcise us! Run!

468
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,716
Run!

469
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,991
Get Xu Xian away from here while I distract him

470
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,190
Take care!

471
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,589
A tawdry illusion to dupe humans!

472
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,508
Send them all back to the demon realm!

473
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,516
Yes, Master!

474
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,437
Master!

475
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,160
Master, let her go!

476
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,279
You know what you're asking?

477
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,396
Come back with me

478
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,995
Master...

479
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,393
I can't go back any more

480
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,278
Master, take care!

481
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,869
We escaped?

482
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,548
I'm not dead?

483
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,310
Be calm, I'll always protect you

484
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,515
What are we doing here?

485
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,073
Weren't we getting engaged?

486
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,350
We did it

487
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,350
My parents gave us their blessing

488
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,390
Really?

489
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,636
That was easy

490
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,275
So now we're married

491
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,992
I'm your wife

492
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,592
We can be together for the rest of our lives

493
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,870
One day...

494
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,714
...I'll have my own pharmacy

495
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,555
then I'll have more money

496
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,393
I don't want you to suffer with me

497
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,715
How could that be?

498
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,593
As long as we're together...

499
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,639
...I'll never know suffering

500
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,192
What's love like in this human world?

501
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,750
What do you mean?

502
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,994
I'd just like to know what kind of couple we are

503
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,990
Tell me

504
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,431
Well, there are several kinds...

505
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,954
Some couples are like birds in the forest

506
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,873
Each can fly away if they want

507
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,709
Not that kind!

508
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,636
Another kind is...

509
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,630
...where the husband gets rich and dreams...

510
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,988
...of his wife's death

511
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:23,951
Xu Xian!

512
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,956
I'll kill you!

513
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,155
Watch out!

514
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,953
Don't chase me!

515
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,157
You'll make me drop the herbs!

516
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,036
I'll kill you!

517
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,393
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

518
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,231
This disease cannot be cured

519
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,637
Master

520
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,993
They are victims of demons

521
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,150
At best, they'll go mad... at worst, they'll die

522
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,513
while they're alive, I must try to save them

523
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,676
Take precautions, don't go to strange places alone

524
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,509
Thank you, Master

525
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,599
Where did this disease come from?

526
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,234
So many people suddenly dying

527
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,075
You should take some rest

528
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,312
You've been making medicine for three days!

529
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,231
I can't

530
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,710
I have to find the cure

531
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,552
Susu, give me a hand

532
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,630
It mustn't stick...

533
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,870
...to the bottom of the pot

534
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,196
Preserving vital essence

535
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,391
concentrating vigor

536
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,790
boosting the spirit

537
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,839
Aside from these fundamentals...

538
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,276
...the medicine must strengthen basic functions

539
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,159
This is such a fierce disease

540
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,108
Can this medicine work?

541
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,754
I don't really know

542
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,633
Woman...

543
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,990
Disciples!

544
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,878
Foul demons! Crossing the three realms
and five planes...

545
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,198
...you've harmed the people
and spread chaos and evil!

546
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,353
By Buddha's mercy, if you choose to repent...

547
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,393
...you still have a chance to live

548
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,157
We'd rather die than listen to your nonsense!

549
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,958
Beware! The fox-demons are casting a charm!

550
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,077
On guard!

551
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,156
Yes, Master!

552
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,873
Maximum protection shield!

553
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,389
Heaven needs no hearing, ecstasy needs no sight

554
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,319
void my sense of self

555
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,836
What's that mantra?

556
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,430
Is it real or are you making it up?

557
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,749
Show your real forms!

558
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,957
By heaven's mercy

559
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,231
Master, we regret our sin

560
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,914
Please let us go. We beg you

561
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,712
Silence! You are demons!

562
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,758
return to the six paths of transmigration!

563
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,758
Accept your punishment with humility!

564
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,874
Amitabha...

565
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,631
Sister, Sister

566
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,190
What's wrong? Are you alright?

567
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,756
It's nothing

568
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,394
That's impossible...

569
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,512
if you keep on like this...

570
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,274
...something will go very wrong

571
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,191
I know what I'm doing

572
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,351
All you care about is that Xu Xian

573
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,631
Adding your vital essence to that medicine...

574
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,996
...is costing you centuries of self-improvement

575
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,752
I don't want to see him work so hard

576
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,191
I want to help him

577
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,029
But you may not live to see him again!

578
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,555
It can't be that bad

579
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,108
Of course it is

580
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,276
I have to go

581
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,598
Wait!

582
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,833
Ah, Dr Xu is here

583
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,519
Dr Xu, thank you!

584
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,270
You're truly our savior

585
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,197
We owe you our lives

586
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,952
You and your wife are such good people

587
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,439
Don't rush

588
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,680
There's enough for everyone

589
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,310
Thank you

590
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,157
Master, you should take some too

591
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,316
It cures sickness and prevents infection

592
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,913
Thank you

593
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,637
Master...

594
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,239
Did you mix this medicine?

595
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,236
Yes

596
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,516
No-one helped you?

597
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,079
Yes, my wife did

598
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,238
You are the quintessence of benevolence

599
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,198
Take this spirit dagger as a token of thanks

600
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,716
I can't, Master, I'm just doing my duty

601
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,358
You shouldn't refuse a gift from a senior

602
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,159
Keep it to protect yourself

603
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,395
Thank you, Master

604
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,989
Amitabha...

605
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,193
You think you can run?

606
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,118
You made the cure for the fox-demon's poison

607
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,430
So what?

608
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,077
Making it has cost you centuries
of your vital essence

609
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,632
You're kind to the ordinary people

610
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,831
But in your eyes, all we do is harm people

611
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,588
Despite good intentions, you will harm someone

612
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,510
Who will I harm?

613
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,989
You should know that

614
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,194
Xu Xian is my true love, how could I harm him?

615
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,749
You're from different realms! Being together...

616
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,150
...you drain his life-force and distort his destiny

617
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,318
Human lives are short, and true love is rare

618
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,636
He didn't choose to love you, you took his love

619
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,753
What does that matter? He's happy with me

620
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,113
Go chant your sutras!

621
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,836
You know nothing of love

622
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,757
if Xu Xian knew you are a snake...

623
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,519
...would he still love you?

624
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,399
I truly love him

625
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,989
if that's the case, shed your own tears

626
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,152
Don't make him shed tears over you

627
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,953
Since you're so benevolent...

628
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,159
...I'll let you go this time

629
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,558
if I see you again in this realm,
there'll be no mercy

630
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,874
Susu, I'm home

631
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,430
So soon?

632
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,190
You're back...

633
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,715
Look!

634
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,839
What's special about today?

635
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,075
Well, everyone else...

636
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,428
...is celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival

637
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,350
while I am celebrating...

638
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,438
...the best day I've ever had!

639
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,077
The day my medicine cured everyone!

640
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,551
Really?

641
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,750
That's wonderful

642
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,552
The old villagers were so grateful

643
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,108
They gave us all this food

644
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,989
Susu, thank you for working so hard

645
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,995
Here, a toast to you

646
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,271
I'm hungry

647
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,669
Here, try this

648
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,434
It's good

649
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,230
You have some too

650
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,790
What's wrong?

651
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,509
What kind of wine is this?

652
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,268
They distilled it themselves

653
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,231
Sulphur-flower wine!

654
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,517
That's right

655
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,356
It's a festival tradition, it wards off snake-bites

656
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,432
Susu?

657
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,351
Susu? What's wrong? Susu!

658
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,434
Susu? Susu? What's the matter?

659
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,595
Are you alright?

660
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,276
I'm alright

661
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,751
Susu!

662
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,191
Why lock the door? Open it!

663
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,196
Susu...

664
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,110
Don't frighten me!

665
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,191
Susu...

666
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,029
What's the matter?

667
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,676
Susu!

668
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,550
Susu!

669
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,950
Susu!

670
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,151
Susu, what are you doing?

671
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,396
Open the door!

672
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,750
Susu, don't frighten me

673
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,430
Xu Xian...

674
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,309
Do you recall...

675
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,831
...what you said to me when you proposed?

676
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,153
I want to hear you say it again

677
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,553
I knew you were playing a trick on me!

678
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,836
I'd rather not repeat it

679
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,950
if you don't...

680
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,399
...I might never hear it again

681
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,675
Alright, alright

682
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,230
I'll say it

683
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,958
But then you must open the door!

684
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,911
Alright

685
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,953
"All it took was one kiss"

686
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,276
"I'm sure that the wheels of fate turned..."

687
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,113
"...and brought me to a perfect moment..."

688
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,876
"...of tenderness and happiness"

689
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,959
"From now on..."

690
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,396
"...every moment, every second I have..."

691
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,355
"...I will spend beside you..."

692
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,837
"...to make you happy"

693
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,428
Susu! Susu!

694
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,634
Open the door, Susu!

695
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,959
I gave you a chance

696
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,196
You didn't leave, so now I must take you

697
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,911
Monk...

698
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,749
Why are you intent on destroying our happiness?

699
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,791
Susu! Who are you talking to?

700
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,790
Don't chase her

701
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:42,910
She was stabbed with the spirit dagger

702
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,159
Losing vital essence, she can't take human form

703
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,839
Master, where is my wife?

704
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,750
Did the white snake eat her?

705
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,513
The white snake was your wife

706
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,838
You married a thousand-year-old snake demon

707
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:03,916
Impossible!

708
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,514
Impossible!

709
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,508
Impossible!

710
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,238
Sister, I'll give you some of my vital essence

711
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,389
It's no use

712
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,750
You have only a few centuries' worth

713
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,037
That spirit dagger had thousands!

714
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,796
We were wrong to come here

715
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,437
It wasn't worth it, to see you like this

716
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,197
Maybe I shouldn't have done it...

717
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,228
But I have no regrets

718
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,029
Only now do I know...

719
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,591
...what true love is

720
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,035
Love...

721
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,917
Is it really so important?

722
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,189
Tell me...

723
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,638
How can I save Susu?

724
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,159
The one thing that might is spirit herb

725
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,117
It can bring the dead back to life

726
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,515
It only grows in the Lei Feng Pagoda

727
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,275
A demon like me can't even get in there!

728
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,358
Plus, there is only a single sprout

729
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,269
It is really, really scary.
They say fire can't even burn it!

730
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,958
Even if it takes braving swords and seas of fire...

731
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,113
...I shall save Susu

732
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,433
I can't take you any further

733
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,790
You dare to steal the spirit herb? Thief!

734
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,036
Which is the real spirit herb?

735
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,311
You will know after your death

736
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,268
I'll find it even if it kills me!

737
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,510
I must save Susu!

738
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,513
There's only a single sprout.
Fire can't even burn it!

739
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,079
They found us!

740
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,229
Did you get the spirit herb?

741
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:16,792
I did

742
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,636
then let's get out of here!

743
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,079
It is going to be a disaster If they catch you

744
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,430
You take the spirit herb, I'll distract them

745
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,956
Demons have been confined in
Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!

746
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,158
The spirit herb kept them trapped

747
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,833
Your theft has caused a catastrophe!

748
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,433
Let me go! Why are you keeping me here?

749
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,274
I needed it to save her!

750
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,113
I wounded Susu

751
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,437
Master, let me go! Let me go!

752
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,834
I wounded Susu

753
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,114
Master, we can't hold them much longer

754
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,119
Call all the senior monks, now!

755
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,438
We'll cast the Luohan spell!

756
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,033
I got spirit herb!

757
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,790
Spirit herb? From where?

758
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,634
Xu Xian gave it to me

759
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,796
Where is he?

760
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,993
The monks took him

761
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,870
Disciples!

762
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,390
Seal the main hall with a maximum protection spell!

763
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,428
Maximum protection in force!

764
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,875
Now we cast the spell!

765
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,391
Any interruption will kill him!

766
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,160
Leave! You trespass on hallowed ground!

767
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,072
Fahai, give me my Xu Xian!

768
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,908
You should be thankful you aren't dead

769
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,514
Why this further trouble?

770
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,155
Release him and I'll go at once

771
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,153
He stole the spirit herb for you

772
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,955
He's in great danger
because evil spirits possessed him!

773
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,231
Now we're breaking your spell!

774
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,109
I possessed him?

775
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,150
That cannot be...

776
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,437
I want to see him

777
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,113
He's in a life-or-death struggle

778
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,669
Interrupting the ritual...

779
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,313
...will end his life...

780
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,152
...and threaten those around him

781
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,318
Relations between humans and demons
can bring no good

782
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,390
You...

783
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,151
You're just coming between my sister and Xu Xian!

784
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,956
if you won't release him, I'll fight you!

785
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,319
if I don't leave with Xu Xian, I'll flood Jinshan!

786
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,678
You are selfish! How many lives will you threaten?

787
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,080
I will be forced to put an end to you
unless you stop

788
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,515
Very well... You're forcing me!

789
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,429
Get the important ones first.

790
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,510
Quick!

791
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,918
Forward, brothers!

792
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,431
Charge!

793
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,270
Bite them!

794
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,839
Break their human chain!

795
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,832
Xu Xian! Xu Xian!

796
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,876
Xu Xian?

797
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,670
You...

798
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,669
It's me, Susu

799
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,716
Susu?

800
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,598
Who is Susu?

801
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,592
I'm your wife

802
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,918
When did I get married?

803
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,591
Do you remember how we met?

804
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,190
I...

805
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,188
Fahai, what horrible magic did you use...

806
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,948
...to make him forget me?

807
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,749
As I told you, evil spirits possessed him

808
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,874
You broke in and disrupted the Luohan spell!

809
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,352
You're the one who's harmed Xu Xian!

810
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,157
What Luohan spell? What possession?

811
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,119
You're making it up!

812
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,071
You just want Xu Xian to leave me

813
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,309
You're a monster!

814
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:13,910
Qingqing!

815
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,914
Brother Neng Ren!

816
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,593
Brother Neng Ren!

817
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,593
I have been a dharma defender all my life...

818
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,117
...to maintain natural order and ethical conduct

819
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,949
Why did the calamity happen instead?

820
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,398
Have I been too stubborn?

821
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,314
Was I really wrong?

822
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,995
Why is it...

823
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,671
...that every time I wake up...

824
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,637
...you're beside me?

825
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,150
Open the door! Let me out!

826
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,831
Let me see Xu Xian once more!

827
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,670
I don't care if you turn me to dust and scatter me

828
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,914
The love we had... was it not real?

829
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,439
Where is all your 'great benevolence' now?

830
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,552
Can't we see each other just once more?

831
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,913
Just once...

832
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,588
I'll accept my punishment

833
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,591
Amitabha...

834
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,988
Your mercy is boundless...

835
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,433
I understand...

836
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,279
Amitabha...

837
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,629
Xu Xian!

838
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,829
You're suffering...

839
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,153
I don't recognize you...

840
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,839
But for some reason I don't understand...

841
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,672
...when I see you shedding tears...

842
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,153
...my heart aches for you

843
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,909
Don't be upset, I don't want you to cry

844
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,713
I'll cry for both of us

845
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,672
I don't mind that you've forgotten me

846
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,238
My own memories are enough

847
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,914
Before I first saw you...

848
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,830
...I meditated for a thousand years

849
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,119
But those thousand years...

850
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,959
...were worth less than a moment with you

851
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,789
You'll never know...

852
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,190
...how I've had to suffer

853
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,194
But even if I die...

854
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,119
...I'll have no regrets

855
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,070
Susu...

856
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,557
"Your hair tickles my heart"

857
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,996
"Your eyes lingers in my mind"

858
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,629
"I can bear any hardships to be with you"

859
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:44,111
"Our love shall remain in the dark"

860
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,120
"year after year"

861
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,838
"but nothing can change it"

862
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,512
"Nothing at all"

863
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,312
"I will be there"

864
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,278
"if you are there"

865
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:01,636
"I vow to live for you"

866
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:08,556
"coz I can lose anything but you"

867
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,554
"Love is right"

868
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,709
"if there is joy between us"

869
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,673
"Our love shall survive"

870
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,839
"longer than any time"

871
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:28,154
"I vow to live for you"

872
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,037
"till the end of time"

873
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:34,989
"coz I can lose anything but you"

874
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:39,153
"Love is right"

875
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,194
"if the tortures on me are to protect you"

876
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,839
"Our love shall survive"

877
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,916
"longer than any time"

878
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:56,718
"And we'll meet again in our next lives"

879
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,869
Susu...

880
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,232
for the two of them...

881
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,395
...that was probably the best outcome

882
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,915
I never want to love anyone as she loved him

883
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,554
You... you'll never be much good as a demon

884
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,316
Neng Ren...

885
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,314
That new form you have...

886
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,788
It kind of suits you
