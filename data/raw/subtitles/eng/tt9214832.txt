2
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,036
Not that one.

3
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,004
The next.

4
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,414
How am I to bear it
when you are gone?

5
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,251
I am going only
half a mile, Emma.

6
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,518
But great is
the difference between

7
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,358
a Mrs. Weston half a mile away
and a Miss Taylor in the house.

8
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:05,899
Dear Emma.

9
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,936
You have been a friend

10
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,872
and companion
such as few possess.

11
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,440
A governess in office, but...

12
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,945
...little short of a mother
in affection.

13
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:23,248
I wish you every happiness
on your wedding day.

14
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,424
<i>Poor Miss Taylor!</i>

15
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,197
It's a pity Mr. Weston
ever thought of her.

16
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:42,000
Papa, Mr. Weston is
such a good-humored,

17
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,436
pleasant, excellent man.

18
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,304
He thoroughly deserves
a good wife.

19
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:46,938
And you would not have had
Miss Taylor

20
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,307
live with us forever
when she might have had

21
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,042
- a house of her own.
- "A house of her own."

22
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,410
Where is the advantage
of a house of her own?

23
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,412
This is...

24
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,350
three times as large.

25
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,383
It's entirely unnecessary.

26
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,218
Poor Miss Taylor.
Poor Isabella.

27
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,920
My sister married
seven years ago, Papa.

28
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:03,922
You must be
reconciled to it by now.

29
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:04,892
That was a terrible day.

30
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,103
It shall always be
a matter of great joy to me

31
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:19,971
that I made the match myself.

32
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,407
Everyone said Mr. Weston
would never marry again,

33
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,242
but I did not believe it.

34
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,912
Emma, you should not make
matches or foretell things.

35
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:29,414
Whatever you say
always comes to pass.

36
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,484
You must not make any more.

37
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:34,986
I promise to make none
for myself, Papa.

38
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,190
But I must indeed
for other people.

39
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:40,092
It is the greatest amusement
in the world.

40
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,295
And after such success,
you know.

41
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,376
Miss Bates. Mrs. Bates.

42
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,177
Miss Gilbert. Mrs. Cox.

43
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,214
Mr. Woodhouse, sir.
Miss Woodhouse.

44
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:04,319
- Mr. Cole, Mrs. Cole.
- Good morning.

45
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,395
M-Miss Woodhou...

46
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,296
M-Miss Woodhouse.

47
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,132
Morning.

48
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:21,099
Is this not the most happy...

49
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,436
happy, the-the most fortunate?

50
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:26,241
This morning, I could not get
my bonnet on for trembling.

51
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,306
Hmm.

52
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,309
Surrounded by blessings.

53
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,279
Wanting for nothing.

54
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,081
I am trembling again.

55
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,386
It is <i>too</i> joyful!

56
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,054
What is it, Emma?

57
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,490
I have a fancy
that Mr. Weston's son

58
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,325
- may surprise us.
- Frank Weston?

59
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,762
He's Frank Churchill now, Papa.

60
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,430
He's his uncle's heir.

61
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,766
When he came of age,
he took his uncle's name.

62
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,067
I so long to meet him.

63
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,069
But how do you know
he might surprise us?

64
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,373
It is his father's wedding day.

65
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,408
Mr. Weston speaks of him
so highly.

66
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,245
I cannot doubt
that he will come.

67
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,502
Poor Miss Taylor.

68
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,611
Dearly beloved friends,

69
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,614
we gather here
in the sight of God

70
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:46,084
to join together this man
and this woman

71
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,253
in holy matrimony,

72
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:51,389
an honorable estate
instituted by God

73
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,660
in this time of...
of man's great inno-cence.

74
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,532
"Inno-cence"?

75
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,533
Innocence.

76
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:02,267
No?

77
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,135
Well...

78
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,475
Mmm.

79
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,420
Mother, you must eat.
It is impolite not to eat.

80
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:25,458
I was just telling Mrs....

81
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:36,361
You know what
I'm about to say, sir.

82
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:39,197
"Why do you keep a carriage
if you never put it out?"

83
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,766
It's just such a shame
to see it standing by.

84
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,502
A gentleman on foot--

85
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,370
- it's unusual.
- Unusual.

86
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,673
Good evening, Mrs. Reynolds.

87
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,512
At last.

88
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:29,484
Mr. Knightley.

89
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,686
You must have had
a shocking walk.

90
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:36,288
Not at all, sir.
It's a beautiful evening.

91
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,691
You must have found it
very damp and dirty.

92
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,525
Dirty, sir?

93
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,260
Look at my shoes.

94
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,562
Not a speck on them.

95
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,765
MR. - How do you do?

96
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,667
I came to wish you joy.

97
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,001
Joy?

98
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,403
Oh, the wedding.

99
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:52,537
What a terrible day.

100
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:56,776
So, how did you all behave?
Who cried the most?

101
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:59,377
We all behaved charmingly.

102
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,379
Everybody was in
their best looks.

103
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,249
Not a tear, and hardly
a long face to be seen.

104
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:05,785
Bring the screen
a little closer.

105
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,854
Mr. Knightley feels a chill.

106
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,322
And what of
Mr. Frank Churchill?

107
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:11,456
Is he every bit as handsome

108
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,728
as his father
promised he would be?

109
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,663
He did not come?

110
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,839
You see, he wished
exceedingly to come,

111
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,741
but his aunt and uncle
could not spare him.

112
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:31,676
Well, I dare say
he might have come if he could.

113
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,746
I do not know why
you should say so.

114
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:36,549
If Frank Churchill had wanted
to attend his father's wedding,

115
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,283
he would have contrived it.

116
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,285
He... he chose not to come.

117
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,320
You've never met
Mr. Frank Churchill.

118
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,623
We do not know what he is able
or unable to do.

119
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,592
There is one thing, Emma,
which a man can always do

120
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:49,794
if he chooses,
and that is his duty.

121
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,764
It is Frank Churchill's <i>duty</i>

122
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,632
to pay this attention
to his father.

123
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,368
He also has a <i>duty</i> to his aunt,
who is unwell.

124
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,370
Mrs. Churchill has been unwell

125
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:00,573
for as long
as she could say so.

126
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,507
Her nephew is not a doctor.

127
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,777
If he had told her simply
and resolutely that he...

128
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,713
...that he must
attend his father's wedding,

129
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,883
there would have been
no opposition to his going.

130
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,318
You are the worst judge
in the world, Mr. Knightley,

131
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,819
of the difficulties
of dependence.

132
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:16,756
You've always been
your own master.

133
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,658
You've no idea what it is
to have tempers to manage.

134
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,495
I shall remember that
next time you quarrel with me.

135
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,837
There is a new
parlor boarder, Papa,

136
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,839
at Mrs. Goddard's school.

137
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,473
- Miss Smith.
- There.

138
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,375
Distinctly.

139
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:11,977
Do you feel it?
A chill draft.

140
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,646
A chill and sickly draft.

141
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:15,480
She's a natural child.

142
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:18,383
Nobody knows her parentage,
not even Miss Smith herself.

143
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,320
Is that not mysterious?

144
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:26,326
Miss Taylor would have felt it.

145
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,796
The misfortune of your birth,
Harriet,

146
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,799
ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates.

147
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,501
There can be no doubt of your
being a gentleman's daughter.

148
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,736
You must support your claim
to that station

149
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,740
by everything
within your power.

150
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,642
Know you the Martins,
Miss Woodhouse,

151
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,212
of Abbey Mill Farm?

152
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,580
I know that they are
tenant farmers.

153
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,517
They rent their farm
from Mr. Knightley.

154
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,586
They were ever so kind to me
this summer.

155
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,654
Thank you.

156
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,958
When I went away,
Mrs. Martin was so very kind

157
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,796
as to send Mrs. Goddard
a beautiful goose.

158
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,735
The finest goose Mrs. Goddard
had ever seen, she said.

159
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,940
The Martins are of precisely
the order of people

160
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:50,876
with whom I feel
I can have nothing to do.

161
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:52,978
A degree or two lower
might interest me.

162
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,248
If they were very poor,
I might hope to be

163
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,650
useful to them
in some way, but...

164
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:00,253
a farmer can need
none of my help

165
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,990
and is therefore as much above
my notice as he is below it.

166
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:05,891
Mr. Robert Martin went

167
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:07,960
three miles one day
to bring me walnuts

168
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,729
because he knew
how fond I was of them.

169
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:11,964
I believe he's very clever.

170
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,565
He understands everything.

171
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,567
Come.

172
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,271
After tea, we shall call on
my dear Mrs. Weston.

173
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,940
We promised we should be
seeing one another every day.

174
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,058
It was
a beautiful service, Mr. Elton.

175
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,961
I'm not the first
to visit you this morning.

176
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,030
You are no less welcome
for being the second.

177
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:48,002
Mr. Elton, Miss Harriet Smith.

178
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,104
It is my great honor.

179
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,110
Harriet,
you must sit over there

180
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,112
so that you may admire
the view of Enscombe.

181
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,747
Mr. Frank Churchill
is the artist.

182
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,983
I have heard it described as

183
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,718
one of the finest houses
in Yorkshire.

184
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,586
I have heard the same.

185
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,622
And Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

186
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:11,890
He is very fortunate.

187
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:15,894
There is such symmetry
between us.

188
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,563
We both lost our mothers
when we were very young.

189
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,600
And he has his aunt
to care for, as I have Papa.

190
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:25,604
But how can we admire
a painted beauty

191
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:30,675
with such... loveliness
before us in the flesh?

192
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:39,818
Mr. Elton is
such a good-humored man.

193
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
So cheerful and obliging.

194
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,856
And gentle.

195
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,660
I think very well of Mr. Elton.

196
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:51,063
I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse,

197
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,999
that you should not be
going to be married.

198
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,601
So charming as you are.

199
00:15:56,603 --> 00:16:00,039
I have none of the usual
inducements of women to marry.

200
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,907
Fortune I do not want.

201
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,808
Employment I do not want.

202
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,911
Consequence I do not want.

203
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:07,679
I believe few married women

204
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,948
are half as much mistress
of their husband's house

205
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,585
as I am of Hartfield.

206
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,057
You must come again tomorrow.

207
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,824
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.

208
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,694
Thank you.

Miss Woodhouse,
which do you prefer?

216
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,090
They are practically identical.

217
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:55,828
Of course, if the dark
gets dirty, it would not show.

218
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,063
- But the light...
- The dark, then.

219
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,733
The light is
a good deal prettier.

220
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,738
Miss Woodhouse, what's the matter?

221
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,874
Miss Woodhouse.

222
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:09,975
Miss Woodhouse.

223
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:11,244
How do you do?

224
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,148
And you, Miss Smith.

225
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:16,281
I saw you through the window.

226
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,883
I saw you through the window.

227
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,184
Miss Woodhouse,
I bring happy news.

228
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,753
We have had a letter
this very morning

229
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,256
from my niece, Jane Fairfax.

230
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,290
I hope that she is well.

231
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,693
In normal course, she writes
on a Tuesday, but today was...

232
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,062
Oh, her health.

233
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:34,032
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you are
so very kind to inquire.

234
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:36,201
Poor Jane. She was at Weymouth

235
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,137
with Colonel Campbell
and, uh...

236
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,938
Oh, where is the letter?

237
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,774
Oh. Oh, it must not be far off.

238
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:44,277
Oh, such an unexpected...

239
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,845
Oh, it's on the glove stand.

240
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,482
It was with the gloves.
It was with the gloves.

241
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:52,050
Yes, at Weymouth with Colonel Campbell

242
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:54,219
and his wife
and Jane's dear friend,

243
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:56,289
Miss Campbell,
who is recently married.

244
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,223
She's Mrs. Dixon now.

245
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,159
And, oh, dear, Mr. Dixon,

246
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,827
who is the most charming
young man,

247
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:05,264
rendered to Jane
a great service in recent days.

248
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,733
They were... Oh, too pretty.
That is...

249
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:13,038
Yes, they were out in a part...
oh, in a party on the water,

250
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,041
and Jane, by the sudden
whirling around

251
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:19,077
of something or other
in the sails,

252
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,214
would have been dashed
to the sea at once...

253
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:25,150
...and actually all but gone.

254
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:29,322
But Mr. Dixon, with
the greatest presence of mind,

255
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:34,759
caught hold of her habit
and saved her life.

256
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:38,096
Oh, to think that poor Jane
may have perished.

257
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:42,034
I cannot think of it
without shaking, she an orphan.

258
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,769
I am very pleased that
Miss Fairfax was not harmed.

259
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,340
How gratified Jane will be
to know that she has

260
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,243
such dear, devoted friends.

261
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,211
Heaven forbid that I should
ever bore anybody

262
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,247
half as much about
all the Knightleys together

263
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,349
as Miss Bates does
about Jane Fairfax.

264
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:01,987
One is sick of the very name
"Jane Fairfax."

265
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,257
Every letter from her
is read 40 times over.

266
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:06,359
And if she does but knit
a pair of garters,

267
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,362
one hears of nothing else
for a whole month.

268
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:14,235
It is Robert Martin.

269
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,740
Good boy.

270
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,145
- Miss Smith.
- Mr. Martin.

271
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,024
- Lovely to see you, Miss Smith.
- Goodbye.

272
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,400
Only think of
our happening to meet him.

273
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:49,167
Well, Miss Woodhouse?

274
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:51,336
Is he like what you expected?

275
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:54,373
What do you think of him?

276
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,042
I had no right to expect much,

277
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,910
and indeed,
I did not expect much,

278
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:02,381
but I had imagined him,
I confess,

279
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:05,951
a degree or two nearer...

280
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,921
gentility.

281
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,124
To be sure...

282
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,062
he's not so genteel
as to a real gentleman.

283
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,907
Mm-hmm.

284
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,177
I do hope
Mr. Woodhouse is not ill.

285
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,079
Oh, no.

286
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:37,350
Oh, Papa sees Mr. Perry
every day.

287
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,352
I know I disappoint him
awfully.

288
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,354
I'm so seldom indisposed.

289
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,356
If he does not invent
an illness for me,

290
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,892
I hardly figure in his letters.

291
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,427
Truly...

292
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,665
you are the very picture
of good health, Miss Woodhouse.

293
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,200
Mrs. Martin thinks you
the most handsome woman

294
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:57,871
in all of Highbury.

295
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:03,508
You must never
flatter me in front of

296
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,077
Mr. Knightley, Harriet.

297
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,446
He thinks me
vain enough already.

298
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,048
I do not think you
personally vain.

299
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,384
Considering how
very handsome you are,

300
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:13,020
you seem little occupied
with it.

301
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,857
Your vanity lies
a different way.

302
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,370
Did I tell you what Mr. Elton
said of you the other day?

303
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,173
He called you...

304
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,477
..."loveliness itself."

305
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,714
It-it seems to me

306
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:45,050
his manners are rather softer
than they used to be,

307
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,720
and I rather wonder
whether he means

308
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,123
to ingratiate himself with you.

309
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,562
Morning, Mrs. Goddard.

310
00:21:57,564 --> 00:21:59,364
- Good morning, Mr. Elton.
- Girls.

311
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,302
Quickly now.

312
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,993
These are exquisitely done,
Miss Woodhouse.

313
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:30,095
You have a charming talent.

314
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,297
I dare say
there is merit in them,

315
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:34,767
in the least finished
perhaps the most.

316
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,435
So Mr. Knightley tells me,

317
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,471
and he finds fault
in everything I do.

318
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,176
Did you ever have
your likeness taken, Harriet?

319
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:46,144
Oh... no.

320
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:50,115
What an exquisite possession
a good picture of her would be.

321
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:51,351
It would indeed.

322
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:54,085
It would indeed.

323
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:55,455
Let me entreat you,
Miss Woodhouse.

324
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,223
Now, at once.

325
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:28,621
You have given Miss Smith...

326
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:31,624
all that she requires.

327
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,658
She was a beautiful creature
when she came to you,

328
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,394
but the attractions
you have added are

329
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:40,165
infinitely superior
to what she received from...

330
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,266
nature.

331
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:42,235
It's depressing for me

332
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,668
- to have to take care of it, you know?
- No.

333
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,737
- Well, quite.
- Take over.

334
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:46,539
Mr. Woodhouse,
your daughter's gifts

335
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,074
are without compare.

336
00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:51,011
Bear witness.

337
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:56,150
Mm. You've made her
too tall, Emma.

338
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,284
Uh, no.

339
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:01,386
No, certainly not too tall.

340
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,421
Not in the least too tall.

341
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:07,425
Mm, mm, yes.
It is very... pretty.

342
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,362
When it is finished,
you must have it framed.

343
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,865
Allow me.

344
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,535
Trust me with this commission,
Miss Woodhouse,

345
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,171
and I will ride to London
the moment I am asked.

346
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,642
It would be my great honor.

347
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,579
I cannot have a moment's doubt.

348
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,149
It is exactly as I planned.

349
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,554
He's in love with you.

350
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:39,191
I do not know
what your opinion may be,

351
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:41,459
Mrs. Weston, of this great...

352
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:44,196
intimacy between Emma
and Harriet Smith,

353
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:45,898
but I think it a bad thing.

354
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,632
How differently we feel.

355
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:50,335
Miss Smith knows nothing
about herself

356
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,607
and looks upon Emma
as knowing everything.

357
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,609
Her ignorance
is hourly flattery.

358
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:58,578
But educating Harriet
will be an inducement

359
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,345
for Emma to educate herself.

360
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:01,546
They will read together.

361
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:03,215
Emma has been meaning
to read more

362
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,250
ever since she was
12 years old.

363
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:06,919
She never would submit
to anything

364
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,753
requiring industry
and patience.

365
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:10,455
I cannot allow you to be

366
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:12,290
a judge in this matter,
Mr. Knightley.

367
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,159
You are so used to live alone,

368
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:17,597
you do not know the value
of a companion.

369
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,198
Well, she always declares
that she will never marry,

370
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,201
which, of course,
means just nothing at all.

371
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,570
I should like to see
Emma in love

372
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:28,273
and in some doubt of a return.

373
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:30,244
It would do her good.

I'd expected to wait
until the spring.

385
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:05,680
Always buy out of season,
Mr. Martin, whenever you can.

386
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:12,417
Mr. Knightley, sir,
forgive my liberty,

387
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,689
but may I be so bold
as to seek your advice?

388
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:18,158
Of course.

389
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,595
Miss Woodhouse!

390
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,497
You will never guess
what has happened.

391
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,533
Robert Martin
has offered me his hand.

392
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:31,305
He writes as if
he really loves me very much.

393
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,547
Is it a good letter?

394
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,716
Or too short?

395
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,550
It is a very good letter.

396
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:48,721
So good I think one of his
sisters must have helped him.

397
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,690
But what shall I say?

398
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,391
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
do advise me.

399
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:54,727
Oh, no, no, no.

400
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,497
The words must be your own.

401
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,416
You think I ought
to refuse him.

402
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,618
I lay it down
as a general rule, Harriet,

403
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,822
that if a woman doubts whether
she should accept a man or not,

404
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,225
she certainly ought
to refuse him.

405
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,698
Perhaps... it is safer.

406
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,700
Do you think
I had better say no?

407
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:38,537
Not for the world
would I advise you either way.

408
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:41,508
You must be the best judge
of your own happiness.

409
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,421
I have now...

410
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,493
quite determined...

411
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:03,530
...and really almost
made up my mind...

412
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,801
...to...

413
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:11,405
refuse Mr. Martin.

414
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,777
<i>Refused?</i>

415
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,780
Then she is a greater simpleton
than I ever believed her.

416
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,116
Harriet Smith
refuse Robert Martin?

417
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,851
I...

418
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:27,552
I hope you are mistaken.

419
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,122
I saw her answer.

420
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,422
Nothing could be clearer.

421
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,690
You saw her answer?

422
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:33,926
You wrote her answer.
This is your doing.

423
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:36,428
Emma, you persuaded her
to refuse him.

424
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,564
Well, if I did, I should not
feel that I had done wrong.

425
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,433
Mr. Martin's
a respectable young man,

426
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,435
but I cannot admit him
to be Harriet's equal.

427
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:46,806
No, indeed, he is her superior
in both sense and situation.

428
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,942
Emma, your infatuation
about that girl blinds you.

429
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:52,410
What are Harriet Smith's
claims, either of

430
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,713
birth, nature or education,
to any connection

431
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,381
higher than Robert Martin?
She is the natural daughter

432
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:57,616
- of nobody knows whom.
- There can scarcely be a doubt

433
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,417
that her father is a gentleman,
and a gentleman of fortune!

434
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,619
Probably no settled provision
at all, and certainly

435
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:02,420
- no respectable relations!
- Her allowance is very liberal.

436
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:04,589
Nothing has been grudged
for her improvement.

437
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,791
She is known only as a parlor
boarder at a common school.

438
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:08,793
She is pretty,
and she is good-tempered,

439
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:11,496
- and that is all.
- That is all?

440
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,966
These are not trivial
recommendations, Mr. Knightley.

441
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,768
Till men do fall in love

442
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,970
with well-informed minds
instead of handsome faces,

443
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,604
a girl with such loveliness
as Harriet

444
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:21,506
has a certainty
of being admired

445
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:22,975
and sought after
wherever she goes.

446
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:25,010
I am very much mistaken
if your sex, in general,

447
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,611
would not find these qualities

448
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:27,913
the highest claims
a woman could possess.

449
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:30,749
Upon my word, Emma,

450
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,852
to hear you abusing
the reason you have

451
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,520
is almost enough
to make me think so, too.

452
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:36,889
Better to be
without sense altogether

453
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,893
than to misapply it as you do.

454
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:48,633
Men of sense
do not want silly wives.

455
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,536
And more prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience

456
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,706
and disgrace that
they might be involved in

457
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,909
when the mystery of her
parentage came to be revealed.

458
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,978
Let her marry Robert Martin,

459
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,580
and she is safe
and respectable forever.

460
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:03,916
But if you teach her
to expect to marry greatly,

461
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:06,785
nobody within her reach will
ever be good enough for her.

462
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:10,555
Your plans for Harriet are
best known only to yourself.

463
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:13,926
But as you make no secret
of your love of matchmaking,

464
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:16,896
it is fair to suppose
the plans you have.

465
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,499
And as a friend...

466
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:21,800
I shall just hint to you

467
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,802
that if Elton is
the man that I think,

468
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:25,537
it will be your labor in vain.

469
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:29,008
He knows that he is
a very handsome young man

470
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,076
and-and a great favorite
wherever he goes,

471
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:32,912
but from his general
way of talking

472
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,779
when there are
only men present,

473
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,982
I'm convinced that he does not
mean to throw himself away.

474
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,717
I'm very much obliged to you

475
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,819
for opening my eyes,
Mr. Knightley,

476
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:43,724
but know that I am done with
matchmaking for the present.

477
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,895
I only want to keep Harriet
for myself.

478
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,874
It's so beautiful!

479
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:38,879
You certainly spared
no expense.

480
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:46,919
♪ Hark, hark, what news
the angels bring ♪

481
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:50,323
- ♪ Glad tidings of ♪
- ♪ Glad tidings of... ♪

482
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,556
...me to do all

483
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:52,691
- the disciplinary action to the children.
- You must...

484
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:53,892
- It is utterly unfair.
- You, it is your responsibility

485
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:55,894
and your responsibility to
teach the baby to drink milk...

486
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,029
It is not only
my responsiility.

487
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:57,997
...without spilling it
all over my favorite trousers.

488
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,598
That is the nurse's
responsibility, not...

489
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,802
Emma, they're here.

490
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,774
That was unendurable.

491
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,678
Husband, comport yourself.

492
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,614
- Papa.
- Isabella.

493
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,849
Emma.

494
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,184
I shall always
be sorry you went to the sea

495
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,685
this autumn
instead of coming here.

496
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:21,786
But why should you
be sorry, sir?

497
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:22,988
It did us a great deal of good.

498
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,690
On the contrary, Mr. John
Knightley looks far from well.

499
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:26,825
Southend was
strenuously recommended

500
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:27,993
by our physician, sir.

501
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:29,162
Sea air and sea bathing.

502
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:31,164
The sea is rarely of use
to anybody.

503
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,664
It nearly killed me once.

504
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,866
Come.

505
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,135
I must beg you
not to speak of the sea.

506
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:37,836
Makes me miserable.

507
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,072
And envious--
I who have never seen it.

508
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,374
Mr. Wingfield specified
that Southend

509
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,075
was the best place to go
for the family.

510
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,809
Perhaps you
should change your physician.

511
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:45,911
He was
recommended by my husband.

512
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:48,181
Cornwall
might have been forgivable,

513
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,714
but Southend?

514
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,819
Let us be friends.

515
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,160
Aw.

516
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,865
Tell your aunt, little Emma,
that she was very wrong

517
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,570
and she ought to set you
a better example.

518
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:13,672
- Oh.
- Wh...

519
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,740
- What is the matter? Is there fever?
- Uh...

520
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,809
Uh...

521
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,844
Where is the nurse?
Give her to me.

522
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,045
- Is she feverish? -
- I do not know.

523
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:20,913
I-I do not know.
Wh-Where is the nurse?!

524
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,083
- Send for Perry.
- Do not send for Perry.

525
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,851
Send for Perry!

526
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:29,990
As death follows life...

527
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:44,937
Mm.

528
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:47,875
Yes.

529
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,748
As... far as
good intentions went, um...

530
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,153
...we were both in the right.

531
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:03,690
I must admit, I have not yet
been proved wrong.

532
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:11,799
Mr. Knightley.

533
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:21,642
Was Mr. Martin
very disappointed?

534
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:28,183
A man cannot be more so.

535
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,076
Miss Woodhouse is coming.

536
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,818
Miss Woodhouse.

537
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:07,220
Harriet!

538
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,088
Miss Woodhouse!

539
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:14,759
You're so, uh... disheveled.

540
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:17,062
I'm always ill at Christmas.

541
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,864
Get back in bed at once.

542
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:25,837
You'll miss the party
at Randalls.

543
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,839
Mr. Elton will be there.

544
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,875
And Frank Churchill
is expected at last.

545
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,747
And Mr. Elton's sermon.

546
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:40,187
A sermon on Christmas Day.

547
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,327
I transcribe them every Sunday.

548
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:55,901
I will transcribe it for you.

549
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,038
You are so kind to me,
Miss Woodhouse.

550
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,011
Welcome!

551
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:08,313
Welcome, my friends!

552
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:12,150
Welcome!

553
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:13,952
Mr. Elton.

554
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,420
How's poor Miss Smith?

555
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,089
Oh, no better, I'm afraid.

556
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,125
Aw, such a sad loss
to our party today.

557
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,160
Miss Smith has sent
her apologies.

558
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:24,765
She will be missed
every moment.

559
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,767
Ooh.

560
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:29,835
How are the children?

561
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:31,103
Multiplying.

562
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,372
My only moment's rest
is in the office.

563
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,942
Frank has been detained
at Enscombe, I'm sorry to say.

564
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,876
Oh.

565
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:40,281
I had a letter from him
just this morning.

566
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:49,054
Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

567
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:51,624
I have heard it described
as one of the finest houses

568
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,458
in Yorkshire.

569
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,264
Going out in dismal weather

570
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,399
to return probably in worse.

571
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:03,468
Four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing

572
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,138
but to convey five idle...

573
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Another fine,
flourishing letter

574
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,941
full of professions
and falsehoods?

575
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:11,977
Your feelings are singular.

576
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,946
His letters seem to
satisfy everybody else.

577
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:18,884
I suspect they do not
satisfy Mrs. Weston.

578
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,253
Were she a person
of consequence herself,

579
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:21,887
he would have come by now,
I daresay.

580
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,990
You seem determined
to think ill of him.

581
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,925
I should be as ready
to acknowledge his merits

582
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:29,294
- as any other man, but...
- I hear of none

583
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,963
except that he is well grown
and good-looking.

584
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:34,167
Well, if he has nothing else
to recommend him,

585
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,967
he shall be a treasure
at Highbury.

586
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:39,272
We do not often look
upon fine young men.

587
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:42,341
Cannot ask for all the virtues
into the bargain.

588
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,377
You will excuse my being
so much overpowered.

589
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,379
We are both prejudiced.

590
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:49,014
You against, I for him.
And we shall have

591
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,049
no chance of agreeing
until he is really here.

592
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,485
Prejudiced?

593
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,219
I'm not prejudiced.

594
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:56,289
Yes, but I am.

595
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:59,224
Very much, and without at all
being ashamed of it.

596
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:01,259
My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston

597
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:04,064
gives me a decided prejudice
in his favor.

598
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:13,372
Charming Miss Woodhouse.

599
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,173
Mr. Weston.

600
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:45,003
Mrs. Churchill
rules at Enscombe.

601
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:47,205
Ev-Everything...

602
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,074
gives way to her.

603
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,209
She has decreed that if Frank

604
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:53,513
does not marry
a lady of some fortune,

605
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:56,047
then he will be entirely
cut out from her will.

606
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,450
There is jealousy.

607
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:00,051
She is jealous even
of his regard for his father.

608
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:01,219
Jealousy...

609
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:03,188
But she is so very fond
of her nephew.

610
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,991
- He is her particular favorite.
- Dear Emma.

611
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:08,193
Do not attempt,
with your good nature,

612
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,061
to understand a bad one.

613
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,167
You must let it go its own way.

614
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,273
Uh, I have heard it described

615
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,276
as one of the finest houses
in Yorksh...

616
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:31,484
Mm. What seasonable weather
we're having.

617
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:34,254
I dare say we shall
have snow tonight.

618
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,123
Snow? Tonight?

619
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,524
When did it commence?

620
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:41,326
We shall call
for the carriage right away.

621
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:43,094
It has hardly begun--
barely an inch--

622
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,130
but it is falling fast.

623
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,531
It was snowing
when your mother died.

624
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:47,800
Oh, Papa, I know.
We shall get you home.

625
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,868
Well, what is to be done? Emma!

626
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,368
There is room for us all.

627
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,037
We have accommodation
for all of you.

628
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,171
Absolutely.

629
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,372
The horses are in
good condition.

630
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:55,508
I do admire
your resolution, sir,

631
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,441
venturing out
in such weather...

632
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,611
There's nothing we can do.
It is snowing.

633
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:00,213
- Mrs. Weston, the party.
- We should go at once.

634
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:01,446
Wh-Where is the carriage?
Where is James?

635
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,381
Of course, fortunately, we do
have more than one carriage,

636
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:05,218
so if one is blown over
in the wind...

637
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,385
- Husband, please.
- Happy Christmas.

638
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:10,288
I am so very sorry.

639
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,825
- We must leave.
- I think we shall be very glad

640
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,129
that-that Frank
did not come at Christmas.

641
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:23,134
Look to your vinaigrette, Papa.

642
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,837
Mr. Knightley, you must
move your carriage.

643
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,204
- My father is not well.
- Take it.

644
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,472
It is first
and will be the fastest.

645
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:28,841
You will catch your death.

646
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,675
Your husband is not...
is not strong.

647
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,314
I'll ride with you, then.

648
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,585
Evidently, I may not survive.

649
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:52,497
Oh.

650
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,435
Miss Woodhouse.

651
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,463
Mr. Elton!

652
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,135
I must avail myself
of this precious opportunity

653
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:31,469
to declare sentiments
which must be

654
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:33,238
- already well known.
- Mr. Elton, please.

655
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,207
- You've drunk too much wine.
- My ardent attachment.

656
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,541
Mr. Elton!

657
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:38,345
You forget yourself.

658
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:42,415
I am ready to die
if you refuse me.

659
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,618
You take me for my friend.

660
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,352
Any message you have
to Miss Smith,

661
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:48,688
I shall be happy to deliver.

662
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,624
For Miss Smith?

663
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,758
A message for Miss Smith?

664
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,360
I never thought of Miss Smith

665
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,462
in the whole course
of my existence.

666
00:41:57,464 --> 00:42:00,398
Never paid her any attentions
but as your friend.

667
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,336
Never cared whether
she were dead or alive

668
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:05,403
but as your friend.

669
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:10,475
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.

670
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:14,379
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near?

671
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:17,450
Everything I have said or done
for many weeks

672
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,384
has been with the sole view

673
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:23,157
of making my adoration
to yourself.

674
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,196
Charming Miss Woodhouse...

675
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:34,701
...allow me
to interpret this...

676
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:38,272
...interesting silence.

677
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,475
It confesses you have
long understood me.

678
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,477
No, sir.

679
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,746
It confesses no such thing.

680
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:48,648
Nothing could be farther
from my wishes.

681
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,550
Your pursuit of Harriet
has given me great pleasure,

682
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:54,219
and I've been very earnestly
wishing your success.

683
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:59,293
Miss Smith is
a very good sort of girl...

684
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,364
...and no doubt there are men
who might not object.

685
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:09,704
Everybody has their level.

686
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:16,241
Madam, my visits to Hartfield
have been for yourself only,

687
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:17,610
and the encouragement
I received...

688
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:19,446
Encouragement?

689
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,550
I give you encouragement?

690
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:28,353
You are entirely mistaken, sir.

691
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,725
I have no thoughts
of matrimony at present.

692
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:39,732
- Driver, stop the carriage.
- Mr. Elton, please...

693
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:41,734
Driver, stop the carriage!

Miss Woodhouse.

711
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:12,292
Miss Woodhouse.

712
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,564
He never loved me.

713
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,766
He loves you.

714
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,370
He sought to aggrandize
and enrich himself.

715
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:29,443
Yes.

716
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:41,889
Harriet.

717
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,859
You might never have thought
of him but for me.

718
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,861
I assured you
of his attachments.

719
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:50,963
I contrived his visits
to Hartfield.

720
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:54,167
I do not blame you,
Miss Woodhouse.

721
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,435
I could never have
deserved him.

722
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,839
And none but so partial
and kind a friend as you

723
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,640
could even have
thought it possible.

724
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:05,880
It's silly, really.

725
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,422
Harriet.

726
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,758
I cannot see it
without thinking of him.

727
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,564
Burn the frame if you like,
but you must keep the likeness.

728
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,601
Then I will take it.

729
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:30,603
I will take it,
and I will treasure it

730
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:32,506
as a picture of my friend.

731
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,747
Goodbye, Papa.

732
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:44,850
Now, are we going
to be quiet this carriage ride?

733
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,651
Sit next to your sister.

734
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:47,853
Why are you so pale?

735
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,521
Where is the baby?
Where is the baby?

736
00:46:49,523 --> 00:46:50,755
Where is the baby?!

737
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,060
Henry needs his mor-mor.

738
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,795
We must retrieve
Henry's mor-mor.

739
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:59,464
I will not stop
this carriage for a mor-mor.

740
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:02,534
Goodbye, Isabella.

741
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:03,938
Goodbye.

742
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:11,545
Papa.

743
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:15,514
I wish she would not leave.

744
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:17,718
You must never leave me, Emma.

745
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:21,822
Oh, Papa.

746
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,426
You know I never could.

747
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:42,675
He cannot stay away forever.

748
00:47:42,677 --> 00:47:46,111
The curate cannot give
the sermon forever.

749
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,450
No one preaches
as Mr. Elton does.

750
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,786
Hear this extract,
Miss Woodhouse.

751
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,588
Hear this.

752
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,460
Enough about Mr. Elton.

753
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,037
Miss Woodhouse.

754
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,906
Miss Smith.

755
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:16,510
Such news.

756
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:19,878
My niece, Jane Fairfax...

757
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,048
Miss Woodhouse,
Jane Fairfax, she has...

758
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,553
Jane has surprised us.
She is here.

759
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,822
Oh, do come along.
We must have tea.

760
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,592
It is too thrilling.

761
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:38,597
She caught
a bad cold. Poor thing.

762
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,699
So long ago
as the seventh of November.

763
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,667
She has not been well since.

764
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,737
And her kind friends,
the Campbells,

765
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:46,805
thought she'd better come home

766
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:49,975
and try an air that always
agrees with her.

767
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:52,611
I hope that
your father is well.

768
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:54,113
Very well. I thank you.

769
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:56,115
She is very sorry to be parted

770
00:48:56,117 --> 00:48:58,650
from her dear friends,
the Campbells.

771
00:48:58,652 --> 00:48:59,852
And Mrs. Dixon.

772
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,087
And, oh, Mr. Dixon,

773
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:04,723
the most amiable young man
who did her

774
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:07,626
so great a service
at Weymouth in October.

775
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:10,795
I still shudder to think
what might have...

776
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:13,098
if not for Mr. Dixon,

777
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,869
with the waves and the water
and the sails.

778
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,038
Oh.

779
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,008
Such a charming man.

780
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:24,711
Oh, dear.

781
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:30,051
Is this not pleasant?

782
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:33,888
She plans to stay three months.

783
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:38,623
We must have you all
to Hartfield.

784
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:40,859
Oh.

785
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:43,862
Oh, Mother, do you hear?

786
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:48,867
Miss Woodhouse has invited us
to Hartfield!

787
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,104
Mother!
You must sample the tart.

788
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:01,880
No, I do... I do...
I do not advise the custard.

789
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,116
What do you say
to half a glass of wine?

790
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,052
In a tumbler of water,
naturally.

791
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:08,854
We shall be seeing Frank
any day now.

792
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:10,155
I have...
I have no doubt of it.

793
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,426
Oh, now, Jane,
Mr. Frank Churchill

794
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,894
is a man much talked about
in Highbury.

795
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:18,030
Is he not, Miss Woodhouse?

796
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:21,134
We are all very eager
to meet him.

797
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:23,735
He was at Weymouth
when Jane was there.

798
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:26,006
We are very little acquainted.

799
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:29,808
Frank Churchill
was at Weymouth?

800
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,210
In October?

801
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:33,714
That was the month
of his father's wedding.

802
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:38,217
But you must describe him.

803
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:40,020
Is he handsome?

804
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:43,922
Is he agreeable?

805
00:50:43,924 --> 00:50:46,894
I believe he is
generally thought so.

806
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:52,030
How well prepared
this custard is.

807
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:54,768
I must ask your cook
for the method.

Miss Fairfax.

819
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:56,195
Oh, what a pity
you did not bring your music.

820
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,797
I hope I can
recollect the tune.

821
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:09,041
Nobody in the world
plays like you.

822
00:52:43,378 --> 00:52:47,012
I'm glad you invited
Miss Fairfax to play.

823
00:52:47,014 --> 00:52:49,414
Having no instrument
at her grandmother's,

824
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,883
it must be a real indulgence.

825
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:53,885
I am glad you approve.

826
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,854
But I hope I am not
often deficient

827
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:58,293
in what is due
to my guests at Hartfield.

828
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,194
No.

829
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:03,797
You are not often deficient.

830
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:10,902
You make it very plain
you do not like Miss Fairfax.

831
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:15,841
Everybody supposes we must be
so fond of each other

832
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:17,843
because we are the same age.

833
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:20,245
Ever since I can remember,
I have been told I can find

834
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:22,981
no better companion
than Jane Fairfax.

835
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:27,085
She who is so accomplished
and so superior.

836
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:29,391
She is certainly accomplished.

837
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,159
Perhaps the accomplished
young woman

838
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:36,196
you wish to be thought
yourself.

839
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:57,215
Three months of doing
more than I wish

840
00:53:57,217 --> 00:53:59,051
and less than I ought.

841
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:01,855
That indifferent,
imperturbable statue.

842
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:15,070
I must go.

843
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:29,682
Harriet.

844
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:30,982
Oh.

845
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,853
We have missed you.

846
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,255
Our mother's been
asking for you.

847
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,259
Will you come
and visit us again?

848
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,432
Of course.

849
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:50,068
Good day, Miss Martin.

850
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,172
Miss Catherine Martin.

851
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:00,447
Mr. Martin.

852
00:55:13,961 --> 00:55:15,430
Miss Smith!

853
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:28,306
Th... The near way is flooded.

854
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:34,045
You would do better
going by Mr. Cole's stables.

855
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:36,049
The ground is higher there.

856
00:55:44,526 --> 00:55:47,426
You behaved extremely well.

857
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:49,428
And it is over.

858
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:53,064
As a first meeting,
it cannot occur again.

859
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:55,535
You must stay no longer
than a quarter of an hour.

860
00:55:55,537 --> 00:55:59,304
And allow no dangerous
reminiscences.

861
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:02,040
There must be
no recurrence to the past.

862
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,561
I seek the village
of Highbury, sir.

863
00:56:21,563 --> 00:56:23,463
Over the bridge,
left at The Crown.

864
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:25,430
You'll see the steeple.

865
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:27,098
Thank you.

866
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:28,503
Very much obliged.

867
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:58,533
Here we are.

868
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:03,201
- My dear.
- Mrs. Weston.

869
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:05,570
My son, Mr. Frank Churchill.

870
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:10,308
- Miss Emma Woodhouse.
- Miss Woodhouse.

871
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:13,378
He, uh... he's caught us
quite by surprise.

872
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,380
Indeed he has.

873
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:17,382
There are not many houses
in which I would

874
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:20,553
presume on so far, sir, but...

875
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:25,390
in coming home, I felt
I might take the liberty.

876
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:27,492
We, uh... we had a plan

877
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:29,094
to walk to the village, Emma.

878
00:57:29,096 --> 00:57:30,295
Will you join us?

879
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:31,466
I would be delighted.

880
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,299
Splendid.

881
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:35,402
Right.

882
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:59,392
I believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in Jane Fairfax.

883
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:01,359
Did you meet often at Weymouth?

884
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,228
Pray, let us go in here.

885
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,665
That I may prove myself to be
a true citizen of Highbury,

886
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:09,604
I must buy something at Ford's.

887
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:22,615
And I beg your pardon,
Miss Woodhouse,

888
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:25,217
you were speaking to me.

889
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:26,719
I merely asked
whether you had known

890
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:29,289
much of Miss Fairfax
and her party at Weymouth.

891
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:33,225
And now that I understand
the question,

892
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:35,496
I must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one.

893
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:38,931
Well, it is always
the lady's right

894
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,434
to decide on the degree
of acquaintance.

895
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:44,537
You answer as discreetly
as she would herself.

896
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:48,273
Though her account leaves
so much to be guessed

897
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,408
that I really think
you may say what you like

898
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,410
of your acquaintance with her.

899
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:55,247
I only know what is
generally known.

900
00:58:55,249 --> 00:58:57,518
That she is poor
and of no consequence.

901
00:59:03,257 --> 00:59:05,658
Here's where you have
your balls, I suppose.

902
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,960
Every fortnight through the winter.

903
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,795
I am afraid Highbury may yet
disappoint you, Mr. Churchill.

904
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,632
We have not society enough
for dancing.

905
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:15,267
Ah, but an inn of this size
must have a ballroom,

906
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:18,740
and where there is a ballroom,
there can be a ball.

907
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:22,407
We cannot do without dancing.

908
00:59:25,546 --> 00:59:28,346
Instances have been known
of young people

909
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:30,650
passing many, many months
successfully

910
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:34,219
without any ball
of any description

911
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:37,490
and no injury either to body
or to mind, but when...

912
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:41,763
when the felicities of
rapid motion have been felt...

913
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:47,767
...it must be
a very heavy heart

914
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:50,468
that does not ask for more.

915
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:53,538
It is very dirty inside.

916
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,508
Oh, my dear, my dear,
you are too particular.

917
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,577
By candlelight, it'll be
as clean as Randalls.

918
00:59:58,579 --> 01:00:00,478
We must have a ball.

919
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:04,549
Yes, and when we do,
may I hope for the honor

920
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:07,321
of your hand
for the first two dances?

921
01:00:10,725 --> 01:00:12,692
The Coles are to hold a
supper party in Frank's honor,

922
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:14,796
and perhaps there'll be
dancing there.

923
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:21,801
So, Emma Woodhouse
deigned to accept

924
01:00:21,803 --> 01:00:24,804
an invitation
from the merchant Mr. Cole.

925
01:00:24,806 --> 01:00:28,306
Mr. Churchill will soon
return to Yorkshire.

926
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:30,876
We must make the most of every
opportunity until he does.

927
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,344
"We must."

928
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:33,612
He's in Highbury
only two weeks.

929
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:35,680
And yet he spent a whole day
going to London

930
01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:37,550
just to get his hair cut.

931
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:40,485
16 miles, twice over.

932
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:42,888
He's a trifling, silly fop.

933
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:47,628
Indeed.

934
01:00:55,502 --> 01:00:58,436
Mr. Cole.

935
01:00:58,439 --> 01:01:01,640
Such grand estates you have
in common, gentlemen.

936
01:01:01,642 --> 01:01:02,875
Donwell Abbey.

937
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,744
Enscombe,
soon to inherit, of course.

938
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,679
Soon to inherit Enscombe.

939
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:08,513
Not too soon.

940
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:12,653
I trust your uncle Churchill
is in good health?

941
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:15,522
Uh, excellent health.

942
01:01:39,514 --> 01:01:41,514
And have you heard
the choicest piece of gossip

943
01:01:41,516 --> 01:01:43,849
that has set all the tongues
of the village aflame?

944
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:47,120
A pianoforte, very elegant,
delivered to Miss Fairfax

945
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:49,588
this very morning
with no return address.

946
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,456
I never saw so fine
an instrument.

947
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:55,460
A pianoforte, very elegant,
and with no return address.

948
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,729
No return address.

949
01:01:56,731 --> 01:01:58,731
Jane herself
is quite at a loss.

950
01:01:58,733 --> 01:02:00,833
Quite bewildered to think
who could have sent it.

951
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:02,767
Bewildered, indeed.

952
01:02:12,713 --> 01:02:14,446
Why do you smile?

953
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:15,716
Nay, why do you?

954
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,583
I suppose I smile for pleasure.

955
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:22,587
A pianoforte is
a very handsome present.

956
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:24,689
I rather wonder
it was never made before.

957
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,659
Perhaps Miss Fairfax
has never been

958
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,793
staying here so long before.

959
01:02:28,796 --> 01:02:29,995
Or that Colonel Campbell
did not

960
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,796
give her use
of his own instrument,

961
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:34,667
which must now be shut up
in London untouched by anybody.

962
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,870
She has done her hair
in so odd a way.

963
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:40,507
I never saw anything like it.

964
01:02:41,876 --> 01:02:43,508
Must be a fancy of her own.

965
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,777
I see nobody else
looking like her.

966
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:48,613
If Colonel Campbell
is not the giver,

967
01:02:48,615 --> 01:02:49,748
who can be?

968
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,184
Mrs. Dixon?

969
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:54,954
As a token of her...
her friendship, perhaps?

970
01:02:54,956 --> 01:02:57,190
What say you to Mr. Dixon?

971
01:02:57,192 --> 01:02:58,757
Mr. Dixon?

972
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:00,492
He saved her life.

973
01:03:00,494 --> 01:03:02,427
Did you hear of it?

974
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:04,496
A water party,
and by some accident,

975
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:06,199
she was falling overboard.

976
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:07,766
He caught her.

977
01:03:07,768 --> 01:03:08,903
Huh.

978
01:03:11,672 --> 01:03:13,806
Ladies and gentlemen,

979
01:03:13,808 --> 01:03:15,810
a duet.

980
01:03:18,779 --> 01:03:21,214
What do you say to this, Emma?

981
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:24,950
I have made a match between
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.

982
01:03:26,787 --> 01:03:28,787
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax?

983
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:30,956
This pianoforte's
been sent to her by somebody.

984
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,592
And she has always been
a favorite with him.

985
01:03:33,594 --> 01:03:36,028
Tonight, he sent his carriage
for her as a courtesy

986
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,963
and walked himself.

987
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:40,799
Was that not gallant?

988
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,803
Mr. Weston.

989
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:05,057
♪ Drink to me only

990
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:11,832

01:06:14,389 --> 01:06:16,957
"for in thy sight...

...shall no man living

1001
01:06:38,113 --> 01:06:39,978
He's married.

1002
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,947
It cannot be
a long acquaintance.

1003
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:44,051
He's only been gone six weeks.

1004
01:06:46,187 --> 01:06:49,890
My wife, Mrs. Augusta Elton.

1005
01:07:06,974 --> 01:07:08,874
This house is very like

1006
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:12,677
my brother Mr. Suckling's seat
at Maple Grove.

1007
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:14,679
Very like.

1008
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:18,183
I'm quite struck by
the likeness.

1009
01:07:18,185 --> 01:07:20,119
Is it not astonishingly like,
dear husband?

1010
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,887
Very like.

1011
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:23,822
I really could almost
fancy myself at Maple Grove.

1012
01:07:23,824 --> 01:07:25,124
The staircase as I came in--

1013
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:27,860
I observed how very like
the staircase is.

1014
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:30,165
Placed in exactly the same part
of the house.

1015
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:35,834
I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
it is very delightful to me

1016
01:07:35,836 --> 01:07:39,172
to be reminded of a place
I am so extremely partial to

1017
01:07:39,174 --> 01:07:41,174
as Maple Grove.

1018
01:07:41,176 --> 01:07:43,476
A most impressive residence.

1019
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:46,479
Whenever you are transplanted

1020
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:49,848
like me, Miss Woodhouse,

1021
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,750
you will understand
how very delightful it is

1022
01:07:51,752 --> 01:07:53,051
to meet with anything at all

1023
01:07:53,053 --> 01:07:55,990
that reminds one
of what one has left behind.

1024
01:07:58,926 --> 01:08:01,059
We have been calling
at Randalls.

1025
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:03,762
What pleasant people
the Westons seem to be.

1026
01:08:03,764 --> 01:08:05,831
And who should call in
while we were there?

1027
01:08:06,934 --> 01:08:08,133
Knightley.

1028
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:10,802
Knightley himself.

1029
01:08:10,804 --> 01:08:14,072
Of course, as so particular
a friend of Mr. E's,

1030
01:08:14,074 --> 01:08:16,875
I had a great curiosity
to meet him.

1031
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:19,178
"My friend Knightley"
had been so often mentioned

1032
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,813
that I really was
impatient to see him.

1033
01:08:21,815 --> 01:08:25,884
And I must do
my <i>cara sposo</i> the justice

1034
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:30,323
to say that he need not be
at all ashamed of his friend.

1035
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:32,824
"Knightley."

1036
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:34,759
I could not have believed it.
"Knightley."

1037
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,195
Never met him before
in her life

1038
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:37,362
and calls him "Knightley."

1039
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,532
And to discover
that he is a gentleman.

1040
01:08:39,534 --> 01:08:41,300
Upstart, vulgar being,

1041
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:43,936
with her "Mr. E"
and her <i>cara sposo.</i>

1042
01:08:43,938 --> 01:08:45,204
Emma.

1043
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:47,074
- Mr. Weston.
- Miss Smith.

1044
01:08:48,543 --> 01:08:51,310
The Churchills
have settled at Richmond.

1045
01:08:51,312 --> 01:08:52,945
Here.

1046
01:08:52,947 --> 01:08:54,213
Frank is returning.

1047
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,281
We shall have our ball.

1048
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,987
No. No.

1049
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:04,357
- You are Frank Churchill.
- Oh.

1050
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:06,293
Of course.

1051
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:24,142
You dance so beautifully.

1052
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,316
Oh.

1053
01:09:31,318 --> 01:09:34,052
Oh, this is brilliant, indeed.

1054
01:09:34,054 --> 01:09:36,321
This is admirable.

1055
01:09:36,323 --> 01:09:39,824
Excellently contrived,
upon my word.

1056
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,994
Nothing wanting.

1057
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:44,329
Oh! Miss Woodhouse.

1058
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:46,331
You must really have had
Aladdin's lamp.

1059
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:51,304
This is meeting
quite in fairyland.

1060
01:09:51,306 --> 01:09:53,406
Such a transformation.

1061
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:56,241
Now, where shall we sit?
Where shall we sit?

1062
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:58,411
Oh, now, anywhere where Jane
is not in a draft.

1063
01:09:58,413 --> 01:10:00,145
How do you like my gown?

1064
01:10:00,147 --> 01:10:01,913
- Oh! -
- MISS BATES: Oh, Mr. Elton!

1065
01:10:01,915 --> 01:10:04,317
I do not know whether
it is not over-trimmed.

1066
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:07,853
I have the greatest dislike to
the idea of being over-trimmed.

1067
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:09,322
Quite a horror of finery.

1068
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:11,324
Of course, I must put on

1069
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:14,192
a few ornaments now
because it is expected.

1070
01:10:14,194 --> 01:10:17,396
A bride, you know,
must appear like a bride.

1071
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:20,335
But my natural taste
is all for simplicity.

1072
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:23,869
How do you like Jane's hair?

1073
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:25,871
She did it all herself.

1074
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:27,140
Too wonderful.

1075
01:10:27,142 --> 01:10:29,274
No hairdresser
from London, I think,

1076
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:31,211
could do a finer style.

1077
01:10:41,288 --> 01:10:43,288
Emma,
it has just occurred to us

1078
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:46,659
that Mrs. Elton will expect
to be asked to begin the ball.

1079
01:10:46,661 --> 01:10:49,428
And she will surely think
Frank ought to ask her.

1080
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:51,464
Frank cannot break
his promise to you.

1081
01:10:51,466 --> 01:10:53,432
He's promised you
the first two dances.

1082
01:10:53,435 --> 01:10:54,966
Here's the plan.

1083
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:57,336
I will ask Mrs. Elton.

1084
01:10:57,338 --> 01:11:00,040
The ball is in Frank's honor,
but it's in my design.

1085
01:11:01,443 --> 01:11:03,178
I shall ask her.

1086
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,912
You must submit
to stand second.

1087
01:11:06,914 --> 01:11:10,949
A bride must be first
in company.

1088
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:13,251
It is almost enough
to make me think of marrying.

1089
01:11:13,253 --> 01:11:14,419
Oh.

1090
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,054
Must I go first?

1091
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:18,391
I really am ashamed
to always be

1092
01:11:18,393 --> 01:11:20,861
leading the way.

1093
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:27,532
Gentlemen.

1094
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,257
You have been much missed
in Highbury.

1095
01:11:52,259 --> 01:11:54,027
Have I?

1096
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:04,471
How is your aunt?

1097
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:07,973
Most reluctant to release me.

1098
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:37,035
Do you not dance, Mr. Elton?

1099
01:12:37,037 --> 01:12:39,404
Most readily, Mrs. Weston,
if you will dance with me.

1100
01:12:39,406 --> 01:12:41,274
- Oh.
- Ah.

1101
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:43,241
Well, perhaps...

1102
01:12:43,243 --> 01:12:46,211
There is a young lady
disengaged

1103
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:48,550
whom I should be very glad
to see dancing-- Miss Smith.

1104
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:53,586
Miss Smith.

1105
01:12:53,588 --> 01:12:56,021
If I were not
an old married man.

1106
01:12:56,023 --> 01:12:57,422
But my dancing days are over.

1107
01:12:57,424 --> 01:12:59,494
Mrs. Weston,
you will excuse me.

1108
01:13:12,372 --> 01:13:14,975
Will you dance, Miss Smith?

1109
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,500
Thank you.

1110
01:14:47,502 --> 01:14:49,671
For your kindness to Harriet.

1111
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:56,541
He was unpardonably rude.

1112
01:14:56,543 --> 01:14:59,379
And he aimed at wounding
more than Harriet.

1113
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:04,617
I was completely mistaken
in Mr. Elton.

1114
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:06,619
There is a littleness about him

1115
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:08,590
which you discovered
and I did not.

1116
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:13,491
You would have chosen
for him better

1117
01:15:13,494 --> 01:15:16,161
than he has chosen for himself.

1118
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:20,365
Harriet Smith has some
first-rate qualities

1119
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:23,438
which Mrs. Elton
is totally without.

1120
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:28,773
She does you credit, Emma,
as you do her.

1121
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:30,408
Ah.

1122
01:15:30,411 --> 01:15:32,310
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
Come.

1123
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,478
Set your companions an example.

1124
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,647
They're all lazy.

1125
01:15:34,649 --> 01:15:36,181
They're all asleep!

1126
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:37,482
We must dance another set.

1127
01:15:37,484 --> 01:15:39,454
I am ready
whenever I am wanted.

1128
01:15:42,724 --> 01:15:45,192
With whom will you dance?

1129
01:15:47,362 --> 01:15:48,630
With you.

1130
01:15:50,465 --> 01:15:52,465
If you will ask me.

1131
01:15:52,467 --> 01:15:53,798
You have shown
that you can dance,

1132
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,601
and we are not really so much
brother and sister

1133
01:15:56,603 --> 01:15:58,371
as to make it improper.

1134
01:15:58,373 --> 01:15:59,674
No, indeed.

1135
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:13,386
Stop it.

1136
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:14,587
Stop embarrassing yourself.

1137
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:16,789
I am not embarrassing myself!

1138
01:19:58,479 --> 01:19:59,778
Oh!

1139
01:20:01,782 --> 01:20:03,782
Mr. Churchill. Harriet.

1140
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:05,218
- Oh!
- What has happened?

1141
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,019
She was set upon by some
gypsies as she was coming home.

1142
01:20:07,021 --> 01:20:09,922
When she attempted escape,
she fell.

1143
01:20:09,924 --> 01:20:11,690
She had a cramp.

1144
01:20:11,692 --> 01:20:14,793
- From too much dancing!
- Well, is she hurt?

1145
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:15,828
I didn't see.

1146
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:18,063
I arrived moments after...

1147
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:20,532
...and brought her here.

1148
01:20:20,534 --> 01:20:21,867
I could think of
no other place.

1149
01:20:21,869 --> 01:20:23,668
To the drawing room.

1150
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:26,239
It was on account
of the scissors!

1151
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:27,806
EMMA and MR. KNIGHTLEY:
The scissors?

1152
01:20:27,808 --> 01:20:29,708
- Oh!
- I...

1153
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,948
...borrowed a pair of scissors
from Miss Bates.

1154
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,517
I was halfway home

1155
01:20:38,519 --> 01:20:40,519
when I made the recollection

1156
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:44,689
and so doubled back.

1157
01:20:44,691 --> 01:20:46,525
Whew.

1158
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:56,904
What is your purpose here?

1159
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:02,074
Um, my-my... carriage...

1160
01:21:02,077 --> 01:21:04,043
My... Uh, my horse
threw a shoe.

1161
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,844
You took
your carriage to the ball?

1162
01:21:05,846 --> 01:21:07,280
Yes.

1163
01:21:07,282 --> 01:21:09,848
What might have become of me,
Miss Woodhouse,

1164
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,750
if not for the scissors?

1165
01:21:11,752 --> 01:21:12,853
We must send for Perry.

1166
01:21:14,922 --> 01:21:16,922
Miss Woodhouse.

1167
01:21:18,926 --> 01:21:20,859
I believe I am in love again.

1168
01:21:20,861 --> 01:21:22,861
Mrs. Goddard
should be assured of her safety.

1169
01:21:22,863 --> 01:21:23,963
Yes, and I shall
rouse my father.

1170
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:24,930
We ought to let them know

1171
01:21:24,932 --> 01:21:26,899
that there are gypsies
in the neighborhood.

1172
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:28,635
Yes, let us go at once.

1173
01:21:30,037 --> 01:21:32,305
- Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
- Say nothing more.

1174
01:21:32,307 --> 01:21:34,073
Do not go!

1175
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:36,844
Mr. Churchill.

1176
01:21:38,612 --> 01:21:40,713
Please.

1177
01:21:40,715 --> 01:21:42,014
Stay.

1178
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:52,325
What is the matter?
What has happened?

1179
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:53,993
What... Is she...
is she... is she alive?

1180
01:21:53,995 --> 01:21:55,760
Harriet is unharmed, Papa.

1181
01:21:55,763 --> 01:21:57,162
We have Mr. Churchill to thank.

1182
01:21:57,164 --> 01:21:58,931
Please stay.

1183
01:21:58,933 --> 01:22:01,033
Mr. Knightley
can sound the alarm.

1184
01:22:01,036 --> 01:22:03,635
We will both go.

1185
01:22:03,637 --> 01:22:04,769
Why are we alarmed?

1186
01:22:04,772 --> 01:22:06,771
We have sent for Perry, Papa.

1187
01:22:06,774 --> 01:22:08,773
He's your superior,
no doubt, but...

1188
01:22:08,776 --> 01:22:10,609
but wonderful things
have taken place.

1189
01:22:10,611 --> 01:22:12,177
There have been matches
of greater disparity.

1190
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:15,814
Believe me, I have not
the presumption to suppose.

1191
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:17,182
No, but the service
he rendered you.

1192
01:22:17,184 --> 01:22:18,650
Service?

1193
01:22:20,055 --> 01:22:22,921
The very recollection of it,

1194
01:22:22,923 --> 01:22:25,790
and all that I felt.

1195
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:30,095
His coming to me,
his noble look.

1196
01:22:30,097 --> 01:22:34,535
Such a change in one moment
from misery to...

1197
01:22:38,373 --> 01:22:40,705
...to perfect happiness.

1198
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,207
I was very wrong before.

1199
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:43,942
I will be cautious now.

1200
01:22:43,944 --> 01:22:46,081
I am determined against
any interference.

1201
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:32,858
What is this I hear, dear Jane,

1202
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,893
about your going
to the post office

1203
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:36,261
in the rain last week?

1204
01:23:36,263 --> 01:23:37,930
Why, you sad girl.

1205
01:23:37,932 --> 01:23:39,832
Why would you do such a thing?

1206
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:43,168
I will not allow you
to do such a thing again.

1207
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:45,138
I shall speak to Mr. E.

1208
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,140
The man who fetches
our letters--

1209
01:23:47,142 --> 01:23:49,174
one of our men,
I forget his name--

1210
01:23:49,176 --> 01:23:52,245
shall inquire for yours, too.

1211
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:55,448
Do you suppose Mr. Knightley
might extend us all

1212
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:58,750
an invitation to the abbey,
Miss Woodhouse?

1213
01:23:58,752 --> 01:24:00,886
I love to explore great houses,

1214
01:24:00,888 --> 01:24:04,257
and I fear I have
long exhausted Highbury.

1215
01:24:04,259 --> 01:24:05,991
I'm afraid
Mr. Knightley's concerns

1216
01:24:05,993 --> 01:24:07,692
are all for his tenants

1217
01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:09,228
and none for his house,
Mrs. Elton.

1218
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:11,464
His ballrooms and picture
galleries are quite shut up.

1219
01:24:11,466 --> 01:24:13,932
I should be very glad
to open Donwell

1220
01:24:13,934 --> 01:24:15,834
for your exploration,
Mrs. Elton.

1221
01:24:15,836 --> 01:24:17,736
- The welcome is long overdue.
- Mm.

1222
01:24:17,738 --> 01:24:20,173
I should like that
of all things.

1223
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:22,275
Name your day, and I will come.

1224
01:24:22,277 --> 01:24:24,910
I cannot
name a day until I have spoken

1225
01:24:24,912 --> 01:24:27,146
to some others whom I would
wish to form the party.

1226
01:24:27,148 --> 01:24:29,047
Oh, leave that to me.
It is my party.

1227
01:24:29,049 --> 01:24:30,149
I will invite your guests.

1228
01:24:30,151 --> 01:24:31,984
I hope you will bring Elton,

1229
01:24:31,986 --> 01:24:36,255
but I will not trouble you
to give any other invitations.

1230
01:24:36,257 --> 01:24:37,990
Oh.

1231
01:24:37,992 --> 01:24:40,926
Oh, well, now you are
looking very sly.

1232
01:24:40,928 --> 01:24:43,496
But consider,
you need not be afraid

1233
01:24:43,498 --> 01:24:45,198
of delegating power to me.

1234
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,233
Married women, you know,
may be safely authorized.

1235
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:51,236
There is but one
married woman in all the world

1236
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:52,905
whom I can ever allow

1237
01:24:52,907 --> 01:24:56,041
to invite what guests
she pleases to Donwell.

1238
01:24:56,043 --> 01:24:57,310
Mrs. Weston, I suppose?

1239
01:24:57,312 --> 01:24:59,811
No. Mrs. Knightley.

1240
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:03,684
Until she is in being, I will
manage such matters myself.

1241
01:25:33,113 --> 01:25:35,182
Oh, my heavens.

1242
01:25:40,988 --> 01:25:43,188
Do you not feel transported?

1243
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:46,261
I can hardly believe
that we remain in England.

1244
01:25:55,803 --> 01:25:57,302
And I was to accompany him,

1245
01:25:57,304 --> 01:26:00,805
but the night before his going,
I was struck down by a fever,

1246
01:26:00,808 --> 01:26:02,277
and so I did not go.

1247
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:06,411
Please excuse me.

1248
01:26:06,413 --> 01:26:08,115
Of course.

1249
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,260
There is an excellent prospect

1250
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:23,428
from the south window,
Miss Smith.

1251
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:25,332
May I escort you?

1252
01:26:30,337 --> 01:26:32,237
Jane of course
knows a great deal

1253
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,905
more of the world than I.

1254
01:26:33,907 --> 01:26:35,140
She has been to Ireland.

1255
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,914
Will you...

1256
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:45,318
be so kind when I am missed

1257
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,386
to say that I am gone home?

1258
01:26:47,389 --> 01:26:50,022
If you wish it.

1259
01:26:50,024 --> 01:26:52,359
But you're not going to walk
back to Highbury alone.

1260
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:57,264
- Are you unwell?
- Miss Woodhouse...

1261
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:03,405
We all know at times what it is
to be wearied in spirits.

1262
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:09,344
Mine, I confess, are exhausted.

1263
01:27:29,464 --> 01:27:31,433
Have I missed the party?

1264
01:27:34,269 --> 01:27:35,934
Not at all.

1265
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,871
We're exploring the house.

1266
01:27:41,975 --> 01:27:44,177
I was detained by my aunt.

1267
01:27:44,179 --> 01:27:46,978
A nervous seizure
which lasted some hours.

1268
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,313
Had I known how hot a ride
I should have,

1269
01:27:48,315 --> 01:27:50,015
I believe I should not
have come at all.

1270
01:27:50,017 --> 01:27:52,250
You will soon
be cooler if you sit down.

1271
01:27:52,252 --> 01:27:54,321
Some cold beer, perhaps.

1272
01:27:58,058 --> 01:28:01,026
As soon as my aunt gets well
again, I shall go abroad.

1273
01:28:01,028 --> 01:28:02,295
I'm tired of doing nothing.

1274
01:28:02,297 --> 01:28:04,464
I want a change.

1275
01:28:04,466 --> 01:28:06,199
I'm serious, Miss Woodhouse,

1276
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:08,501
whatever your penetrating eyes
may fancy.

1277
01:28:08,503 --> 01:28:10,503
I'm sick of England.

1278
01:28:10,505 --> 01:28:13,171
You are sick of prosperity
and indulgence.

1279
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:15,173
Cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself

1280
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:17,008
and be contented to stay?

1281
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:19,412
You are quite mistaken.
I do not look upon myself

1282
01:28:19,414 --> 01:28:21,414
as either prosperous
or indulged.

1283
01:28:25,018 --> 01:28:27,154
We're going to Box Hill
tomorrow.

1284
01:28:29,056 --> 01:28:32,492
It is not the grand tour,
but it will be something

1285
01:28:32,494 --> 01:28:36,161
for a young man
so much in want of change.

1286
01:28:36,163 --> 01:28:39,364
Well, if you wish me to stay
and join the party,

1287
01:28:39,366 --> 01:28:41,301
I will.

1288
01:28:52,112 --> 01:28:56,281
How much I am obliged to you
for telling me to come today.

1289
01:28:56,283 --> 01:28:59,284
I had quite determined
to go away again.

1290
01:28:59,286 --> 01:29:01,922
Yes, you were very cross.

1291
01:29:18,038 --> 01:29:22,207
Our companions
are excessively stupid.

1292
01:29:22,209 --> 01:29:24,477
What shall we do to rouse them?

1293
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:27,045
Hmm? Any nonsense will serve.

1294
01:29:27,047 --> 01:29:28,513
Ladies and gentlemen,

1295
01:29:28,515 --> 01:29:31,082
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse
to say that

1296
01:29:31,085 --> 01:29:33,218
she desires to know
what you're all thinking of.

1297
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:37,457
Dear. What we are thinking of?

1298
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:39,792
Is Miss Woodhouse sure
that she would like to know

1299
01:29:39,794 --> 01:29:41,294
what we are all thinking of?

1300
01:29:41,296 --> 01:29:43,228
No, no.
Upon no account in the world.

1301
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,497
It is the very last thing

1302
01:29:44,499 --> 01:29:46,364
I would stand the brunt of
just now.

1303
01:29:46,366 --> 01:29:49,267
It is the sort of thing
which I should not

1304
01:29:49,269 --> 01:29:53,506
have thought myself privileged
to inquire into, as...

1305
01:29:53,508 --> 01:29:56,374
<i>chaperon</i> of the party.

1306
01:29:56,376 --> 01:29:58,243
Very true, my love.

1307
01:29:58,245 --> 01:29:59,512
Very true.

1308
01:29:59,514 --> 01:30:02,247
But some ladies
will say anything.

1309
01:30:02,249 --> 01:30:05,250
Best to pass it off as a joke.

1310
01:30:05,252 --> 01:30:07,352
Everybody knows
what is due to you.

1311
01:30:07,354 --> 01:30:09,522
They are
most of them affronted.

1312
01:30:09,524 --> 01:30:12,325
I will attack them
with more address.

1313
01:30:12,327 --> 01:30:13,526
Ladies and gentlemen,

1314
01:30:13,528 --> 01:30:16,529
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse

1315
01:30:16,531 --> 01:30:18,196
to say that
she waives her right

1316
01:30:18,198 --> 01:30:20,065
of knowing what
you may be thinking of

1317
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:23,134
and only requires something
entertaining from each of you.

1318
01:30:23,137 --> 01:30:24,504
She demands either
one thing very clever

1319
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:27,205
or two things moderately clever

1320
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:30,275
or three things
very dull indeed.

1321
01:30:30,277 --> 01:30:32,310
And she engages

1322
01:30:32,312 --> 01:30:33,846
to laugh heartily at them all.

1323
01:30:33,848 --> 01:30:36,147
Oh. V-Very well, then.

1324
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,351
I need not be uneasy.

1325
01:30:38,353 --> 01:30:41,152
"Three things
very dull indeed."

1326
01:30:41,155 --> 01:30:42,687
That will do just for me.

1327
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:45,156
I shall be sure to say
three dull things

1328
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:46,591
as soon as I open my mouth.

1329
01:30:46,593 --> 01:30:48,528
Ah, ma'am, but there is
the difficulty.

1330
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:51,031
When have you ever
stopped at three?

1331
01:30:57,672 --> 01:30:59,506
Oh.

1332
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:05,547
No. I see what she-she means.

1333
01:31:08,283 --> 01:31:10,448
I shall try to hold my tongue.

1334
01:31:21,896 --> 01:31:23,596
I-I like this plan.

1335
01:31:23,598 --> 01:31:26,599
Uh, agreed, agreed,
agreed, agreed.

1336
01:31:26,601 --> 01:31:28,466
Uh, I shall do my best.

1337
01:31:28,469 --> 01:31:30,735
Um...

1338
01:31:30,737 --> 01:31:33,205
I'm making a conundrum.

1339
01:31:33,207 --> 01:31:34,472
How will a conundrum reckon?

1340
01:31:34,475 --> 01:31:36,609
Low, I am afraid, sir,

1341
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:38,643
but we shall, uh,
be indulgent...

1342
01:31:38,645 --> 01:31:43,616
Mr. Knightley, I must have
made myself very disagreeable,

1343
01:31:43,618 --> 01:31:47,720
or she would not have said
such a thing to an old friend.

1344
01:31:47,722 --> 01:31:50,222
I cannot think
what I have done.

1345
01:31:50,224 --> 01:31:52,425
What two letters

1346
01:31:52,427 --> 01:31:56,329
of the alphabet are there
that express perfection?

1347
01:31:56,331 --> 01:31:59,197
What two letters...

1348
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:00,633
...express perfection?

1349
01:32:00,635 --> 01:32:03,368
I... I'm sure I do not know.

1350
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,937
Well, I shall tell you.

1351
01:32:04,939 --> 01:32:07,205
"M" and "A." "Emma."

1352
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:11,611
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1353
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:13,278
Mr. Weston has shown us how

1354
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,448
to play this game
but also how to end it,

1355
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:17,782
for who can improve
upon perfection?

1356
01:32:17,785 --> 01:32:19,719
I protest, I must be excused.

1357
01:32:19,721 --> 01:32:22,287
I do not pretend to be a wit.

1358
01:32:22,289 --> 01:32:24,689
I really must be allowed
to judge when to speak

1359
01:32:24,691 --> 01:32:26,525
and when to hold my tongue.

1360
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:27,760
Shall we walk, Augusta?

1361
01:32:27,762 --> 01:32:28,828
Most willingly.

1362
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:32,197
I am very tired of exploring
so long on one spot.

1363
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:34,467
Shall we join
Mrs. Elton, ma'am?

1364
01:32:34,469 --> 01:32:36,469
If you please, my dear.

1365
01:32:36,471 --> 01:32:39,406
With all my heart,
I am quite ready.

1366
01:33:35,029 --> 01:33:38,831
How could you be
so unfeeling to Miss Bates?

1367
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:40,733
It was not so very bad.

1368
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:44,737
How could you be so insolent
to a woman of her character

1369
01:33:44,739 --> 01:33:47,339
and-and-and age
and-and situation?

1370
01:33:47,341 --> 01:33:49,341
I dare say she did not
understand me.

1371
01:33:49,343 --> 01:33:50,575
I assure you she did.

1372
01:33:50,577 --> 01:33:51,811
She felt your full meaning.

1373
01:33:51,813 --> 01:33:53,680
She has talked of it since.

1374
01:33:55,582 --> 01:33:57,817
I know there is not a better
creature in the world...

1375
01:33:57,819 --> 01:34:00,352
I wish you could have heard
how she talked of it--

1376
01:34:00,354 --> 01:34:02,521
w-with what candor
and-and generosity.

1377
01:34:02,523 --> 01:34:04,757
You must allow that what is
good and what is ridiculous

1378
01:34:04,759 --> 01:34:06,459
are most unfortunately
blended in her.

1379
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:08,527
They are blended in her,
I acknowledge.

1380
01:34:08,529 --> 01:34:10,663
And were she
a woman of fortune,

1381
01:34:10,665 --> 01:34:12,865
I would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner,

1382
01:34:12,867 --> 01:34:14,499
but she is poor.

1383
01:34:14,501 --> 01:34:16,569
She has sunk from the comfort
she was born to,

1384
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:19,504
and if she lived to an old age,
she will probably sink more.

1385
01:34:19,506 --> 01:34:21,506
- It is too hot, and...
- She has seen you grow up

1386
01:34:21,508 --> 01:34:23,776
- from when her notice of you was an honor.
- And I am tired!

1387
01:34:23,778 --> 01:34:26,545
To have you now,
in thoughtless spirits

1388
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:27,812
and the pride of the moment,

1389
01:34:27,815 --> 01:34:30,549
laugh at her
and-and humble her,

1390
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:32,651
and before her niece
and before others, many of whom

1391
01:34:32,653 --> 01:34:34,719
are entirely guided
by your treatment of her!

1392
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:36,390
It was badly done, indeed!

1393
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:56,374
Go!

1394
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:26,841
I have been
unpardonably vain...

1395
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,912
...and insufferably arrogant.

1396
01:35:33,714 --> 01:35:35,783
I have been inconsiderate...

1397
01:35:37,985 --> 01:35:41,987
...and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling and...

1398
01:36:57,664 --> 01:37:00,532
I'm afraid Jane
is not very well.

1399
01:37:00,534 --> 01:37:02,701
Dreadful headache.

1400
01:37:02,703 --> 01:37:04,671
Writing all morning.

1401
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,740
Such long letters.

1402
01:37:07,742 --> 01:37:10,411
I said, "My dear,
you shall blind yourself."

1403
01:37:12,247 --> 01:37:14,782
I'm so very sorry, Miss Bates.

1404
01:37:16,051 --> 01:37:18,651
Please give Jane
my good wishes.

1405
01:37:18,653 --> 01:37:20,519
You were kept waiting
at the door.

1406
01:37:20,521 --> 01:37:21,553
I was quite ashamed.

1407
01:37:21,555 --> 01:37:24,089
No, you... you see,
there was a little bustle,

1408
01:37:24,091 --> 01:37:26,259
for it so happened
we did not hear the knock,

1409
01:37:26,261 --> 01:37:27,760
and until you were
on the stairs,

1410
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:29,864
we did not know
that anybody was coming.

1411
01:37:42,009 --> 01:37:43,878
So very kind.

1412
01:37:47,848 --> 01:37:50,985
But you are always kind,
Miss Woodhouse.

1413
01:37:58,059 --> 01:37:59,892
Ah, Emma.

1414
01:37:59,894 --> 01:38:01,860
How did you find them?

1415
01:38:01,862 --> 01:38:03,628
Emma has been to call on

1416
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:05,630
Mrs. and Miss Bates,
Mr. Knightley.

1417
01:38:05,632 --> 01:38:08,669
She is always
so attentive to them.

1418
01:38:09,937 --> 01:38:11,603
I...

1419
01:38:11,605 --> 01:38:14,807
I regret I cannot stay, sir.

1420
01:38:14,809 --> 01:38:17,078
We will miss you
in the evening.

1421
01:38:25,552 --> 01:38:27,052
Goodbye, Emma.

1422
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:55,082
What has happened?

1423
01:38:56,784 --> 01:38:59,118
Mrs. Churchill is dead.

1424
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,020
Dead?

1425
01:39:01,022 --> 01:39:03,989
Yes, we-we always thought
her illness

1426
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:06,058
was invented, but...

1427
01:39:06,061 --> 01:39:07,993
Emma.

1428
01:39:07,995 --> 01:39:09,828
Frank was here
this very morning

1429
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:12,765
on the most
extraordinary errand.

1430
01:39:12,767 --> 01:39:15,102
It is impossible
to express our surprise.

1431
01:39:16,837 --> 01:39:19,074
Frank and Jane Fairfax
are engaged.

1432
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:22,674
What?

1433
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:24,676
There's been a solemn
engagement between them

1434
01:39:24,678 --> 01:39:26,179
ever since October.

1435
01:39:26,181 --> 01:39:28,949
Formed at Weymouth and kept
a secret from everybody.

1436
01:39:30,985 --> 01:39:32,653
What? Um...

1437
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,154
Engaged?

1438
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:37,156
Before either of them
came to Highbury?

1439
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:39,392
Secretly engaged.

1440
01:39:39,394 --> 01:39:41,827
Of course,
had his aunt heard of it,

1441
01:39:41,829 --> 01:39:43,695
she would have
cut him off, but...

1442
01:39:43,697 --> 01:39:45,198
It has hurt me, Emma,
very much.

1443
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,234
It has hurt his father equally.

1444
01:39:51,138 --> 01:39:53,206
He sent the pianoforte.

1445
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:55,142
He has confessed it.

1446
01:39:56,844 --> 01:39:58,877
Emma, you must know

1447
01:39:58,879 --> 01:40:01,048
it was our darling wish.

1448
01:40:02,917 --> 01:40:05,050
Oh, no, no.

1449
01:40:05,052 --> 01:40:06,854
Not for me.

1450
01:40:12,127 --> 01:40:15,660
I'm so very sorry, Harriet.

1451
01:40:15,662 --> 01:40:18,864
But why should you condole me?

1452
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:23,136
You do not think I care about
Mr. Frank Churchill?

1453
01:40:23,138 --> 01:40:26,872
There was a time,
and not very distant, either,

1454
01:40:26,874 --> 01:40:28,874
when you gave me reason
to believe

1455
01:40:28,876 --> 01:40:31,144
- that you did care about him.
- Him?

1456
01:40:33,048 --> 01:40:34,779
Never.

1457
01:40:34,782 --> 01:40:37,682
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
how could you so mistake me?

1458
01:40:37,684 --> 01:40:39,751
Harriet, wh-what do you mean?

1459
01:40:39,753 --> 01:40:41,753
I should not have
thought it possible

1460
01:40:41,755 --> 01:40:45,158
that you could have
misunderstood me.

1461
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,063
But you told me that
greater things had happened.

1462
01:40:49,897 --> 01:40:52,030
That there had been matches
of greater disparity.

1463
01:40:52,032 --> 01:40:53,899
Those were your very words,
Miss Woodhouse.

1464
01:40:53,901 --> 01:40:55,767
Harriet.

1465
01:40:55,769 --> 01:40:58,103
Let us understand
each other now

1466
01:40:58,105 --> 01:41:00,707
without possibility
of further mistake.

1467
01:41:02,776 --> 01:41:05,043
Are you speaking
of Mr. Knightley?

1468
01:41:05,045 --> 01:41:06,914
Of course.

1469
01:41:08,849 --> 01:41:11,850
- But...
- I thought you knew.

1470
01:41:11,852 --> 01:41:14,287
But the service
Mr. Churchill rendered you

1471
01:41:14,289 --> 01:41:16,088
i-in protecting you
from the gypsies.

1472
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,923
Oh, no.

1473
01:41:17,925 --> 01:41:20,828
It was not the gypsies. No.

1474
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:26,066
I was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance.

1475
01:41:28,269 --> 01:41:32,804
Of Mr. Knightley's coming
and asking me to dance.

1476
01:41:32,806 --> 01:41:35,276
When Mr. Elton
would not stand up with me.

1477
01:41:38,313 --> 01:41:40,247
Good God.

1478
01:41:42,317 --> 01:41:45,218
And have you any idea
of Mr. Knightley's

1479
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,019
returning your affection?

1480
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:48,956
I must say that I have.

1481
01:41:51,025 --> 01:41:55,162
He has shown me sweetness
and kindness.

1482
01:41:57,831 --> 01:42:01,534
And at Donwell, he took
great pains to describe to me

1483
01:42:01,536 --> 01:42:05,370
some particulars of the
management of his tenant farms.

1484
01:42:05,372 --> 01:42:08,742
We were interrupted,
but before we were...

1485
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:12,945
...he seemed almost
to be asking me

1486
01:42:12,947 --> 01:42:15,849
if my affections were engaged.

1487
01:42:16,917 --> 01:42:19,318
Yes, but is it possible

1488
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:22,355
that he might have been
alluding to Mr. Martin?

1489
01:42:22,357 --> 01:42:25,226
That he might have had
Mr. Martin's interest in view?

1490
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:35,100
You think of Mr. Knightley
for yourself.

1491
01:42:35,102 --> 01:42:37,805
Harriet.

1492
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:41,039
I-I do not flatter myself

1493
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:42,943
with any idea
of his attachment to me.

1494
01:42:46,013 --> 01:42:47,282
Harriet.

1495
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:54,387
I should have considered it
too great a presumption

1496
01:42:54,389 --> 01:42:56,989
even to think of him
but for you.

1497
01:42:56,991 --> 01:42:59,224
Harriet.

1498
01:42:59,226 --> 01:43:04,029
I know that he is the last man

1499
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:06,199
who would intentionally give
any woman the idea

1500
01:43:06,201 --> 01:43:09,835
of his feeling more for her
than he does, so...

1501
01:43:09,837 --> 01:43:12,172
if you believe...

1502
01:43:14,109 --> 01:43:15,876
...he loves you...

1503
01:43:18,178 --> 01:43:21,750
I refused Mr. Martin
because of you.

1504
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:26,787
Because...

1505
01:43:28,188 --> 01:43:29,391
Harriet.

1506
01:44:06,461 --> 01:44:08,163
Emma!

1507
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,942
Mr. Knightley.

1508
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:28,980
Have you heard the news?

1509
01:44:28,982 --> 01:44:30,515
Miss Fairfax
and Frank Churchill.

1510
01:44:30,517 --> 01:44:32,385
I did not see it.

1511
01:44:32,387 --> 01:44:34,920
But then I seem to have been
doomed to blindness.

1512
01:44:34,922 --> 01:44:37,022
Time, my dearest Emma...
time will heal the wound.

1513
01:44:37,024 --> 01:44:38,957
He will soon be gone.

1514
01:44:38,959 --> 01:44:40,393
You will forget him.

1515
01:44:40,395 --> 01:44:44,331
You are very kind,
but you are mistaken.

1516
01:44:45,999 --> 01:44:47,500
My blindness
to what was going on

1517
01:44:47,502 --> 01:44:50,435
led me to act in a way that
I must always be ashamed of,

1518
01:44:50,437 --> 01:44:53,271
but I have no other regret.

1519
01:44:53,273 --> 01:44:56,274
With respect to...

1520
01:44:56,276 --> 01:44:58,245
Mr. Churchill.

1521
01:44:59,481 --> 01:45:02,482
He is a disgrace
to the name of man.

1522
01:45:02,484 --> 01:45:05,283
And is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman?

1523
01:45:05,285 --> 01:45:09,324
Jane, Jane...
you'll be a miserable creature.

1524
01:45:11,558 --> 01:45:13,291
Everything turns out
for his good.

1525
01:45:13,293 --> 01:45:16,027
His-his aunt is in the way,
his aunt dies.

1526
01:45:16,029 --> 01:45:17,430
He uses everybody ill,

1527
01:45:17,432 --> 01:45:19,965
and-and-and they're delighted
to forgive him.

1528
01:45:19,967 --> 01:45:22,169
He is a fortunate man, indeed.

1529
01:45:23,971 --> 01:45:25,438
You speak as if you envied him.

1530
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,508
And I do envy him.

1531
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,476
Emma.

1532
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:35,482
In one respect,
he is the object of my envy.

1533
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,360
You will not ask me why.

1534
01:45:47,362 --> 01:45:49,462
You are... you-you are...

1535
01:45:49,464 --> 01:45:52,532
you are determined, I see,
to have no curiosity.

1536
01:45:52,534 --> 01:45:55,066
You are wise.

1537
01:45:55,068 --> 01:45:56,601
But I cannot be wise.

1538
01:45:56,603 --> 01:46:00,005
I must tell you, Emma,
what you will not ask,

1539
01:46:00,007 --> 01:46:01,574
though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.

1540
01:46:01,576 --> 01:46:03,510
Oh, then do not speak it.

1541
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:19,524
If you wish to speak to me...

1542
01:46:19,526 --> 01:46:21,226
as a friend

1543
01:46:21,228 --> 01:46:23,596
or to ask my opinion...

1544
01:46:23,598 --> 01:46:25,330
as a friend,

1545
01:46:25,332 --> 01:46:27,065
I will hear whatever you like.

1546
01:46:27,067 --> 01:46:29,402
"As a friend." Emma, that,
I fear, is a word...

1547
01:46:29,404 --> 01:46:32,472
Tell me, Emma.

1548
01:46:32,474 --> 01:46:35,242
Have I no chance
of ever succeeding?

1549
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:37,642
My dearest Emma,

1550
01:46:37,644 --> 01:46:39,644
for dearest you will always be,

1551
01:46:39,646 --> 01:46:42,315
my dearest, most beloved Emma,
tell me at once.

1552
01:46:42,317 --> 01:46:44,584
I cannot make speeches.

1553
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:46,519
If I...

1554
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:48,186
If I... if I loved you less,

1555
01:46:48,188 --> 01:46:50,823
then I might be able
to talk about it more,

1556
01:46:50,825 --> 01:46:52,625
but y-y-you-you...

1557
01:46:52,627 --> 01:46:54,327
you know what I am.

1558
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:57,395
I have... I have lectured you,

1559
01:46:57,397 --> 01:47:00,633
and I've...
I've blamed you, and...

1560
01:47:00,635 --> 01:47:03,268
and you have borne it
as no other woman in England

1561
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:04,669
could have borne it.

1562
01:47:04,671 --> 01:47:07,507
God knows I have been
a very indifferent lover.

1563
01:47:07,509 --> 01:47:09,074
But you understand me.

1564
01:47:09,076 --> 01:47:11,011
You-you understand my feelings.

1565
01:47:17,084 --> 01:47:18,419
Will you marry me?

1566
01:47:22,089 --> 01:47:23,221
Oh.

1567
01:47:23,223 --> 01:47:24,357
Emma.

1568
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:27,159
Oh.

1569
01:47:27,161 --> 01:47:28,493
Emma.

1570
01:47:28,495 --> 01:47:31,129
- Oh.
- Emma.

1571
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:32,197
Oh.

1572
01:47:32,199 --> 01:47:33,566
- Emma.
- Uh, no, I...

1573
01:47:33,568 --> 01:47:35,233
- Emma.
- Oh.

1574
01:47:35,235 --> 01:47:37,537
No, I...

1575
01:47:37,539 --> 01:47:40,138
I...

1576
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:42,140
I-I cannot.

1577
01:47:42,142 --> 01:47:43,508
Why not?

1578
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,609
Harriet!

1579
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:46,479
- Harriet? Wh...
- She's in love with you!

1580
01:47:46,481 --> 01:47:48,581
And she believes that you may love her, too.

1581
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:51,449
And... and you danced with her!

1582
01:47:51,452 --> 01:47:53,553
- Oh. Oh.
- And shown her kindness

1583
01:47:53,555 --> 01:47:56,421
and took notice of her
at Donwell

1584
01:47:56,423 --> 01:47:59,394
and spoke of farming and...

1585
01:48:02,196 --> 01:48:03,663
And seemed on the verge
of asking

1586
01:48:03,665 --> 01:48:05,230
if her affections were engaged!

1587
01:48:05,232 --> 01:48:07,265
To Robert Martin!
To Robert Martin!

1588
01:48:07,267 --> 01:48:08,466
She told you this?

1589
01:48:08,469 --> 01:48:11,236
I cannot break her heart again.

1590
01:48:11,238 --> 01:48:13,638
I shall... I shall
call on Robert Martin

1591
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,173
this very evening.

1592
01:48:15,175 --> 01:48:16,441
I shall urge him
to put his suit

1593
01:48:16,443 --> 01:48:18,143
to Miss Smith a second time.

1594
01:48:18,145 --> 01:48:19,579
He still loves her.
I'm certain that he does.

1595
01:48:19,581 --> 01:48:20,913
He need only ask again.

1596
01:48:20,915 --> 01:48:22,480
Not-not by letter,
but in person.

1597
01:48:22,483 --> 01:48:25,350
No.

1598
01:48:25,352 --> 01:48:27,488
No, I must do it.

1599
01:48:31,358 --> 01:48:33,160
I must go.

1600
01:49:16,671 --> 01:49:18,605
Mr. Martin...

1601
01:49:20,407 --> 01:49:22,342
...I have a confession to make.

1602
01:49:24,278 --> 01:49:27,546
I have caused you
great suffering.

1603
01:49:27,548 --> 01:49:30,485
As I have also caused
the suffering of my friend.

1604
01:49:32,787 --> 01:49:35,522

Mr. Robert Martin
has offered me his hand.

I have accepted.

1616
01:50:26,841 --> 01:50:30,277

man of my acquaintance.

There is something else.

1619
01:50:43,725 --> 01:50:46,360
I have had a letter
from my father.

1620
01:50:48,362 --> 01:50:51,566

he has revealed himself.

1621

He is a tradesman.

1622
01:50:56,336 --> 01:50:58,871
In Bristol.

1623
01:50:58,873 --> 01:51:00,808
He makes galoshes.

1624
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:08,382
He comes to Highbury next week
on purpose to meet with me.

1625

bring him to Hartfield.

Do you feel a draft,
Mr. Knightley?

1645
01:52:56,523 --> 01:52:59,024
About the knees.

1646
01:52:59,026 --> 01:53:02,761
I-I cannot say that I do, sir.

1647
01:53:02,763 --> 01:53:03,965
Ah.

1648
01:53:05,632 --> 01:53:07,367
Pity.

1649
01:53:10,905 --> 01:53:12,372
In fact...

1650
01:53:13,574 --> 01:53:14,807
Yes.

1651
01:53:14,809 --> 01:53:16,641
- A chill draft.
- Chill.

1652
01:53:16,643 --> 01:53:18,211
The screen. Bartholomew!

1653
01:53:18,213 --> 01:53:19,680
Charles, make haste.

1654
01:53:20,982 --> 01:53:23,048
No, not that... This one.

1655
01:53:40,635 --> 01:53:42,536
No, not that one. This one.

1656
01:53:44,505 --> 01:53:46,874
How could I ever leave him?

1657
01:53:50,945 --> 01:53:53,045
He can remove with you
to Donwell.

1658
01:53:53,048 --> 01:53:55,614
You know he never would.

1659
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:57,418
He could not stand it.

1660
01:53:58,519 --> 01:54:00,454
Then I shall come here.

1661
01:54:04,059 --> 01:54:05,690
You would quit the abbey?

1662
01:54:05,692 --> 01:54:07,826
Yes.

1663
01:54:07,828 --> 01:54:10,629
Sacrifice your independence?

1664
01:54:10,631 --> 01:54:12,265
Yeah.

1665
01:54:12,267 --> 01:54:16,269
And live constantly with my
father in no house of your own?

1666
01:54:16,271 --> 01:54:17,905
Yeah.

1667
01:54:20,075 --> 01:54:23,744
Uh, h-how
is it now, Mr. Knightley?

1668
01:54:26,081 --> 01:54:28,580
