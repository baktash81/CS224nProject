1
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,808
Folks are blessed who make
the best of every day

2
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:22,562
Living by
their own philosophy

3
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:29,944
Everyone beneath the sun
must find a way

4
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:36,533
And I have found
the only way for me

5
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:45,709
I don't believe in
frettin' and grievin'

6
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:49,003
Why mess around with strife

7
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:55,509
I never was cut out
to step and strut out

8
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:58,846
Give me the simple life

9
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:05,810
Some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant

10
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:09,522
Those things
roll off my knife

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,654
Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes

12
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:19,531
Give me the simple life

13
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:25,078
A cottage small
is all I'm after

14
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,041
Not one that's spacious
and wide

15
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:35,463
A house that rings
with joy and laughter

16
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,509
And the one you love
in sight

17
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,471
Some like the high road

18
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,474
I like the low road

19
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,019
Free from the care
and strife

20
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:57,274
Sounds corny and seedy
But, yes, indeedy

21
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,194
I like the simple life

22
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:28,303
Life could be thrilling
with one who's willing

23
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:31,722
To be a farmer's wife

24
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:38,687
Kids calling me Pappy
would sure make me happy

25
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:42,149
Give me the simple life

26
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:48,947
Some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant

27
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,283
Those things
roll off my knife

28
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:59,248
Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes

29
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:03,293
Give me the simple life

30
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,776
Nina, come on. They're gonna
be here any minute.

31
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,820
Okay. We'll be right down.

32
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,624
Father of the bride.

33
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,585
I never thought I'd say this, but that
whole experience Pas a piece of cake...

34
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:53,339
compared to the roller coaster
I've been on this past year.

35
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,549
I admit it took me a while
to recover from the wedding,

36
00:03:55,716 --> 00:04:01,054
but eventually life got back
to normal, which is exactly
the way I prefer life to be.

37
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:05,850
After the dust settled, I began
to realize what a lucky guy I was.

38
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,853
I had a wonderful home
filled with memories,

39
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,980
and completely paid for;

40
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:14,358
a wife I love just as much
as the day I married her;

41
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,569
a daughter, independent,
self-sufficient,

42
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,113
married, working, happy;

43
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,824
a son blossoming
in the middle of middle school;

44
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,410
and a son-in-law
gainfully employed,

45
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:29,038
and very often,
out of town on business.

46
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,499
Life was sweet.

47
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:35,377
I felt for the first time
ahead of the game.

48
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,421
Then it dawned on me.

49
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:41,133
I was a mere five years
away from freedom.

50
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,970
Soon I'd be a father with one kid
married and the other off in college.

51
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,388
And that started me
thinking.

52
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:50,641
What was I gonna do
with all that free time?

53
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:55,396
Anything I wanted.

54
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,273
Maybe I'd take up
fly-fishing,

55
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,818
travel to exotic places,
climb Mount Everest.

56
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:05,113
I was feeling
on top of the world.

57
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,284
And that's when
they lowered the boom on me.

58
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,663
It was like that old joke:
''All those who think they have
it made, take one step forward.

59
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:17,207
Not so fast, George Banks.''

60
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,751
It was about a year ago
when it all started.

61
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:25,590
Well, nine months ago
to be exact.

62
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,139
I was on my way home from work
on a perfect fall day.

63
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,434
The leaves were golden.
The air was crisp.

64
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:40,604
And I couldn't help thinking
what a charmed life I was leading.

65
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:46,109
Yep, I was a happy man.

66
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,338
Hey, hey!

67
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,299
- Hey, Dad, you hear the news?
- What news?

68
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:13,509
- I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.
- Matty, phone!

69
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:16,720
- Got it!
- Who wouldn't tell you?

70
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,724
- Hey.
- Hi, George.

71
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,726
Do you think it's
what we think it is?

72
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:24,978
What? What? What is it?
Somebody tell me what's going on.

73
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:27,063
Bryan called and said
to be here at 6:00 sharp,

74
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,316
that he and Annie have
some important news to tell us.

75
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:35,821
This is one of those moments,
George. I can feel it.

76
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,823
Oh, my.

77
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,997
Hi, honey. Oh, don't worry,
okay? I'm sure nothing's wrong.

78
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,999
- How do you know?
- Well, I, I know.

79
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,543
- Oh, you know?
- No. I don't-- I don't really know.

80
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,629
I just know nothing's wrong.
Now, come on. Come on inside.

81
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,798
- Can I fix you a drink, George?
- No, thanks.

82
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,175
Nina, you don't think Annie's
been transferred back East, do you?

83
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:02,679
No, honey. Something tells me
this has nothing to do with work.

84
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:05,640
George. George. You sure
you don't want a glass of wine?

85
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,684
'Cause she always said
a transfer was a possibility.

86
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,686
And I, for one,
would hate it if they moved.

87
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,647
Really, George? You?

88
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,690
Well, they live
far enough away as it is.

89
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,233
Dad, they live
a mile from here.

90
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:18,152
Well, you know, with
the traffic and everything.

91
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:22,697
Oh, there they are. I just--
I just don't wanna hear
the word ''Boston,'' that's all.

92
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,699
I mean, you know what's
gonna happen, don't you?

93
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:26,785
First, they're gonna promise
to come home for long weekends.

94
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,289
Then it'll be a week every other summer.
Next thing you know, we're strangers.

95
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:34,083
We're just names on
a Christmas card list.

96
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,545
We'll be those relatives
out in California.

97
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,423
Bummer Man, he delivers.

98
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,383
- Hello?
- We're here.

99
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,553
- Hi!
- Hello!
- Hi!

100
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,972
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

101
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,182
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, son.

102
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,436
There she was, my Annie.

103
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,356
Every time I saw her, I had to remind
myself she was a married woman.

104
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,485
To me, she still seemed
like a kid playing house.

105
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,072
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, hon.

106
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,574
- How are you?
- Good!

107
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,450
Are you feeling all right?

108
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:15,246
Of course she's feeling all right.
Look at her. She never looked better.

109
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:19,791
- Hi, Dad.
- Are you okay?
- I was a little late.

110
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,169
So, any news at work?
Any-- Any news? Any anything?

111
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,588
- No, everything's great.
Same, but good.
- Same.

112
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,048
- Busy.
- Busy.

113
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,466
See?

114
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,842
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

115
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,969
George. Sorry, George.

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,223
As long as the big news wasn't that
my daughter was moving 3,000 miles away,

117
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,893
her husband could call me
anything he wanted.

118
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:45,023
In spite of myself, I had
actually begun to grow somewhat
fond of Bryan MacKenzie.

119
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,152
Those hors d'oeuvres
look so great. I'm starving.

120
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,364
Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,075
So what is it, Annie?
What's the news?

122
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,203
- Well, don't you wanna eat first?
- Come on. Tell us. What is it?

123
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:01,455
- I know what it is.
I got it. I'm positive.
- What?

124
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:04,457
You bought a house, right? A place
you can remodel a little closer to home?

125
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,335
- A house? Is that it?
- Well--

126
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,295
Well, no, no, no, no.
A house is fine.

127
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:11,923
Oh, yeah, of course,
a-- a house is definitely good.

128
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:15,718
That's the big news? A house? Man, I
thought you guys were gonna have a baby.

129
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:20,180
- Oh, get outta here.
- Us too.

130
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,349
I know. Me too.
That's what I thought.

131
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,559
That's what
we were hoping for.

132
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,270
- Well--
- Tell 'em.

133
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:31,858
Your wish came true.
I'm gonna have a baby!

134
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,693
- We're pregnant!
- Oh!

135
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:49,123
- Congratulations.
- Oh, this is so--
- Thanks.

136
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,378
I never liked
that Bryan MacKenzie.

137
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:57,673
Not from the moment
I laid eyes on him.

138
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:01,468
Here my little girl was playing house,
and he had the nerve to--

139
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:05,972
- George.
- What do you say, Dad?

140
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,600
Congratulations.

141
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,602
You too.

142
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,863
Congratulations.

143
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,949
- Oh!
- Grandpa!

144
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:31,329
''Grandpa''? First that runt
steals my daughter, now he
makes a grandpa out of me.

145
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:39,836
The baby is due July 26, and I like that
'cause that's a good even number.

146
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:42,172
Of course, it is
going to be very hot.

147
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,718
But I'm sure she's not
gonna mind. Oh, God. Oh, George.

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,056
Can you believe the same doctor
who delivered Annie is going
to be delivering her baby?

149
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:55,226
- Oh, honey. It's so amazing.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,979
Oh, George!
I have a great idea.

151
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:02,566
What if Franck did
the baby shower for us?

152
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:06,277
- Franck?
- As a favor, honey. George.

153
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,947
What? I thought
you liked Franck now.

154
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,574
- I never actually said
I liked the man.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

155
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,701
When we were at that party
with those people from whatcha-callit,

156
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:15,744
- you were just raving on about him.
- All right. Well, maybe it slipped out,

157
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,162
but I didn't mean it.

158
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,373
Nina, get a grip.
I'm not gonna go into hock...

159
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:20,666
to give Annie a baby shower.

160
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,375
I just finished
paying for the wedding.

161
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:25,587
Oh, now my stomach hurts.
Where'd you put my Tums?

162
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,465
All right, honey. Okay. Okay, okay.
It was just a thought. Calm down.

163
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,134
What's the matter with you anyway?
You didn't say a word during dinner.

164
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,596
- You're acting as if
you're not happy about this.
- Who's acting?

165
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:39,892
Oh, I see. You're not happy that your
daughter is going to be having a baby?

166
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:43,478
That's right, Grandma.
I'm not.

167
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,898
- Why?
- Well, for starters,
they can't afford a baby.

168
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:48,524
- Oh! Oh.
- Babies cost money.

169
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,610
And the older they get,
the more they cost.

170
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:53,112
I mean, they didn't plan for this.
They don't have a nest egg.

171
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,572
They-- They
barely have a nest.

172
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,825
How are they gonna fit a baby
into that shoe box they live in?

173
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:01,286
Really, George. They have more money
than we had at their age.

174
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,955
Also, what do they know
about raising a kid?

175
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,043
Annie's just a kid herself. I
mean, she graduates college and
marries the first guy she meets.

176
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,921
And now to get saddled with a baby
even before her career takes off.

177
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:14,632
Why must I always be the only
feminist in this family?

178
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,634
You know, I just
realized something.

179
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,052
I'm four-foot-six.
I don't shave.

180
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:22,055
I don't have a job,
and I'm gonna be an uncle.

181
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,850
Is there somethin'
weird about that?

182
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,062
Finally, someone
who thinks like I do.

183
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,938
Oh, yeah,
a 12 year old.

184
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,569
Hello? Oh. Sally!

185
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:41,198
Oh, Sally, hi. I have
the best news. Guess what.

186
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:44,409
This is so exciting.

187
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,911
I'm gonna be a grandmother.

188
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:50,123
- Poor Nina. The woman was
obviously living in denial.
- Yeah. I know.

189
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,833
- I, for one, wasn't ready
to be a grandfather.
- I know. Yeah.

190
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,877
What was so grand
about it anyway?

191
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,546
George? Oh, he's thrilled.

192
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:00,674
- Grandfathers wore
cardigans and hearing aids.
- In fact, um, I was just
telling him that...

193
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,759
-I wore baseball caps and running shoes.
-the same doctor who delivered Annie--

194
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:06,971
Sure I may have been a little
out of shape, but I was still young.

195
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,390
And I could prove it.

196
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,613
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

197
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:29,367
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

198
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,036
Oh, yeah! Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

199
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,663
- Whoa.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

200
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,790
You better
take it easy there, Pops.

201
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,380
Oh! Ow!

202
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,278
Oh, hang on a second.

203
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,322
- You got the list?
- I got it right here. Are you okay?

204
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:13,074
- Yeah, I'm fine. Shoot.
- Okay.

205
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,743
- The following men are older than you:
- Go.

206
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,870
- Paul McCartney;
- Yeah.
- Rod Stewart;
- Yeah.

207
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,329
- Jack Nicholson.
- Jack Nicholson?

208
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,748
Oh, by eight years.
You're much younger than Jack Nicholson.

209
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:24,084
Well, you can't get any cooler than Jack
Nicholson. That's a good one. Go on.

210
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,461
- Okay. Mick Jagger;
- Yeah.
- Robert Redford.
- Really?

211
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:29,130
-Mm-hmm. Bob Dylan; Warren
Beatty; and Bill Clinton.
-Really?

212
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:32,925
- But only by 31 days.
- Hey, younger is younger.

213
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,804
- Oh, when the saints
- Hi. Here's what I'm thinkin'.

214
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,472
- Go marchin' in
- I wanna look younger.

215
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,057
- You know, I think maybe
something, you know, in here.
- Oh, when the

216
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,642
- Saints go marchin' in
- Like the hair, it's really too square.

217
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:44,519
- I'm just kind of-- you know.
- I want to be

218
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:47,272
- A little stickied up,
you know. Kinda hip!
- In their number

219
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:51,317
- Easy.
- When the saints go marchin' in

220
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:56,655
Oh, when the sun
refuse to shine

221
00:14:56,822 --> 00:15:01,618
Oh, when the sun
refuse to shine

222
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:05,914
I still wants to be
in their number

223
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:09,417
- When the sun refuse to shine
- Young, right?
- Oh, totally.

224
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,128
- It's bitchin'.
- Oh, when the saints

225
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,296
- Go marchin' in
- Bitchin'.

226
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:18,717
Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in

227
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:22,971
I'm going to sing
as loud as thunder

228
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:28,184
Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in

229
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:33,272
Hi.

230
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,154
Hi.

231
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,823
Well, hi.

232
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,510
At last

233
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,893
My love has come along

234
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:21,066
My lonely days

235
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,068
Are over

236
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:30,074
And life is like a song

237
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,705
Oh, yeah, yeah

238
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,166
At last

239
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,132
- The skies above are blue
- Oh! George. George!

240
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,717
- George, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

241
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,428
- Oh! Oh, George.
- Hey, what do you think?
Can you tell the difference?

242
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,181
Can I tell the difference? What
did you do? ls it-- Is it permanent?

243
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,725
It is if you want it to be. The new,
permanent, young and improved...

244
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,269
- and stronger, I might add,
George Stanley Banks.
- I

245
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,938
- I love you
- I look like the guy
you married, right?

246
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,857
- Kind of.
- Hey, don't kid yourself.

247
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,026
It makes you look
younger too, you know?

248
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,029
- Hey, where's Matty?
- Matty's eating at Cameron's.

249
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,115
Huh. All alone. Hmm.

250
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:19,328
Just you and me
at the old house.

251
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:24,499
- May I ask you what
possessed you to do this?
- To call my own

252
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:27,919
- I found a thrill
- Just wanna look the way
I feel, that's all.

253
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:29,379
- Oh. What?
- Ava loved it.

254
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,340
- Who's Ava?
- Oh, just the girl
who did it, that's all.

255
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:34,884
She said it took years
off my face.

256
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:36,927
You know, Nina,
you're very beautiful.

257
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,513
- Oh. George.
- You are so very beautiful.

258
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,722
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:43,975
Thank you, honey. Oh!

260
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,061
- My. What's in the bag?
- Oh!

261
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:50,398
I got you something totally great.
I found it at Victoria's Secret.

262
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:54,318
- Oh, God, George.
- I opened a charge
for you there, by the way.

263
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:57,279
Huh? What-- What are you--
Are you crazy, honey?

264
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:01,616
-I'm not-- I'm not wearing that.
I am a grandmother, okay? I--
-You're-- You're--

265
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,160
- You're not my grandmother, are you?
- No.

266
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:07,705
- For you are mine
- Well, George, what's
gotten into you, honey?

267
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,334
Hey, can't a man make love
to his wife without something
having gotten into him?

268
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,462
Well, what do you mean,
make love?

269
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:18,340
What do you think I mean?
Hmm?

270
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:27,557
My, my, my. This is
a new and improved George Banks.

271
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:54,123
Hey, hey, hey. Didn't we just pay
900 bucks to have this roof fixed?

272
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,792
I swear to God, this house
is starting to fall apart.

273
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:01,254
First, the heating went, then the gas
thing broke and the plumbing froze.

274
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:05,091
I don't know, sometimes I, I
think I would just like to wash
my hands of this whole thing.

275
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,969
George, what is it?
What-- What are you thinking?

276
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:11,514
- I have a brilliant,
beyond-brilliant idea.
- Uh, yeah?

277
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:14,767
- I say we sell this dump.
- Right.

278
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,852
- I'm serious.
- George, what? Are you crazy?

279
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,937
Honey, last year you said
you wanted to be buried in the backyard.

280
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:21,231
Now you're telling me
you wanna sell the place?

281
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,192
Nina, listen. Matty's
in school every day 'til 6:00.

282
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,486
You're at work. I'm at work.
You know, let's get rid of it.

283
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:30,823
Let's not be so by-the-book,
you know. Let's-- Let's be
adventurous. Let's loosen up.

284
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,368
I don't know. I mean,
if we sold the place, then
we won't have room for the baby.

285
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:38,247
What ''we,'' kemo sabe?
It's not our baby. lt doesn't
need its own room in our house.

286
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:41,792
- Well, what about Matty?
- Oh, like Matty wouldn't
love living at the beach?

287
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:45,587
The-- Oh! The beach?
Mr. Sunscreen?

288
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:48,172
Please, George. I mean,
now you wanna live at the beach?

289
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,300
Hey, you're the one who always
said that one day before you're
old you wanna live by the ocean.

290
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,761
- I know, but--
- I'm telling you,
this, this leak is an omen.

291
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:55,721
You know, we could sell
this place in a second.

292
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,265
I mean, it's the Leave It To Beaver
house that everybody wants.

293
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,435
You know, we'd have enough money to buy
a condo. You know, we could get a boat.

294
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,062
We could travel. And I could get
that Harley I always wanted.

295
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:08,358
Harley? Honey. Oh, George. This
has been a very big day for you.

296
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:13,279
First your hair,
and then this, uh, thing.

297
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,991
I just-- I think we should
think about things, okay?

298
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:19,076
Okay. But will you
think about it, really?

299
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,913
- Well, will you wash that stuff
out of your hair, really?
- Yeah.

300
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,623
Okay, I'll make ya a deal.

301
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,666
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,419
If one more thing goes wrong with
this house, we'll put it up for sale.

303
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,046
You have my word on it.

304
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:39,469
As luck would have it, termites
attacked two weeks later.

305
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,810
So we decided to give it a test run,
see if we got any nibbles.

306
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:53,983
Four weeks went by
and not a single nibble.

307
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,568
All right, here we go.
Here we go. Here.

308
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,196
- Check.
- Ball in. Come on. Let's go.

309
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,781
What are you doing? What are
you doing? Hey! Where you going?

310
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,408
- Spin move.
- Whoa! Hey! What? Hey!

311
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,452
- Come on. No. No!
- Yes!

312
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:09,831
Then one Saturday morning,
we got a bite. A big bite.

313
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:14,502
George, I'd like you
to meet Mr. and Mrs. Habib.

314
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:18,005
Hello. How do you do? Nice to
meet you. This is my son Matty
and his friend Justin.

315
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:22,092
- We like house very much.
When you can move out?
- Excuse me?

316
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,512
The Habibs would like to buy
the house, George. It's exactly
what they've been looking for.

317
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,723
Yes, when you can move? We need
house a week from Wednesday.

318
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:31,475
And my wife wants
flower dishes in kitchen.

319
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:36,480
- You sell, we pay top dollar.
- For the house, top dollar?

320
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:41,610
Dishes. For the dishes. For the house,
we pay what you ask and no more.

321
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:45,322
But we need house a week
from Wednesday or no deal.

322
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:50,034
Gee, that's, uh-- That's ten days
from now. That's kinda quick.

323
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,286
We've lived here 18 years.
I don't know if we can get every--

324
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,419
Excuse, please?

325
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:08,885
Uh, you explain that I pay big money
if he sell now. Very big bonus.

326
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:13,639
Mr. Habib is willing
to pay a generous bonus...

327
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,934
for whatever inconvenience moving
too quickly may cause you, George.

328
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:19,061
Dad, you better
discuss this with Mom.

329
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,276
- How generous?
- Would, uh,

330
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:30,279
$15,000 be generous enough?

331
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:33,783
- We may be making real estate
history here, George.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,203
One, two,

333
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:40,247
three thousand,

334
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,125
four, five, six,

335
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,836
seven thousand--

336
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,048
I shook the man's hand and
promised to be out in ten days.

337
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:57,471
Careful with the dishes.

338
00:22:57,513 --> 00:23:01,516
Only problem was, I didn't
have the nerve to tell Nina.

339
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:06,229
Wonderful champagne, George.
Dom Perignon. What are we celebrating?

340
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:10,066
I know. That's what I was wondering.
What are we celebrating, dear?

341
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:14,278
Well, it's just the first time
the whole family's been together
since the baby and everything.

342
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:17,948
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Oh, honey.
- Thanks, Dad. That's sweet.

343
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:19,366
Oh.

344
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:22,828
So tell us, have you thought of
any names for the baby yet?

345
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:28,124
Well, if it's a boy, we like
Cody, Cooper, Riley or Wyatt.

346
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,544
- Wyatt? As in Earp?
- Yeah.

347
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:34,713
- Y-You don't like it, Dad?
- Well, I like it better than Cooper.

348
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,757
- Or Riley.
- Hey, what if it's a girl?

349
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,885
For a girl,
our favorite name is Chloe.

350
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,430
- Chloe? Ooh.
- Chloe? It's not even American.

351
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:47,267
Th-Thank you, Matthew. We realize that.
We-- We also like Phoebe and Sophie.

352
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:49,310
And we're still debating
between Lucy and Fanny.

353
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,270
Y-You're not considering
any family names?

354
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:55,900
Yes, isn't the first son supposed to be
named after the paternal grandfather?

355
00:23:55,983 --> 00:24:00,070
Well, he doesn't have to be named John,
of course. Any name on my side will do.

356
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:03,406
We have an Andrew in the family.
A Melville. A Jacob.

357
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:06,159
Uh, Jake is a great name.

358
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:09,412
Hey, you know what. They don't need any
more suggestions. Their list is fine.

359
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:13,791
You're absolutely right, George.
Anything is fine as long
as it goes with MacKenzie.

360
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:17,419
Uh, wait a minute. I thought the
baby's last name was gonna be
Banks-MacKenzie with a hyphen.

361
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,254
- Wasn't that the deal?
- Would you like to go through life...

362
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,256
with the name
Cooper Banks-MacKenzie?

363
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,924
Kid's gonna sound
like a law firm.

364
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,468
It's an awfully long
last name, George.

365
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:28,388
Hold on. What are we saying?
You're not gonna hyphenate the
last name? When did this happen?

366
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,431
Nothing's been decided yet, Dad.
It's just that...

367
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:33,392
we think two last names is a lot
for a little kid to deal with.

368
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,811
And since neither of us
want to forfeit our names,

369
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,772
we've been coming up
with alternative last names.

370
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:41,817
Your baby's gonna have an alternative
last name? Like, what, Smith or Jones?

371
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:44,944
- No.
- No, because you can't
make Smith or Jones from
the letters of our last names.

372
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,197
- Right.
- So--
- I don't understand.
What names can you make?

373
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:50,825
Well, the ones we like best
are Zineman, Zenkman and Mannis.

374
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,660
Oh, my.

375
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:56,080
Are you telling me I might have
a granddaughter named Sophie Zenkman?

376
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,458
- Yeah.
- Look, look. I have
a simple solution here.

377
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,378
George, Nina. You already have
Matty to carry on the family name.

378
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,215
So, why don't we drop this
Banks-MacKenzie business and...

379
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,842
just go with MacKenzie?

380
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,888
- Or drop the MacKenzie.
- Oh, well, now wouldn't that be silly?

381
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,307
Well, I don't think that's any
sillier than dropping the Banks.

382
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,975
- Well, I would venture
to suggest that MacKenzie...
- Well, I do.

383
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,560
- is a good, solid family name.
- I mean, traditionally, you take--

384
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,687
I mean, the baby's just as much
a Banks as it is a MacKenzie, isn't it?

385
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,940
- Traditionally--
- Dad, say something.

386
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,151
- I just don't agree with that.
- Change the subject.

387
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,695
- MacKenzie is--
- Hey, guess what.
I sold the house today.

388
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:34,657
- What did you say, dear?
- Nina, I forgot to tell you.

389
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:37,993
While you were at the market
this morning, I sold the house.

390
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:40,662
Well, congratulations, Gramps.
Where are you movin'?

391
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:44,666
Well, we don't know exactly for
sure where yet, but, uh, we're
thinking of maybe the beach.

392
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,918
- We don't know exactly
for sure where yet?
- What?

393
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:49,504
But, George, we haven't
even started looking.

394
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:52,214
You sold the house? Dad.

395
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:54,842
- Why is she crying?
- Well, because I never thought...

396
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,970
they were serious
about selling the house.

397
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,848
I'm sorry, Dad, but I just thought it
was another goofy idea like your hair.

398
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,184
- Hey.
- I never thought you were
actually gonna go through with it.

399
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:08,229
- I love this house.
- Well, wow!

400
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:10,523
I guess I just assumed
we'd have a little more warning.

401
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,610
But what do we have?
We have at least 90 days before
we have to move. Am I right, George?

402
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:18,072
Oh, believe me, Nina, you can jack up
an escrow six months, if you need to.

403
00:26:18,238 --> 00:26:21,158
- Matty, what's going on?
- May I be excused?

404
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:25,537
No. No, sir.
You may not be excused.

405
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,915
- George!
- The guy paid me $15,000 extra
to be out in ten days.

406
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:32,501
The guy paid you $15,000 extra
to be out of the house in ten days?

407
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:35,296
- I hope you took it, George.
- He did.

408
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:39,716
- And he threw in Mom's favorite
dishes just to close the deal.
- George!

409
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,735
Nina was less than thrilled
about our abbreviated escrow.

410
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:02,487
But being the great woman
that she is, she went with the flow...

411
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:07,450
and even allowed me back into
our bedroom for our last night
at 24 Maple Drive.

412
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:11,370
And since we had nowhere to
live, she also arranged for us
to stay at the MacKenzie's...

413
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,998
- while they took a Caribbean cruise.
- Honey.

414
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:17,876
Honey, are you sure you don't
want me to take your picture by
your favorite part of the fence?

415
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,629
No, no, I'm fine.

416
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:25,008
Oh, okay-- Oh. Whoa.

417
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:27,552
Hey, Nina, are you okay?
I mean, you don't look so good.

418
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,637
I know. I don't
really feel so good.

419
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,974
I-I just didn't think I'd get
so emotional about this whole thing.

420
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:35,017
I don't know.
I feel kind of dizzy.

421
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,896
You guys, these are from the tree
that we carved our initials...

422
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:41,189
- in out back.
- Oh!

423
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:43,233
- Here. Here.
- Oh!

424
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,193
Oh, Mom, did you get
a picture of the tree?

425
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,029
- Oh, just a roll, honey.
- Okay.

426
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:51,449
- Oh.
- Hey, Matty, what's that?
- My doorknob.

427
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:54,577
I want to keep a memento
from my room.

428
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:55,911
- Oh!
- Oh!

429
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:58,372
Hey, what are we,
the Schmaltz family?

430
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,250
Come on. No more tears.
We're on to bigger and better things.

431
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:06,087
I mean, who needs
this old shack? Look at it.

432
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,347
Dad, there's one more thing
we have to do before we go.

433
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,515
I'm not gonna dig up
that parakeet from the backyard.

434
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:20,559
That's not
what I was thinking.

435
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:26,731
How many times do you think
we've played out here?

436
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:29,192
About a thousand.

437
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,489
- I remember our very first game.
- Me too.

438
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:48,042
- I remember you were four.
- Here you go. Here you go.

439
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,086
You had a red ribbon
tied in your hair.

440
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,886
Dad!

441
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:02,973
Look, Dad,
I can dribble. Watch.

442
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,017
That's my girl.
That's my girl.

443
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:07,393
Hey.

444
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:05,280
Sorry to interrupt.

445
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,573
Oh, uh, hi.

446
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:12,328
- You got the key, George?
- Yeah, I-- Uh, I have it right here.

447
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:16,165
Uh. I got it.
I know I have it.

448
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,625
Oh, uh, Mr. Habib,
this is my daughter Annie.

449
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,211
Uh, she had her wedding here
at this house.

450
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,505
Ah, yes. The key?

451
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,382
Oh, yeah. I got it.
Somewhere.

452
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,510
Did I give that to you?
Ah, okay. Oh, sorry.

453
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,933
So, well, here you are.
And, uh, here you go.

454
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,644
- She's all yours.
- Good luck, Banks.

455
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:41,563
Uh, you too.

456
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:56,994
Well.

457
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:04,626
- Ah, what perfect timing. We were
just about to depart ourselves.
- Hi, Nina.

458
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:06,961
- Are you-- Are you in a hurry?
- Oh, not at all. No.
We have plenty of time.

459
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,630
- Oh, thanks so much.
- Welcome. Come on in.

460
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,673
- Oh, it's our pleasure.
- Welcome. Welcome.
Make yourselves at home.

461
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,633
- Come in, please.
- Are you sure?
- Where's Matty?

462
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,009
- Oh, he's sleeping at a friend's.
- I'll tell you what. The dog food's...

463
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:15,344
- all in the refrigerator and marked.
- That's nice.

464
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:18,097
- Uh, uh, you remember
the dogs, of course?
- Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:24,144
- Fortunately, they forgot you.
- Oh.

466
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,479
Come here, you angels.

467
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:33,027
I'm gonna miss you guys.

468
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,446
- See, George? They're
completely harmless.
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,990
Get ahold of yourself. Now, listen,
I want you to pay attention...

470
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:41,535
to your Uncle George and
your Aunt Nina now, all right?

471
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:43,787
Bye, fellows.

472
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,373
Oh, all right.
One more kiss, you maniac.

473
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:55,422
- John!
- Wow.
- All right.

474
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,258
- We're off.
- Well, good-bye.
- Oh! Oh.

475
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,302
- Oh, well.
- That's what the limo was for.

476
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,679
- Help yourself to anything
you see. We'll call you.
- Got the tickets, honey?

477
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:04,306
- They're all yours.
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye-bye.

478
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:06,391
- Enjoy.
- Thanks so much.
- I've got everything, sweetheart.

479
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:09,894
And when you get through with
that limo, send it back for us.

480
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:15,524
Oh. Oh, George.

481
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:19,778
Honey, do something.
They look sad.

482
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:22,072
Hey, guys.
Don't worry about a thing.

483
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:25,617
- Uncle George is here--
- Oh, George.

484
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:29,203
All right. Now, just take it easy, guys.
He's not gonna hurt you.

485
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:32,373
- Cute. Cute.
- Well, as it turned out,
the dogs did remember me.

486
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:35,084
Hey, puppy, puppy, puppy.

487
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:40,881
It was going to be a long night.
Just the four of us
in the old MacKenzie mansion.

488
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:44,301
Hey, listen to this. Luxury
beach condo. Marina views.

489
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:48,012
Stroll along winding streams
past lush landscaped gardens.

490
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:51,349
Honey, are you sure you didn't
pack the Pepto-Bismol?

491
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:53,351
Why? You still feel sick?

492
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:56,270
I can't seem to shake this thing.
I just don't feel right.

493
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:59,731
You just need a good night's sleep.
That's all. Tomorrow--

494
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:04,778
- Oh.
- Tell 'em to get off.

495
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:08,656
Okay, come on, guys.
Get off. Let's go. Off.

496
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:11,450
Come on. Off.
Come-- Oh, forget it.

497
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:14,954
I gotta-- I gotta lay down.
Just come on. Let's move over.

498
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,457
That's a good dog. Oh!

499
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,917
What am I supposed to do?
Sleep standing up?

500
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,961
I don't know, honey.
Just push 'em off.

501
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,089
All right, boys. Hey, come on, come on.
Now, now, fun's over. Let's go.

502
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,132
Come on. Get off the bed.
Off the bed. Now, come on.

503
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,093
Come on. I-I don't
wanna have to get tough.

504
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,512
So just come on. Let's go!
I mean it. Amscray!

505
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,098
Off the bed! Come on! Off!

506
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,686
- Oh.
- Get your filthy paw
off my wife, you good--

507
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,067
Oh, forget about it. It's their house.
Let 'em have the bed.

508
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,236
I'll-- I'll go stay in one
of the other seven bedrooms.

509
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:54,949
Oh, but, honey, I don't
wanna be left alone in this
big room. I don't feel good.

510
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,284
Fine. I-I'll sleep
on the floor. Huh?

511
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,828
Thanks.

512
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:07,585
Oh, I know. I have an idea.
What if after they fall asleep,
you just lift them off?

513
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,048
Oh, yeah, of course. I'll just
lift 'em off. What are you, nuts?

514
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,091
- Could you hand me a pillow?
- Yep.

515
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:46,830
Oh, I'm so naive.

516
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:49,916
Oh, I know
what's wrong with me.

517
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,918
What? What's
wrong with you?

518
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:54,837
It's so obvious. I don't know
why I didn't realize it before.

519
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:58,799
Honey, I'm going
through menopause.

520
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:04,220
Oh, Nina. You can't be going
through menopause. My mother
went through menopause.

521
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:06,931
Well, exactly,
and probably at my age.

522
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:09,392
George, I have
all the symptoms.

523
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:12,895
I'm late. I'm weepy all
the time. I'm hot and dizzy.

524
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,565
- Don't be silly. We're still so--
- But, George, honey, we're not.

525
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,650
We're not as young
as you think we are.

526
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:22,446
Just because we're getting
older, it doesn't mean that
we're old. This is the '90s.

527
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:26,324
Growing old isn't what
it used to be. Well, it's true.

528
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:30,703
Women my age are doing Geritol ads
and Fixodent commercials.

529
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,998
- Nina.
- They are.

530
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:37,668
And guess who I saw on
the cover of Longevity magazine.

531
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:40,712
- Guess.
- Barbara Bush.

532
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:42,839
Peggy Lipton.

533
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:48,636
From The Mod Squad?

534
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,890
This is reality, George.
Do me a favor, will ya, honey?

535
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:55,768
Stop acting like
this isn't happening.

536
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:59,146
- Oh, do I have to?
- Yes! Yes.

537
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:06,653
George. George. You haven't been
the same since the day you
found out Annie was pregnant.

538
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:11,157
Now, I know you, and I know it takes you
a long time to work these things out.

539
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:15,119
- But I miss the old George.
- Must you use that word?

540
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:19,414
All right. I miss the adorable
George Banks I used to be married to.

541
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,960
Honey, you got me worried. I don't know.
You dyed your hair. You sold our house.

542
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:26,629
- What's next, a 19-year-old girlfriend?
- Nina!

543
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,756
Well, men do those kinds
of things, George.

544
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,968
They don't wanna grow old with their
wives, so they get-- I don't know.

545
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:36,347
New wives. Young wives.
Just--

546
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:41,601
- Nina.
- What, honey?

547
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:46,356
- What?
- I may dye my hair, and I may
wanna move to the beach and...

548
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:49,442
- Yeah?
- I may hate the idea that
I'm gonna be a grandfather,

549
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:53,070
but never for one millisecond
of one day...

550
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:55,739
did I ever not wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

551
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:58,784
- Really?
- Really.
- Really?

552
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:02,579
And I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk.

553
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:08,167
- Oh, that's okay. I'm used to it.
- Yeah.

554
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,169
- Good night.
- Good night.

555
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,677
The doctor didn't give you
any indication of why
he wanted me to come with you?

556
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:21,138
-No.
-But he didn't say there was
anything to be concerned about?

557
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:23,723
No. I mean, I assume this is
absolutely routine. I don't know, honey.

558
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,476
I've never been through
menopause before, you know.

559
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,479
He probably just wants to tell us
what to expect un-- well, unless--

560
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:32,064
- Unless what? What? Unless what? What?
- Well, unless...

561
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:36,026
something showed up on my
blood test that was too horrible
to tell me over the phone,

562
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,654
and he wanted you here for
support in case I flipped out.

563
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,697
- You know, and he just, like--
- Nina, well, what did
the man say exact--

564
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:43,909
- Well--
- What were his words?
- Just that...

565
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,078
he thought it would be wise for us
to come in together as soon as possible.

566
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,163
That's all.
Okay, here we are, honey.

567
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:53,793
I'm sure I'm gonna be fine.
I hope.

568
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,754
I'd never seen Nina
so unglued.

569
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:59,923
I wasn't used to being
the calm one.

570
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:02,092
I didn't know what the doctor
was about to tell us.

571
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:07,931
But nothing, absolutely nothing,
could've prepared me for what
I was about to hear.

572
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:10,391
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know.

573
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:15,729
Nina, George.

574
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:23,945
- Well, we ran a panel on Nina's blood.
- Nina.

575
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,156
- What?
- Whatever it is, I just want
you to know I'm here for you.

576
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:28,408
- And you can count on me.
- Okay.

577
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,118
We're gonna get
through this together.

578
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,619
- Okay?
- Okay.

579
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:36,957
So, uh, tell us. Uh, what is it?
We can handle it.

580
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:40,627
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

581
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,383
Nothing that won't go away
in nine months.

582
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,052
Kids, you're gonna
have a baby.

583
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,481
- Excuse me?
- Nina's pregnant.

584
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:05,316
- Oh, my God.
- Pregnant?

585
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:12,156
- And who, may I ask, is the father?
- George!

586
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,450
Don't ''George'' me,
you two-timing Mata Hari.

587
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,452
I swear, we haven't
done it in six weeks.

588
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:19,329
I haven't just felt myself
lately, but pregnant?

589
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,248
How could this happen,
Nina Dickerson?

590
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,167
Why are you calling me
by my maiden name, you big jerk?

591
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,545
And, what do you mean we haven't
done it in six weeks? What about
that little escapade in the kitchen?

592
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:31,674
Oh, please. That was
a stupid nothing. I mean, that
was a moment of pure insanity.

593
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:33,843
Would you like to know
how many moments of pure insanity...

594
00:39:33,968 --> 00:39:36,804
I've delivered
over the last 20 years?

595
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:40,432
Phil, look at me.
I'm about to be a grandfather.

596
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:43,268
Things like this
do not happen to men my age.

597
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:46,229
Come on! Picasso had children
well into his seventies.

598
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,481
Ah, well, you know, Picasso.
I mean, Picasso.

599
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,275
I mean, there-- He's the one guy in
history who had kids into his seventies.

600
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,986
But, you know, he's an artist.
He can do anything he wants.

601
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm just-- You know,
I'm just a, a regular Joe.

602
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:59,575
You know, regular Joes don't
have, have babies at my age!

603
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:03,203
You know, I was-- I was just
adjusting to being a grandfather!

604
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,497
Preg--

605
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:07,624
Oh! Oh, my God!

606
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:12,295
- All right. Here you go, Mr. Banks.
- Oh, I'm all right.
- George?

607
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,505
- Now, wait a minute.
- Here. Let me help. I'll help.
- I'm okay.

608
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,466
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
- Let's see if you got
your sea legs back yet.

609
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,509
- Sorry about that. I'm just, uh--
- The shock.

610
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:21,887
- I know.
- Anyway, thank you.

611
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,389
- Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.
- I know, honey. Me too.

612
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:29,060
I just-- God. I can't
believe it, huh? Yikes!

613
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,563
Well, you don't think he could be like,
you know, wrong or something, do you?

614
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:36,775
I don't think he used a
home pregnancy test, George. No.

615
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:40,904
Honey, this is definitely like
I'm-- This is happening, George.

616
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:44,824
I know it's a lot to deal with,
but we'll just-- we'll just
let it sink in, all right?

617
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:48,244
- Good idea.
- Okay. Mom's the word, huh?

618
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:50,371
Did she say,
''Mom's the word''?

619
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:53,707
Oh, man. This was a life curve
I was not ready for.

620
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:58,003
''Grandmother Has Baby.'' It was like
a National Enquirer headline.

621
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:02,507
One would have thought nothing on earth
could have topped this moment.

622
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:05,719
- Wrong again.
- It's the musk oil smell
that scares me.

623
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:07,762
- Oh, well.
- Oh!

624
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:09,430
- Oh, my God, the Banks!
- Oh, my gosh.

625
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,600
And my favorite
father of the bride.

626
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:14,560
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello!

627
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,645
- Great. Wonderful. You
look wonderful. Mr. Banks.
- Oh. Look at you!

628
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,189
- Chop, chop, chop.
Oh, you look beautiful.
- How are you, sir?

629
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:23,735
Imagine running into you here of all
places. This is our home away from home.

630
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:28,114
Well, I am always fixing, you know.
A nip, a tuck, a little suction.

631
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:30,867
You know, I look in the mirror
and I say, ''Hello. Looking sad.''

632
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:34,703
So I come down here, I valet
park, and bongo, Cher Bono.

633
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,831
So how 'bout you? Nothing is wrong,
I hopes? Your health is good?

634
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,083
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're--
We're good. We're perfect.
- Oh, yeah, it's good. It's great.

635
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,043
- We're healthy and,
uh, nothing to report.
- Very healthy.

636
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:44,087
- Nothing at all.
- Great.
- Oh, well.

637
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,547
- Oh.
- Mrs. Banks.

638
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,757
- Huh?
- You forgot your prenatal vitamins...

639
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:50,510
and all your pamphlets
on becoming a mommy again...

640
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,595
- and the ultrasound photo.
- Oh.

641
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,055
Your baby's first picture.

642
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,725
- Oh, no.
- Baby's first picture? Don't--

643
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,937
- Don't tell me you are pregnant?
- No?
- Yeah. I am.

644
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,980
- Oh, my God!
- I know. I just found out.

645
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:09,652
Oh, I love that so much! Mother of
the bride and a mommy! Get out of town!

646
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,530
- Oh, mazeltov, Mrs. Banks!
- And guess what.

647
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,323
- What?
- Annie's pregnant too.

648
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,659
- Oh, no!
- I didn't hear that!

649
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,913
Mother and daughter are
pregnant together? Oh!

650
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,582
That is fabulous!
I love that ! That's chic.

651
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:28,795
- I think I'm gonna faint.
- He did.

652
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:31,797
This is what I suggest. You must
let me do the baby shower.

653
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:34,884
- Howard, hands me the book.
Quick. Quick, boy.
- Oh!

654
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,846
No, no, Franck. Not this time.
No more parties. No way. N-O.

655
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:42,015
You never wants to have fun,
George. And you never change.

656
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:44,893
Every party has a pooper
That's why we invited you

657
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:47,979
- Party pooper
- Party pooper

658
00:42:48,104 --> 00:42:52,066
Every party has a pooper
That's why we invited you George Banks

659
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,485
- That's you
- It was on the second chorus...

660
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,738
of ''Every party has a pooper''
that I got woozy again.

661
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:01,825
Next thing I knew, we
were driving through town.

662
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:04,536
Nina was glowing.

663
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,622
She looked so peaceful.

664
00:43:07,705 --> 00:43:11,959
Grab your coat
and get your hat

665
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:16,338
Leave your worries
on the doorstep

666
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:19,841
- You can't get me!
- Just direct your feet
- Slow down, son!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, son!

667
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:25,138
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- To the sunny side of the street

668
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:29,267
Can you hear
the pitter-pat

669
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:33,562
- Yeah, that happy tune he's whistlin'
- George?

670
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:37,691
- Nina?
- Honey, I need to know how
you feel about all this.
- Life can be so sweet

671
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,944
- Dad, I want a hot dog!
- On the sunny side of the street

672
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,072
- They don't have any hot dogs!
They don't have hot dogs!
- I don't like--

673
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:48,660
Don't! Josh! No! No! No!

674
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:51,913
I feel super about it.
I'm totally up for it.

675
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,666
- You are?
- Definitely.

676
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,709
Oh!

677
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:10,555
So what do you think? You think we have
the stamina to have a baby?

678
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,431
What do you mean, honey?
For the actual pregnancy?

679
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:15,392
- Well, I know I have
the stamina for that part.
- Oh, well. That's a relief.

680
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:18,270
I'm talking about the rest of it,
like the next 18 years part.

681
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:20,647
But, George, for weeks you've been
telling me how young you are.

682
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:23,567
- And you've been telling me
how old we are.
- Well, we're obviously
not too old, honey.

683
00:44:23,608 --> 00:44:27,487
Well, Nina, let's be honest. I
mean, just because a man wears sneakers,
it doesn't make him a teenager.

684
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:31,532
I was completely kidding myself.
When I was working out at the gym, there
were 60 year olds more buff than me.

685
00:44:31,616 --> 00:44:33,492
Oh, so we're too old for this. ls that
what you're trying to tell me, George?

686
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:35,494
No, it's just that I was beginning
to feel like we were approaching...

687
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:37,496
that big parenting
finishing line.

688
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,706
Now to be all the way back
at the starting gate?

689
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,251
Not to mention, we will be
like the oldest parents ever
at the starting gate.

690
00:44:43,293 --> 00:44:46,629
I mean, let's face it. Between us,
we're almost a hundred years old.

691
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:48,673
But don't get me wrong.
I'm into it.

692
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:53,094
3:00 a.m. feedings and diapers and car
seats and Mister Rogers and vomiting.

693
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:57,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

694
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:01,059
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

695
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:02,727
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

696
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,437
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Everything go okay?

697
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:08,066
Oh. Oh.

698
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,776
So what's going on?
What'd the doctor say?

699
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:12,236
Is that, uh, TV still on the blink?
Because I have time now, I--

700
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,530
- Dad.
- Okay.

701
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:18,742
- Well, he, uh--
- Mom, you can tell me. I'm a big girl.

702
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:22,704
Well, honey, as it turns out,
my, my blood tests are fine.

703
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:25,874
- Good.
- Yeah. And I'm not even
going through menopause.

704
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:28,793
- I thought you were too young for that.
- Yeah, well, I don't know.

705
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,878
So what is it?
Did he find anything?

706
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,466
Well, actually, he did, didn't he?
He did find a little something.

707
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:37,760
He did? What?

708
00:45:37,843 --> 00:45:41,972
Believe it or not,
your father and I--

709
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:45,517
- We're going to have a baby.
- We're pregnant!

710
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:50,396
You guys!
That is so unfunny.

711
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:53,524
I mean, can you imagine
if that were true?

712
00:45:53,566 --> 00:45:55,943
I mean, you couldn't be.

713
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:02,949
You're serious?
You're really pregnant?

714
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,452
I'm due September 4,
Labor Day.

715
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:08,663
Perfect timing, huh? Labor Day.
You know, we should go now.

716
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:11,624
- Mom, you're pregnant?
- Well, honey.

717
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:14,418
It's not something we planned. Sometimes
these things, they just happen.

718
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:18,088
Who knew? You know,
it was a rainy afternoon.

719
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:22,300
And, uh, your mom and I were
all alone in the house.

720
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:27,639
Then, uh, one thing leads to another.
And then the next thing you know, hey.

721
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:32,685
- Daddy!
- At that moment, I wanted to
crawl under the sofa and die.

722
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,728
You old son of a gun.

723
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:37,564
''Son of a gun''?
I wish I had a gun.

724
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:40,692
If it wasn't for this kid
coming into our lives, none of
this would ever have happened.

725
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:42,777
- It's okay.
- Gee, I don't know what to say.

726
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:45,947
- That's okay.
- I just never thought we'd both
be pregnant at the same time.

727
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:49,242
- Yeah, well.
- I'm not crying because I'm
sad, really, because I'm not.

728
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,244
- No. What's-- Well--
- I gotta get a Kleenex.

729
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,872
Annie? Oh.
Annie, don't-- Don't cry, honey.

730
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:57,082
She's been kind of
emotional lately.

731
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:01,920
So, our kids will be what?
Not brother and sister. That's wrong.

732
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:06,091
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Their kid will be your brother
or sister and our kid's cousin?

733
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:08,051
No, your kid's
uncle or aunt.

734
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:11,179
Yeah, but our kid will probably
be more comfortable calling us
Grandma and Grandpa...

735
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:13,514
just like your kid, you know, at
least in front of his friends.

736
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:17,518
You know, 'cause let's face it.
We're gonna be in our fifties
when he's in preschool.

737
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,395
In our sixties,
when he graduates college.

738
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:23,398
But, you know, that'll be great
to see another kid in cap and gown,

739
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,025
you know, if we can
still see by then.

740
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,820
Now, at least going to the movies,
that'll be economical.

741
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:31,822
''One child, two seniors.
Thanks.''

742
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:35,326
Kid's gonna love spending
his adolescence in a retirement home.

743
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,870
At least he won't have to worry
about us hearing him come in late.

744
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:41,248
That's right, honey, because
we won't be able to hear, right?

745
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,625
Exactly.

746
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:46,711
You're so hilarious, George. You're so
hilarious. You're so sensitive.

747
00:47:46,794 --> 00:47:51,424
And I really appreciate you
asking me how I feel about
all this, especially since...

748
00:47:51,465 --> 00:47:53,843
I'm the one who's going
to be having the baby.

749
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:58,263
You're right.

750
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:01,058
How do you feel about it?

751
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:06,312
I know how old I am, George. I've
already been the mother of the bride.

752
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:10,316
But here I am at the age I am,
and I'm pregnant.

753
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:14,945
And, you know, I don't
think that qualifies me for
the Guinness Book Of Records, George.

754
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:20,158
So in answer to your question,
I'm very happy!

755
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,619
I'm happy and
I'm feeling nervous...

756
00:48:22,744 --> 00:48:27,582
and I'm just
very much alone.

757
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:30,460
Well, anyway,
good-bye, sweetie.

758
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:34,255
I've gotta go. Yeah.
And thank you so much, Bryan.

759
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:36,298
Thank you. Thank you.

760
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:47,892
Do me a favor.
Don't follow me, Banks! No!

761
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,943
I went after her,
but it didn't do much good.

762
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:02,197
I called her, but she refused
to pick up the phone.

763
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:04,866
Calling me ''Banks''
was never a good sign.

764
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:10,705
Fortunately, my daughter was kind enough
to put her old man up for the night.

765
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:26,261
But I couldn't sleep.

766
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:29,222
I was worried I wouldn't
have what it takes,

767
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,474
that I wouldn't be the same
for the next one.

768
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:47,864
- Okay? I miss you.
- Yes.
- Okay.

769
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:52,576
Okay, gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss. I love you.

770
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,790
Bye, Daddy. I love you.

771
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,833
Go up and see Mommy.

772
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,632
I love you, Daddy.

773
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:24,356
Sorry, Maple Drive's closed.
You'll have to use the detour.

774
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,289
- My house!
- Bye-bye, house.

775
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:45,041
Bring it back!

776
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:51,714
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop!

777
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,009
Stop! Stop that ball!
Stop it! Stop that!

778
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:59,054
Hey, stop! Stop. Stop!

779
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:01,765
- Stop! Stop, stop!
- Stop!

780
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:06,519
- Stop! Stop! Stop.
- Hold, please!

781
00:51:09,772 --> 00:51:12,024
- Hang on, guys!
- You have a problem, George?

782
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:15,694
Mr. Habib, you didn't tell me
you were gonna tear down the house.

783
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:20,198
- You didn't ask.
- I didn't ask because it just
never entered my mind.

784
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:22,868
But since you obviously don't want
the house, I have the perfect solution.

785
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:25,870
Sell the house back to me! I still have
your check here in my wallet.

786
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:28,373
- I never even cashed it.
- I don't think so, George.

787
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:33,669
See, I demolish house, build two in
its place. This a great piece of land.

788
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:38,132
Mr. Habib, this is not
''a piece of land.''

789
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:42,385
This is my home,
and I'm gonna be a father again...

790
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:47,015
and I don't want to bring
my baby home from the hospital
to a condo on the beach.

791
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,059
I wanna drive
down that street,

792
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:54,438
and I wanna pull
into this driveway,

793
00:51:54,563 --> 00:51:57,107
and I wanna honk my horn--

794
00:51:57,274 --> 00:51:59,610
Yes, yes, okay. I know.

795
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:04,281
Mr. Habib, please.

796
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:06,950
You see this pathway?

797
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:12,121
I laid these bricks
with my own two hands.

798
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:15,583
I planted this grass.

799
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,710
I-- I built this fence.

800
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:24,424
I broke that window
with a frisbee!

801
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:30,471
I painted these shutters.

802
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:34,934
Don't bulldoze
my memories, man.

803
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:38,687
I'm begging you.
Sell me back my home.

804
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:47,028
Boy. For how much?

805
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:49,238
You wanna make a profit
on something you owned for one day?

806
00:52:49,322 --> 00:52:51,240
Yes!

807
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:54,827
Fine.

808
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:57,621
Will $5,000
do the trick?

809
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,002
George, just another day ago,

810
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:07,630
I turned down profit
of 50,000 on lot.

811
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:12,468
Now, you want to double that,
I consider selling back.

812
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:16,638
You want me to take out
a loan on something I owned free
and clear just 24 hours ago?

813
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:18,724
Well, that is up to you, George.

814
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:23,186
Your path, your fence,
your memories.

815
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:27,649
You don't know what you're asking, sir.
I am the cheapest man alive.

816
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:31,194
Then move aside, George,
'cause I going to level the place.

817
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,488
We go to work!
Come, come! Go, go!

818
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:41,578
- Commence to start!
- Commence to start!

819
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:10,104
- All right!
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

820
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:17,277
You win.
One hundred thousand dollars.

821
00:54:17,444 --> 00:54:22,115
Very close shave, George. Yes, make out,
please, to the Habib Group.

822
00:54:22,282 --> 00:54:24,576
- Habib Group.
- Inc.

823
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:27,328
- Inc.
- Very good.

824
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:30,081
- Welcome home, George.
- It feels good to be back.

825
00:54:30,248 --> 00:54:32,124
Well, I happy I could help.

826
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,627
Mr. Habib,
just one last question.

827
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:38,297
Would you mind getting
your wrecking ball off my lawn?

828
00:54:38,464 --> 00:54:42,425
Oh, sure. Anything you say, George.
You're the boss.

829
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:47,597
- We go. Move out!
- That's right! I'm the boss!

830
00:54:47,722 --> 00:54:49,766
So all you guys,
get a move on!

831
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,434
- Get that dump truck out of here!
- Right away!

832
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:53,519
- And quit standing on my shutters!
- Sorry.

833
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,855
And all of you guys, just pack up
your stuff and hit the road!

834
00:54:56,939 --> 00:55:00,150
And don't trample the pansies.

835
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:03,695
I laid those bricks,
I planted those pansies,

836
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,239
I painted those shutters,
I broke that window!

837
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,287
I'm home.

838
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,334
I'm home!

839
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:32,138
First thing I did
was apologize to Nina.

840
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:34,890
That is not funny, George.
I'm not gonna listen to you.

841
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:39,811
Then I told her I bought
the new baby a present.

842
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:44,607
- That did it. Twenty-four hours
later, we moved back home.
- George!

843
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:49,487
Before we knew it,
it was spring.

844
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,906
- Here you go.
- Everything was in full bloom,

845
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,950
including the women
in my life.

846
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:58,120
Hello? Oh, hi, honey.

847
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:01,581
- Baby's been kicking a lot.
- Annie and Nina were
in their second trimesters.

848
00:56:01,665 --> 00:56:04,000
- There was no denying it now.
- Yeah, I know we can't sing.

849
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:08,421
The stork was not only on his way,
he was circling the neighborhood.

850
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:13,467
Still trying
to redeem myself,

851
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:15,970
I did the unthinkable.

852
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:19,765
I hired Franck to surprise the girls
with a double baby shower.

853
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:24,853
- It's a baby shower! Oh!
- Hello, ladies.

854
00:56:24,978 --> 00:56:29,148
What dreams are made of!
Look what I have for you!

855
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:31,609
- It was picture perfect,
- Oh, my!

856
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:35,738
topped off by two surprise
guests flown in for the occasion
all the way from Vienna.

857
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:43,995
- It's a stork!
- Oh, my God.

858
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,830
- After the shower,
- Thank you.

859
00:56:45,955 --> 00:56:47,665
Nina was showing a few of her friends
the new baby's room...

860
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,168
and Franck started giving
decorating tips.

861
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,336
But this is what I suggest.

862
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:54,380
Firstly, if it were me,
you know,

863
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:59,009
what I would do is I'd
push those windows out and let
sweet San Marino light fill in.

864
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:04,139
Therefore, the third trimester
in the Banks family began...

865
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:08,226
with a remodel of what we
now affectionately called
''the baby's suite.''

866
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,398
I'll admit we got a little carried away,
and it wasn't even all Franck's fault,

867
00:57:14,523 --> 00:57:17,067
although God knows
I tried to blame him.

868
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:18,777
- Hey! Hey!
- No, no, no, no!

869
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,029
Nina and Annie were doing great,
right on schedule...

870
00:57:21,196 --> 00:57:25,450
and weighing in at 128
and 132 pounds respectively.

871
00:57:25,617 --> 00:57:27,368
Ohh! Oh.

872
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:31,080
We had everything you'd expect
when you're expecting:

873
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:33,833
leg cramps, backaches
and cravings.

874
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:36,251
And the women were worse.

875
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:44,301
What we didn't expect
one sleepy night...

876
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:47,011
was an unexpected visitor.

877
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:55,603
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- You okay?

878
00:57:57,104 --> 00:57:59,356
I'm fine.

879
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:01,608
Bryan and I got in a fight.

880
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:06,321
And I got angry and got in my car.
I didn't know where to go.

881
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:09,323
- Did I wake Mom?
- No, no, no. She's asleep.

882
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,877
So, do you wanna, you know--

883
00:58:22,043 --> 00:58:24,587
Yeah, sure, I can talk about it.
It's not, you know-- It's fine.

884
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:28,216
- 'Ca-- If you don't wanna, it's okay,
'cause I could just make up the sofa.
- No, no, that's-- it's okay.

885
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:30,218
Thanks.

886
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:35,764
- Pretzel?
- No, thanks.

887
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:44,272
All right.
Here's what happened.

888
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:48,276
When I was leaving work today,
my boss calls me in, tells me
what a great job I'm doing...

889
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:52,655
and says I have as much promise
as anyone she's hired
since she's been at the firm.

890
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:55,824
Then she said the great part. She said
that she's been asked to select...

891
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,410
one person from my level
to be part of a design team...

892
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:02,247
that's gonna design the new
Boston Museum of Contemporary
Art, and she picked me.

893
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,291
- That's fantastic.
- I know. I was completely thrilled.

894
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,002
Plus, to live in Boston.
I love Boston.

895
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,130
- You have to, uh--
- Move to Boston. Yeah.

896
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,175
I need to be there right after
the baby's born, by October.

897
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:16,677
- Uh-huh.
- I knew when they hired me...

898
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:19,304
that this was a possibility
one day, and Bryan knew it too.

899
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:24,601
But now, well-- I rush home
to tell him the news, and as soon as
I say the word ''Boston,'' his face drops.

900
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:29,188
I mean, this is the kind of opportunity
everybody dreams about, and we're
talking Massachusetts here, not Mars.

901
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:35,402
So Bryan doesn't wanna go?

902
00:59:35,527 --> 00:59:39,323
Well, he said that he understood
that career-wise it was great for me,

903
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:43,076
but with the baby coming,
he figured I wouldn't wanna go.

904
00:59:43,243 --> 00:59:45,995
- Which is--
- Ridiculous.
- Right.

905
00:59:46,037 --> 00:59:50,041
It's like under that mellow,
'90s Gap ad exterior of his...

906
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:55,045
beats the heart of a 1950s
husband that just expects me to
take a backseat to his career.

907
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:58,799
- You said that to him?
- Of course.

908
00:59:58,924 --> 01:00:03,386
To which he said I was nuts,
and that all he meant was that
with us having a new baby,

909
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,557
it just seemed like a crazy time
to move to sub-zero weather
and a city full of strangers,

910
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:09,725
and that I should think
of you guys...

911
01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:14,939
and of his parents, and how moving so
far away would be so hard on everyone.

912
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:19,526
Anyway, I knew if anybody would
understand how I felt, it would be you.

913
01:00:19,651 --> 01:00:24,197
You were the one that always told me
to go for my dreams, never to settle.

914
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,908
Dad, tell me.
Am I being unreasonable to want to go?

915
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:30,703
Because if you think I am,
I won't go. I won't.

916
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:40,545
Ann, you have to go.
This is not the Dark Ages.

917
01:00:40,712 --> 01:00:43,923
We'll still see each other all the time.
You'll just be an airplane ride away.

918
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,925
That's exactly
what I said.

919
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,136
And wasn't Bryan the one
who said you were a gifted architect...

920
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:50,138
- and he'd move anywhere you got a job?
- Yes.

921
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:52,723
And wouldn't you move for him if he
was the one being offered the promotion?

922
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,350
In a minute.

923
01:00:56,268 --> 01:00:58,687
Oh, gosh, that must be him.

924
01:01:10,406 --> 01:01:12,283
- Hi.
- Hi.

925
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,079
Hi, Dad.

926
01:01:19,206 --> 01:01:24,127
Um, Annie, I-I realize
that-- that--

927
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:26,129
Did you tell your dad?

928
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:30,007
Sorry, George.
I didn't mean to be so lame.

929
01:01:30,174 --> 01:01:32,802
Hey, you guys go ahead.
It's not up to me.

930
01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:36,805
Okay. Annie, I realized
after you left that, uh,

931
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:40,434
if the same thing happened to me,
you'd come with me anytime, anywhere.

932
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:43,770
- I would.
- So I wanna do the same for you.

933
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:49,233
- God, honey, I am so sorry l--
- Oh.

934
01:01:51,652 --> 01:01:53,821
I just don't want you
to ever resent me for this.

935
01:01:53,946 --> 01:01:57,866
Hey, I can work out of Boston
just as easy as I can work out of L.A.

936
01:01:57,991 --> 01:02:00,952
And I don't want you
to ever resent me, ever.

937
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:11,629
- Okay. So then we're goin'.
- Okay.

938
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:16,592
The baby has hiccups.

939
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:18,427
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you feel that?
- Yes.

940
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,429
Boston.

941
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:35,276
As I watched the kids pull
out of the driveway, I got an
all-too-familiar pain in my gut.

942
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,321
The one I always got when I did
something for one of the kids
that fell under the heading of,

943
01:02:39,446 --> 01:02:41,865
''I did it for their own good.''

944
01:02:43,533 --> 01:02:46,202
And then I thought
about baby number three...

945
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:49,622
and 25 more years
of moments like this.

946
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:52,833
And suddenly,
I was tired.

947
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:14,895
I'll be able to do it again.
I'm sure I can.

948
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:25,030
All right. lf it swishes,
no problem.

949
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:27,490
Father of the Year.

950
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,288
Not swishes!
Just goes in! Well.

951
01:03:42,837 --> 01:03:46,716
- Oh, it's frying!
- Well, we made it to July.

952
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:51,637
The Farmer's Almanac said
it was the hottest month L.A.
had seen in over half a century.

953
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:54,557
- Did you see it?
- Nina was four weeks from her due date,

954
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:57,726
- and Annie was two days past hers.
- Howard! Howard!

955
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:01,730
Franck and his crew were working
around the clock to have
the baby's room ready by D day.

956
01:04:01,813 --> 01:04:03,815
Life was hectic,

957
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,109
- especially once Annie moved in.
- I better go.

958
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:09,695
Bryan was called to an emergency
meeting in Japan, and since
Annie's doctor assured us...

959
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,073
that the baby was at least
another week away,

960
01:04:12,198 --> 01:04:15,743
-Bryan took the red-eye to Tokyo
and left Annie in our care.
-Bye.

961
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:19,663
So there I was, living with
two extremely pregnant women...

962
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:23,083
- during the worst heat wave
of the century.
- Okay. Okay.

963
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,377
Annie and Nina dealt with
the heat by adding extra
air conditioners to the house,

964
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,213
turning our home into
the only igloo in San Marino.

965
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:31,340
- How we doing, girls?
- Good.
- Dad, would you mind...

966
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:33,717
- adjusting the pillow behind my back?
- Sure, sure.

967
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:36,011
- Yeah. George. George.
- Oh, thank you.

968
01:04:36,136 --> 01:04:38,096
Prop that pillow up
under my foot, would you please?

969
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:40,057
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Thank you, honey.
- Lemonade?

970
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:42,934
Thank you, yes.
Oh, and George,

971
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:45,270
- would you please scratch
my left ankle?
- Mm-hmm.

972
01:04:45,437 --> 01:04:47,647
My mission was to keep them
calm and comfortable.

973
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:50,650
I tied their shoes, massaged their
backs, painted their toenails...

974
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:53,819
and went to every imaginable
take-out restaurant in the city.

975
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:57,197
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Gotta go get dinner.

976
01:04:57,322 --> 01:05:00,117
- Matty, hold down
the fort while I'm gone.
- Okay, Dad.

977
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:05,371
George! Turn the air conditioning up
on your way out. It's stifling in here.

978
01:05:05,455 --> 01:05:07,373
Oh, boy.

979
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:14,046
Uh, now, you all have
my beeper number just in case.

980
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:19,343
- Shut the door!
- Shut the door!

981
01:05:19,468 --> 01:05:23,388
Here we go. Here we go.
Dinnertime. Dinnertime. All right.

982
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,974
- Thai noodles with chicken,
white meat only.
- That's me.

983
01:05:26,057 --> 01:05:28,059
- Oh, yeah, Annie.
- And let's see.

984
01:05:28,184 --> 01:05:31,145
- Uh, Taco Grande.
- Mm, honey. Yes.
- Extra rice, no beans.

985
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:35,691
- Ooh. Mmm. Thank you, honey.
- All right. Uh, lox, bagels
and cream cheese.

986
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:37,943
Thanks, Dad.

987
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:42,113
All right now.
Where's Dad's? Where's Dad's?

988
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,617
As the days rolled by
and nothing happened,

989
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:47,702
the tension mounted.

990
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:50,121
I found myself watching Annie
as if she were a time bomb.

991
01:05:51,664 --> 01:05:53,290
- Ouch!
- What?
- What?

992
01:05:53,374 --> 01:05:56,502
Ouch. O-U-C-H.

993
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,921
- Oh!
- Hey, good word.
- Honey.

994
01:05:59,046 --> 01:06:01,590
- Ohh.
- That's 20 points.

995
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:04,509
Every night we laid out our clothes
so we could grab them in a hurry.

996
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:07,845
We were like firefighters ready
to jump at the first alarm.

997
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,225
Okay. Okay.

998
01:06:16,186 --> 01:06:18,897
I'm hot!

999
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:20,857
- Good night.
- Good night.

1000
01:06:35,663 --> 01:06:37,790
It's about that time.

1001
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:41,209
- George!
- All right, everybody stay calm!
- Okay. Okay.

1002
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:44,713
Now, I've mapped out the
various routes to the hospital.
We can, uh-- Oh, it's just, uh--

1003
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,716
What, uh, what time is it?
It's, uh-- All right, it's 11:36. 11:36.

1004
01:06:48,758 --> 01:06:52,053
All right.
So that would be 11:36.

1005
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:54,471
Plan ''F,'' uh, route ''B.''

1006
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:58,976
We can be there in 17 minutes.
Annie, don't worry.
We got everything under control.

1007
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:03,688
What is this?
What am I wearing?

1008
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:06,232
My blouse.

1009
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:16,575
- Oh, honey!
- What? What happened?
- Oh, my God.

1010
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,078
- Sorry. False alarm.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Well, that doesn't--
- It's all right.

1011
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,913
- Don't worry about it.
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not unusual.

1012
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,915
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.
- That can happen.

1013
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,292
We'll be back
before you know it.

1014
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,711
We got home just
as the sun came up.

1015
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:32,048
The girls fell right
to sleep...

1016
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,842
as I headed off to work.

1017
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,346
Hello! It's fabric day.

1018
01:07:39,471 --> 01:07:42,390
- Hello, George.
- Hi.
- A pleasure to see you.

1019
01:07:42,432 --> 01:07:45,977
And oddly enough, knowing Franck was
at the house made me feel better,

1020
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:49,188
although I have no idea
what he did there all day.

1021
01:07:49,313 --> 01:07:52,858
Do the baby workout
Make the babies gleeful

1022
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,528
Oh, that's good.
That's good!

1023
01:07:56,612 --> 01:08:00,032
Little tin soldier
Happy tin soldier

1024
01:08:00,198 --> 01:08:02,993
Right. And now
with an attitude.

1025
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:06,496
Hello! Who you?

1026
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:11,626
Get away! I don't
like what you say! Now, leg up--

1027
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,901
Uh-oh. Mom! Dad!

1028
01:08:40,027 --> 01:08:43,655
- I'll get it. What flavor?
- No flavor. This is it.

1029
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:46,366
Good. I didn't even
get undressed this time.

1030
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:48,785
Where's my chart?

1031
01:08:53,414 --> 01:08:56,125
- George, don't forget the suitcase!
- I won't!

1032
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,088
Dad, keys!

1033
01:09:11,389 --> 01:09:14,683
You'd think I could tell the difference
between labor pains and indigestion.

1034
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,978
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry, Mom. Really.

1035
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,106
- Mom?
- I understand, honey.

1036
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:24,109
You know, I think-- Oh, boy,
I think I just gotta--

1037
01:09:24,234 --> 01:09:27,362
- I'm gonna lie down here
just for a sec.
- Oh, me too.

1038
01:09:29,155 --> 01:09:31,907
I'm gonna go catch
a few winks before I--

1039
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:41,083
Dad, where've you been?
I'm late for camp!

1040
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:43,543
- Camp. Camp.
- Come on!

1041
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:46,880
At this point I hadn't
slept in 48 hours.

1042
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:49,549
Have a good day
at work, George.

1043
01:09:49,674 --> 01:09:51,676
Yeah, Dad. Good night.

1044
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:13,654
Ohh.

1045
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:30,545
Hello! Pappala's home!
We got a surprise for you, George.

1046
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:32,922
I'm sorry I can't stay,
George,

1047
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:37,926
but I-- Whoops! I caught a cold
from your house.

1048
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,345
Come on, George.
Hurry up. ''Quick-ah.''

1049
01:10:40,512 --> 01:10:42,722
I'm too tired
to ''kovick-ah.''

1050
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:45,767
Okay, George, this is it.
The baby suite is finished.

1051
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:48,019
Think of it, buddy.
After today, I'm out of your hair.

1052
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,813
- Did we come in on budget?
- Close enough, George. Close enough.

1053
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:53,983
- Now close those eyes.
- Oh, Franck, I'm not
gonna close my eyes.
- Don't ''oh, Franck'' me.

1054
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:56,735
You never wants to have any fun.
Close those eyes.

1055
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,238
- All right.
- Drumroll, if you please.

1056
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,909
Okay, open up.

1057
01:11:21,341 --> 01:11:23,760
Welcome to babyland.

1058
01:11:25,762 --> 01:11:28,056
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you, sir.

1059
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:30,850
I mean it.
It's perfect.

1060
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:35,312
Oh, well, coming from you, George Banks,
that-- that means a lot.

1061
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,315
A lot.

1062
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:41,860
A whole lot.

1063
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:47,699
And here's the bill.
Ju-Just don't go nuts, George.

1064
01:11:47,824 --> 01:11:51,994
Just-Just-Just try to remember, uh, what
you feel right at this minute, okay?

1065
01:11:52,036 --> 01:11:54,747
In fact, do me a favor.
Maybe you open it after I leave.

1066
01:11:54,872 --> 01:11:56,749
That will be better.

1067
01:12:05,965 --> 01:12:09,635
- George!
- He's up here and he loves it!

1068
01:12:09,677 --> 01:12:12,805
Oh, well, good!
Honey, dinner's ready.

1069
01:12:12,888 --> 01:12:15,891
- She cooked?
- She wants to give you a break.

1070
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:20,395
She's been cooking up a storm all day
in that freezing kitchen.

1071
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,480
What's the matter, George?
You look a little pooped.

1072
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:24,983
Oh, I haven't slept in three days.
You know, I try to sleep at work,

1073
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:28,361
but I keep thinking any minute
one of 'em's gonna go into labor
and I'll just end up--

1074
01:12:28,486 --> 01:12:31,447
Totally wired. Trust me.
I know the feeling.

1075
01:12:31,572 --> 01:12:35,492
And do you know how
I spell relief? V-A-T-S-N-I-K.

1076
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:38,495
- V-A-T-S-N-I-K?
- Vatsnik.

1077
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:41,665
The best sleeping pill in
the whole wide world. I swear by them.

1078
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,667
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't take sleeping pills.

1079
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:47,420
Oh, George, you need
your rest. You do.

1080
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:50,047
What if they need you,
and you're walking into walls?

1081
01:12:50,214 --> 01:12:54,051
Believe me, I never take pills myself
neither. But sometimes, I need to rest.

1082
01:12:54,176 --> 01:12:57,554
So I take a half a Vatsnik,
close my eyes, and I wake up a new man,

1083
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,891
refreshed and replenished
and ''roaring'' to go.

1084
01:13:00,974 --> 01:13:03,435
Just-- You know what?
Keep them. They're very mild.

1085
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,229
- Mild?
- Oh, yeah. No, y-y-you'll
thank me. You'll see.

1086
01:13:06,354 --> 01:13:10,358
- George, Franck, dinner!
- On our way. ''Quick-ah.''

1087
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,613
I'm so happy that you
like the room, George.

1088
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:18,532
Sit next to me
at dinner, okay?

1089
01:13:36,548 --> 01:13:38,592
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Matty. How was camp?

1090
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:40,927
- Good.
- Ann, how're you feelin'?

1091
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:43,555
Great. Really energized.
Bryan's coming home tomorrow.

1092
01:13:43,638 --> 01:13:47,267
- Don't think we'll see
any action tonight?
- Don't think so, Dad.

1093
01:13:47,392 --> 01:13:49,560
- Hey, honey. How're you feelin'?
- Oh, good. Fine.

1094
01:13:49,644 --> 01:13:53,105
- Went to the doctor today.
- And?
- And right on schedule.

1095
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,899
Three weeks.

1096
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,359
Hmm. Well, here goes.

1097
01:14:01,696 --> 01:14:05,116
- Dad, what are you taking?
- Well, Dad hasn't been
sleeping so well lately,

1098
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,119
so I thought I'd take
a couple of very mild sleeping pills.

1099
01:14:09,454 --> 01:14:10,872
Hmm.

1100
01:14:11,998 --> 01:14:14,166
Please pass the rolls.

1101
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:17,711
Thanks.

1102
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:20,130
Dad?

1103
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,716
- What's he doing? What's going on?
- George? George?

1104
01:14:22,883 --> 01:14:25,718
I never saw anything like it.
He said, ''Pass the rolls.''

1105
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:29,138
- By the time I passed them,
he was gone.
- George!

1106
01:14:29,222 --> 01:14:31,891
- Georgie, love, what is wrong?
- Oh, my God! George?
- George! George!

1107
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:35,019
- He's not dead, Mom. He just
took two sleeping pills.
- George, baby.

1108
01:14:35,144 --> 01:14:37,688
- Are you all right?
- He took them both?
- You gave him sleeping pills?

1109
01:14:37,813 --> 01:14:42,150
He said he could not sleep, but
two Vatsnik is like, ''Good-bye,
George, see you next Thursday.''

1110
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:44,652
- George! Oh, my! George!
- I didn't think he would
take them both, you know.

1111
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:48,323
- Look at him! He's like--
- Truth is, I take half
a Vatsnik and I'm a goner.
- Honey!

1112
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:50,908
- He took them both at once?
- Looked that way to me.

1113
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:54,245
Well, at least he'll sleep,
you know. Matthew, help me
get him into the living room.

1114
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,663
- Can I help in some way?
- No, no, no. We men can do it.

1115
01:14:56,789 --> 01:15:00,334
- On three we lift, Matthew.
- Okay.
- One, two, and we go.

1116
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:04,462
- George?
- Oh!

1117
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:07,131
Drop that boy on me.
Am I moving?

1118
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:11,010
- Oh, yes, you're moving.
- Oh, that's good.
- Oh, dear. Oh, Franck.

1119
01:15:11,093 --> 01:15:13,179
- Going down.
- Oh, God, are you all right?
- Am I getting shorter?

1120
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:15,389
- Oh, no.
- Help me, baby.
- Second strength.
- Okay. Okay.

1121
01:15:15,514 --> 01:15:17,391
Okay.

1122
01:15:19,142 --> 01:15:21,019
- Franck?
- Yeah?
- Is he breathing?

1123
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:25,523
- Yes, breathing and drooling.
- Oh, honey. Oh, dear.

1124
01:15:25,648 --> 01:15:27,775
- There you go!
- Oh! Oh!
- Mom?

1125
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,028
Oh, what are Vatsnik anyway? I've never
heard of it. Are they prescription?

1126
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:34,073
Not yet. They're from my country.
They're not exactly legal.

1127
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:37,910
But trust me,
there are no funny side effects.
I've been taking them for years.

1128
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:42,247
Oh, yeah. Okay. He's going to be fine.
Don't you worry.

1129
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:45,458
- Um, Mom?
- Well, if he's so fine,
why are you taking his pulse?

1130
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,711
- Mom!
- Well, just to check it.
Pulse excellent. See? He's fine.

1131
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:52,590
- He'll just sleep like
a little lamb. Okay.
- Oh, George.
- Nina!

1132
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,343
- What?
- Mom, this is it.
I'm not kidding this time.

1133
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,763
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm gonna have this baby tonight.

1134
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,724
All right, Franck. Franck,
we need you to drive us to the hospital.

1135
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,768
- No, no! No, no!
- I'm too big to get
behind the wheel, Franck.

1136
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:11,065
Franck! Franck! Franck,
we need you. Could you drive us
to the hospital, Franck?

1137
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,692
Huh? Okay. Thank you.

1138
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:16,653
Yes, the hospital.
I'll drive you there.

1139
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:18,864
- I'll take the suitcase.
- Okay, come on. Come on. Let's go.
- I'll be there in a moment.

1140
01:16:18,947 --> 01:16:22,367
- Hurry up. Hurry.
- Ladies, not to worry.
We have no problem.

1141
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,870
- Good. Then hurry.
- Hey, Mom, can I drive?
- No.

1142
01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:28,956
George! Wake up!
Please, wake up!

1143
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:31,250
You're gonna be
a grandpappala.

1144
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:36,046
Oh, George, don't do this!
I am not a husband! I am not
a father! I'm not a 9-1-1 man!

1145
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:40,675
Come on. Rise and shine,
you big white-haired man.

1146
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:43,345
There we go. All right. Look at that.
All right. Okay.

1147
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:47,599
We're on our way! All right.
Now-- oh, now we're clippin'.

1148
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,602
Right, left.
Right, left.

1149
01:16:51,727 --> 01:16:55,272
Left, right. Right.

1150
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:58,358
We're clippin' along, George.

1151
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:03,947
Oh, no. Oh, George.
We're almost there!

1152
01:17:04,072 --> 01:17:07,992
And we move. Okay.
And a running start.

1153
01:17:10,203 --> 01:17:13,581
On the Atchison, Topeka--

1154
01:17:13,706 --> 01:17:16,208
There! Moving.
Moving, George.

1155
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,585
Ohh!

1156
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:20,670
Gee, I'd change this room.

1157
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:23,840
This is not the time
to think about that! Let's get the head.

1158
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:27,802
Okay, okay.
Any day now!

1159
01:17:27,885 --> 01:17:29,971
We're on our way!

1160
01:17:31,931 --> 01:17:35,809
Look who's up!
He wouldn't miss it for the world.

1161
01:17:41,148 --> 01:17:43,024
Franck! Wrong way!

1162
01:17:46,986 --> 01:17:49,530
Right turn here.
Right!

1163
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:54,952
How's the maternity
department doing?

1164
01:17:54,994 --> 01:17:57,413
I'm hangin' in there.
Just hurry, please.

1165
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:04,711
- George, get ahold of yourself!
- Make a left here!

1166
01:18:04,836 --> 01:18:07,130
- Where?
- Left here!
- Left here!
- Oh, right!

1167
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:25,772
Hey, man,
what's with that face, huh?

1168
01:18:25,897 --> 01:18:28,483
Is that supposed to be me?

1169
01:18:32,737 --> 01:18:36,448
Hey, you got a problem,
loser?

1170
01:18:36,573 --> 01:18:39,701
We have no problem with nobody!
Just ''leaf'' us alone!

1171
01:18:39,826 --> 01:18:43,747
''Leaf'' you alone?
What are you, a tree?

1172
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:49,377
Yes, I am. That's very funny.
Ha, ha, ha. You're obviously a comedian.

1173
01:18:49,502 --> 01:18:51,796
Very good.
Don't nobody look at them.

1174
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:56,342
Hey, that's a nice accent, man.
What planet are you from, huh?

1175
01:18:56,467 --> 01:19:01,763
What planet? The planet of not
wanting to die by a drive-by shooting!

1176
01:19:01,888 --> 01:19:04,682
Lock the doors!
Quick! Quick!

1177
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:10,104
Where ya goin', man?

1178
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:16,610
You all right?
Now just breathe in and out.

1179
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,695
- Yeah.
- Breathe slowly.

1180
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:25,076
Yes, thank you. I will. I'm just not
used to all this hod-rodding business.

1181
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,371
- She was talkin' to my sister.
- Oh.

1182
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:42,259
Look who's walking all by himself!
Let's go over here, George.

1183
01:19:42,384 --> 01:19:45,428
Oh, George, honey. It's really
happening. This is it. Now, Franck.

1184
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:47,680
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go upstairs with
Annie to meet her doctor.

1185
01:19:47,805 --> 01:19:49,932
- Sure.
- So I want you and Matty
to get George some coffee.

1186
01:19:50,099 --> 01:19:52,852
- And then I'll meet you in
the waiting room, all right?
- Of course! No problem! Yes.

1187
01:19:52,977 --> 01:19:56,271
- How are you doing?
- I have the chair
for the prostate exam.

1188
01:19:56,355 --> 01:20:00,275
- Mr. Lemisch?
- He'll be out in a sec.
He's in the john.

1189
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:03,945
Oakhurst Emergency.
Slow down. Slow down.

1190
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:07,282
Oh, Mr. Lemisch.

1191
01:20:07,323 --> 01:20:09,450
- You all ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1192
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:12,328
People, please, we got a pregnant
lady here. Can we get a move on?

1193
01:20:12,328 --> 01:20:14,622
- Buddy, we got it covered.
Are you doin' okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1194
01:20:14,747 --> 01:20:17,374
- The contractions are
about five minutes apart.
- Okay, hold on.

1195
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:20,377
This chariot's gonna move.
You gonna need a chair too?

1196
01:20:20,502 --> 01:20:24,089
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Annie, see you after?
- Definitely. Bye.

1197
01:20:24,172 --> 01:20:26,799
Okay, keep breathing.
You're gonna be just fine.

1198
01:20:30,261 --> 01:20:32,596
- Where your father go?
- I don't know. He was just here.

1199
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:43,148
Bring him on in.
I'm ready.

1200
01:20:48,653 --> 01:20:52,656
Excuse me!
Do I know you?

1201
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:56,660
Come on, Annie.
Come on.

1202
01:20:56,785 --> 01:21:00,122
Keep breathing.
It's almost over.

1203
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:02,999
Almost.

1204
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:06,753
Okay, the worst is over.
Almost gone, honey.

1205
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,173
You did it.

1206
01:21:11,882 --> 01:21:14,301
- Doin' real good, Ann.
- Thanks.

1207
01:21:14,385 --> 01:21:17,888
Look who's back
from the dead.

1208
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:22,309
- Hi.
- Oh, honey.
- Dad, you're up.

1209
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:25,019
Matthew and I are gonna go
to the cafeteria for some Coca-Colas.

1210
01:21:25,061 --> 01:21:27,814
So, ju-- You just--

1211
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:33,277
- How're you doing?
- Okay.
- So far, so good.

1212
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:36,488
We called Bryan and he checked out of
his hotel, but nobody knows where he is.

1213
01:21:36,572 --> 01:21:39,241
And Dr. Brooks--
Wait a minute.

1214
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:45,205
- You hang on.
- Dr. Brooks's kid broke
her arm at camp...

1215
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:48,499
- so he had to fly
to Maine this morning.
- Dr. Brooks is in Maine?

1216
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:50,293
Yeah.

1217
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:53,963
- Hi, Annie. I'm Dr. Eisenberg.
- Hi.

1218
01:21:54,088 --> 01:21:56,256
- Let's see how you're doin' here, okay?
- Okay.

1219
01:21:56,382 --> 01:21:58,800
I'll be filling in
for Dr. Brooks today.

1220
01:21:58,926 --> 01:22:02,053
- And you're Annie's--
- Oh.
- Parents.

1221
01:22:02,137 --> 01:22:04,764
You're, uh-- Y-You're, uh--
Y-You-re-- You're gonna, uh, actually--

1222
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:08,142
Yes, I am. Annie, actually,
everything looks real good here,

1223
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:10,895
so I'm just gonna check now to see what
kind of progress you're making, okay?

1224
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,481
- Okay.
- We'll wait outside.

1225
01:22:14,607 --> 01:22:18,235
Nina, this is-- this is no good.
We got to get another doctor.
She looks younger than Annie.

1226
01:22:18,318 --> 01:22:20,237
- Do you have any change?
- No, George. Anyway,

1227
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,239
Dr. Brooks said she's
absolutely fantastic.

1228
01:22:22,322 --> 01:22:24,240
- Nina, this is our daughter
we're talking about.
- Hey, I know.

1229
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:26,159
What if something goes wrong?
I mean, how much experience...

1230
01:22:26,284 --> 01:22:28,161
- could she have six months
out of medical school?
- Well--

1231
01:22:28,328 --> 01:22:30,246
- Did you see the name
on her tag? Megan.
- Yes.

1232
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:32,748
- No real doctor is named Megan.
- Hey.
- I mean, what, uh-- what--

1233
01:22:32,873 --> 01:22:36,668
- How many babies could she
have delivered, two?
- Actually, 341.

1234
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:39,546
Not counting the two
I delivered this morning.

1235
01:22:39,713 --> 01:22:42,966
- You can come back in now.
- Well, thank you.

1236
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:46,261
Annie's doing great. Now,
the contractions are still irregular,

1237
01:22:46,344 --> 01:22:50,181
but they're getting kind of intense,
so it could take just a few more hours.

1238
01:22:50,306 --> 01:22:55,144
So just, um, just remind her
now to relax between contractions, okay?

1239
01:22:55,227 --> 01:22:57,271
- You're going somewhere?
- Oh, just down the hall, Mr. Banks.

1240
01:22:57,396 --> 01:22:59,273
Oh, hey, you're
wearing Sidekicks.

1241
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:01,274
- Oh, don't you love 'em?
They're all I wear.
- Yeah, me too.

1242
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,318
Yeah, well,
they're the best.

1243
01:23:03,443 --> 01:23:05,445
So when's your baby due,
Mrs. Banks?

1244
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:09,949
- Uh--
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no, I feel fine.

1245
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:13,786
It's just, uh, I have
this funny pain. It's kinda sharp.

1246
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:18,624
- You're almost 40 weeks?
- Mm-hmm. Uh, uh-oh. Here's another one.

1247
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:20,667
Okay, let's go across the hall.
I'll see what's going on.

1248
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,044
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, I'm perfectly fine.

1249
01:23:23,169 --> 01:23:25,255
- Really.
- I'd feel much better really
if you let me take a look.

1250
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:29,467
- And Mr. Banks can stay with Annie.
- Oh, I'll be right back.

1251
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,844
- Okay? Don't worry.
- Okay?
- Honey, fine.

1252
01:23:31,927 --> 01:23:33,804
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1253
01:23:35,597 --> 01:23:37,975
The doctor seems
pretty together.

1254
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:40,227
- She's young.
- Well, so what? So are you.

1255
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:43,647
Doesn't mean you couldn't
design a skyscraper.

1256
01:23:43,772 --> 01:23:46,733
- All right. All right.
- Just tell me when it's over, will you?

1257
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:50,653
Okay, you're doing great.
Just breathe in. And now breathe out.

1258
01:23:50,736 --> 01:23:53,239
- Breathe out.
- I can't.

1259
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:56,033
Okay, the worst is over.

1260
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:58,952
- You're sure?
- Absolutely. Coming down, way down.

1261
01:23:59,036 --> 01:24:02,622
It's almost over.
Down to nothing. There we are.

1262
01:24:02,706 --> 01:24:07,168
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

1263
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,837
That was short, but horrible.

1264
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:13,299
- Annie, can I steal
your dad for a second?
- Yeah.

1265
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:16,260
- You're hanging in there?
- Mm-hmm.

1266
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,178
Okay.

1267
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,810
- Save my seat.
- I will. Hurry.

1268
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:35,194
- Mr. Banks, your wife is in labor.
- Very funny. Where is she?

1269
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:37,863
She's putting on a gown and getting
hooked up to a fetal monitor.

1270
01:24:37,946 --> 01:24:40,741
No, no, no, no. My-My daughter's
in labor. My son-in-law's not here.

1271
01:24:40,866 --> 01:24:44,786
And my wife is the solid one
that will--

1272
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:47,205
Are you sure? We have a lot
of false alarms in our family.

1273
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:49,582
Her cervix is already dilated
five centimeters.

1274
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:53,419
Now, the way she's going, your baby
could be born before your grandchild.

1275
01:24:53,502 --> 01:24:56,755
Now, I'm okay.
I can handle this. Can you?

1276
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,134
Okay. Why don't you go congratulate
Mrs. Banks and I'll check on Annie.

1277
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:03,678
You know, it's pretty cool, actually.
If they both deliver before midnight,

1278
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,680
they'll have the same birthday.

1279
01:25:05,763 --> 01:25:08,224
Dr. Eisenberg,

1280
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:12,353
these women are my life.

1281
01:25:12,436 --> 01:25:14,271
I know.

1282
01:25:24,572 --> 01:25:27,909
Nice timing, I know.
How's Ann?

1283
01:25:28,034 --> 01:25:30,077
Well, she's doing good.
How 'bout you?

1284
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:32,913
Oh, George, I haven't
packed my bag.

1285
01:25:33,038 --> 01:25:37,084
We haven't even practiced
that Lamaze stuff yet. It's just--

1286
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:40,295
Oh!

1287
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,756
- You're having a contraction, huh?
- Yeah, I know.

1288
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:47,051
- Yeow.
- You okay?

1289
01:25:50,096 --> 01:25:53,933
Just promise me-- promise me you'll stay
with Annie, George. She needs you.

1290
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:56,393
- You know I will.
- Okay.

1291
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,979
- Nina.
- What?

1292
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:01,481
We're gonna have
a baby tonight.

1293
01:26:01,648 --> 01:26:03,525
I know.

1294
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:06,152
Isn't it just amazing?

1295
01:26:10,072 --> 01:26:12,867
You know, we haven't even
locked in on any names yet.

1296
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,744
Ah, okay.
Now, I was thinking...

1297
01:26:15,828 --> 01:26:19,623
Megan if it's a girl,
and Franck if it's a boy.

1298
01:26:19,748 --> 01:26:23,376
Franck Banks. It's got kind of a
continental ring to it, don't you think?

1299
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:26,588
Can't you see him walking around
the house with his little ascot?

1300
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:28,756
George, go check on Annie.

1301
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:31,717
Tell her I'm fine, all right?
Oh, boy.

1302
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:35,012
These contractions are
really coming fast, honey.

1303
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:39,057
But go, go. I'm fine.
And, oh, check on Matty, honey.

1304
01:26:39,182 --> 01:26:42,602
And, George? George.

1305
01:26:46,898 --> 01:26:49,942
I don't know what
I was gonna say.

1306
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:57,366
Okay.

1307
01:27:00,118 --> 01:27:02,704
Okay, hang in there.
A little more.

1308
01:27:02,829 --> 01:27:07,083
- That one was a bitch, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1309
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:09,210
- Pappala, we're getting closer.
- How're you doin'?
- Hi.
- You okay?

1310
01:27:09,293 --> 01:27:11,504
- Yes, that's better. Thanks.
- Fine. Good.
- Dad, how's Mom?

1311
01:27:11,587 --> 01:27:14,089
Well, uh, sh-she's, uh--
You're not gonna believe this.

1312
01:27:14,173 --> 01:27:18,010
- She's not in labor?
- She is, actually.

1313
01:27:18,177 --> 01:27:21,471
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- This is some night.

1314
01:27:21,555 --> 01:27:23,473
- More ice.
- I'll get it!
- I'll get it!
- No, no, no. I'll get it.

1315
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:26,809
- All right.
- You just, uh-- You just stay there.
- Dad, you should--

1316
01:27:26,893 --> 01:27:28,978
- Hold on.
- I got you. I got you.

1317
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:31,397
Go to Mom. I'll be fine.

1318
01:27:31,522 --> 01:27:34,942
- The ice man arrives.
- Almost. Almost. Almost. There we are.

1319
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:37,194
There we go. More ice.

1320
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:40,030
Really, Dad, I can handle this now.
You stay with Mom.

1321
01:27:40,072 --> 01:27:45,285
Well, she did say she wanted
some ice. I could take this to
her and be back in two seconds.

1322
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:48,413
- How about I find a doctor and get
an update here, okay? Be right back.
- Okay.

1323
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,666
- You just-- You just--
- Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

1324
01:27:51,749 --> 01:27:55,336
- Oh! This is very good.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1325
01:27:57,421 --> 01:28:00,841
- Franck. I need you, buddy.
- I'm here, buddy.

1326
01:28:00,924 --> 01:28:04,219
- Anything. What?
- W-Well, I need you to help me.
Can you hang in here with me?

1327
01:28:04,302 --> 01:28:07,221
Of course. I will hang in
until I hear those babies cry.

1328
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:10,808
I don't know what I'm doing exactly, but
I will keep doing that. You know that.

1329
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:12,810
- Well, I thought you
could stay with Annie.
- Good.

1330
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:15,521
-And then I could check on Nina.
-Fine.
-Then maybe we could switch.

1331
01:28:15,604 --> 01:28:17,981
Yeah. George?

1332
01:28:18,148 --> 01:28:20,275
We're bonding here,
aren't we?

1333
01:28:20,442 --> 01:28:24,279
- I think we are, Franck.
- Someone's buzzing me
awful bad in here.

1334
01:28:24,446 --> 01:28:26,739
Go on. Don't worry.
I'm on the case.

1335
01:28:28,116 --> 01:28:32,787
Okay. Oh, George. George?
I think I'm almost there.

1336
01:28:32,912 --> 01:28:35,414
Yeah, Dad, don't go too far.
We may need you.

1337
01:28:35,497 --> 01:28:39,584
Dad? Dad!

1338
01:28:41,253 --> 01:28:46,466
- We're moving her into delivery.
- Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.

1339
01:28:46,549 --> 01:28:50,178
- Dad?
- Baby.

1340
01:28:52,304 --> 01:28:55,099
Doctor.

1341
01:28:57,434 --> 01:29:00,103
What's going on?
What's wrong?

1342
01:29:00,145 --> 01:29:02,564
Nina, your contractions
are really close together...

1343
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:05,775
and the baby's just not handling
it as well as we'd like.

1344
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,569
The baby's heart rate has dropped.
Now, we're gonna watch it carefully...

1345
01:29:08,653 --> 01:29:11,489
and if it doesn't go back up in a couple
of minutes, I wanna do a C-section...

1346
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:16,243
- and get the baby out.
- Oh, George.

1347
01:29:16,326 --> 01:29:19,579
Mr. Banks, I'm concerned
your wife's going to need to
be delivered in the next few minutes...

1348
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:22,415
- and obviously I can't be
in two places at once.
- Right.

1349
01:29:22,499 --> 01:29:25,710
Everything's going beautifully
with Annie. Her labor's
progressing very well.

1350
01:29:25,835 --> 01:29:28,671
I'd like to turn her over
to the chief resident.

1351
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,464
I have complete
confidence in him.

1352
01:29:30,548 --> 01:29:33,467
I just feel that it's more important
that I stay with your wife.

1353
01:29:33,509 --> 01:29:36,095
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, fine.

1354
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:38,347
If the baby's heart rate doesn't go up,
how long does it take to--

1355
01:29:38,472 --> 01:29:43,768
Once I get her in the operating
room, I can have the baby out
in 60 seconds if I have to.

1356
01:29:43,852 --> 01:29:47,063
We're still okay.

1357
01:29:47,146 --> 01:29:49,315
- We're in labor in room number four.
- Okay.

1358
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,068
- Get Dr. Wagner up here.
- Right.

1359
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:04,996
- Dad! Is Mom okay?
- She's fine. Don't worry.

1360
01:30:05,163 --> 01:30:07,373
- Okay.
- Hi, Annie. I'm Dr. Wagner.

1361
01:30:07,457 --> 01:30:10,418
- Hi.
- Hold on. We're almost there.
- Okay.

1362
01:30:14,004 --> 01:30:16,131
- Bryan!
- Annie!

1363
01:30:16,215 --> 01:30:18,967
Oh. Oh, God.

1364
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:21,970
- I hope he's the husband.
- He is.

1365
01:30:25,849 --> 01:30:28,684
- How'd you know we were here?
- Well, I got to the folks' house...

1366
01:30:28,851 --> 01:30:30,937
and saw the tray
of uneaten lasagna.

1367
01:30:31,062 --> 01:30:33,689
- I'm so glad I made it.
- Me too.

1368
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:37,484
Slow down, kids.
This is our stop.

1369
01:30:42,906 --> 01:30:44,824
Dad, if--

1370
01:30:45,867 --> 01:30:47,952
- Just go. Go.
- Okay.

1371
01:30:56,502 --> 01:31:00,005
I don't see enough of an improvement,
Nina. Let's get you delivered.

1372
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:02,841
- Pat, we're on our way.
- Okay.

1373
01:31:02,882 --> 01:31:06,511
- Nina.
- Oh, George.

1374
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,847
What if she doesn't
get the baby out in time?

1375
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,767
- She will.
- Excuse me.

1376
01:31:13,851 --> 01:31:15,894
- Hey, you know what I
was thinkin' about?
- What?

1377
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:18,564
- I was thinkin' about our first date.
- Oh, yeah.

1378
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:20,941
The one you showed up
an hour late for?

1379
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:24,819
- Oh, actually, I wasn't an hour late.
- Yes, you were, George.

1380
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:27,238
You showed up as I was pulling
away from the restaurant.

1381
01:31:27,363 --> 01:31:30,992
Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

1382
01:31:31,117 --> 01:31:34,662
Actually, I got there on time.
I told you this.

1383
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:36,413
- Never.
- I didn't?

1384
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:44,754
Remember, you told me I'd know
you because you'd be wearing
that red turtleneck?

1385
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:47,423
- Oh, George.
- And I just...

1386
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:52,678
stood in the window and I watched
you walk to that booth in the back.

1387
01:31:52,803 --> 01:31:56,181
And you were so
incredibly beautiful.

1388
01:31:56,306 --> 01:31:58,892
I was afraid to go in.
And I--

1389
01:31:58,976 --> 01:32:01,061
- And I just stood there,
- Excuse me.

1390
01:32:01,186 --> 01:32:05,148
watching you sip your water
and talk to the waiter,

1391
01:32:05,273 --> 01:32:08,359
and I just fell in love
with you.

1392
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,195
George.

1393
01:32:13,531 --> 01:32:17,993
And when you left, I watched you
get in your V.W. bug...

1394
01:32:18,035 --> 01:32:22,330
and I saw your hair blowing out
the side of the window, and--

1395
01:32:22,414 --> 01:32:26,417
and you started to drive off, and I
just got afraid I'd never see you again.

1396
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:29,670
That's when I almost
ran you over.

1397
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:35,467
Thanks for telling me this,
George.

1398
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,303
Thanks for marrying me, Nina.

1399
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,432
We're ready.

1400
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:44,697
Dad, it's a boy.
We have a son.

1401
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:49,660
Congratulations.
How's Annie?

1402
01:33:49,744 --> 01:33:51,996
Perfect.
She's just perfect.

1403
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:55,416
He's so cute.
Seven pounds, nine ounces.

1404
01:33:55,582 --> 01:33:58,544
- How's Nina?
- I'm, uh, still waiting.

1405
01:33:58,669 --> 01:34:01,171
Yeah. Well, I guess
I-I better get back.

1406
01:34:01,213 --> 01:34:04,132
- Go.
- Okay.

1407
01:34:04,299 --> 01:34:07,093
It's wonderful.
Give Annie a kiss for me.

1408
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,137
I will.

1409
01:34:17,227 --> 01:34:19,146
I'm a grandfather.

1410
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:25,110
Mr. Banks?

1411
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:31,073
I have someone
that I'd like you to meet.

1412
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:41,208
It's a girl.

1413
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:44,044
I love girls.

1414
01:34:44,169 --> 01:34:47,422
- How's Nina?
- She's excellent. She did beautifully.

1415
01:34:55,012 --> 01:34:58,849
Am I nuts, or is this
the most beautiful baby ever born?

1416
01:34:58,974 --> 01:35:00,851
She's perfect.

1417
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:06,439
Oh. Would you tell Nina
she has a grandson?

1418
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:11,277
I will. Congratulations.

1419
01:35:11,444 --> 01:35:14,238
And thanks.

1420
01:35:16,156 --> 01:35:18,075
My pleasure.

1421
01:35:21,953 --> 01:35:24,706
Hey. Hey.

1422
01:35:25,957 --> 01:35:28,543
Hi, beauty. Hi.

1423
01:35:34,256 --> 01:35:36,800
Dad, you gotta see him.

1424
01:35:39,094 --> 01:35:41,513
Annie says he looks
just like you.

1425
01:35:41,596 --> 01:35:44,140
- Come here, you.
- Boy.

1426
01:35:44,224 --> 01:35:46,643
- Oh, that's yours?
- She's a daughter.

1427
01:35:46,768 --> 01:35:51,105
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Say. Say.

1428
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:13,042
It was at that moment, with my daughter
in one arm and my grandson in the other,

1429
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:16,128
that I realized life isn't
gonna get much better than this.

1430
01:36:20,215 --> 01:36:23,301
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh, let me see him.

1431
01:36:23,426 --> 01:36:25,970
- Ohh!
- Hi, Dad. Mom.

1432
01:36:26,137 --> 01:36:29,015
- There they are.
- Oh, my God. They're so sweet!

1433
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,770
Hello!

1434
01:36:38,315 --> 01:36:42,110
Before we knew it,
two months had passed,

1435
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:44,863
and it was time
to say good-bye.

1436
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:49,867
Have you got the stroller?

1437
01:36:50,076 --> 01:36:51,869
I guess we're off.

1438
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:57,624
That's it.

1439
01:36:57,749 --> 01:37:00,043
Mom?

1440
01:37:00,168 --> 01:37:02,045
- Oh, honey.
- I'll miss you.

1441
01:37:02,087 --> 01:37:05,215
- Knock 'em dead, okay?
- Okay, I'll try.

1442
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:08,551
- Let me hug George good-bye,
okay? Can I?
- Ohh. Yeah.

1443
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:12,763
- Hi. Hi. Are you George?
Oh, you're George.
- Can I get a little hug?

1444
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:14,807
- Can I hold him?
- Huh?
- Yeah, sure.

1445
01:37:14,932 --> 01:37:18,602
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- All right, honey. Okay.

1446
01:37:18,769 --> 01:37:21,354
- Two hands.
- Two hands.
- Two hands.

1447
01:37:22,772 --> 01:37:24,691
Yes. Good.

1448
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,780
- Well.
- Well, good-bye. Take care.

1449
01:37:30,947 --> 01:37:33,908
- Bye.
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

1450
01:37:35,784 --> 01:37:37,911
See you, George.

1451
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,871
We'll call ya.

1452
01:37:42,999 --> 01:37:46,461
Bye, Megan.
Call me, okay?

1453
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:49,255
I may be your nephew's mother,
but I'm still your big sister.

1454
01:37:55,761 --> 01:37:59,640
- Here. I got her a going-away present.
- Hey. Okay.

1455
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:08,189
Thanks.

1456
01:38:08,356 --> 01:38:11,275
You better get going if you're
gonna get to Phoenix before dark.

1457
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:14,403
Yeah, we better.

1458
01:38:14,445 --> 01:38:18,115
Okay, well, remember. If you're
ever up for a 3:00 a.m. feeding,
it'll be 6:00 in Boston.

1459
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:20,909
So, you know,
don't hesitate.

1460
01:38:27,206 --> 01:38:30,376
- I'll take him. Oh, sleepy.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1461
01:38:30,501 --> 01:38:33,546
I haven't had a chance to kiss
my grandson good-bye yet.

1462
01:38:33,629 --> 01:38:35,506
Hey, buddy.

1463
01:38:38,675 --> 01:38:41,761
I got ya. I got ya.

1464
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:45,557
We are named well, George.
Don't let the other kids tease
you. It's a good, solid name.

1465
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:48,518
- His last name's not Zenkman, is it?
- No.

1466
01:38:48,559 --> 01:38:52,313
Well, good. Hmm? Oh!
Oh, he got me.

1467
01:38:52,396 --> 01:38:55,482
Got me. Do it again.
Hey, do it again. Come on.

1468
01:38:55,566 --> 01:38:58,068
Oh! He got me.

1469
01:38:58,193 --> 01:39:00,070
Oh!

1470
01:39:01,488 --> 01:39:04,657
Hey. Yeah, I got ya.
I got ya.

1471
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:16,543
Well, I guess we gotta go.

1472
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:23,800
- Bye.
- I'll take him, George.
- Okay.

1473
01:39:23,842 --> 01:39:27,804
- There we go.
- Bye, Matty. Be good.

1474
01:39:27,845 --> 01:39:30,348
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1475
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:37,229
- Don't forget to buckle your seat belt.
- Okay, Dad.

1476
01:39:37,312 --> 01:39:40,190
- You too, Bryan.
- I will, Dad. So we'll
talk to you tonight?

1477
01:39:40,315 --> 01:39:43,985
And it's hard to see out the rear view,
so go slow and let people pass you.

1478
01:39:44,027 --> 01:39:46,487
We will, Dad.

1479
01:39:46,529 --> 01:39:49,198
- Okay.
- Bye.

1480
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,201
- Bye.
- Bye!

1481
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,286
Take care!

1482
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:04,045
- Bye!
- Bye!

1483
01:40:21,103 --> 01:40:23,355
- Okay.
- ''Okay'' what?

1484
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,566
Okay, let's finish
your science project.

1485
01:40:26,774 --> 01:40:30,236
- It's not due 'til Thursday.
- Let's get a jump on it then, huh?

1486
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:13,484
I don't look too old
to be your father, do I?

1487
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,448
Hey, you're already laughing
at me. What took you so long? Hey.

1488
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:24,619
Bet you can't do this.
I can teach you that.

1489
01:41:24,702 --> 01:41:26,996
I can teach you
all kinds of tricks.

1490
01:41:27,121 --> 01:41:30,666
How to pass behind your back,
how to sink it shooting backwards.

1491
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:33,085
I taught your big sister.
I can teach you.

1492
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:35,963
Megan, you wanna see the court?
I don't think you've seen it yet.

1493
01:41:36,046 --> 01:41:40,592
We got lights and everything.
We can play at night,
one-on-one, just you and me.

1494
01:41:43,887 --> 01:41:48,141
Grab your coat
and get your hat

1495
01:41:48,224 --> 01:41:52,269
Leave your worries
on the doorstep

1496
01:41:53,395 --> 01:41:56,815
And just direct your feet

1497
01:41:57,107 --> 01:42:01,486
To the sunny side
of the street

1498
01:42:01,611 --> 01:42:05,615
Can't you hear the pitter-pat

1499
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:10,661
Yeah, that happy tune
is your step

1500
01:42:10,828 --> 01:42:14,498
Life can be so sweet

1501
01:42:14,623 --> 01:42:18,168
On the sunny side
of the street

1502
01:42:18,293 --> 01:42:22,797
I used to walk
in the shade

1503
01:42:22,839 --> 01:42:27,427
With my blues on parade

1504
01:42:27,552 --> 01:42:31,847
But now I'm not afraid

1505
01:42:31,972 --> 01:42:36,060
'Cause this rover
has crossed over

1506
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:40,522
If I never have a cent

1507
01:42:40,647 --> 01:42:44,901
I'll be rich
as that Trump fella

1508
01:42:45,068 --> 01:42:49,530
There'll be gold
where I step my feet

1509
01:42:49,655 --> 01:42:52,366
On the sunny side

1510
01:42:53,951 --> 01:42:58,205
On the sunny side
of the street
