1
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,459
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

2
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,670
<i>Pick up.</i>

3
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,049
<i>Pick up.</i>

4
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,580
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,587
Come in.

6
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,552
Drink?

7
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,130
No, thank you.

8
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,849
Perfect.

9
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,440
This way.

10
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,734
Slowly.

11
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,377
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

12
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,884
<i>Pick up.</i>

13
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,551
<i>Pick up.</i>

14
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,389
<i>Brandon?</i>

15
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,231
<i>Brandon?</i>

16
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,577
<i>Brandon, where are you?</i>

17
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,910
<i>Brandon? Brandon?</i>

18
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,587
<i>Brandon?</i>

19
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,938
<i>This is me calling you.</i>

20
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,352
<i>Fuck!</i>

21
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,140
"I find you disgusting."

22
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,611
"I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive."

23
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,194
This is what the cynics used to say.

24
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,119
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.

25
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,990
They would say,
"Can we stop this virus?"

26
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,792
As if it was a negative progression.

27
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,587
But it's growing.

28
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:45,260
More and more, with a momentum
that is unstoppable.

29
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,137
Now some kid snorts the entire load
of his mother's spice cupboard.

30
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,931
Post that on YouTube.

31
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,679
They would watch as it becomes
the buzz word

32
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,635
amongst high school students everywhere.

33
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,018
Eventually, the cynicism is turning into awe.

34
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,294
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?

35
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,876
They took it.

36
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,763
Yeah, I know.
Someone could have told me.

37
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,932
Some kind of virus.

38
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,806
Cool.

39
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,138
Thank you.

40
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,541
<i>Okay, me again.</i>

41
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:31,836
<i>I'm dying. I have cancer.
I have one week to live.</i>

42
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,093
<i>The very worst kind of cancer.</i>

43
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,890
<i>Of the vulva...</i>

44
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,855
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,301
You're such a dick.

46
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,478
What are you doing, man?

47
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,234
All right, gentlemen.
If you just please make yourselves at home.

48
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,233
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,171
<i>It falls upon me as your beloved boss
to propose a toast.</i>

50
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,342
<i>To success.</i>

51
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,095
I just hope my wife appreciates it.

52
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,882
Get a new tie, please.

53
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,263
Jesus Christ.

54
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,720
Oh, my goodness.

55
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,349
I love women in suits.
I love women in suits.

56
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,816
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life.

57
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,314
- She's beautiful.
- Gray suit?

58
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,688
- I'm gonna go talk to her. Count me down.
- You should go talk to her.

59
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,398
Yeah, you should.

60
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,108
Five, four, three, two, one.

61
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,693
Boom.

62
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,323
Have fun.

63
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,032
Twenty bucks says he fucks it up.

64
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,208
Incoming.

65
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,540
Hi, excuse me. Listen,
I don't want to beat around the bush.

66
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,591
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
My name's David.

67
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,134
Hi, David. Elizabeth.
Nice to meet you.

68
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,507
Elizabeth. That's a beautiful name.

69
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,054
- Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be rude.
- Loren.

70
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,255
Hi, how are you? David.
Nice to meet you.

71
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,340
Rachel.

72
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,892
Listen, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?

73
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,219
- Sure. Why not?
- I would love that.

74
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,054
That would be my pleasure.
What are you guys drinking?

75
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,980
- Well, we were thinking shots.
- You were thinking shots?

76
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,309
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

77
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,685
- Bring it on.
- Lovet it.

78
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,939
Excuse me. Bartender?
Can we get four shots of your finest tequila?

79
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,023
Thank you very much.

80
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,201
I can see you're very successful.

81
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,279
I think part of the secret to my success
is attention to detail.

82
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,363
Detail?

83
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,413
Play the game.

84
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,490
What game?

85
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,745
Okay. Blue or green?

86
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,418
I like games. I like this game.

87
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,417
Blue. Green. Green, it's green.

88
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,873
That's brown.

89
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,799
I don't know how you change
the color of your eyes like that.

90
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,002
How do you do that so quickly?
That's amazing. That's a real talent.

91
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,712
- Detail man.
- Hey, buddy.

92
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,674
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.

93
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,305
I want you to know you fucking nailed it.
You're the man.

94
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,762
Your pitch, amazing.
Listen, we're playing a game here.

95
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,188
Close your eyes again.
Blue or green?

96
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,144
- Brown.
- Fuck off.

97
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,352
All right. You, Loren,
close your eyes.

98
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,357
- Blue.
- Blue.

99
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,438
- You're just making that up.
- See? He's good.

100
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,273
He's just picking colors randomly.

101
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,323
You can have his shot.

102
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,447
Excuse me.
We need another shot, please.

103
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,329
You can put these on me.

104
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,453
No, I told you, I had it.

105
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,579
No, I have it.

106
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,122
- I'll get the next round.
- Sure.

107
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,953
You're a strong, independent woman.
I like that.

108
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,835
Thank you. Cheers.
To nailing it...

109
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,961
- To nailing it.
- To nailing it.

110
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,041
- To nailing it.
- and to success.

111
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,126
Yes.

112
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,718
I love that.

113
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,716
Oh, fuck.

114
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,970
So what do you girls do for fun?

115
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,554
Fun? Karate.

116
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,400
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song,

117
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,978
I would love it
if you would dance with me

118
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,733
to this song that I wrote for you.

119
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,406
Come on. Let's go on the dance floor.
One song.

120
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,361
Yeah, come on. You're a fun girl.
It'll be fun.

121
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,071
I'll bring her back. Swear to God.
Come on, come on, it's fun.

122
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,706
<i>Toe to toe
Dancing very close.</i>

123
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,669
Spinning, spinning, spinning...

124
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,549
I'm grabbing her purse
'cause she's gonna get robbed and roofied.

125
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,047
- Dance?
- No.

126
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,174
- Are you sure? Okay.
- I'm sure.

127
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,180
<i>Wall to wall.</i>

128
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,604
<i>People hypnotized.</i>

129
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,231
<i>And they're stepping lightly.</i>

130
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,690
<i>Hang each night in.</i>

131
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,947
<i>Rapture.</i>

132
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,161
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on.

133
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,205
I just gotta talk to you
one more time.

134
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,782
Listen, your eyes, they're beautiful.

135
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,162
You know why I didn't get it right
the first time?

136
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,370
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see them again.

137
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,170
Look at those eyes.
I know the color of your eyes!

138
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,380
- David! Come on!
- Come on, we love that game.

139
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,924
That's so much fun.

140
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,673
It's okay, 'cause I'm going this way.

141
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,425
Hey, man, he's going uptown.

142
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,058
Come on.

143
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,945
Okay.

144
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,738
I'll see you tomorrow.

145
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,500
Hey. Want a ride?

146
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,214
Sure.

147
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,235
<i>I want your love
I want your love.</i>

148
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,364
<i>I want your love
I want...</i>

149
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,910
I'll fucking kill you!

150
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,993
What the fuck?

151
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,703
Fuck!

152
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,159
Jesus Christ, Sissy!

153
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,870
Fuck! Brandon, don't you fucking knock?

154
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,830
What the fuck? Why would I knock?
I live here!

155
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,127
Oh, fuck!

156
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
How'd you get in?

157
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,008
You gave me fucking keys.

158
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,630
Fuck.

159
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,601
You fucking scared me.

160
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,679
Don't I always say call me first
if you're coming into town'?

161
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,273
Oh, my God!
I called you so many times.

162
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,562
You have a fucking baseball bat?

163
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,738
Yeah.

164
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,117
What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.

165
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,243
Shampoo.

166
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,949
Is it for grooming dogs?

167
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:46,082
<i>I want your love
I want your love.</i>

168
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,339
Good to see you.

169
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,919
<i>I want your love
I want your love.</i>

170
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,720
- Lock the door next time.
- Yeah.

171
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,887
Don't use all the towels.

172
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,010
I won't.

173
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:02,558
<i>I want your love
I want your love.</i>

174
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,979
<i>I want your love
I want your love.</i>

175
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,787
<i>I want your love
I want your love</i>

176
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,398
But I want you.

177
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,275
I don't want anyone else.
There is no one else.

178
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,905
I love you. I'll do anything.

179
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,036
I'll do anything.

180
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,373
Please don't say that.

181
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
Please don't say that.

182
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,548
I love you. I love you.

183
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,559
I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

184
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,439
I don't have to go out!
I don't have to go out!

185
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,767
I don't even fucking want to go out!

186
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,229
I can stay with you.
I don't care. I don't care.

187
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,361
I don't need anybody else.
I love you.

188
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,446
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, please.

189
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,373
I love you. I love you.

190
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,455
Please.

191
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:53,957
I feel sick. I feel really sick.

192
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,592
- Morning.
- Morning.

193
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,053
Nice earring. Hot date?

194
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,898
Juice?

195
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,991
Will you use a glass?

196
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,817
Sorry.

197
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,503
You're going gray.

198
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,752
Do you think I look fat?

199
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,972
Do you think I look fat?

200
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,146
Sit down.

201
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,720
Fuck you!

202
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,437
I'm doing a couple of gigs.

203
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,396
Yeah. Sure.

204
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,238
Can I stay?

205
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
You want toast?

206
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,947
Just for a few days?

207
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,000
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.

208
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,710
- Mark?
- Please.

209
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,046
Jesus, Sissy.

210
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,673
What do you expect?

211
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,964
Pretty please?

212
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,220
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it

213
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,846
before I leave every morning.

214
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,769
I will. I promise. I will.

215
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,267
Okay. Okay. Okay.

216
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,312
We leave in 15.

217
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,735
Okay!

218
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,078
So good!

219
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,134
Stop fucking around.

220
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,350
- Leave it.
- You have fluff.

221
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,477
I like it there.

222
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,704
- How are you for money?
- I'm good.

223
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,664
- 'Cause if you need some money...
- Honestly,

224
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,204
I even make money now and everything.

225
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,411
Yeah, sure.

226
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,871
Huge amounts.

227
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,547
What, you collect it in that hat?

228
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,428
You should come and hear me.

229
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,054
Yeah, I will.

230
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,131
"Yeah, I will"?

231
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,512
Like, "Yeah, I will,"
like last time?

232
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,601
Please come.

233
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,273
Where'd you get this, anyway?

234
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,941
It's vintage.

235
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,018
Yeah, I can see that.

236
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,566
Do you like?

237
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,650
Yeah.

238
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,494
Please come.

239
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,582
Okay, I will.

240
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,797
Sorry.

241
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,263
Fuck, my computer.

242
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,094
Well, well, well.

243
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,429
Morning, asshole.

244
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,765
Look who's decided to grace us
with his presence.

245
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,939
Yeah.

246
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,517
Don't tell me. No cabs.

247
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,648
No, your wife wouldn't let me
leave this morning.

248
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,230
Hey. That's not cool.

249
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,780
You should be so lucky.

250
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,985
Any calls?

251
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,367
Yes. Like, 50.

252
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,962
Hey! Heads up, buddy.

253
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,415
So, how'd it go last night?

254
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,757
Got home, went to bed.
Good night.

255
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:10,383
Right, right.

256
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,179
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.

257
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,803
Yeah, my sister's playing downtown somewhere.

258
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,603
She's playing?

259
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,523
She's a musician.
Well, she's a singer.

260
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,148
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what?
That sounds like a lot of fun.

261
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,571
And that will ruin your enamel.

262
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,628
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.

263
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,671
Good evening.

264
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
Evening.

265
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,129
Reservation. Sullivan?

266
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,504
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?

267
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,056
Thank you.

268
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,508
There you are.

269
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,219
Right this way, please.

270
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:05,818
Look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.

271
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,311
Nice pick.

272
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,578
I forget how beautiful the city is.

273
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,572
Thank you.

274
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,165
Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?
What can I get you?

275
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,342
Your accent. Are you...
You're from...

276
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,714
Brazil.

277
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,146
Rio?

278
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,731
São Paulo.

279
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,558
That is a beautiful city. That's...

280
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,600
You've been there?

281
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,393
Once or twice.

282
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,392
Can we get two dry martinis with olives?

283
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,688
And a little bit later,
why don't you come by for a drink with us?

284
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,777
I'll make sure I get those drinks.

285
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,274
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

286
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,612
She would be so offended
if I didn't try.

287
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,489
Unbelievable.

288
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:12,336

She's good! She's good!

324
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,716
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,302
- I'm David.
- Sissy.

326
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,928
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet...

327
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,354
I think you are absolutely fantastic

328
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,681
and you look great in the dress, too.

329
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,765
Please, sit down.

330
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,100
Thank you.

331
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,819
What did you think?

332
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,693
Yeah, it was interesting.

333
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,319
What do you mean?

334
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,234
No, it was...

335
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,320
It was good. It was good.

336
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,247
It was good?

337
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,249
He was crying. He was crying.

338
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,622
There were tears coming down his face.

339
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,830
I saw it. You made a grown man cry.

340
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,913
Really?

341
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,419
I'm gonna get some drinks.

342
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,627
That's a great idea.
Why don't you get a round for the table, buddy?

343
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,342
Okay. I'm really sorry about that.

344
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,561
He's had a rough day at work.
I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

345
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,104
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

346
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,556
So you guys grew up in Jersey?

347
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,606
Yeah.

348
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,184
- You still live there?
- God, no.

349
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,816
That's good. That's good.
Where do you live now?

350
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,111
Kind of all over the place.

351
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,359
Yeah?

352
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,198
What's the last city you've been to?

353
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,321
L.A.

354
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,422
Los Angeles?

355
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,073
Oh, boy. You like it there?

356
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,120
I mean, I'm going back.

357
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,492
That must mean you love it then, huh?

358
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,574
No! I can't even fucking drive.

359
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,292
- Wait a minute. You can't drive?
- It's a nightmare.

360
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,877
- Nope.
- Why not?

361
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,626
I tried when I was a kid
and I was horrible.

362
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,423
Wait, how old were you
when you quit driving?

363
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,296
- Sixteen.
- You were 16 years old?

364
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,638
So, wait a minute.
How do you get along in Los Angeles?

365
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,760
I take the bus.

366
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,091
No. No, no, no.

367
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,269
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.

368
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,345
What happened to your arm here?

369
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,477
When I was a kid, I was bored.

370
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,682
You must have been really bored.

371
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,143
I was.

372
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,977
All right, we've got a problem.

373
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,779
Your sister cannot be
taking the bus anywhere, okay?

374
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,322
I know a guy who owns
a car rental company.

375
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,240
We're gonna get you a car,
we're gonna drive around in circles

376
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,159
in a parking lot and you are going
to learn how to drive.

377
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,486
Not stick, automatic.
It's a little easier.

378
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,536
I would love that.

379
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,205
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet,

380
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,032
we're gonna get you a golf cart

381
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,662
and you will drive
the golf cart around.

382
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,541
Now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.

383
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,042
A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue, huh?

384
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,041
You know, they should. They should.

385
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,296
It would be a lot cleaner and greener.

386
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,674
It would be great for the city.
Brandon, what do you think?

387
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,471
- Sounds great.
- Yeah?

388
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,260
I love your brother.
What an amazing man.

389
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,771
- How long are you here for?
- I don't know.

390
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,519
You don't know?

391
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:29,814
Can I see you again? Please?
Is that too forward? I find you fascinating.

392
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,858
I really do.
I think you're a fascinating creature.

393
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,363
I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we...

394
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,035
This is a celebration,
let's get champagne.

395
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,533
- Yes! Champagne!
- Champagne for everybody.

396
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,864
The whole table! Come on.

397
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,948
Champagne.

398
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,508
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out, get out.

399
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,054
Come here, come here, come here.

400
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:00,306
No!

401
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,513
Come on, come on with me.

402
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,063
- Get off. Get off.
- How did that work?

403
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,265
Get off me.

404
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,691
Come on, come on.

405
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,520
Champagne on your dress, that's...

406
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,567
Well, I'm hot, I'm hot.

407
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,768
You are hot.

408
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,533
You are?

409
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,602
No! You're crushing me.

410
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,473
I need to take this off. I'm hot.

411
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,059
I need to take it off. I'm hot.

412
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,687
Nice sheets.

413
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,072
Aren't they nice sheets?
Bed Bath & Beyond.

414
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,407
Stop.

415
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,168
What if I kiss you right here?

416
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,183
How about here?

417
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,354
Yeah?

418
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,654
Shit.

419
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,327
What?

420
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,713
Stop talking!

421
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,756
I have to be up and out by 7:00.

422
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,841
It's cold.

423
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,355
Sissy, get out of my room.

424
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,897
Sissy, get out of my room.

425
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,156
Get the fuck out! Get out!

426
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,335
Hey, slacker. Your computer's back.

427
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,529
Dave's looking for you.

428
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,194
- Yeah. It was really great last night.
- <i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>

429
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,530
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
Thanks for calling.

430
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,663
Hey, buddy. Listen,
we said an hour French,

431
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,039
and then Isobel's gonna pick you up

432
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,457
because Mommy's picking up Nathan.

433
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,130
All right? You can go after.

434
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,628
<i>Yeah, I know, but Mommy says I can't.</i>

435
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,776
Okay. Well, let's go talk to Mommy.

436
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,175
<i>She's all the way downstairs.</i>

437
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,468
Well, go downstairs and tell her

438
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,472
that Daddy said it's okay
for you to go to Jason's.

439
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,429
Huh? Come on. How about that? Do it.

440
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,310
- You can do it. Get up.
- <i>Okay.</i>

441
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,107
Yeah.

442
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,152
<i>Mommy? Mommy?</i>

443
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,150
What's up, man?

444
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,402
Steven said you wanted to see me.

445
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,695
Yes.

446
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,742
Dude, 9:00 this morning,
where were you?

447
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,201
- Dentist. Root canal.
- Oh, shit.

448
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,533
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who did you see?

449
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,869
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.

450
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,172
Good. Good. You're stinging the
company health plan, I hope, right?

451
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,170
- Sure.
- That's what it's there for, man.

452
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,876
All right, brother.

453
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,879
Listen, one more thing.

454
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,516
Your hard drive is filthy, all right?
We got your computer back.

455
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,936
I mean, it is dirty.

456
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,644
I'm talking like hoes,
sluts, anal, double anal,

457
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,725
penetration, interracial facial, man.

458
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,402
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.

459
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,949
You think it was your intern?

460
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,530
On my hard drive?

461
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,738
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.

462
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,123
And we're blowing our wad in cash,
you know'?

463
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,874
It takes a really, really sick fuck
to spend all day on that shit.

464
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,704
<i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>

465
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,789
Yeah. Hey, buddy. What'd she say?

466
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,500
<i>She said I can go to Jason's
for a half hour,</i>

467
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,298
<i>but I have to be home
by 5:00 for dinner.</i>

468
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,799
Okay. That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.

469
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,301
- You got everything you want.
- <i>Yup.</i>

470
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,552
- You happy?
- <i>Yup.</i>

471
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,225
Yeah. You better be.
Get out of here.

472
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,969
<i>Okay. All right, see you.</i>

473
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,863
Hey. You like your sugar?

474
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,824
I do.

475
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,601
Hey.

476
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,141
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,851
Did you find it okay?

478
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,483
Yes, I'm glad you made it.

479
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,614
Yeah?

480
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,157
I'm late. Sorry.

481
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,203
You look handsome.

482
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,080
- You look amazing.
- Hi.

483
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,878
- Thank you.
- How are you doing tonight?

484
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,626
- Thank you.
- Okay.

485
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,255
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?

486
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,506
Sure.

487
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,806
The soup of the day is tomato
with basil oil and parmesan crostini.

488
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,259
The special is marinated swordfish,

489
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,512
tabouleh and Moroccan charmoula.

490
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,891
It's really good.

491
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,098
We're also serving
a DeBragga and Spitler.

492
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,351
New York Strip with a side order of fries,

493
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,028
and the salad is snow pea and radish
with a cider vinaigrette.

494
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,775
Can I start you off
with a sparkling water?

495
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,401
- Tap water's fine.
- Okay.

496
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,237
And the wine menu is right next to...
Yup, there you go.

497
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,072
- You want some wine?
- Sure.

498
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,491
White? Red?

499
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,584
Red. Maybe...

500
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,209
Pinot Noir is light,

501
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,711
if you like it, like, light.

502
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,379
Great.

503
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,760
Okay. I'll be back.

504
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:52,940
So...

505
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,857
Where do you live?

506
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,185
Brooklyn.

507
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,440
Nice.

508
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,693
Born and raised. Where you from?

509
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:06,907
I was born in Ireland
and we moved here when I was a teen.

510
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,075
Did you get back much?
Thank you.

511
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,748
A couple times.

512
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,876
A big family? You miss them?

513
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,587
I have a sister.

514
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,585
I have two.

515
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,635
Oh, yeah?

516
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,803
Yeah.

517
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,839
Older? Younger?

518
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,515
Older and younger.

519
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,514
I'm right in the middle.

520
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,891
What?

521
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,976
Just wondering.

522
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,521
Are you nervous?

523
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,822
Why would I be nervous?

524
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,320
You look a little nervous.

525
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,742
Do I?

526
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,493
No.

527
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,661
Well, what's a date?

528
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,330
It's no big deal.

529
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,743
It took me an hour
to figure out what to wear.

530
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,171
You chose wisely.

531
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,247
Yeah.

532
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:04,586
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.

533
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,046
Great.

534
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,015
Yeah. I haven't even looked at this.

535
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,345
I'll have the lamb.

536
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,395
The lamb.

537
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,690
I'll have the lamb, too.
That sounds great.

538
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,234
Okay. No appetizer?

539
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,945
- I'm fine.
- No.

540
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,318
Okay. And how would you like the lamb?

541
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,899
Medium.

542
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,826
We recommend it pretty pink.

543
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,034
- Okay.
- Yeah?

544
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,538
Okay. Pink it is.

545
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,130
Thank you. Excuse me.

546
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,718
So you seeing anyone at the moment?

547
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,092
No, I'm not.
Are you seeing anyone?

548
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,881
No.

549
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,342
No? Really?

550
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,971
Why is that?

551
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,523
I don't know.
It's just the way it is.

552
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,101
It's just the way it is.
Yeah, I...

553
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,655
Actually, I'm separated.

554
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,525
Tragedy.

555
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,985
Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.

556
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,659
Okay.

557
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,786
You were married for long?

558
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,076
No.

559
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,036
Did we decide on the wine?

560
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,549
Well, yeah.
Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

561
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,298
Yeah, great. Great choice. Okay.

562
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,883
I wasn't married long. Gave it a shot.
It didn't really work out.

563
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,476
No.

564
00:51:36,535 --> 00:51:37,512
What?

565
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,938
You just seem, like...

566
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,014
What?

567
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,724
Averse to the whole idea.

568
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,024
Well, yeah.

569
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,774
I just don't understand
why people would want to get married.

570
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,824
Especially nowadays, I mean, it's...
You know?

571
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,446
I don't see the point.

572
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,204
In relationships?

573
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,782
It doesn't seem realistic.

574
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,705
Are you serious? I mean...

575
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,539
Yeah. I am, really.

576
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,796
Well, then, you know,
why are we here,

577
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,503
if we don't matter to one another?

578
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,587
Well...

579
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,762
Why are you here?

580
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,487
The food is supposed to be great here.

581
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,765
No, no, no.
I'm not saying it like that.

582
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,188
I mean... I just mean...
You know?

583
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,355
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...

584
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,150
I mean, you come to restaurants,

585
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,230
you see couples sitting together,

586
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,987
and they don't even speak to one another,

587
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,818
they don't have anything to say.

588
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,747
They probably don't have to speak
because they're connected.

589
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,166
Or they're just bored
with one another.

590
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,335
Every...

591
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,912
Here we go.

592
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,587
What's your longest relationship?

593
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,259
Exactly.

594
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,012
That's... You can pour.

595
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,092
Sure.

596
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,600
Four months.

597
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,947
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.

598
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,192
I did. For four months.

599
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,369
For four months.

600
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,851
Thank you.

601
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,310
Look, touch that.

602
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:47,850
Your head?

603
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,486
No, no, no.

604
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,689
You're such a weirdo.

605
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,150
No, seriously, seriously, seriously.
Touch it.

606
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,906
Okay.

607
00:53:58,986 --> 00:53:59,987
Oh, my God.

608
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,367
Do you feel that?

609
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,915
Yeah, what is it?

610
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,833
- It's a remnant.
- A remnant?

611
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,787
Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

612
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,464
There's only a few of us left
since the <i>Homo sapiens</i> took over.

613
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,540
Okay.

614
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,423
That would explain the forehead.

615
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,469
What's that supposed to mean?

616
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,546
"What's that supposed to mean?"

617
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,755
What do you mean?

618
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,052
Seriously, how did you get it?
What is it?

619
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,303
I used to play this game
with my cousin...

620
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,691
where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.

621
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,736
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.

622
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,279
I was knocked out
for five or 10 minutes.

623
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,776
I peed my pants.

624
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:46,918
If you had a choice to live
in the past or the future,

625
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,120
and you could be anything
you wanted to be,

626
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,876
what would you be?

627
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,090
What would you be?

628
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,222
Well, I always wanted
to be a musician in the '60s.

629
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,675
That's cool. A musician?

630
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,101
Yeah.

631
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,803
'60s is tough, though.

632
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,934
I saw <i>Gimme Shelter</i> recently,
you know,

633
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,981
the Rolling Stones documentary?

634
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,058
Yeah.

635
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,358
It kind of seemed like hell.

636
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,693
What?

637
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,364
Yeah, the '60s would be, like,
the last place I would want to be.

638
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,440
No way!

639
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,525
Yes.

640
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:22,027
Chaos!

641
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,489
So where and what would you wanna be?

642
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,124
You know, here, now.

643
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,628
That's boring.

644
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,674
Fuck you.

645
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,647
Okay. Well, this is me.

646
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,723
This is you?

647
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,150
This is me.

648
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,355
Thank you very much, Brandon.

649
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,528
Thank you very much, Marianne.

650
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,034
We should do this again.

651
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,792
Right.

652
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,512
So is that a yes?

653
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,928
Maybe, yeah.

654
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,570
Hello? Sissy?

655
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,034
Oh, fuck!

656
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,537
Fuck!

657
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,915
Fuck!

658
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,875
What, are you fucking spying on me?

659
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,381
Lock the fucking door, Brandon.

660
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,461
Are you fucking spying?

661
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,841
"Are you fucking spying?"

662
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,591
- Fuck! Brandon...
- What do you want?

663
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,472
You wanna fight?
You wanna fight?

664
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,427
- You wanna fight?
- You want some of this?

665
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,763
What do you want from me?

666
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,097
- What do you want from me?
- Brandon!

667
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,272
- What do you want?
- Get off me!

668
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,520
Why did you come here? Why?

669
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,600
Get off me! Get off me!

670
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,231
- Why? Why?
- Get off me!

671
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,482
You're fucking hurting me.

672
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,813
Talk to me! Fucking bitch!

673
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,194
Get the fuck off,
you fucking weirdo.

674
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,900
- Fucking slut!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

675
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,472
Brandon?

676
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,094
Brandon, I'm sorry.

677
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,118
<i>Hey, where's Brandon?</i>

678
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,667
<i>Are you Brandon's girlfriend?</i>

679
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,791
<i>Do you wanna play?</i>

680
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,628
<i>You wanna play with my tits?</i>

681
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,968
<i>I know Brandon would really like it,</i>

682
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:12,136
<i>and I know exactly what Brandon likes.</i>

683
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,541
Come on.

684
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,844
Where are you taking me?

685
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,766
Come on. You'll see.

686
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,726
No, where are we going?

687
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,019
Come on.

688
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,444
You want a drink?

689
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,824
What are you looking at?

690
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,531
This view is amazing.

691
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,008
Hey.

692
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,748
Are they vintage?

693
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,333
A little bit.

694
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:50,585
I love it.

695
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,463
Oh, yeah.

696
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,929
Brandon?

697
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,897
You know, it's cool. It's okay.

698
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,661
Should I go?

699
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,283
Sure.

700
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,030
I can walk you down.

701
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,457
That's okay.

702
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,392
Can I get you a drink?

703
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,891
No.

704
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,783
Fuck.

705
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,360
Need a hand?

706
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:18,242
No. The hook's odd.

707
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,909
There you go.

708
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,946
David?

709
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,453
Pick up.

710
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,874
I take it you're at your pottery class.

711
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,552
Have you eaten?

712
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,925
No.

713
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,551
Are you hungry?

714
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,178
No.

715
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,650
Can you just give me a hug?

716
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,684
He's not gonna screw you again.

717
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,362
You left him a message,
didn't you?

718
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,815
You can't help yourself.

719
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,276
It's disgusting.

720
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,239
Why are you so fucking angry?

721
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,369
Why am I so fucking angry?

722
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,877
That's my boss.

723
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,675
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.

724
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,383
What's the matter with you?

725
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,595
You know he's got a family, right?

726
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,313
You know he's got a family?

727
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,481
No.

728
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,185
You didn't see the wedding ring
on his finger?

729
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,736
No.

730
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,314
You're a liar.

731
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,906
I'm sorry.

732
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:08,500
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.

733
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,918
Well, at least I say I'm sorry.

734
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,997
Try doing something.

735
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,091
Actions count, not words.

736
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,050
I'm sorry.

737
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,723
I'm sorry.

738
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,101
I fucked up.

739
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,394
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

740
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,857
Some people fuck up all the time.

741
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,995
Look, just forget it.

742
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,330
This isn't working out. Obviously.

743
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,089
You need to find somewhere else to live.

744
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,129
I don't have anywhere else to go.

745
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,507
This isn't about him.

746
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:11,805
I make you angry all the time
and I don't know why.

747
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,601
No. You trap me.

748
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,073
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.

749
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,194
"I've got nowhere else to go."

750
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,867
I mean, what sort of
fucking shit is that?

751
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,414
You're my brother.

752
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,833
So what?
I'm responsible for you?

753
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,910
Yes.

754
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,370
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

755
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,670
No, I didn't give birth to you.

756
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,374
I didn't bring you into this world.

757
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,422
You're my brother, I'm your sister.
We're family.

758
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,753
We're meant to look after each other.

759
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:44,837
You're not looking after me.

760
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,173
I'm looking after myself.

761
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,757
I'm trying.
I'm trying to help you.

762
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,265
How are you helping me, huh?
How are you helping me?

763
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,433
How are you helping me?

764
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,434
Huh? Look at me.
How are you helping me?

765
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,405
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.

766
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,733
Do you understand me?
You're a burden.

767
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,409
You're just fucking dragging me down.

768
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,828
How are you helping me?

769
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:12,498
You can't even clean up after yourself.

770
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,874
Stop playing the victim.

771
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,502
I'm not playing the fucking victim.

772
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,876
If I left, I would never
hear from you again.

773
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,087
Don't you think that's sad?

774
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,216
Don't you think that's sad?

775
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,894
You're my brother.

776
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,280
Why is it always so dramatic with you?

777
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,982
Everything is always
the end of the world.

778
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,660
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.

779
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,576
I don't wanna talk.

780
01:14:55,741 --> 01:15:00,713
Try not talking.
Try just listening or thinking for a change.

781
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:04,008
Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.

782
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,335
I've got my own fucking apartment.

783
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,216
Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

784
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,342
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.

785
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,800
You have a job and an apartment.
I should be in awe of you.

786
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,385
Well, at least I'm responsible for it.

787
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,766
At least I don't depend on people
all the time.

788
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,473
You're a dependency. You're a parasite.

789
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,773
You don't have anybody.

790
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,898
You don't have anybody.
You have me and your fucking pervert boss.

791
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,981
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?

792
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,575
Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.
Not from you.

793
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,659
Whatever.

794
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,867
I'm going out.

795
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,577
Great. And then you'll come back

796
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,537
and we'll just have the same
fucking conversation again.

797
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,622
No, you'll move out.

798
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,965
And then I'll never hear
from you again?

799
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:07,165
Hey.

800
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,059
<i>You wanna get out of here?</i>

801
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,897
I could take you somewhere.

802
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,779
What, are you with someone?

803
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,664
Does he go down on you?

804
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,544
I do.

805
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,006
That's what I like to do.

806
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,309
<i>I like the way it feels.</i>

807
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,055
<i>I like the way it's just me and it.</i>

808
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,279
I wanna taste you.

809
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,487
I wanna slip my tongue inside you,

810
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,987
just as you come.

811
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,169
You want me to make you come?

812
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:19,343
I can do that.
Want me to do that?

813
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,173
What's up, babe?

814
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,434
I was just getting some drinks.

815
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,636
Yeah, huh?

816
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,961
Not tonight, buddy.

817
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,629
I said not tonight.

818
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,148
I was just telling
your pretty girlfriend here,

819
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,147
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.

820
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,320
I mean, bone her real hard.

821
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,647
Till she's clawing up my back.

822
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,947
He's kidding.

823
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,650
This guy's funny.

824
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,871
After I fuck her hard up the ass,

825
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,667
I'll put my balls in her mouth
while I come in her face.

826
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,498
You won't let me fuck you in the ass?

827
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,545
Christ.

828
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,837
You get to fuck her in the ass?

829
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:35,914
You know.

830
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,751
Tell me more, man,
'cause I'm fucking loving this.

831
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,131
- Smell it.
- Yo!

832
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,429
Jesus, come on. You motherfucker.

833
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,807
Hey, Romeo.

834
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,214
<i>Brandon, it's Sissy.</i>

835
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,417
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

836
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,637
<i>Please, will you pick up
the fucking phone?</i>

837
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,103
<i>Brandon, I need you.</i>

838
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,657
<i>We're not bad people.</i>

839
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,957
<i>We just come from a bad place.</i>

840
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,333
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.</i>

841
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,340
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

842
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:37,256
<i>at this time,
due to a police investigation,</i>

843
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:40,009
<i>we have to discharge this train.</i>

844
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,135
<i>Please follow the conductor
to the rear of the train.</i>

845
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,436
Watch your step between cars.

846
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,563
Watch your step.

847
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,308
Follow me, please. Follow me.

848
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:57,273
Watch your step. This way.
This way. Quickly.

849
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:00,401
- This way. Nothing to see. Move on.
- Right this way, please.

850
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:10,332
<i>This is Sissy. Leave a message.
Don't if you're an asshole.</i>

851
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,428
<i>This is Sissy. Leave a...</i>

852
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,756
Shit!

853
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:31,637
Shithead.

854
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:01,644
God!

855
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:05,977
English - US
