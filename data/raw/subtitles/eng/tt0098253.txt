1
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:36,209
Fenix.

2
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,875
Please...

3
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:44,744
Eat like a human being.

4
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:04,208
Grr!

5
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,036
You can't just stay here all the time,

6
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,166
not seeing anyone.

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,249
Now come on, stand up.

8
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:35,624
Come on now. Your foot.

9
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:40,289
That's it.

10
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,415
The other one.

11
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:08,158
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo,
the greatest show on earth!

12
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,619
The death-defying trapeze girl!

13
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:15,032
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!

14
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,909
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,748
The elephant from darkest Africa!

16
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,661
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!

17
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,954
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!

18
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,781
Aladin, the world's smallest
elephant trainer! Roll up! Roll up!

19
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:40,280
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...

20
00:03:56,832 --> 00:04:00,279
Papa! Wake up, wake up! They're here!

21
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,905
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!

22
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,202
Why does he drink so much?

23
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,118
My mother says
he killed a woman in America.

24
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,243
And he can't go back?

25
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,829
Tough life. Come on,
let's go see the new act.

26
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:31,951
- The new act?
- Yes!

27
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,902
The Tattooed Woman!

28
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,618
Now come on.

29
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,912
Come on! Come on!

30
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:54,911
Come on! Don't be afraid!

31
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:57,532
Come on!

32
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,075
You can't do anything!

33
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:04,651
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.

34
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:08,079
Come on, don't just stand there!

35
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,032
I should have left you in the poorhouse
when your mother died. Now practice!

36
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,158
Or I'll beat you.

37
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,283
What's goin' on here?

38
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,238
Oh, Mr Orgo.

39
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,449
Here I am.

40
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,112
Hmm.

41
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,283
Ahh!

42
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:44,694
- The ocean!
- Oh!

43
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,991
- Ooh!
- It's a peacock!

44
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,242
- Ooh!
- It's the moon.

45
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,031
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.

46
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,070
- And a crab!
- The ocean!

47
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,069
Ooh!

48
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,824
Nice to meet you.

49
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,947
Come with me.

50
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,323
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr Orgo.

51
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,281
Ohh! Ah!

52
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,068
Blasphemy! Idiots!

53
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:40,194
Sacrilege!

54
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,186
Mother! Mother!

55
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,646
Blasphemy! This is our church!

56
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:09,356
All right, get them off my land right now
or I'll run 'em over!

57
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:13,985
Go ahead - but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!

58
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:16,441
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!

59
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:20,728
No!

60
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,565
No! Don't hurt her!

61
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,394
We are not afraid of you.

62
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,227
♫ El fin del mundo se acerca ya

63
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:19,480
♫ Toda esperanza se acabará

64
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:26,318
♫ Ya las señales se están cumpliendo

65
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:32,522
♫ Se están cumpliendo como escrito está

66
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:40,017
♫ Querido amigo, Lirio te llama

67
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:46,647
♫ No hagas duro tu corazón

68
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:53,687
♫ Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma

69
00:10:55,486 --> 00:11:00,557
♫ Y tendrás parte en la resurrección ♫

70
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,728
Peace! I bring peace.

71
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,354
- Come now.
- Father.

72
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,356
Peace.

73
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:17,436
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.

74
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,683
I won't let them do such a thing.

75
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:24,149
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.

76
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,814
This is it, Monsignor.

77
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:41,560
This is where we worship...
our beloved saint and martyr.

78
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:05,317
Here she is, Monsignor.

79
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:12,438
But... this is no saint.

80
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,561
Monsignor, she is a saint.

81
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,687
How could you?

82
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:28,017
Right here, many years ago,

83
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:34,725
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked
by the Terrano brothers.

84
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,014
She tried to fight them off
with all her strength

85
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,596
but they cut off her arms.

86
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,678
They raped her

87
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,688
and left her to die in a pool of blood.

88
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,225
And on this ground, miraculously
still wet with her holy blood,

89
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:13,471
we built our church.

90
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,930
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.

91
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,641
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!

92
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,433
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!

93
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:36,355
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!

94
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:40,053
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!

95
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:44,604
Holy blood! It's holy blood!

96
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,726
It's holy blood!

97
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:05,510
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.

98
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:18,010
I order you to stop...
this foolish sacrilege... immediately.

99
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:21,186
Never! This is our saint!

100
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:27,516
The church will never
recognise... this heresy!

101
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:30,471
Don't dare! Holy blood!

102
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:33,885
Cantemos todos!

103
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:42,848
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!

104
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,717
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!

105
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,266
Holy blood!

106
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:53,517
Holy blood! Holy blood!

107
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:58,593
Come, Kevin, I don't want this
to soil your pure soul.

108
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:02,052
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!

109
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:06,643
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!

110
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:11,350
Holy blood.

111
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:14,220
Holy blood!

112
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:21,845
- Holy blood! Holy blood! Oh!
- Holy blood!

113
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,306
Go ahead!

114
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,723
Don't run away!

115
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,267
Mother! No!

116
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:03,552
- No, no! No, no!
- No.

117
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,552
Kill me! Go ahead!

118
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,925
Kill me! Kill me!

119
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:17,055
Kill me!

120
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,757
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!

121
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:23,137
Go ahead...

122
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:06,134
Hey!

123
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:51,050
Ahh...

124
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,632
Mr Orgo...

125
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,506
Aah!

126
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:57,836
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him -

127
00:19:57,928 --> 00:19:59,965
or I'll kill you!

128
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:03,050
She's crazy!

129
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,963
Get up. Get up!

130
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,208
You bastard!

131
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,176
Aaah.

132
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,170
Ahh. Ahh.

133
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:30,169
Aaah.

134
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,332
My little child.

135
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:39,463
No...

136
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,171
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!

137
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:52,963
Don't do that!

138
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,626
Ahh. Ah!

139
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,838
Ah!

140
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,671
Ah!

141
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,712
Hah!

142
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:37,504
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.

143
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:39,628
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.

144
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,753
Vamoose. Vamoose.

145
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:34,168
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.

146
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,789
Please, don't die.

147
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,872
Please.

148
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:41,916
Don't die.

149
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:05,531
Stop crying... like a little girl.

150
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,618
I'll give you a charm.

151
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,992
That'll make you a man.

152
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,777
There, now you're a man.

153
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,903
Just like me.

154
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:34,102
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!

155
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:07,725
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!

156
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:10,685
Hanging by her own hair!

157
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:18,765
Put me down! Put me down!

158
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:22,140
Quick, quick! Down! Down!

159
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,186
Quick. Quick.

160
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:33,936
Go away!

161
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:37,223
Music! Music!
Concha!

162
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:01,767
Mummy! Mum!

163
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:04,262
Shh! Get in the trailer.

164
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:07,603
Keep quiet. Go! Go...

165
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,475
Come on, come on, come on.

166
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:07,683
Oh!

167
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,339
♫ Yo ya me voy

168
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:34,759
♫ Al puerto donde se haya... ♫

169
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:41,880

♫ Adiós para siempre, adiós... ♫

175
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:19,379
Come on.

176
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:23,681
♫ No volverán

177
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:31,213
♫ Tus ojos a mirarme

178
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:37,925
♫ Ni tus oídos

- Yes?
- Yes.

209
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:04,173

215
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:41,246
Now we will see a great film
about Robinson Crusoe.

216
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:44,457
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.

217
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:48,377
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe,
one of life's castaways.

Yes. Good boy, Darío.

219
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,160
Goodbye. Goodbye!

220
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,461
I have to go with my grandmother.

221
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:59,499
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.

222
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,204
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.

223
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:06,793
Good morning.
I am Robinson Crusoe.

Bye! Enjoy the movie!

225
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,588
And don't worry, we will wait for you.

Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.

228
00:45:28,756 --> 00:45:32,879
Listen, this kind of stuff
will make you sick.

229
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:36,957
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else...

230
00:45:38,214 --> 00:45:42,337
that's much more fun than the movies.

231
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:48,703
A little sniff of this...
And we'll see.

232
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,167
Sniff.

233
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,959
Ándele para adentro.

234
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:06,838

- You have?

369
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:38,471
- Can we see each other later?
- Sure.

370
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:40,932
- Here?
- Mm.

371
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:43,260
I love your nose.

372
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,801
Oh, you scared me.

373
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,016
I was thinking...

374
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:47,260
how we could join...

375
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,307
your art...

376
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,307
and mine.

377
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:03,883
A man like you always finds a way.

378
01:10:07,062 --> 01:10:09,301
I will do anything you want.

379
01:10:15,854 --> 01:10:18,058
First...

380
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:23,891
I will tie you to a wheel...

381
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:33,557
and I will throw knives at you.

382
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,557
One here.

383
01:10:40,353 --> 01:10:42,390
One here.

384
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,887
And one here, next to your mouth

385
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:53,059
so you can kiss it with your lips.

386
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:57,724
And then...

387
01:11:00,062 --> 01:11:03,641
the last one... here.

388
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:14,974
I will be afraid.

389
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:17,728
Don't worry, you'll love it...

390
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:20,180
because I will hypnotise you.

391
01:12:30,269 --> 01:12:32,306
Aah.

392
01:12:39,436 --> 01:12:41,473
Fenix!

393
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:48,591
You know what you have to do.

394
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:51,553
No, I don't want to!

395
01:12:56,144 --> 01:13:01,014
This girl has defiled you with her lust.

396
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:04,218
No, Mum, it's not true! It is only a game!

397
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:09,720
No! I can't!

398
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,848
Don't ask me to!

399
01:13:11,936 --> 01:13:15,764
I'm not asking you, I'm ordering...

400
01:13:16,894 --> 01:13:21,965
my hands... and my arms...

401
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:24,098
to kill her.

402
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,092
- Kill her!
- Aah!

403
01:13:47,894 --> 01:13:49,931
Stupid!

404
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,597
Wake her up.

405
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,222
Put her in the car.

406
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:22,014
And get a suitcase ready.

407
01:14:23,268 --> 01:14:25,305
We are going home.

408
01:17:03,142 --> 01:17:05,179
Please.

409
01:17:12,475 --> 01:17:14,299
Please.

410
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:21,177
Please...

411
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,304
don't die.

412
01:17:33,642 --> 01:17:36,177
Don't die, please...

413
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:44,259
- Don't die...
- Wake up!

414
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:48,924
You can't atone for your sins
with nightmares.

415
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:51,054
Huh!

416
01:17:59,392 --> 01:18:01,429
Bring me my robe.

417
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:03,803
Hurry!

418
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:05,929
I want my breakfast.

419
01:18:28,433 --> 01:18:31,679
I couldn't stand
those awful hotels any more.

420
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:37,512
I'm too tired to be travelling
around and around.

421
01:18:38,683 --> 01:18:40,720
And you!

422
01:18:41,975 --> 01:18:45,803
You are too weak to resist temptation.

423
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:47,928
Huh!

424
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,844
Without me you are nothing.

425
01:19:34,933 --> 01:19:38,547
No one sees you
and no one notices you.

426
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:41,046
Just like your stupid hero.

427
01:19:46,099 --> 01:19:49,760
Watch it! You're getting me dirty.

428
01:19:54,391 --> 01:19:58,847
Now we are going
to practice my concerto.

429
01:20:25,391 --> 01:20:28,342
No grace, no style!

430
01:20:28,432 --> 01:20:31,216
You've got to move
my fingers more elegantly.

431
01:20:35,391 --> 01:20:37,428
All right.

432
01:20:43,974 --> 01:20:47,256
- Start again.
- But I can't do it. I don't remember.

433
01:20:47,349 --> 01:20:51,970
I know that! At least you remember
the song of our patron saint.

434
01:20:55,265 --> 01:20:57,338
Come on then, I want to play it.

435
01:21:05,515 --> 01:21:10,136
♫ El fin del mundo se acerca ya

436
01:21:11,182 --> 01:21:15,389
♫ Toda esperanza se acabará

437
01:21:16,307 --> 01:21:21,675
♫ Ya las señales se están cumpliendo

438
01:21:22,932 --> 01:21:25,846
♫ Se están cumpliendo como escrito está

439
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:31,930
♫ Querido amigo, Lirio te llama... ♫

440
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:47,966
♫ Y tendrás parte en la resurrección ♫

441
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:50,094
Stop it!

442
01:21:50,182 --> 01:21:53,878
It's always roosters or swans!

443
01:21:53,973 --> 01:21:58,546
You never see anything else
in your ridiculous hallucinations.

444
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:02,969
Ah!

445
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,094
It's over, Mummy.

446
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,427
My angel.

447
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:20,754
- Now let's sing.
- Aladin.

448
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:36,046
♫ Siento en el alma

449
01:22:38,681 --> 01:22:43,503
♫ Unas ganas inmensas

450
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:48,384
♫ De llorar

451
01:22:49,515 --> 01:22:52,548
♫ Tú me haces falta

452
01:22:55,348 --> 01:23:00,929
♫ Y juré no decírtelo

453
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:03,584
♫ Jamás

454
01:23:06,056 --> 01:23:09,966
♫ Yo quiero hacerte

455
01:23:11,806 --> 01:23:15,799
♫ Con mis lágrimas un

456
01:23:16,723 --> 01:23:19,804
♫ Collar de perlas

457
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:24,922
♫ Déjame llorar

458
01:23:26,973 --> 01:23:30,717
♫ Porque hoy que te perdí

459
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,335
♫ Queriéndote olvidar

460
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:41,753
♫ Me acuerdo más

461
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:47,465
♫ De ti ♫

462
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:33,925
So you failed again?

463
01:26:34,013 --> 01:26:36,086
- Oh!
- Come here.

464
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,217
Come here!

465
01:26:41,388 --> 01:26:43,425
Come!

466
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:01,295
I want to finish the stockings
for Santa Lirio.

467
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,631
One, two, pass.

468
01:27:19,263 --> 01:27:23,920
One, two, pass. One, two, pass.

469
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:52,129
Oh, Mr Fenix, what a pleasure.

470
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:56,925
I... I have the things that you ordered.

471
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:00,716
Mercury,

472
01:28:00,804 --> 01:28:02,841
sulphur,

473
01:28:02,929 --> 01:28:04,966
boric trisulphate.

474
01:28:05,054 --> 01:28:11,133
Oh... I'd really like to see
your experiments, Mr Fenix.

475
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,424
- Really?
- Yes!

476
01:28:13,512 --> 01:28:16,924
Why don't you invite me some time?

477
01:28:17,012 --> 01:28:19,465
We could have dinner...

478
01:28:21,387 --> 01:28:23,626
How about tonight?

479
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,293
I'll bring some flowers.
Ten o'clock all right?

480
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:30,673
Yes, I guess so. I have to go now.
Thank you.

481
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:33,250
Ladies and gentlemen!

482
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:38,582
Coming soon at the Coliseum,
an evening of wrestling!

483
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:44,177
Featuring The Saint,
the world's strongest woman!

484
01:28:44,262 --> 01:28:48,634
Good! The Saint...

485
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,757
Oh! Oh!

486
01:28:55,845 --> 01:28:58,049
Mr Fenix!

487
01:28:59,303 --> 01:29:01,589
Mr Fenix?

488
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:14,752
Mr Fenix, what's happening to you?

489
01:29:18,803 --> 01:29:22,168
Nothing. It was just an hallucination.

490
01:29:30,053 --> 01:29:34,509
Eh, bonita,
no tiene nada para mí? Venga! Eh!

491
01:29:34,595 --> 01:29:36,632
Culito.

492
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,298
Eh?

493
01:29:53,386 --> 01:29:56,585
Qué? Una foto? No, no.

494
01:29:56,678 --> 01:29:58,715
No... No?

495
01:29:58,803 --> 01:30:03,010
Ahh... Pobrecita. Espere. Una foto.

496
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:06,749
Eh? There.

497
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,882
Bueno.

498
01:30:37,969 --> 01:30:41,002
How great is that?
The audience will buy it.

499
01:30:51,594 --> 01:30:54,508
The next trick - attack and defence.

500
01:31:20,927 --> 01:31:24,173
That's it for today.
They can hit the showers.

501
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:38,461
Mm, what are you doing here?

502
01:32:44,302 --> 01:32:46,339
You're very nice.

503
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:48,500
What's the matter?

504
01:32:51,635 --> 01:32:53,672
Don't you like me?

505
01:32:54,843 --> 01:32:56,880
Yes.

506
01:32:56,968 --> 01:33:01,175
I like you so much
that I would like to have you in my show.

507
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:04,423
Do you have
your own company or theatre?

508
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:06,796
A little theatre in my house.

509
01:33:06,885 --> 01:33:08,922
Hm.

510
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:14,000
Would you like to take me there tonight?

511
01:33:14,093 --> 01:33:16,130
For a quick rehearsal?

512
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:21,998
- If it's not asking too much.
- Hey, I like you.

513
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:25,166
You got a bottle on you, baby?

514
01:33:28,218 --> 01:33:30,255
Ahh, nice.

515
01:34:03,301 --> 01:34:05,338
Hm.

516
01:34:11,176 --> 01:34:13,213
Shh!

517
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,880
Careful, Saint.

518
01:35:01,967 --> 01:35:04,004
This is my theatre.

519
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:13,916
I like this strong
and beautiful body of yours...

520
01:35:17,967 --> 01:35:20,171
that could fight me off.

521
01:35:21,176 --> 01:35:24,506
- Oh!
- Why should I, sugar? Mm?

522
01:35:26,176 --> 01:35:29,623
Fenix? Where are you?

523
01:35:30,634 --> 01:35:32,707
What's the matter with you?

524
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,335
Nothing. It was only my imagination.

525
01:35:56,092 --> 01:35:58,378
Ladies and... Ladies.

526
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:01,753
The show is about to begin!

527
01:36:02,675 --> 01:36:05,128
Come, Lothar.

528
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:26,294
You are about to witness
the ultimate miracle,

529
01:36:26,383 --> 01:36:30,376
the transformation of death into life.

530
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:45,584
I will change this mummy
into one hundred flying doves!

531
01:37:31,383 --> 01:37:33,420
Watch out, Saint!

532
01:37:34,175 --> 01:37:36,841
For now you have to fight me off.

533
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:41,665
What's happening to you?
Are you going crazy?

534
01:37:41,758 --> 01:37:45,088
Kill her! Kill her!

535
01:37:46,758 --> 01:37:48,795
Did you hear her?

536
01:37:48,883 --> 01:37:51,501
She wants me to kill you with my hands.

537
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:54,257
Kill her!

538
01:37:56,674 --> 01:37:58,166
Kill her!

539
01:38:16,758 --> 01:38:21,628
- Kill her!
- Please...

540
01:38:21,716 --> 01:38:24,121
break my arms.

541
01:38:24,216 --> 01:38:26,253
Kill her!

542
01:39:06,882 --> 01:39:08,919
Crazy fool.

543
01:39:15,507 --> 01:39:17,793
Use the sword.

544
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:29,044
Yah!

545
01:43:04,172 --> 01:43:07,205
Why did you...?

546
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,917
Forgive me.

547
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,794
Please, forgive me.

548
01:43:59,505 --> 01:44:01,542
What have I done?

549
01:44:50,421 --> 01:44:52,458
Alma.

550
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:03,993
I have been waiting for you...

551
01:45:05,171 --> 01:45:07,208
for so long.

552
01:46:06,087 --> 01:46:08,124
You've come...

553
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:12,075
to take me... away?

554
01:46:54,337 --> 01:46:56,374
Fenix!

555
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:01,416
You will never take
my son away from me!

556
01:47:03,045 --> 01:47:05,367
I order my hands to kill her!

557
01:47:05,462 --> 01:47:07,499
No!

558
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,957
No!

559
01:47:32,462 --> 01:47:34,499
- Yes!
- Oh...

560
01:47:34,587 --> 01:47:36,624
Cut off her arms!

561
01:48:22,336 --> 01:48:24,871
Cut off her arms!

562
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:31,790
Is anybody home?

563
01:48:32,711 --> 01:48:35,495
Mr Fenix? Mr Fenix!

564
01:48:48,753 --> 01:48:50,790
Somebody help me!

565
01:48:54,378 --> 01:48:57,126
No!

566
01:48:57,211 --> 01:48:59,248
Kill her!

567
01:48:59,336 --> 01:49:02,997
- Oh!
- Yes! Kill her!

568
01:49:03,086 --> 01:49:05,123
- Kill her!
- No!

569
01:49:05,211 --> 01:49:06,703
Kill her!

570
01:49:08,336 --> 01:49:10,373
Kill her! Kill her!

571
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:14,161
Kill her! Kill her!

572
01:49:15,586 --> 01:49:18,916
Kill her! Kill her!

573
01:49:19,003 --> 01:49:21,573
Cut off her arms!

574
01:49:21,669 --> 01:49:24,951
Cut off her arms! Cut off her arms!

575
01:49:25,044 --> 01:49:27,449
Cut off her arms!

576
01:49:30,377 --> 01:49:34,322
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

577
01:49:34,419 --> 01:49:36,456
Kill her!

578
01:49:38,627 --> 01:49:42,869
- Cut them off!
- Aaah!

579
01:49:56,461 --> 01:49:59,375
Now get out of my life!

580
01:50:00,586 --> 01:50:02,955
Disappear!

581
01:50:06,377 --> 01:50:08,581
You will never be free of me!

582
01:50:08,669 --> 01:50:10,706
I'm inside of you!

583
01:50:31,169 --> 01:50:33,622
Oh!

584
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:35,747
Oh!

585
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:58,542
♫ Yo ya me voy... ♫

586
01:50:58,627 --> 01:51:00,664
Mother.

587
01:51:01,293 --> 01:51:07,704
♫ Al puerto donde se haya

588
01:51:10,543 --> 01:51:15,496
♫ La barca de oro

589
01:51:17,835 --> 01:51:22,326
♫ Que debe conducirme

590
01:51:22,418 --> 01:51:25,285
♫ Yo ya me voy... ♫

591
01:51:25,377 --> 01:51:27,414
My mummy is dead.

592
01:51:29,335 --> 01:51:35,449
♫ Sólo vengo a despedirme

593
01:51:38,002 --> 01:51:42,458
♫ Adiós mujer

594
01:51:44,251 --> 01:51:49,998
♫ Adiós para siempre, adiós

595
01:51:51,626 --> 01:51:55,833
♫ No volverán

596
01:51:57,126 --> 01:52:03,371
♫ Tus ojos a mirarme

597
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:10,072
♫ Ni tus oídos

598
01:52:12,335 --> 01:52:16,743
♫ Escucharán mi canto

599
01:52:16,835 --> 01:52:19,121
♫ Voy a aumentar... ♫

600
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:21,330
No. No.

601
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:27,750
♫ Los mares con mi llanto

602
01:52:30,876 --> 01:52:35,995
♫ Adiós mujer

603
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:42,370
♫ Adiós para siempre, adiós ♫

604
01:52:58,126 --> 01:53:02,699
♫ Yo quiero hacerte

605
01:53:04,126 --> 01:53:08,166
♫ Con mis lágrimas un

606
01:53:09,334 --> 01:53:12,781
♫ Collar de perlas

607
01:53:14,042 --> 01:53:17,454
♫ Déjame llorar

608
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:23,197
♫ Porque hoy que te perdí... ♫

609
01:53:25,126 --> 01:53:28,906
♫ Queriéndote olvidar

610
01:53:30,792 --> 01:53:39,039
♫ Me acuerdo más de ti ♫

611
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:42,999
Hey!

612
01:53:43,084 --> 01:53:46,531
Ándale, ándale.

613
01:53:47,959 --> 01:53:49,996
Throw her out the window.

614
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:53,621
One!

615
01:53:53,709 --> 01:53:56,162
And two!

616
01:53:56,250 --> 01:54:00,113
And three! And four!

617
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,283
A fire!

618
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:00,867
Whoo!

619
01:55:00,958 --> 01:55:03,078
♫ La, la, la-la-la-la! ♫

620
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:50,912
Goodbye!

621
01:55:57,958 --> 01:55:59,995
Mr Fenix.

622
01:56:03,541 --> 01:56:05,578
Aladin.

623
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:53,319
Put your hands up!

624
01:58:06,374 --> 01:58:08,411
My hands...

625
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:12,077
My hands!

626
01:58:13,624 --> 01:58:15,661
My hands.
