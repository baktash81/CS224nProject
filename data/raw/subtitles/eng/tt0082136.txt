Headquarters, we are still in
pursuit of the black Lamborghini.

42
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:13,092
Car 42, you've been in
pursuit for two hours.

43
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,723
Another five minutes and
you'll be in Arizona.

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,720
Yeah, and we're gonna stay in
pursuit until we catch him.

45
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:23,474
It didn't take us that
long to catch Dillinger.

46
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,326
Hi, guys. JJ?

47
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,461
- JJ?
- Victor.

48
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:57,167
Ooh.

49
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,889
- You're two hours late.
- I'm sorry.

50
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,970
- Where the hell you been?
- Oh...

51
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,434
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,521
The fuel-injection system.
It's driving me crazy.

53
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,473
I'm really sorry I'm
late, but one of

54
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,194
my hamsters had an anxiety attack.

55
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,225
I couldn't leave him till
he was settled down.

56
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,238
He was acting so crazy,
he ate a piece of tail,

57
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:20,701
and Henrietta wasn't
even bothering him.

58
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,452
Then he ate his treadmill. Whoo.

59
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:30,115
They got vets for that. We got
other things to worry about.

60
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,418
Hamsters are a big responsibility.

61
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:36,552
Let me paint you a mental
picture, all right, Victor?

62
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,631
I want you to think of your
hamsters as a little army

63
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:41,838
marching along on a treadmill,

64
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:45,348
running their little legs off,
just running as fast as they can,

65
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,482
making that engine just
purr right along the road.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,310
Oh, JJ. What a wonderful
way to put it.

67
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,884
Wouldn't it be great
if we could share the

68
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,034
glory of winning the
Cannonball with them?

69
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:05,163
That would be a real team effort.
You, me, the hamsters and... him.

70
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:24,054
Don't start with him. I don't
want to talk about him.

71
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,496
If you need any help...

72
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:27,887
Damn it, I don't want
to talk about him.

73
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,184
Ok.

74
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,731
Sir James.

75
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,685
Oh, my God. You again?

76
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,736
Fenderbaum, do me a favour.

77
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,899
You're drawing flies. Get
the hell out of here.

78
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:44,658
No. Wait a minute, Greek.
Only thing I want to know is,

79
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,331
how are you figuring the odds
on this Cannonball cockamamie?

80
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,001
It takes brilliance and
years of hard work.

81
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,001
And you wouldn't understand
any part of that.

82
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,043
Do me a favour. A race
is a race, right?

83
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,997
The only thing you gotta do in
the Cannonball is drive steady,

84
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,089
stay out of trouble and
have a good cover.

85
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,394
3,000 miles, averaging
85 miles an hour.

86
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,299
Do you know what that is?

87
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:09,218
You want to talk or
do you want a bet?

88
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:15,017
Anti-radar paint, turbo-charged.
JJ, nobody can stop us now.

89
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,265
Nobody.

90
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:35,624
What are you, some kind of
nut? Who do you think you are?

91
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,038
Dun-dun-dah.

92
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,708
I am Captain Chaos.

93
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,050
And this - this is my
faithful companion, Cato.

94
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,217
Say hello, Cato.

95
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,934
Been a cop long?

96
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,267
That's funny.

97
00:06:57,355 --> 00:07:00,105
- You wanna talk or you wanna bet?
- You've got 50-1.

98
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:03,821
And you know what you got?
You got yourself a bet.

99
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,283
Twenty big, large ones.

100
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:11,445
That's a million dollars.
Ha-ha. If you win.

101
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,661
I don't know if you
know my partner.

102
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:15,786
Jamie, you remember
Jimmy the Greek.

103
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:18,924
Ha. Jamie Blake.

104
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,592
You used to drive
that Formula One.

105
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,841
When high-buttoned
shoes were in style.

106
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:28,183
Let me tell you something,
Greek. We got a secret weapon.

107
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,181
God is our copilot.

108
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,103
You'll need him.

109
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,099
God is our copilot?

110
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,399
Remember our car?

111
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,522
- Yeah.
- Two seats.

112
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,399
Two seats.

113
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:46,646
Where's he gonna sit?

114
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:47,858
Where?

115
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:51,662
Listen to me, El Porko.

116
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,913
We're not in the Indianapolis 500.

117
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,945
We can't have a car
with numbers on it.

118
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,633
We have to camouflage
the car somehow.

119
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,709
Like what, JJ?

120
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:03,302
How about a limousine
with diplomatic plates?

121
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:04,379
- Nah.
- No.

122
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:07,134
I know. A bloodmobile.

123
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,152
Never stop a
bloodmobile, would they?

124
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,153
Nah.

125
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,093
Ice-cream truck. An
ice-cream truck. You

126
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:14,516
know, they got to get
there before it melts.

127
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:15,769
Nah.

128
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,396
Terrific. We're out
of beer, Victor.

129
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,481
Sorry.

130
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,244
Take it easy. You're acting crazy
since this Cannonball thing.

131
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,779
I'm gonna pull in here and
get some beer, all right?

132
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,994
How about an armoured
personnel carrier?

133
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,290
They wouldn't stop
that, would they?

134
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,640
- Hey, don't bother to park.
- I'll be right out.

135
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:07,568
Thank you.

136
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,650
We could get a black Trans
Am. No, that's been done.

137
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:38,274
Hello, Mother. I trust
you had a pleasant day.

138
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:43,645
A nightmare. A living nightmare.
You are killing me, Seymour.

139
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,320
Killing me a slow death with
this idiot spy business.

140
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:52,201
- Mother, you don't understand.
- What is there to understand?

141
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm looking at my son,
Seymour Goldfarb Jr,

142
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:59,236
son of Seymour Goldfarb,
God rest his soul,

143
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,289
and heir to the Goldfarb
Girdles fortune.

144
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,293
And what is he doing?

145
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,415
Walking around, acting,

146
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:09,882
like he was some goy movie
star named Roger Moore.

147
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:13,054
And for this I sent you
to the best schools?

148
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:16,304
For this I'm spending 8,000
on orthodontia work?

149
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,967
For this I'm going broke, paying
that Beverly Hills analyst?

150
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:21,158
And now... Ha-ha.

151
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,159
This.

152
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:27,523
The sleep-in maid found it under
your pillow this morning.

153
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,817
What is the meaning of this?

154
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:32,741
The meaning, Mother
dear, is a quick death.

155
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,570
I warned you not to
interfere in my affairs.

156
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:38,367
Seymour, put that away.
It's liable to go off.

157
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:43,955
I'm terribly sorry, Mother,
but you know too much.

158
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,750
You see, in my business,

159
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,451
even the deepest
family relationships

160
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:50,173
aren't worth a farthing.

161
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,424
Farthing, schmarthing.

162
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,257
- No.
- Zei gezunt, Mama.

163
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,138
Oy. Where did I go wrong?

164
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,725
You know something, Mama?
You're too Jewish.

165
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,310
We could always go with a
nice, plain-Jane Chevy,

166
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,609
with a truckload of
Sidewinder missiles.

167
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:14,363
Maybe you should slow this
down just a little bit.

168
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:17,525
- I can't hear you.
- I said, you're making waves.

169
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,275
You're bothering the people.

170
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,881
What the hell has
going too fast got

171
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,327
to do with being
in the Cannonball?

172
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,464
JJ, you're making very big waves.

173
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,921
Hi. How are ya?

174
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,172
Aaargh.

175
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,684
You guys are lucky. You tore
the heck out of that boat.

176
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:48,693
- You all right, Victor?
- Oh, I'm fine, JJ.

177
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,651
It only hurts when I point.

178
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,938
You know, maybe it
would've been better,

179
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:56,946
if you didn't pay so much
attention to those girls.

180
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,859
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's true.

181
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:01,948
Nobody's perfect, but him.

182
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,871
Sorry.

183
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,543
How far is it to the hospital?

184
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,503
- About ten miles.
- Oh, yeah?

185
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,559
How long will it take
us to get there?

186
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,004
About four or five minutes.

187
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:17,127
You can smoke through traffic like
shot through a gun in this thing.

188
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,482
Argh.

189
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,449
(Speaks foreign language)

190
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,743
Jackie Chan.

191
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,909
Here's Johnny.

192
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,130
(Speaks foreign language)

193
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,182
Jackie Chan.

194
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,356
Godzilla movie.

195
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,065
Michael Hui.

196
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,078
(Speaks foreign language)

197
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,467
Excuse me.

198
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,252
(Speaks Arabic)

199
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,787
Camel.

200
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,214
Not the Camel, schmuck. Winston.

201
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,673
Ah.

202
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,519
(Speaks Arabic)

203
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,078
Starting tomorrow, you and George
will be riding in the car with me.

204
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,082
Yes, sir.

205
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,630
How goes your driving, my brother?

206
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,875
Allah be praised, dear sister.

207
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:09,097
My speed is rivalled only by the
lightning bolts from the heavens.

208
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,893
And I suppose you still
intend to go through

209
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,146
that race with the
infidel Americans.

210
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:23,531
The Cannonball will fall
to the forces of Islam.

211
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:26,571
My dear sister. I pledge it.

212
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,485
Drink. Drink.

213
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,825
- The car will be there, correct?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

214
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,371
Don't forget to cancel the
board meeting on Monday.

215
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,615
I'm going to spend a week
in Spain at the castle.

216
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,708
Yes, Mr. Compton.

217
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,881
I want you to find an old friend
of mine, a Mr. Shakey Finch.

218
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:46,594
He is the finest long-distance
motorcycle rider in this nation.

219
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,676
- You got it?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

220
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:54,394
The board has asked me to express
their concern one more time.

221
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,305
- Please reconsider.
- Not possible, Arthur.

222
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:01,765
The board will have to permit me
this one indulgence to my ego.

223
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,751
♪ I've gotta be free ♪

224
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:14,541

- Boy, ain't he something?
- Are you kidding?

228
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,148
That is the dumbest
thing I've seen since

229
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,256
that dimwit tried to
jump the Grand Canyon.

230
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,225
He's still on our ass.

231
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:42,896
I don't think... I
don't think... I

232
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,523
don't think he's
a-bluffing, either.

233
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,318
Now, don't you worry, son.

234
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,742
I'm gonna lose him right
up here at the motel.

235
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,531
Hey, I remember. There's a spot...

236
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,075
There... There's a
spot in... right in

237
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,535
back, and it's a
perfect spot to hide.

238
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,959
All right. Wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful.

239
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,580
Take a... Take...

240
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,666
- Left.
- Oh, hell.

241
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,039
- Take a left.
- Left.

242
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:09,973
- I can't see shit. Can you?
- No problem, son. No problem.

243
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,300
What was that?

244
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,232
That's... That's...

245
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,449
That's perfect.

246
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,545
That's better than
hiding it... That's

247
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:35,992
better than hiding it out back.

248
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,827
I know. But the only
problem we got now,

249
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,463
is we have to go and retune it.

250
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,580
All right?

251
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,916
Let's go get a beer first.

252
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,131
Yeah, let's go get
a... Let's... Beer.

253
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,719
I'd like to thank Mona
Corson of Westport

254
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,817
for that wonderful
luncheon of hemp

255
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,721
sandwiches and woodchip consommé.

256
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:01,019
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

257
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:05,312
This is a titty turn... Terrific
turnout for the meeting.

258
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:07,477
- Yes, terrific.
- He led the campaign

259
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,240
to ban the use of electric

260
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,686
toothbrushes during
peak load hours,

261
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,529
and to sound the alarm...

262
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,874
I suppose you... came
here to hear me speak.

263
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:21,122
No, no, not really.
I'm into trees.

264
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,501
Ah.

265
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:24,962
Trees.

266
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:30,545
Friends of Nature love trees,
so I come to the meetings.

267
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,091
That's very interesting.

268
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,755
I love anybody who loves trees.

269
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:39,385
Well, they happen to be a
great passion of mine.

270
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,773
You know what I like
best about trees?

271
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,021
No, what?

272
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,732
That you can lie under
them on a moonlit night

273
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,443
with the breeze blowing,

274
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,193
bawl your brains out.

275
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,275
Mr. Arthur J Foyt.

276
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:57,784
Mr. Foyt. Mr. Foyt.

277
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:05,082
Give that sucker some juice.

278
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:09,836
The only thing hiding it... hiding
it... hiding it in the... pool

279
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,960
did was... make it purty.

280
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,258
It ain't running worth
a shit. And it's wet.

281
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:18,092
I know that. Just hit it
one more time, all right?

282
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,890
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

283
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,024
I know what's wrong.

284
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,020
Don't think for a minute...

285
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:28,612
that we in Washington

286
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,229
don't appreciate
your Mothers' March

287
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,817
to ban the sale of
coloured toilet paper

288
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:38,824
to, help reduce
irritation of the...

289
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,828
rectum.

290
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:47,832
But today, I want to
direct my remarks

291
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,787
to an old and familiar enemy.

292
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:54,839
The automobile.

293
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,054
All right. One more
time. Let me hear it.

294
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,642
Ha. It's...

295
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:09,023
It reminds me of
a, a poem I wrote.

296
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,864
The automobile, the automobile...

297
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:26,754
- Who was that?
- Get your hand out of my face.

298
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,580
Are you all right?

299
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,206
They picked on the
wrong one this time.

300
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,383
I guarantee they're
gonna pay for this,

301
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:37,722
because when the going gets
tough, the tough get going.

302
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,840
She's running good now, buddy.

303
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,806
I still think we
ought to paint it.

304
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,270
If we're gonna paint it, let's go
ahead and Midasize it, all right?

305
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,861
Hey, there's the motel.

306
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,197
Look at the parking lot. The

307
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:56,901
Cannonballers have
it all jammed up.

308
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,646
Man, I can't handle this traffic.

309
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,028
Hold on to your lunch pail.

310
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:03,695
- This may get a little weird.
- Wait a minute.

311
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,786
Slow down.

312
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:16,291
Hey, you the one
running this fleabag?

313
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,292
Huh.

314
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:19,471
- Where the hookers?
- What?

315
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,880
Hookers, man. Where the hookers?

316
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,759
Excuse me. Excuse me.

317
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:27,643
- Hello, Mad Dog.
- Hey, JJ.

318
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:30,175
You probably didn't realise,
but the parking lot's outside.

319
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:31,589
I know. Brakes went out.

320
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,519
Do you think you're the President?

321
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:37,565
Well, let me make one
thing perfectly clear.

322
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:41,781
We feel terrible about it. And
if they can't take a joke...

323
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:46,406
Thank goodness. We just
had a terrible accident.

324
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,931
We'd like to help you,
but we're off duty.

325
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,043
This man looks bad.
Maybe he's dead.

326
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:54,173
You should call the coroner.
JJ, he don't look too good.

327
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,381
Nah.

328
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:00,086
- He's just had his bell rung.
- Can't you do something?

329
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:03,934
- I mean, you're professionals.
- This is our day off.

330
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,601
Will you guys do something?

331
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,139
This man's life is
hanging by a thread.

332
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:11,847
Victor.

333
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,625
You have to be very
scientific about this. It

334
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:20,435
could go up the nostrils,
affect the sinuses.

335
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:21,777
That's true.

336
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:33,003
There.

337
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:34,582
Don't bother about the bill.

338
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:38,086
Just give him a couple of enemas
and call me in the morning.

339
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,134
Hi. How's it going?

340
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:44,256
- Perfect.
- We'd like two singles.

341
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,893
JJ McClure, Victor Prinzim.

342
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,299
I'll be in the bar.

343
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,635
I always like a couple of
drinks right after surgery.

344
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:00,023
I wonder why that guy parked
his truck in the lobby.

345
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,399
Only in America. Get me 12 suites.

346
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:05,106
- Better yet, the entire floor.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,278
Ah. Too much couscous.

348
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,868
I sure as H would like
to get my hands on

349
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,504
those Hell's Angels who
were driving that truck.

350
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,833
But it's probably just as well,

351
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,958
because I am a wild bull
when I lose my temper.

352
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:26,264
- I love wild bulls.
- Oh.

353
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,306
It's really funny that you
should... Oh, my God. It's them.

354
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:34,351
- "Them" who?
- Those Hell's Angels.

355
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,102
They could be part of
a terrorist group.

356
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:38,103
I don't know.

357
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:44,986
But this place is filling up...
with some real hoodlums.

358
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:48,066
Did you see anything
weird back there?

359
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:50,737
- No.
- I'm gonna find out.

360
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:05,419
Why is it so difficult for
you to find a doctor?

361
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,087
It's very, very hard.

362
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,796
It's not easy finding a
doctor to take off like that.

363
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:11,897
Dr. Gay doesn't even
leave his house.

364
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,757
If you're gonna win the Cannonball

365
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:17,139
driving an ambulance, you have
to have a doctor in the...

366
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:18,477
What does Dr. Gay do?

367
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:21,612
He's my shrink. He was
committed yesterday.

368
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,030
- Why?
- He was smoking bananas.

369
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:28,282
He gets very upset when
he talks to... him.

370
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:30,363
- So do I.
- Oh.

371
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,700
Sorry. I don't want
fruit in my drink.

372
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:41,542
Congratulations. Here's
to you. Good luck.

373
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:43,917
- Much obliged.
- And to you, Father.

374
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:46,378
You dumb shits.

375
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:50,425
They haven't got a
chance. You know what?

376
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:54,181
I think I'm gonna call the Greek
and put another 10,000 on us.

377
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,095
- JJ.
- Mm.

378
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,595
What about those two?

379
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:03,016
Maybe... Maybe one of those
beauties could be our patient.

380
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,766
- Both of them could be.
- Woof.

381
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:08,236
I could be very patient
with those patients.

382
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:11,238
They're very lickable...
very likeable.

383
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,227
Tell you what. Let's,
the two of us,

384
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,873
go over there and talk to them.

385
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:17,372
- Ok.
- I'll do all the talking.

386
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:19,772
Victor, you just think
about the doctor.

387
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:20,773
Ok.

388
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:26,498
Argh. Ooh.

389
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:28,298
Oh.

390
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,642
- Good evening, ladies.
- Evening.

391
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,662
My name is JJ McClure.
This is Victor

392
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,349
Prinzim, my executive assistant.

393
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:38,391
- Hi...
- I'll do the talking, Victor.

394
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:40,725
Terrorists, my dimpled ass.

395
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:45,271
These people make terrorists look
like the Sisters of Charity.

396
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:48,607
These guys are Cannonballers.

397
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,410
What is that, a bowling team?

398
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,990
We're the favourites to win
the Cannonball tomorrow,

399
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,036
and I was wondering if one
of you, or both of you,

400
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,200
might like to ride in
the winning vehicle.

401
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,459
That would be very exciting.

402
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,131
Exciting.

403
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,379
But we're Cannonballers
ourselves. Thank you.

404
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,591
They're Cannonballers?

405
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:10,866
And, as for the winning
vehicle, well,

406
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,722
we'll just have to wait and see.

407
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:14,801
You haven't seen our equipment.

408
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Equipment?

409
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,430
Equipment.

410
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:48,711
Hi.

411
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:50,838
Hi.

412
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:55,303
Don't tell me your
name. Let me guess.

413
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,263
Melissa.

414
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:01,469
No.

415
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,187
Juliette.

416
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,060
- No.
- Betty?

417
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,608
No.

418
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:13,282
I'll just call you Beauty, ok?

419
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,612
Aw. That's nice.

420
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:16,947
Thank you.

421
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:18,322
Sit down.

422
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:25,066
Are you one of those
volleyballers?

423
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,071
Cannonballers.

424
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:27,073
No.

425
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,578
Why are you dressed up like that?

426
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:31,798
Humanitarian reasons.

427
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,130
I'm a wealthy philanthropist.

428
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:38,047
Me and my partner, we just
ride around in an ambulance,

429
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,466
looking for accidents,
trying to help people.

430
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,928
I don't think we were put on
this earth to hurt people,

431
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:46,847
I think we were put on
this earth to help people.

432
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:49,397
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

433
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,229
You must be a sensitive person.

434
00:27:53,243 --> 00:27:54,243
I try to be.

435
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:56,818
I bet you're a fan
of Rod McKuen's.

436
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:58,525
I listen to him every night.

437
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,065
I'm into trees.

438
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,383
Have you ever heard
of Joyce Kilmer?

439
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,384
Yeah.

440
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:06,874
She wrote a really terrific
poem about a tree.

441
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:07,875
He.

442
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,214
Who?

443
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,592
- He.
- He is a she?

444
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,340
- She's a he.
- Oh.

445
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:18,383
Well, he wrote a really
terrific poem about a tree.

446
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:19,468
Yeah.

447
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,604
You know what I like
best about trees?

448
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:22,605
No, what?

449
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:25,349
That you can lie under
them on a moonlit night,

450
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:28,354
the leaves gently blowing...

451
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,361
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

452
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,896
What were you saying about trees?

453
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:39,856
I was saying, what I like
best about trees is that,

454
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:43,078
on a moonlit night you
can lie under them,

455
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,758
with the leaves gently blowing...

456
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,759
JJ?

457
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,000
Hey, JJ, you'll never believe
what just happened to him.

458
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,332
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He had the most wonderful time.

459
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:54,918
I don't want to talk about...
Victor, Beauty. Beauty, Victor.

460
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:57,085
- Hello, Victor.
- You really are.

461
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,264
- You wanna hear about the doc?
- He can tell me about the doctor.

462
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:03,263
- Oh, it's about the doctor.
- It's really important.

463
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,006
- We need a doc for the ambulance.
- It'll keep.

464
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,502
I'll just leave you two alone.

465
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:08,388
But, listen, I think
you should hear...

466
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:11,687
- It'll keep.
- It's really important.

467
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:14,062
I want to talk to her.

468
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,479
Who?

469
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,474
Now do you wanna
hear about the doc?

470
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:20,475
No.

471
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:21,487
It'll keep.

472
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,874
Hey, Brad, old buddy. Ha-ha.
How the hell are you?

473
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:31,213
Shakey. My God, it is
you. Hello, Shakey.

474
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:36,625
Shakey, it's kind of tough
to get close to you.

475
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:38,950
Last time I saw you,
you were more svelte.

476
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,093
What can I tell you?

477
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:42,099
In the pizza business,
when things are

478
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,925
slow, you tend to
eat the inventory.

479
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:46,182
Listen, that's not good
for the Cannonball.

480
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,668
You know that. You don't need a

481
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,434
motorcycle. You need
the Super Chief.

482
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:53,688
Even with the extra tonnage,
I'm still the best there is.

483
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,072
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.

484
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,399
I got a throttle that's been
sticking. Why don't you fix that?

485
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:02,370
Boss, this is the
biggest coup in the

486
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:05,406
history of the Safety
Enforcement Unit.

487
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:08,792
We're gonna blow this
Cannonball thing wide open

488
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,460
and then we're gonna hit
Congress for a real budget

489
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,920
that will allow us to
play some real hardball.

490
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,420
I mean, this is our Three Mile
Island and Love Canal combined.

491
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:20,545
Oooh.

492
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:25,086
- What's wrong?
- Look at the chicks.

493
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,683
- What is it?
- Look at those chicks.

494
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,346
Boy, if we were Methodists,

495
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:35,895
what a shot we could have
of getting laid right here.

496
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:40,992
Listen, I want to get up there.
I don't want to miss a thing.

497
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,489
No. Yes. Yes.

498
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:44,031
All right. There you go.

499
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:45,954
Just as good as new.
Give her a try.

500
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,082
- That's it?
- That's it.

501
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,619
All right.

502
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,332
We'll see.

503
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:56,416
I don't think it's the throttle.
I think it's the clutch.

504
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,711
Goodbye.

505
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,295
Look out.

506
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,920
Hey, watch out. Watch out.

507
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,641
Coming through.

508
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,981
What in the hell was that?

509
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:19,522
Oh. That must be the entry of
the National Safety Council.

510
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:53,308
Good day.

511
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:56,691
I am here to participate in your
little jaunt to California.

512
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,400
Well, of course. If you
would sign in here, please.

513
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:05,863
Hold still, Petey. Say cheese.

514
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:09,677
I realise the novelty of a major

515
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,076
celebrity entering
your little race,

516
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,257
but kindly resist
the temptation and

517
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:16,410
keep the media
coverage to a minimum.

518
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:17,498
Thank you.

519
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,080
Will you hurry the hell up?

520
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:36,928
- Got it?
- I got it. Hurry up, will ya?

521
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,122
Man does not live
on... on bread alone.

522
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:58,036
What concerns me is, do we have
enough ice for all this beer?

523
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:01,253
Plenty.

524
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:04,424
Yeah, well, how about food,
son? Did you bring enough food?

525
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,275
Plenty.

526
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,585
Get serious. Give me
the rest of that beer.

527
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,190
Excuse me, good
sisters, if you will.

528
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:24,611
Father, we do have a race to run,
and we're running a little late.

529
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:27,191
So, come on. Will you
excuse him, good sisters?

530
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:29,705
Bye-bye.

531
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:31,985
Don't run off.
Tonight's the night.

532
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,276
Ok. I'd like to welcome you all

533
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:37,658
to an event that's
sometimes been called

534
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,406
the automotive counterpart
to the Bay of Pigs.

535
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,668
You all are certainly the
most distinguished group

536
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:47,258
of highway scofflaws
and degenerates

537
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,763
ever gathered together
in one place.

538
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,301
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

539
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:53,184
Of course, certain sceptics note

540
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:55,548
that perhaps 10,000
of the nation's

541
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:57,391
most elite highway patrolmen

542
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,275
are out there waiting
for us after we

543
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,934
start, but let's think positively.

544
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,309
Think of the fact that there
is not one state in the 50

545
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:06,727
that has the death
penalty for speeding.

546
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:09,776
Although I'm not so
sure about Ohio.

547
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,651
Everybody is gonna get
a card like this.

548
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,279
When you leave, you're gonna punch
out here at this time clock.

549
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:18,657
3,000 miles, roughly,
away from here

550
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:21,615
is another time clock just like
that at the Portofino Inn.

551
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,752
The difference between
the two times

552
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,576
is your time across the country.

553
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,708
The record stands at 32
hours and 51 minutes.

554
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:30,878
Believe it or not,

555
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,925
those guys did break the
55-mile-an-hour speed limit.

556
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,492
Let's get that first car up here.

557
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,388
We're gonna get this
thing under way.

558
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:56,565
Go.

559
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,791
- Victor.
- I know.

560
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,412
All right. Where is the doctor?

561
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:06,579
- I got everything else.
- Where's the doctor?

562
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,878
- I got 60 gallons of gasoline.
- Read my lips.

563
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:10,002
Where is the doctor?

564
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:13,128
- The auxiliary tanks are full...
- I gave you one responsibility,

565
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,966
to get a doctor. Now, where is he?

566
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:17,852
He got sick.

567
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,759
Listen to what I'm telling you.

568
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:22,308
You go find a doctor.
Get me Dr. Kildare,

569
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:24,312
get me Dr. Livingstone,
get me Dr. Frankenstein.

570
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:27,154
Just get me a doctor. Go
where the doctors hang out.

571
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,270
- Where's that?
- Bars, golf courses.

572
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:31,857
Golf course, bar.
Where else? Hospital.

573
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,193
Try there too.

574
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:35,948
My jet will take
you to California.

575
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,120
It's time for you to punch out.

576
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:45,288
I'll see you in
California. I love you.

577
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:54,586
A toast to us, you and me. We're
gonna win the whole thing.

578
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:55,674
It's a cinch.

579
00:35:55,717 --> 00:36:00,007
The more I look around and
see these turkeys, I have...

580
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:06,269
While you're drinking,
that truck to the left.

581
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,522
Isn't that JJ McClure?

582
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:13,232
He's nothing. Don't
worry about him.

583
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:15,528
It's the blimp next
to him. The blimp.

584
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:20,372
When he puts on that mask, he'll
blow your goddamn doors off.

585
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,120
You understand that? The blimp.

586
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:35,707
- Is that weird?
- Wow.

587
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:42,048
It's a Nevada licence plate.

588
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:46,478
And that's whiskey, zebra, alpha,

589
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,939
niner, fiver, zero.

590
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,230
- You got that?
- What?

591
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:54,614
It's... Just write WZA 9...

592
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,322
Here. Will you let me do it?

593
00:36:56,402 --> 00:37:00,492
WZA 950. See?

594
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:02,373
Whiskey, zebra, alpha,

595
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,660
- niner, fiver, zero.
- Oh.

596
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,870
Oh.

597
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:13,748
Ok, so it's Interstate
80 through Pennsylvania.

598
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:17,836
- Pick up...
- Oh, that's a good-looking piece.

599
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:21,594
And cunningly disguised so it
won't look like a racing car.

600
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:25,258
You know, the cops would never
give that a second glance.

601
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:28,808
220 miles an hour, and they
aren't gonna get a second glance.

602
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:33,813
Hey, when we get to California, I
got a place out at Palos Verdes...

603
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,605
You boys gonna start
this thing or just

604
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:37,398
sit there and wait for
that paint to dry?

605
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:39,946
Yes, sir.

606
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:43,905
How long till we stop?

607
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:47,872
- Eight hours.
- Damn. I gotta go to the John.

608
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:57,422
Go.

609
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:03,354
Mad Dog, you are gonna take the

610
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:05,353
shortcut to the
interstate, aren't you?

611
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,510
We're here to win, ain't we?

612
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:11,518
If you gonna be a
bear, be a grizzly.

613
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:21,606
My God, Pamela. Did you see that?

614
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,946
They drove right
through those trees.

615
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,583
I love trees. Did I tell you...

616
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,289
We are going right down there

617
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,289
and bring this thing to a
screeching halt, right now.

618
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:33,792
Buckle up. We're
going into action.

619
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,587
Would you mind?

620
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:39,755
Very civil.

621
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,667
Might be easier with
your lights on.

622
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:43,378
Why advertise?

623
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,394
- Wait a minute, Father.
- What?

624
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,485
That's a no-no. They
haven't allowed

625
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,062
that for nearly 2,000 years.

626
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:53,457
No, look. I'm a liberal wing, way

627
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,192
out, on the other
part of the church.

628
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:58,232
- It's nothing at all.
- Keep flying, Father.

629
00:38:58,316 --> 00:39:00,146
"Keep flying."

630
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:05,316
How about just one of you?

631
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,656
Who says cops won't
stop honeymooners?

632
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,655
Anyhow, why do I have
to be the bride?

633
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:14,827
Shut up, sweetie, and
punch the clock.

634
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,937
Ok, go slow until I get my wig on.

635
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:20,086
Yes, dear.

636
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:26,088
Old pal of mine, are we
all set for California?

637
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:30,427
Damn you. Next time, Methodist.
You understand? Methodist.

638
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:33,725
- All right, pal of mine.
- Ok, ok. You're all right.

639
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,230
Ok, now, who's driving?

640
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:37,772
- You're driving.
- You are.

641
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,605
- I can't drive.
- Then I'm driving.

642
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:42,441
- Yeah, I think you are.
- Ok.

643
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,277
All right. Put me down.

644
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,280
You drive. You hold this.
I'll get in the car.

645
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,749
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

646
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,126
Somebody's hat.

647
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,632
Hold my drink.

648
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,267
Hit it.

649
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,700
Thank you, good sisters.

650
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:34,622
May the good Lord take a liking
to you, but not too soon.

651
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:36,164
Bless you, my children.

652
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:39,247
Those guys are more juiced
up than that Ferrari.

653
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:56,271
- JJ. JJ, wait. I got the doc.
- Terrific.

654
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,560
No, wait. He's in the
ambulance. This way.

655
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:01,225
Come on.

656
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:03,774
Before I open this, don't
get your hopes up too high.

657
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:05,898
- I was pressed for time.
- No problem.

658
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:11,663
Holy shit.

659
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:13,701
I'm honoured, sir.

660
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:15,994
I'm Doctor Nikol...

661
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:19,118
Nikolas Van Helsing,
professor of proctology

662
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:20,957
and other related tendencies.

663
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:25,132
Graduate of the University of
Rangoon and assorted night classes

664
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:28,843
at the Knoxville, Tennessee,
College of Faith Healing.

665
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:31,885
You may be a little
overqualified for this job.

666
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,549
You got your equipment with you?

667
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,138
I never go anywhere without it.

668
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:38,605
However, in my particular line of

669
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:41,274
work, I seldom need
more than this.

670
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,233
Or this.

671
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,815
We'll talk about this later, huh?

672
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:56,197
Now, sir, before we
commence this odyssey,

673
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:59,325
which I understand will carry
us across this grand nation,

674
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:01,293
from sea to shining sea,

675
00:42:01,374 --> 00:42:03,714
there's the matter
of my compensation.

676
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:06,635
I've determined that my services

677
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:08,957
will require the
payment of $2,000.

678
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:15,642
I was thinking more along
the lines of $200.

679
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:20,731
Fortunately, my practise
allows me a certain flexibility.

680
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:26,402
After checking my schedule, I find
I'll be able to make the journey.

681
00:42:26,482 --> 00:42:29,112
As far as the money's
concerned, you got a deal.

682
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,195
We're off.

683
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,409
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

684
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:41,454
3,000 carefree, madcap
miles to California.

685
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:44,098
♪ California, here we come ♪

686
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:46,197
♪ Right back where
we started from ♪

687
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,592
Thanks to you, Victor, we do not
have a female patient in the back.

688
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:52,364
Thanks to your wonderful
cousin Tessie.

689
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,762
It's not my fault she didn't
fit in the stretcher.

690
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:59,465
- Doesn't fit in the ambulance.
- I got the doc here, didn't I?

691
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:03,389
Don't you ever tell
me where you got him.

692
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,480
I don't want to know
where you got him.

693
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:06,481
Ok.

694
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:08,400
I was just surprised that all
the animals there were...

695
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:10,267
I don't want to know
where you got him.

696
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,268
Ok.

697
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:13,953
Hey, maybe I could be the patient.

698
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,030
That's a good idea. Everybody
would believe you were sick.

699
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:20,326
- Wouldn't you believe he's sick?
- Want me to examine him?

700
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:24,831
JJ. Him doesn't like it when
you say bad things about me,

701
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:26,495
and you know that.

702
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:30,165
Thanks to you, though, we
don't have a female patient.

703
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:32,344
And we've got to find a female...

704
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:34,924
JJ.

705
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:36,549
Damn Cannonballers.

706
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,720
- Hi. I'm so happy you're here.
- Hi.

707
00:43:42,808 --> 00:43:46,018
- Can you help me with Mr...
- Foyt.

708
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:49,063
- Foyt.
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.

709
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:52,278
Mr. Foyt, go around and get
in the emergency entrance.

710
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,781
Come on right here.

711
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,702
There we go. Hit it.

712
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:58,241
Wait, I'm not...

713
00:43:58,324 --> 00:43:59,574
Ow.

714
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,155
This is really terrific,

715
00:44:03,245 --> 00:44:05,865
the way you guys go
around helping people.

716
00:44:05,956 --> 00:44:08,058
Next year we're
going for the Nobel

717
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,336
Prize. That's where
the big bucks are.

718
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:14,629
You forgot Mr...

719
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:16,255
Mr...

720
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:18,012
- Foyt.
- Foyt.

721
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:19,974
Mm. Well, we got you.

722
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:22,764
We're batting .500.
Nobody's perfect.

723
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:25,098
I think you have to go
back and pick him up.

724
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:30,191
We'd really like to, but
we're on a tight schedule.

725
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:31,822
We're on our way to California.

726
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:35,239
You'd be amazed how many sick
people there are out there.

727
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:38,239
They need our help. We could
pick him up on the way back.

728
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,287
Victor, can you help me?

729
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,160
No, I can't. I can't do anything.

730
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:49,708
But... he can.

731
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:51,382
Who can?

732
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,880
Him.

733
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,100
Excuse me.

734
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,732
Excuse me.

735
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:09,806
Doctor...

736
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:17,185
My God, the perfect specimen.

737
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,320
JJ, you want me to start the
examination right away?

738
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:23,737
I'm gonna like this
job. Right here, honey.

739
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:26,076
No, thank you. Not right now.

740
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,415
(Speaks foreign language)

741
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:36,798
Of course, man.
This took 30 years.

742
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:48,854
Never be able to see
us, the son of a guns.

743
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:13,753
I'm really sorry about that
little lapse, Officer.

744
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,134
Normally, I drive right
around the speed limit.

745
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:18,422
We all make mistakes,
miss, but 160?

746
00:46:18,423 --> 00:46:20,512
That's a little more than a lapse.

747
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:33,272
What the hell is going on here?
Everybody's driving like maniacs.

748
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:34,854
I don't know, Officer.

749
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:37,109
Let me see your driver's
licence, please.

750
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:52,669
Ah, what the hell? I
can't penalise nice

751
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,384
girls like you for a
little indiscretion

752
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:58,589
with the whole road packed
with speed-crazy lunatics.

753
00:47:00,214 --> 00:47:02,634
Here. You girls have a nice trip.

754
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:04,487
Drive carefully and take it easy.

755
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,488
Thank you.

756
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,219
- Come back and see us next year.
- Bye.

757
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:10,932
Take care.

758
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:12,806
Keep it in the road.

759
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:19,072
I don't know why you're
pouting. I mean, look,

760
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:21,779
we're taking a nice, leisurely
trip to California.

761
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:24,111
And we're picking up the
bills. This could be fun.

762
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:26,316
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

763
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:28,367
This is not a joke any
more. I'm being kidnapped.

764
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,580
You can call it kidnapping,
if you want to be rude.

765
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:33,541
Just think, we have a
professional physician on board

766
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:36,332
in case somebody gets swamp fever.

767
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:39,997
You guys are strange.

768
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:45,431
- JJ?
- Yeah?

769
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,639
- We got company.
- Yeah, I hear.

770
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:51,313
Ok, Beauty. You lie down and
be a patient for the police.

771
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,930
- No.
- Come on.

772
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:56,767
Don't. I'm not gonna help you.
You didn't even help Mr...

773
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:58,733
- Foyt.
- Foyt.

774
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,230
Maybe I can help.

775
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:04,528
Dear God.

776
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:06,532
It's all right, miss.
It doesn't hurt.

777
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:08,324
Give it to myself all the time.

778
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:10,447
Yeah. He gives it to
himself all the time.

779
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:14,788
Show her.

780
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:18,714
Come on, Doc. Show her.

781
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:22,004
Show her.

782
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:37,773
There. You see?

783
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:39,103
That didn't hurt.

784
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,770
- JJ?
- No, thanks.

785
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:43,978
Victor?

786
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:45,488
Oh, no thanks.

787
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,145
No.

788
00:49:09,718 --> 00:49:11,928
Hi, guys. What's up?

789
00:49:12,012 --> 00:49:13,222
- What's up?
- Huh.

790
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:15,246
You guys are running
120, your little lights

791
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:17,015
are flashing all over.
That's what's up.

792
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:20,651
- We've got a patient in there.
- You were still speeding.

793
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:22,277
She's, She's very sick.

794
00:49:22,278 --> 00:49:24,939
There's not a hospital
within 50 miles.

795
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:26,645
- Where you headed?
- UCLA.

796
00:49:26,735 --> 00:49:27,985
UCLA?

797
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,320
- UCLA Medical Centre.
- LA.

798
00:49:30,406 --> 00:49:31,696
California?

799
00:49:32,992 --> 00:49:35,466
This is gonna sound like
a dumb question, but

800
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,832
if she's that sick, why
didn't you fly her?

801
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:39,713
Why didn't we fly her?

802
00:49:42,584 --> 00:49:45,754
I'm just the driver. We
have to ask the doc.

803
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:47,008
No.

804
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,879
That's a good idea. Why
don't we ask the doc?

805
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:52,761
I'm sorry.

806
00:49:56,306 --> 00:49:59,426
What's going on out here? What
is this crude interruption?

807
00:50:04,314 --> 00:50:07,484
The patient. Why can't she
be flown to California?

808
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:11,778
Cysts. On the walls of
her lungs. Very rare.

809
00:50:11,864 --> 00:50:15,204
You see, aeroplanes are only
pressurised at 10,000 feet.

810
00:50:15,284 --> 00:50:19,454
Anybody who knows anything about
medicine knows that she can't fly.

811
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:21,788
We couldn't even go through
Denver it's so high.

812
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:25,754
Tell them to go back
and pick up Mr...

813
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,920
- Foyt.
- Foyt.

814
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,455
Is that lady all right?

815
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,128
She's in great pain.

816
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:34,676
Causes her to make certain
delirious... drememium...

817
00:50:34,762 --> 00:50:36,722
I'm deliri...

818
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,067
Sounds like she's
on something to me.

819
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:43,190
Let me explain something to you.

820
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,190
We have to get the senator's
wife to California in 72 hours.

821
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:49,484
Do you understand what
I'm saying? We ha...

822
00:50:51,195 --> 00:50:56,155
We have to get the senator's
wife to California in 72 hours.

823
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:58,331
We're very close.

824
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:01,776
Well, as long as
you're in New Jersey,

825
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:03,748
I want you fellas to take it easy.

826
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:06,332
- You got that?
- We sure do.

827
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:10,757
- Thanks a lot.
- Get this rig outta here.

828
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,050
I'm glad there's no cupcakes
like that in New Jersey.

829
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:18,676
You haven't met my
brother-in-law, Ralph.

830
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:30,074
I thought that cop was gonna
have a cardiac arrest

831
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,240
when we said we were
going to California.

832
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:35,856
Wasn't Beauty terrific?

833
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:37,738
The lady was splendid.

834
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:41,405
She should have her picture on
the cover of the AMA journal.

835
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:44,245
AMA journal.

836
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,285
I'm sure that doctor's a
very sweet man, basically.

837
00:51:49,378 --> 00:51:50,378
Thanks.

838
00:51:50,462 --> 00:51:53,052
But don't you ever tell
me where you found him.

839
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:54,922
Ever.

840
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:57,675
It's the damn Cannonball for sure.

841
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:00,051
They blasted away right
in front of my eyes.

842
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:02,849
And they kidnapped a girl
named Pamela Glover,

843
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,853
just like it was the goddamn
Red Brigade or something.

844
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:07,976
But I... No, I've got them.

845
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,443
This time I've got them.

846
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:13,574
Ohio? Yes. Ohio has been notified.

847
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:16,402
Yeah. Ohio has been notified.

848
00:52:16,488 --> 00:52:19,908
And Missouri. And California.

849
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:23,042
We'll get them, and I'm gonna
be there to handle it.

850
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,331
You can count on it.

851
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,290
Yeah.

852
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:31,254
Listen, I've got two minutes
to catch my flight. Yeah. Bye.

853
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:36,762
Hey. Hey.

854
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:39,835
- Madam. Madam.
- Madam?

855
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:42,508
I'm no madam. I'm a decent,
respectable woman.

856
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:44,968
I don't even own a house.
I live in an apartment.

857
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:47,308
Now get off my case.
I'm late for my plane.

858
00:52:53,525 --> 00:52:55,225
Oh.

859
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:04,008
Well, then, after my
career in the RAF...

860
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:05,009
The what?

861
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,332
- The Royal Air Force.
- Oh.

862
00:53:07,414 --> 00:53:09,296
Do you mind if I have a cigarette?

863
00:53:09,297 --> 00:53:10,924
Go ahead. They're your lungs.

864
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,851
Well, I had a chestful
of citations,

865
00:53:12,852 --> 00:53:14,251
medals, that sort of thing,

866
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:16,918
and then I drifted in
playing a rather popular...

867
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:18,547
Not that one, darling, please.

868
00:53:18,634 --> 00:53:20,600
We don't want you
leaving so shortly

869
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:22,354
after the trip has begun, do we?

870
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:24,389
No, of course not.

871
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:26,702
Then I drifted into
playing a rather

872
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,233
popular character on
a television series.

873
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,311
It's still in
syndication, you know.

874
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:34,404
Puff away.

875
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:39,027
Thanks a lot, ladies. But I
would take it a little easier.

876
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:42,702
Some of the officers up the road
might not be as understanding.

877
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:47,413
Thank you so much, Officer. We
really do appreciate that warning.

878
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:50,576
And if you're ever up in Duluth,
remember to look me up.

879
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,839
I got the number. You
can count on it.

880
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,180
How's the patient?

881
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,436
She's alive.

882
00:54:14,523 --> 00:54:17,283
Looks like she survived
the procedure.

883
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,689
What procedure?

884
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:21,947
If you guys laid a finger on me...

885
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:28,704
No, I just gave her
a little prick.

886
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:32,002
With this.

887
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:35,582
Super Chief, lean forward so I can
get the front wheel on the ground.

888
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:38,499
Stop kidding. I am.

889
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:58,069
Pull over. We want to
give you our blessings.

890
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,690
JJ. There are two priests
in that car over there.

891
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:02,988
What?

892
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:07,372
They want us to pull over.

893
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,041
- Victor.
- Yeah.

894
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,159
They're two priests
driving a Ferrari.

895
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:14,246
When's the last time you saw
two priests driving a Ferrari?

896
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,977
They taking the bingo money home?

897
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,713
They're doing the
work of the Lord.

898
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:20,304
In a Ferrari, they can do
it faster, that's all.

899
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:24,218
Pull over.

900
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,591
We want to bless you.

901
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:30,177
- Victor.
- Yeah?

902
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:32,385
One of the priests is black.

903
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:34,569
Oh, yeah. They have black priests.

904
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,570
They do?

905
00:55:35,571 --> 00:55:37,194
Oh, sure. They have
a black cardinal.

906
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:42,032
Oh. They do want us to pull over.
They want to bless us. Can we?

907
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,570
Let me get this straight.

908
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:47,886
You want us to pull
over and be blessed

909
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,794
by a black priest
in a red Ferrari?

910
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:51,869
Couldn't hurt.

911
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:54,623
Oy vey.

912
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:05,513
- Nice car, Father.
- Thank you, asshole.

913
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:09,345
Hello, Father. Nice-looking car.

914
00:56:09,429 --> 00:56:12,059
That's what everybody...
He even said it.

915
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,520
I want to thank you
for stopping, son,

916
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:17,186
because we always
stop the ambulance

917
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:19,771
so we can bless
whosever's in there.

918
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:23,186
And you paramedics are doing
such a wonderful job.

919
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:24,859
We're in kind of a
hurry, so if you

920
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,486
can just bless it
and then we can...

921
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,744
Oh. I gotta bless her.

922
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:32,578
I'm sorry, Father.
She's a Zen Buddhist.

923
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:34,871
You're not, so you
can't bless her.

924
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:37,371
We specialise in
blessing Zen Buddhists.

925
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:38,787
Yeah.

926
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:44,126
- Oh...
- Yes?

927
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:47,682
Second thought, Father,
you want to bless him?

928
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:51,179
We need all the help we can get.
Just give him a little shot.

929
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:57,022
- Thank you, Father.
- You're quite welcome.

930
00:56:57,102 --> 00:56:58,942
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

931
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:04,356
Thank you, Father.

932
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,742
Why don't you take that piece
of shit back to the junk yard?

933
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:18,617
- Ooh. JJ, we got a...
- Flat.

934
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:22,037
- Yeah. And those priests...
- Weren't fathers.

935
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:23,787
- They were...
- Mothers.

936
00:57:24,463 --> 00:57:26,173
- Come here.
- Oh, jeez.

937
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:29,126
Ah, shit.

938
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:36,391
So there you have it, a rather
simple story, actually.

939
00:57:36,475 --> 00:57:40,095
International film star,
ruthless assassin,

940
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:43,107
Casanova, poet, philosopher.

941
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,480
You might say a legend
in my own time.

942
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,487
In fact, you can. Not
that one, darling.

943
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,200
I'm afraid this car
is full of surprises.

944
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,621
This is something I've noticed.

945
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,580
How about some champagne, darling?

946
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,354
Little silver four-wheeler
that just flew

947
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:00,920
past, with the
good-looking seat cover.

948
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:04,539
Son, back that thing down. You got
smokeys all over my back door.

949
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:07,297
If you are referring to me,

950
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,590
I request that you speak more
clearly in the Queen's English.

951
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:14,506
That is, if we are going to
converse on this wireless.

952
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:17,006
Ah. Bless your heart.

953
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,808
Cheers.

954
00:58:18,892 --> 00:58:20,772
Down the hatch.

955
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:53,795
What do you think you're
doing? You can't come in here.

956
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:54,925
You're a man.

957
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:58,311
- 7-Eleven. How can I help?
- Pumps one and two, hit 'em.

958
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,236
What are you, some
kind of nut? You

959
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,980
got one unleaded and one premium.

960
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:05,098
She goes both ways.

961
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:08,438
The round orange moon pie with the
white hat on, he'll pay for it.

962
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:11,525
I'm a doctor, and if I may
be permitted the indelicacy,

963
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:14,281
you seen one, you've seen 'em all.

964
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,453
A thousand miles on
one wheel? We're

965
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:25,749
trying to win a race,
not set a record.

966
00:59:43,476 --> 00:59:44,846
Victor, what have you got?

967
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:48,146
A lot of goodies for you guys and
a Big Gulp Dr Pepper for me.

968
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:51,552
♪ I'm a pepper, you're a pepper
He's a pepper, she's a pepper ♪

969
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,135
♪ Wouldn't you like
to be a pepper too ♪

970
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:55,706
- Will you get in here?
- Ok. Here you go.

971
01:00:04,164 --> 01:00:05,624
Officer.

972
01:00:09,753 --> 01:00:11,803
Do you take your law and order
in this town seriously?

973
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,010
Are you kidding?

974
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,257
Excuse me for asking.

975
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:22,677
Greek. But...

976
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:25,056
Would you shut up a
minute and listen to me?

977
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:27,353
(Both speak foreign language)

978
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:41,872
Oh, by the way, Greek.

979
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:45,501
What's the odds on the
Japanese team not finishing?

980
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,170
There's gonna be a red Ferrari
come flying through here

981
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:50,481
and the two men driving
are responsible

982
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:52,379
for the victim in this ambulance.

983
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:55,422
- Victim?
- A flasher victim.

984
01:00:56,508 --> 01:00:58,508
- You want to know the worst part?
- What's that?

985
01:00:58,593 --> 01:01:00,843
- They're dressed as priests.
- Go on.

986
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:04,099
I guess they think it's a little
kinkier, dressed as priests.

987
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:06,142
Goddamn, that's sick.

988
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:08,636
- I'll handle this.
- One more thing.

989
01:01:08,728 --> 01:01:09,938
I think they're armed.

990
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:12,727
Damn, I hope so.

991
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,070
It'll give me an excuse.

992
01:01:24,077 --> 01:01:25,657
Flashers.

993
01:01:26,788 --> 01:01:28,248
Bye-bye.

994
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:30,331
JJ, you son of a...

995
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:32,377
Out of the car, both of you.

996
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,840
Now.

997
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:39,088
All right, hit it.

998
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,625
- Hit it?
- Hit it?

999
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:50,322
Freeze, or name your beneficiary.

1000
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:51,351
Beneficiary?

1001
01:01:51,438 --> 01:01:53,975
Officer, I sincerely hope
you're not a Catholic.

1002
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,318
Pay no attention to him.

1003
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,360
He's been locked up
for six years in that

1004
01:01:57,361 --> 01:01:59,320
monastery. He don't
know what he's doing.

1005
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:01,614
I don't think both of his
paddles are in the water.

1006
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:03,658
Six years is gonna seem
like a summer vacation

1007
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,162
when the state of Missouri
gets through with you.

1008
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:09,254
You, shorty. Where'd you
get all that jewellery?

1009
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:13,293
- Why'd he call me shorty?
- Because you're small.

1010
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:16,546
- Small. S-M-all.
- Oh.

1011
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,879
I suggest you take another
route, good buddy.

1012
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:22,083
The smokeys have got
traffic all tied up

1013
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:24,046
on 40 looking for
them Cannonballers.

1014
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:26,217
That's a big ten-four.

1015
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:27,386
- Hey, JJ.
- Yeah?

1016
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:30,394
There's a lot of talk on the
CB about the roadblock ahead.

1017
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:31,517
What do you think?

1018
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:34,160
I think we're in
deep you-know-what.

1019
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:36,234
The transmission is slipping.

1020
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:39,066
We lost a lot of time because
of your two phony priests.

1021
01:02:39,152 --> 01:02:41,402
Oh. I'm sorry.

1022
01:02:42,155 --> 01:02:44,275
If the transmission
does hold together,

1023
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:45,622
you think we're gonna be able to

1024
01:02:45,623 --> 01:02:47,115
bluff our way through
the roadblock?

1025
01:02:47,202 --> 01:02:50,872
I don't know. Give me a
minute to gather my thoughts.

1026
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:00,383
I gathered my thoughts.

1027
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:03,425
Hey, Lowboy. Look in
your rear view mirror.

1028
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,300
See this ambulance back here?

1029
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:07,546
We need a piggyback ride.

1030
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:11,852
This one can go by.
There's no problem here.

1031
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:16,685
Let's just have this
one and that one.

1032
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,950
Yeah, that one's ok. Let it go.

1033
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,367
Excuse me.

1034
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:31,162
You look very familiar.
Do I know you?

1035
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:33,406
It's quite possible. Is
this going to take long?

1036
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:36,118
You see, we're on our
honeymoon, and she can't wait.

1037
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:38,039
Thank God. Normal people.

1038
01:03:38,127 --> 01:03:40,047
We were just looking
for Cannonb...

1039
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:42,459
It's not important. Move
along, if you would.

1040
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:45,089
- What is this, anyway?
- It's a stakeout.

1041
01:03:45,176 --> 01:03:46,546
Oh. Bon appétit.

1042
01:03:48,263 --> 01:03:49,973
English humour.

1043
01:03:51,015 --> 01:03:53,805
Come on, guys, keep
moving, will you, please?

1044
01:03:56,563 --> 01:03:58,023
Let's see...

1045
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:03,439
Quiet, Victor. You're
gonna blow our cover.

1046
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:08,618
JJ, this is not a nine-to-five
job. I wish him were here.

1047
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,410
Hi.

1048
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:11,833
Hello.

1049
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:19,632
- You look tired.
- Ah, more frustrated than tired.

1050
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,801
Think you're gonna
win this crazy race?

1051
01:04:22,714 --> 01:04:24,014
Damn right I am.

1052
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:27,311
I'm sitting here,
having a conversation

1053
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:29,053
with somebody who kidnapped me.

1054
01:04:29,137 --> 01:04:33,677
Who can blame anybody
for kidnapping you?

1055
01:04:34,684 --> 01:04:36,484
You gave me laughing gas.

1056
01:04:36,561 --> 01:04:39,441
Well, you have an awful
beautiful laugh.

1057
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:42,572
You made me forget my favourite
skirt back at the motel...

1058
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,650
Doesn't matter. You look
terrific without it.

1059
01:04:54,037 --> 01:04:55,497
What'd you expect, anyway?

1060
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:01,064
A gangbang or something like that.

1061
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,065
A gangbang?

1062
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:04,496
We're racers, not rapists.

1063
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:07,626
- Why?
- Why what?

1064
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:13,471
Why all this speed and
trouble and risk and...

1065
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:15,216
I mean, what for?

1066
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:16,728
For the hell of it.

1067
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:21,732
Didn't you ever do anything
just for the hell of it?

1068
01:05:21,814 --> 01:05:23,234
I guess so.

1069
01:05:23,316 --> 01:05:25,976
My father used to work
in the coal mines.

1070
01:05:28,613 --> 01:05:30,203
43 years.

1071
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,030
He was gonna retire.

1072
01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:38,623
Buy a houseboat. Move
down to Florida.

1073
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:43,839
Fish on the back of the
boat and tell my mum lies.

1074
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:49,513
He died two days before
he was gonna retire.

1075
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:50,592
Oh.

1076
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,434
I guess you just never know.

1077
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:55,682
Yeah.

1078
01:05:56,975 --> 01:06:01,685
I made up my mind right then,
I was gonna go for it.

1079
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:05,231
I mean, everything I wanted, I
was gonna go for it right then,

1080
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:09,699
because you never know when
something's gonna happen to you.

1081
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:12,568
Like talking to you, you know?

1082
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,120
I mean, it's really nice.

1083
01:06:18,246 --> 01:06:22,166
Excuse me. Where are
you guys going?

1084
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,335
We're just... We're
just out-out-out

1085
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:26,250
looking for a pack of cigarettes.

1086
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:28,094
With North Carolina plates, you're

1087
01:06:28,095 --> 01:06:30,007
driving to Missouri
for cigarettes?

1088
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:33,223
How about a beer?

1089
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:36,222
How about the fact that your
paint job is coming off?

1090
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:40,055
You want to take these guys away?
The good guys strike back.

1091
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,577
What is that? Five,
eight, three...

1092
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:44,403
Five, eight, three, six...

1093
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:49,992
Hold on. Hold on.
Let it go. Come on.

1094
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:52,399
Come on, guys, keep
moving, will you, please?

1095
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:59,238
Howdy, sir. What seems
to be the problem?

1096
01:06:59,328 --> 01:07:01,271
You didn't think you'd
get away with this?

1097
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:03,168
We're gonna get the
whole lot of you now.

1098
01:07:03,249 --> 01:07:06,249
Not here, you won't. The word
is out about your roadblock.

1099
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:08,745
They're talking about it all
up and down the "super slab".

1100
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:12,258
Come on, get these traitors
out of here, will you?

1101
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:14,261
You think you're so big.

1102
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:17,137
Do some of you people
want to come over

1103
01:07:17,138 --> 01:07:19,013
and push this thing
out of the way?

1104
01:07:19,098 --> 01:07:21,178
Come on. I'll put it in neutral.

1105
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:25,186
Who did that? Make it stop.

1106
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:42,997
Thanks a lot. Keep on trucking.

1107
01:07:50,379 --> 01:07:52,339
(Both speak foreign language)

1108
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:59,637
George, you remember the good
old days before they got radar?

1109
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:03,022
- We used to chase speeders?
- Yeah. This is really boring.

1110
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:04,731
(Speaks foreign language)

1111
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:24,327
Smokey. Sayonara. Bye-bye.

1112
01:08:24,413 --> 01:08:25,833
What the hell was that?

1113
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:28,575
I don't know, but whatever
it was, it was doing 125.

1114
01:08:43,891 --> 01:08:46,351
That's the first time we
took an order by phone.

1115
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:48,244
It was hard to understand you.

1116
01:08:48,245 --> 01:08:51,015
When I called, I was
doing 140 miles an hour.

1117
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:53,477
That was six lamb burgers,
four shish kebabs,

1118
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,988
a side order of couscous, and...

1119
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,700
two milk.

1120
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,570
No. How much?

1121
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,737
Six seventy-five.

1122
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:03,826
Here, my desert blossom.

1123
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,541
Keep the change.

1124
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:08,041
Have you ever considered
joining a harem?

1125
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,170
I shall return for
you after the race.

1126
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:24,433
Get a physical. I shall
return, my little fig.

1127
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:26,095
I love you.

1128
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:33,475
Victor...

1129
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:36,482
I don't know how to ask you this.

1130
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:41,697
Isn't it strange having that guy
running around inside your head?

1131
01:09:41,782 --> 01:09:44,452
Oh. He's not in here.

1132
01:09:44,535 --> 01:09:47,445
He's out there somewhere,
helping people.

1133
01:09:47,538 --> 01:09:50,118
- Oh.
- He's always helping people.

1134
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,788
- He'd help you.
- He would?

1135
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:54,917
He likes you.

1136
01:09:57,048 --> 01:10:00,678
Well, how did he find you? I mean,
how did you two get together?

1137
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,090
Well, when I was real young,

1138
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,639
I didn't have any
friends like I do now.

1139
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:07,433
Like JJ...

1140
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:09,681
Like JJ.

1141
01:10:12,813 --> 01:10:15,296
One day I was in the
schoolyard, and nine

1142
01:10:15,297 --> 01:10:17,483
guys were beating
me up pretty good.

1143
01:10:17,568 --> 01:10:19,188
There he was.

1144
01:10:19,278 --> 01:10:21,148
Dun-dun-dah.

1145
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,909
- Captain Chaos?
- Yeah. Out of the blue.

1146
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:28,161
Pow. Slam. Bam. Boff.

1147
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,870
I sure was grateful.

1148
01:10:30,957 --> 01:10:32,617
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1149
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,288
Nobody bothered me at
school after that.

1150
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:37,208
I wish I had a friend like that.

1151
01:10:37,296 --> 01:10:40,256
Well, first, you need
a mask and a cape.

1152
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:43,091
I think I'd like mine to be pink.

1153
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:44,927
Almost everything I wear is pink.

1154
01:10:45,012 --> 01:10:46,142
Everything?

1155
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:48,966
Even...?

1156
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:50,518
Oh, I don't wear any.

1157
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:52,351
You don't?

1158
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:54,519
Wow.

1159
01:10:56,774 --> 01:11:01,194
Victor, I'd like to be your
friend. Because I like you.

1160
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:03,109
Oh.

1161
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:05,197
I like you too, Beauty.

1162
01:11:05,283 --> 01:11:06,953
Thank you.

1163
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:14,123
(Both speak foreign language)

1164
01:11:20,715 --> 01:11:22,965
New Mexico.

1165
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:35,193
Texas. Stupid.

1166
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:07,339
I'll take care of this one.

1167
01:12:19,065 --> 01:12:21,105
Well, hello, hot pants.

1168
01:12:21,192 --> 01:12:23,355
I don't suppose you
have a driver's licence

1169
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:25,322
tucked down in there
somewhere, do you?

1170
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,284
Yes, Officer.

1171
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:38,578
That policeman seems to
want us to stop, darling.

1172
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:41,957
Yes. He must be rather
upset with our rapid rate.

1173
01:12:42,046 --> 01:12:43,481
Funny. They don't
have any sense of

1174
01:12:43,482 --> 01:12:44,796
humour about that sort of thing.

1175
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:47,932
- Aren't you going to pull over?
- I'd rather not.

1176
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,140
Can be such a bore,
talking to those chaps.

1177
01:12:51,222 --> 01:12:53,472
Tell you what. We'll
just... slip away.

1178
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:56,977
- Hit that button, will you?
- Like in your movies.

1179
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:04,981
And now a little
oil, right, darling?

1180
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,460
Well, well. We are full
of tricks, aren't we?

1181
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:21,632
It's all part of my
business, really.

1182
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:24,500
I've been meaning to ask
you, what movie...?

1183
01:13:24,588 --> 01:13:27,088
Wait a minute. Can you
see where you're going?

1184
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:30,304
- Perfectly.
- This is ridiculous.

1185
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:38,921
Good sport, isn't
it? Would you mind

1186
01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:41,274
rolling the window down, old girl?

1187
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:43,565
We're getting done like a
couple of kippers here.

1188
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:47,319
- Next time, I bring my mask.
- Like a foggy day in London town.

1189
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:01,876
You are about to witness
the ravishment of a woman

1190
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,289
who has been abducted.

1191
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:08,587
A woman whose initial fear has
mellowed into curious expectation.

1192
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:12,434
In the morning, she will be set
free, unaware of anything,

1193
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:15,351
except that she has been
loved as never before...

1194
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,610
Oh, no. Please...

1195
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:29,612
Oh, yes, there. There.

1196
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:45,251
I've never seen a damn Rolls-Royce
that'd do 140 miles an hour.

1197
01:14:45,336 --> 01:14:47,046
What you fellas got in that thing?

1198
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:49,299
- Stock.
- Sign here.

1199
01:14:49,381 --> 01:14:51,671
I guess you must have
misconstrued my remark

1200
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:54,469
about my mother planning to
purchase Southern California

1201
01:14:54,553 --> 01:14:57,433
as an attempt to influence your
giving me a ticket, Officer.

1202
01:14:57,515 --> 01:15:00,082
I am sure that she will
still consider keeping

1203
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,595
you all on as a member
of the Highway Patrol,

1204
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:05,306
regardless of how shabbily
you treated her son.

1205
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:08,147
You might want to tell
that to the judge, sir.

1206
01:15:19,662 --> 01:15:22,462
This is for you and the judge.

1207
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,500
Goddamn camel jockey.

1208
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,259
Oh, shit. We got a
smokey on our tail.

1209
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:39,136
Watch this.

1210
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:42,887
- Officer.
- Pull it over.

1211
01:15:42,977 --> 01:15:44,597
We got no brakes.

1212
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:47,807
No brakes. Help us.
Yes, thank you.

1213
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:49,978
Damn "no brake" gag
works every time.

1214
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:56,025
Oh, no. We really don't
have any brakes.

1215
01:15:56,115 --> 01:15:58,195
- Quit kidding, will you?
- Hang on.

1216
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:12,045
Evel Knievel... you've got
yourself some competition.

1217
01:16:53,464 --> 01:16:55,724
Route 66. Ha-ha.

1218
01:17:09,521 --> 01:17:11,561
(Speaks foreign language)

1219
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:17,199
(Speaks foreign language)

1220
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,737
Secret weapon.

1221
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:38,804
(Chan chatters nervously)

1222
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:42,598
Ready, fire.

1223
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,450
How long we been here?

1224
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:02,911
20 minutes. We could
have been there by now.

1225
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:05,621
The road will be open in
five minutes, Father.

1226
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,459
Hey, Father Putz.

1227
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,340
Albert Schweitzer.

1228
01:18:20,426 --> 01:18:23,796
I want to thank you for
being so sweet and so nice,

1229
01:18:23,887 --> 01:18:27,767
and telling those people all
about us, back in Missouri,

1230
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:31,440
that we were both
flashers and sex maniacs.

1231
01:18:34,356 --> 01:18:36,816
Well, I just wanted
to return the favour

1232
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,780
that you and the chocolate
monk did for us back in Ohio.

1233
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:42,449
"The chocolate monk"?

1234
01:18:45,826 --> 01:18:46,906
He can say that.

1235
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:48,834
He can say that, he can say that

1236
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:52,292
because he's riding around
with the Goodyear blimp.

1237
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:53,493
The Goodyear blimp?

1238
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:55,464
He can say that. He can say that.

1239
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:59,054
- Yeah, I can say that.
- Because if I had the time,

1240
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:02,721
I would take those rosary beads
and stuff 'em up your nose.

1241
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:04,556
These rosary beads?
My rosary beads?

1242
01:19:04,557 --> 01:19:05,557
Yeah.

1243
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:07,323
You're gonna shove
'em up this nose?

1244
01:19:07,324 --> 01:19:08,510
Up that nose, yeah.

1245
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:13,306
- He can do that.
- He can do that?

1246
01:19:13,395 --> 01:19:15,305
- You take a little advice?
- Sure.

1247
01:19:17,107 --> 01:19:18,727
Bring friends.

1248
01:19:24,281 --> 01:19:26,531
A lot of 'em.

1249
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:32,712
He wants me to bring...

1250
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,706
Blimp?

1251
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:53,227
Ah, the bride and
groom Cannonballer.

1252
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:55,520
I told you this honeymoon
scheme would work.

1253
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:57,734
Good. Now you wear
the wig, sweetheart.

1254
01:19:57,815 --> 01:19:59,765
- It's hot.
- Oh, I don't know.

1255
01:19:59,858 --> 01:20:02,688
When I was in Egypt making
The Fly Who Bugged Me

1256
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:06,238
it was at least 180 in the shade,
not that there was much shade.

1257
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,533
If CBS woulda had
their cameras there

1258
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:10,637
we'd have made Sports
Spectacular. We

1259
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:12,497
just zoomed right over that train.

1260
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:13,869
You want to try it again?

1261
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,600
All right.

1262
01:20:38,564 --> 01:20:41,694
Don't you look precious?
All dressed up like that.

1263
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:44,735
And wearing a wig too.
Ha-ha. Ain't he cute?

1264
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,110
Those guys scare me.

1265
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:50,117
You just stay close to Moore.
There won't be any trouble.

1266
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:53,953
He looks like Gregory Peck
in that blue flannel suit.

1267
01:20:57,624 --> 01:21:00,884
This is my friend Shakey.
Allow me to present myself.

1268
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:03,881
I'm on Wall Street. Maybe
we can have lunch sometime.

1269
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:06,174
We don't ride in Wall Street.

1270
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:08,678
Nah, we don't ride in Wall Street.

1271
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,430
Why don't we go and help 'em out?

1272
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:11,722
What do you mean, "we"?

1273
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:15,805
If we do, then that road opens
up and you're long gone.

1274
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:17,643
Now, why don't you, huh?

1275
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:20,188
You're the Good Samaritan.

1276
01:21:21,356 --> 01:21:22,816
Besides, I'm wearing these.

1277
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,190
Maybe you would like to
complete your ensemble.

1278
01:21:25,277 --> 01:21:27,737
No. There's something else
of yours that I want.

1279
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:29,451
Oh, really? What's that?

1280
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:30,871
Your ass.

1281
01:21:35,454 --> 01:21:37,584
Dun-dun-dah.

1282
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,542
Oh, shit.

1283
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:45,495
Well, shall we join the fracas?

1284
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:06,482
Step back, my dear.

1285
01:22:06,568 --> 01:22:08,688
I must warn you, I'm Roger Moore.

1286
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:10,029
Who?

1287
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:11,363
Roger Moore.

1288
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,453
We'll run in there.

1289
01:22:16,536 --> 01:22:18,576
Boom-boo-boom, pow. Pow. Pow.

1290
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,374
Knock 'em flat out.

1291
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:22,486
Then we go. We could
still win it, ok?

1292
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:23,487
We can do that.

1293
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:25,750
- We can do that. Yeah.
- We can do that.

1294
01:22:29,508 --> 01:22:32,088
You'll be sorry. Let me down.

1295
01:22:32,177 --> 01:22:34,677
Dun-dun-dah.

1296
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,059
Take that.

1297
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:50,534
You're so macho.

1298
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:52,152
Watch this.

1299
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:55,569
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

1300
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,291
- Need some help, Father?
- Nah.

1301
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:08,919
Wah. Give me somebody.

1302
01:23:09,006 --> 01:23:10,416
Waaargh.

1303
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:12,547
What, are you crazy, Greek?

1304
01:23:12,634 --> 01:23:15,764
How could you possibly change
odds in the middle of things?

1305
01:23:17,764 --> 01:23:21,144
Hold it. You wouldn't last five
minutes in the New York subway.

1306
01:23:23,228 --> 01:23:24,728
That's the way it's done.

1307
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:37,781
- Is that good to drink?
- I don't know. I never tried it.

1308
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:52,301
Hold it, hold it. You
wanna try this side?

1309
01:23:52,382 --> 01:23:53,762
Yeah.

1310
01:23:56,678 --> 01:23:58,258
Need some help?

1311
01:23:58,346 --> 01:24:00,846
- Get out of here.
- Right.

1312
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:03,272
Dun-dun-dah.

1313
01:24:04,603 --> 01:24:05,983
Fool.

1314
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:13,320
- Thanks, Shakey. Excuse me.
- Get this guy, Shakey.

1315
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:19,210
Excuse me, Father,
the road's open.

1316
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:20,211
Oh, thanks.

1317
01:24:21,244 --> 01:24:23,754
Fenderbaum, the road's open.

1318
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:28,539
Bye.

1319
01:24:36,718 --> 01:24:38,338
Let's go. Hit it.

1320
01:24:39,763 --> 01:24:41,853
(Speaking foreign language)

1321
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:58,737
Ah-so.

1322
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:37,442
Come on, come on. Faster, faster.

1323
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:38,819
- I'm trying.
- Faster.

1324
01:25:38,905 --> 01:25:41,058
Drive it like Captain Chaos would.

1325
01:25:41,059 --> 01:25:42,059
I'll try.

1326
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,712
What do you take off the mask for?

1327
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:45,407
I didn't. He took off the mask.

1328
01:25:57,215 --> 01:25:59,175
- We need him.
- I don't know where he is.

1329
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:02,089
Very interesting fellow. I'd
like to probe his case.

1330
01:26:02,179 --> 01:26:03,994
Don't want him
around, he's around.

1331
01:26:03,995 --> 01:26:05,759
When we want him, he's not around.

1332
01:26:05,849 --> 01:26:06,969
I'm gonna get a beer.

1333
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:09,308
Dun-dun-dah.

1334
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:44,363
It's only ten blocks
to the finish. I feel

1335
01:26:44,364 --> 01:26:47,258
very confident that we
will be triumphant.

1336
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:54,983
Aha-ha.

1337
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:04,623
What the hell was that?

1338
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:07,659
- A Lamborghini.
- Is it in the race?

1339
01:27:07,744 --> 01:27:08,744
Catch it.

1340
01:27:13,124 --> 01:27:15,504
- Will you go faster? Come on.
- I'm trying.

1341
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:18,641
I've seen every single one of your

1342
01:27:18,642 --> 01:27:20,705
movies at least three
or four times.

1343
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:22,009
Four times?

1344
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:25,842
- I think we got it going, baby.
- Yeah, we're looking good.

1345
01:27:25,929 --> 01:27:28,009
The Greek's gonna pay us money.

1346
01:27:28,098 --> 01:27:30,308
Gosh. Wait till I tell my friends

1347
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:34,062
I was sitting next
to George Hamilton.

1348
01:27:34,145 --> 01:27:36,435
George Hamilton?

1349
01:27:41,111 --> 01:27:42,531
- We got 'em.
- We got 'em.

1350
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:45,320
We're not losing it.

1351
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:49,289
Aargh.

1352
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:50,949
Look out.

1353
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:53,959
- Waah.
- Ok, it's a foot race.

1354
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,870
- I've got the card.
- No, give me that, Doc.

1355
01:27:55,959 --> 01:27:57,919
Come on. It's a foot race.

1356
01:27:58,003 --> 01:28:02,303
Have no fear, Chaos
is here. Dun-dun-dah.

1357
01:28:02,382 --> 01:28:04,302
Take it and win, Captain.

1358
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:07,223
Come on, Chaos, you can do it.

1359
01:28:08,471 --> 01:28:11,101
Anyone need medical attention?

1360
01:28:11,182 --> 01:28:14,942
Ah. Ah. Go. Go, Chaos.

1361
01:28:17,314 --> 01:28:18,404
We're gonna win.

1362
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:21,481
It's not a very sporting way to
win. What do you say, Father?

1363
01:28:21,568 --> 01:28:23,568
No, it's a shitty way to win.

1364
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:29,122
We're gonna win.

1365
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,490
Help. Help. Somebody save my baby.

1366
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,199
He's drowning.

1367
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:36,579
No, Chaos. No.

1368
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:41,462
No problem, fair lady. I will
save your baby. Have no Fear.

1369
01:28:48,845 --> 01:28:51,175
Oh, my baby, my baby.

1370
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:53,974
Thank you. You're
such a brave man.

1371
01:28:54,059 --> 01:28:58,149
You don't know what this means
to me. Oh, my baby, I love you.

1372
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:02,612
JJ, I saved that woman's dog.

1373
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:06,706
Victor, we could
have won that race.

1374
01:29:06,707 --> 01:29:08,986
You understand? We
could have won it.

1375
01:29:09,074 --> 01:29:12,494
You understand that? You had to
go and pull that stupid stunt.

1376
01:29:12,577 --> 01:29:14,617
He's right, Victor.

1377
01:29:14,704 --> 01:29:16,504
We are sick of Captain Chaos.

1378
01:29:16,581 --> 01:29:19,291
We are so sick of Captain
Chaos that we could throw up.

1379
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:21,085
So, you know what, Victor? There's

1380
01:29:21,086 --> 01:29:22,996
not gonna be any
more Captain Chaos.

1381
01:29:23,088 --> 01:29:24,838
No more.

1382
01:29:24,923 --> 01:29:30,553
You see what I'm telling you? No
more. No more Captain Chaos ever.

1383
01:29:30,637 --> 01:29:33,467
Now, what do you think of that?

1384
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:39,189
I don't care... because...

1385
01:29:40,438 --> 01:29:44,818
I've always wanted to
be... Captain USA.

1386
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:46,491
Dun-dun-dah.

1387
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:52,741
It's a dirty job, but
somebody's got to do it.

1388
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:08,092
- Who won the race?
- What do you get for last?

1389
01:30:11,386 --> 01:30:13,596
Well... Well...

1390
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,720
How do you all feel, now that you
have raped the American highways?

1391
01:30:17,809 --> 01:30:19,389
- Beautiful. Wonderful.
- Great.

1392
01:30:19,477 --> 01:30:21,950
Old chap, I suggest
you get a grip on

1393
01:30:21,951 --> 01:30:24,357
yourself or better,
on one of these.

1394
01:30:24,441 --> 01:30:25,771
I'll take anything.

1395
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:29,399
And feel free to use the
lighter in my car, Mr...

1396
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:30,817
Foyt.

1397
01:30:30,905 --> 01:30:32,985
Foyt.

1398
01:30:33,074 --> 01:30:35,874
Wait till he touches that lighter.

1399
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:44,585
Ain't nothing happening.

1400
01:30:46,212 --> 01:30:48,462
That's funny. Excuse me.

1401
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:56,051
Mr. Foyt, how did you light that?

1402
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:59,983
Well, with the lighter, of course.

1403
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:02,601
That's odd.

1404
01:31:04,189 --> 01:31:06,229
Oy vey.

1405
01:31:12,989 --> 01:31:16,329
If I'm not filming next
year, we'll do this again.

1406
01:31:20,455 --> 01:31:23,165
Oh, JJ, didn't we do good?

1407
01:31:23,249 --> 01:31:25,419
Wah. Waha-ha-ha.

1408
01:31:56,866 --> 01:31:58,526
- Stop it.
- Ready?

1409
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:05,461
- Will you stop it?
- Ok. Ok.

1410
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,671
What's wrong with you?

1411
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:10,423
Wait a minute. I got something.

1412
01:32:10,505 --> 01:32:12,835
- No, this will help you.
- No, don't hit me.

1413
01:32:12,924 --> 01:32:17,224
No. I'm not gonna hit
you. Listen to me.

1414
01:32:17,303 --> 01:32:19,393
I swear to God. I'm
not gonna hit you.

1415
01:32:19,472 --> 01:32:21,012
Watch. Watch.

1416
01:32:21,099 --> 01:32:22,719
Ah.

1417
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:27,649
- Ok.
- Ok. I'm ready now. Here we go.

1418
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:36,069
Look at that shit.

1419
01:32:38,324 --> 01:32:40,374
I'm ready. I swear
to God, I'm ready.

1420
01:32:40,952 --> 01:32:42,952
We're off.

1421
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:50,125
Where's he gonna sit?

1422
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,170
Where's he gonna sit?

1423
01:32:54,966 --> 01:32:57,676
I warned you not to
interfere in my affairs.

1424
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,970
Steven, put away...
Seymour. Excuse me.

1425
01:33:01,055 --> 01:33:03,595
That's all right. I'll
answer to anything.

1426
01:33:03,683 --> 01:33:07,103
You see, even in the deepest
family relations...

1427
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:12,271
my business is not worth a...

1428
01:33:13,276 --> 01:33:14,686
Thank you, Victor.

1429
01:33:14,777 --> 01:33:16,277
Mark.

1430
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:18,532
As you probably know, we're...

1431
01:33:18,615 --> 01:33:20,065
We're the favourites to...

1432
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:23,738
be the winning racers tomorrow
in the Cannonball race,

1433
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:25,498
which is gonna be poured...

1434
01:33:27,624 --> 01:33:30,084
- Good evening, ladies.
- Evening.

1435
01:33:30,168 --> 01:33:32,628
My name is JJ McClure.
And this is my...

1436
01:33:35,757 --> 01:33:39,042
Next year we're going
for the nu-nu-nu...

1437
01:33:39,043 --> 01:33:40,137
Yes? Ooh.

1438
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:48,229
Perfect. Perfect.

1439
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:50,730
Hey.

1440
01:33:50,813 --> 01:33:52,273
- Better than...
- Cut.

1441
01:33:52,357 --> 01:33:54,857
We have to get this woman,

1442
01:33:54,942 --> 01:33:56,402
the senator's wife,

1443
01:33:56,486 --> 01:33:58,276
to Philadelphia by...

1444
01:33:58,363 --> 01:34:00,323
Make that California, will you?

1445
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:04,488
We're very close.

1446
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,170
Don't hit me.

1447
01:34:12,835 --> 01:34:14,995
Because if I had enough time...

1448
01:34:15,088 --> 01:34:19,088
I would take those rosary bleeds
and stuff 'em up your nose.

1449
01:34:19,175 --> 01:34:21,675
- These bleeds?
- Those bleeds, yeah.

1450
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:23,681
You're gonna take these...
and shove 'em up...

1451
01:34:23,763 --> 01:34:26,183
I'll take these bleeds here...

1452
01:34:26,265 --> 01:34:27,265
Mark.

1453
01:34:27,308 --> 01:34:29,268
I don't care...

1454
01:34:33,064 --> 01:34:35,404
- I don't care...
- Stop laughing.

1455
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:37,941
I don't care, because...

1456
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,067
You're gonna get a slap.

1457
01:34:41,155 --> 01:34:44,775
I always wanted to
be Captain America.

1458
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,370
It's a living.

1459
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:54,126
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1460
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:58,510
He laughed... He laughed...
He laughed first.

1461
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:00,589
Mr. Martin laughed first.

1462
01:35:03,678 --> 01:35:05,638
Why were you laughing?

1463
01:35:05,722 --> 01:35:08,182
He laughed and you hit me.

1464
01:35:08,933 --> 01:35:10,483
Cut it.
