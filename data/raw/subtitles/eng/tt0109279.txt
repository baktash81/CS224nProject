1
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,305
<i>The story of my life
is the story of the people in it.</i>

2
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:19,434
<i>I haven't always been as lucky
as I am now...</i>

3
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:22,020
<i>...in this delicious place of water...</i>

4
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:24,731
<i>...and grass and sunlight.</i>

5
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:28,735
<i>Mine is a story of trust and betrayal...</i>

6
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:31,404
<i>...and learning to trust again.</i>

7
00:02:32,197 --> 00:02:34,240
<i>I remember everything.</i>

8
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,834
I'm here, Duchess.

9
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:47,754
I'll help you.

10
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,766
Come on, old lass.

11
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:07,274
Come on, push.

12
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:08,942
Push!

13
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:28,128
<i>It was cold and too bright
and strange out in the air.</i>

14
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:31,464
<i>But then my mother kissed me.</i>

15
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,385
<i>I wanted to be nearer to her.</i>

16
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:33,109
Over here, little one. It's all right.

17
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:47,874
<i>In the beginning, I stayed as close
to my mother as I possibly could.</i>

18
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,793
<i>As the weeks went by,
I still stayed right beside her...</i>

19
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:35,630
<i>...but I began to have my own ideas
of what we should do.</i>

20
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,259
<i>So much of the time,
she would just stand there.</i>

21
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,802
<i>Hurry up!</i>

22
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,387
<i>Let's go!</i>

23
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,170
Come on, come on.

24
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,757
<i>I don't like this.</i>

25
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,425
<i>I do not like this!</i>

26
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:03,969
Don't fight me now.

27
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,887
<i>Everything's changing.</i>

28
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,555
<i>Even I'm changing.</i>

29
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,057
Come on.

30
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:14,604
<i>A black coat's taking over my baby fur.
It's all happening too fast.</i>

31
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,789
<i>When I turned 3...</i>

32
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:37,043
<i>...my master sent me to spend the year
with a gang of other colts.</i>

33
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,365
<i>Now it was time.</i>

34
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,576
<i>Training.</i>

35
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,329
<i>The bit was the first thing.</i>

36
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:17,417
<i>Terrible bars of cold, hard steel
between your teeth and over your tongue.</i>

37
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:23,089
<i>If you've never had one in your mouth,
you can't imagine what a shock it is.</i>

38
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:36,186
<i>But thank heaven for oats!</i>

39
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:40,190
<i>When you're eating them,
you can forget the bit's nasty coldness...</i>

40
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,275
<i>...the bitter, metallic taste.</i>

41
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,152
<i>Delicious oats.</i>

42
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,321
<i>Sweet oats.</i>

43
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,448
<i>Lovely, crunchy oats.</i>

44
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,241
<i>Beautiful oats.</i>

45
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,244
<i>Splendid oats... ow!</i>

46
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:58,124
Here. It's just a saddle.

47
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,835
<i>It's choking me!</i>

48
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,838
You can still move. Promise.

49
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:06,132
<i>Nobody could walk with this.</i>

50
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,053
<i>Come back here with those oats.</i>

51
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:33,952
<i>At first, the iron shoes made
my feet feel stiff and heavy.</i>

52
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:51,344
<i>I said, "No!" But he said, "Go!"</i>

53
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,769
Come on.

54
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,647
<i>Once I discovered that he and I...</i>

55
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,191
<i>...that the two of us could become one...</i>

56
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:09,904
<i>...this business turned out to be
perfectly glorious!</i>

57
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,128
<i>It was now time for me
to go to a new home.</i>

58
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,589
<i>My mother was proud of me...</i>

59
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,341
<i>...and encouraged me.</i>

60
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:15,262
<i>She knew my master would only
let me go to good people.</i>

61
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,098
<i>But I would miss her.</i>

62
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:33,029
<i>Before long, a man came
to take me to Birtwick Park...</i>

63
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,490
<i>...to live with Squire Gordon's family.</i>

64
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:37,409
Just a moment! Molly!

65
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:40,620
- Come here with that pony.
- Run, Merry. Faster!

66
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,336
Please stay inside.
You're still much too weak.

67
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:51,172
I won't break. I want to see him.

68
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:54,801
It's a horse. Nothing more, nothing less,
I promise.

69
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,512
A beautiful horse!

70
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,473
Beauty is as beauty does.
How was he, John?

71
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,891
Perfect, sir.

72
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:05,437
They were shooting rabbits near Highwood
and the guns went off.

73
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,065
He pulled at such, and looked,
but he didn't step off the path.

74
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,110
- Did you, young fella?
- What shall we call him?

75
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:15,405
We'll decide over tea.
You must get out of this air.

76
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:19,367
He's as black as ebony.

77
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:21,703
Ebony.

78
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:23,663
Ebony.

79
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,042
Sounds like "bones. "

80
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,669
Settle him in the stables.

81
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,004
Pleasure, sir.

82
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:37,010
We'll call him Blackbird,
after your uncle's old horse.

83
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:41,014
But Blackbird was ugly
and mean-tempered.

84
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:45,101
- Wait. You've already named him.
- Pardon?

85
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,104
- "Beauty is as beauty does. "
- That's not a name.

86
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,857
Yes, it is. Beauty.

87
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,026
Black Beauty.

88
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,446
<i>A new name...</i>

89
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,156
<i>...a new home...</i>

90
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,409
<i>...and a stable full of new horses to meet.</i>

91
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,194
She'll be all right.

92
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,865
<i>She was ill-tempered.</i>

93
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:42,951
<i>She was mean-spirited.</i>

94
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,786
<i>She was vicious.</i>

95
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:57,674
<i>She was the most beautiful creature
I'd ever seen.</i>

96
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:06,683
I hate Alfred.

97
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,435
Me too.

98
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:11,980
Let me down!

99
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,317
Charge!

100
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:20,572
Lazy pony!

101
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,782
Move!

102
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,367
Stop it!

103
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,975
Move along!

104
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,279
Merrylegs!

105
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,073
- Quick, Merrylegs!
- Run!

106
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:08,203
Keep running, Merrylegs!

107
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,437
<i>Mine too.</i>

108
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,273
<i>Open mine too!</i>

109
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,618
<i>Merrylegs.</i>

110
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,746
<i>What a perfect name for the little fellow.</i>

111
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,126
Leave him alone!

112
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:02,590
Whoa there, Joe!

113
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:10,098
Better let young Joe catch him,
Master Alfred.

114
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:11,891
He needs the practice.

115
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,893
Go on now. Round them up.

116
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,983
Thank you for offering to help.

117
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,361
I expect it's time for your tea now, isn't it?

118
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,405
Yes, I expect it is.

119
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:29,367
Tea time, girls.
Jessica, Molly, come along!

120
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,831
It's a good thing John came along
when he did.

121
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:36,708
It certainly is.

122
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,628
<i>Joe had a good heart...</i>

123
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,963
<i>...but really not a clue.</i>

124
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,801
Stand still, will you?

125
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,429
Stop running.

126
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,688
Come on, everybody!

127
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,316
<i>What a wonderful place.</i>

128
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:24,798
<i>I flew down to her.</i>

129
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:27,842
<i>I knew it would be magic between us.</i>

130
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,804
<i>Hey! Wait a second.</i>

131
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,014
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

132
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,143
<i>Please!</i>

133
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:59,749
Easy, Ginger, easy.

134
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,169
- What's the matter with her?
- They must've battered her.

135
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:07,674
We treat her well and give her her head,
she'll come round, surely enough.

136
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,801
Back him on in.

137
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,221
Kind treatment makes good horses, Joe.

138
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,015
Bad treatment ruins them.

139
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,227
Straighten him out.

140
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,148
I can't.

141
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:24,608
Yes, you can.

142
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,611
<i>Was I ever going to win her affection?</i>

143
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,371
<i>When we came to the hill...</i>

144
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:41,541
<i>...instead of slowing down
and leaving me to do the work...</i>

145
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:46,046
<i>...she threw her weight into the collar
and pulled away, straight up.</i>

146
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,757
<i>Our paces matched perfectly.</i>

147
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,431
<i>I was sure that afterwards,
things would be different between us.</i>

148
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:58,475
<i>They were.</i>

149
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,310
<i>They were worse.</i>

150
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,812
<i>Now she ignored me completely.</i>

151
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,105
<i>I bounded.</i>

152
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:06,149
<i>I leaped to the sky!</i>

153
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,611
<i>I tried everything to get her attention.</i>

154
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,694
<i>Even though I was new...</i>

155
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:54,739
<i>...the squire and John trusted me to
get them safely back from town...</i>

156
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,784
<i>...no matter how terrible the storm.</i>

157
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,704
<i>The wild branches tried to grab me.</i>

158
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:04,624
<i>The rain stung my eyes
like a thousand bees!</i>

159
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:24,936
Keep moving, Beauty!

160
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:37,032
<i>The bridge was flooded.</i>

161
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,075
<i>But it looked safe.</i>

162
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:52,547
<i>As I reached the middle,
I knew at once that something was wrong.</i>

163
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:54,174
Beauty, forward!

164
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:55,800
Go forward!

165
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:07,020
<i>Everything inside me screamed
not to go any further.</i>

166
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:08,521
Go forward!

167
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:12,651
<i>I wanted to obey him but he was wrong.</i>

168
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,826
I know, chum. I know.

169
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,418
<i>How can I make you understand?</i>

170
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,921
<i>We can't go near there!</i>

171
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,631
Come on, Beauty.

172
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,758
For me.

173
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,552
<i>I stood fast.</i>

174
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,055
<i>I tried to tell him.</i>

175
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,312
That's enough!

176
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:15,088
<i>I didn't know how long
I could hold on to him.</i>

177
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:17,424
<i>I had to hold on!</i>

178
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,809
God bless you, Beauty.

179
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:22,697
What happened?

180
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:24,991
I'll be all right, Mistress.

181
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,995
I just need to look after the horse.

182
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:31,456
You will not. You come inside at once.

183
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,249
Beauty needs looking after.

184
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,418
I'll look after him, Uncle John.

185
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,214
All right. Do what I've shown you, Joe.

186
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:41,841
<i>Not Joe.</i>

187
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,594
<i>He doesn't know what to do.</i>

188
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:50,016
<i>The drying sweat and rain sent a chill
down to my bones.</i>

189
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,185
You don't need that rug.

190
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,271
You're boiling hot.

191
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:56,606
<i>I wanted my rug.</i>

192
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:59,025
<i>I wanted a heap of rugs.</i>

193
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:18,044
<i>The icy water hit my stomach
like a kick in the guts.</i>

194
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:20,797
<i>But I was so thirsty.</i>

195
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,431
<i>By the next morning...</i>

196
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,224
<i>...I was sick.</i>

197
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,897
<i>Ginger stayed up all night with me.</i>

198
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:42,068
<i>Feeling sorry for me softened her.</i>

199
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:47,157
Oh, dear Lord!

200
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,584
<i>It hurts.</i>

201
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,503
There's no rug put on.

202
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:08,762
Stupid, stupid boy.

203
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:13,016
I expect the water was cold as well.

204
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:16,937
Run to the house
and bring another blanket.

205
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:19,022
Now!

206
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:36,706
Come on.

207
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,584
You must drink it, come on.

208
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,520
My poor Beauty.

209
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,230
My good horse.

210
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:20,292
Let's hope it does him some good.

211
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:25,171
You go on to bed now, John.

212
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,675
I'll stay with him tonight.

213
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,595
We've done the best we can.

214
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,515
He may need some help.

215
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,387
<i>Every little noise was torture.</i>

216
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,493
Alfred, stop it!

217
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:40,997
Told you!

218
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,628
Children, that's enough!

219
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,589
They're fine, dear.

220
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:03,770
Please get well.

221
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,278
Uncle John!

222
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:56,615
Uncle John! Come and see Black Beauty!

223
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,916
<i>I was put into a paddock to recuperate.</i>

224
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,919
<i>Joe came to visit me every day.</i>

225
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,812
Catch me if you can!

226
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:40,951
What's wrong?

227
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:42,869
Can't you get up here?

228
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:46,748
All right, I'm coming.

229
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:53,546
What are you doing?

230
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,485
No! Not the sheets!

231
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,195
Sorry!

232
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,671
<i>My mistress became so ill...</i>

233
00:31:57,754 --> 00:31:59,756
<i>...we had to take her to a doctor...</i>

234
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,968
<i>...a specialist who lived far away.</i>

235
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:11,768
You won't smoke that pipe
in these stables.

236
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:15,063
Yeah, yeah. Keep your shirt on, skinny.

237
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,193
Evening.

238
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,820
Evening.

239
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,461
That idiot left a lamp up here.

240
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:44,384
Little know-it-all ought
to mind his own business.

241
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:54,311
You complain about my pipe,
but you leave a lamp near the hay.

242
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:58,189
For you to see by.
Bring it down here, will you?

243
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,650
Lucky for you I came up here.

244
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,116
<i>What? What's that?</i>

245
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:11,286
Beauty! It's only for tonight.

246
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:17,083
What are you afraid of? You'll be all right.

247
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,377
I'll be back for the horse in the morning.

248
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,004
I'm off too.

249
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,422
Easy.

250
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:25,675
Eat your hay.

251
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:57,832
<i>The sounds and smells were so strange.</i>

252
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,834
<i>I didn't know what they were.</i>

253
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,964
<i>If you've never heard or smelled
something, how can you understand it?</i>

254
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:07,068
Whoa, Beauty. I'm here.

255
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,241
<i>I can't leave Ginger!</i>

256
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:16,202
I won't let it hurt you!

257
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:19,956
Don't look at it!

258
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:28,256
<i>I couldn't see anything.</i>

259
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,383
<i>I had to follow him!</i>

260
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,040
<i>Joe saved us.</i>

261
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:48,753
<i>The other horses were rescued too,
but no one could help our mistress.</i>

262
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,131
<i>Her illness was so advanced...</i>

263
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:54,634
<i>...that the doctor told her to move
to a warmer place.</i>

264
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:57,762
<i>The family would have to leave England...</i>

265
00:36:58,346 --> 00:36:59,806
<i>...and us.</i>

266
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:02,601
Right this way. Leaving in five minutes.

267
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,985
Goodbye, John. Bless you.

268
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,405
Please God, we may see you
back again soon.

269
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:19,326
Portsmouth train leaving
from platform one.

270
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,624
We love you, Merrylegs.

271
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,000
You're the best.

272
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,002
We'll never forget you.

273
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:32,631
Time to go, sisters.

274
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,934
I want to thank you, John,
for your faithful service to my family.

275
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:47,103
We shall never forget you, sir.

276
00:37:50,523 --> 00:37:52,025
Goodbye, my Beauty.

277
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:16,591
<i>Nevermore were we to see our family.</i>

278
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:18,593
<i>Nevermore.</i>

279
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:25,684
<i>It was our last time together
in the big pasture...</i>

280
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,896
<i>...but it was something nobody could
ever take away from us.</i>

281
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:02,887
<i>They were dancing!</i>

282
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:46,806
<i>The vicar came to take Merrylegs away.</i>

283
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,518
<i>He'd promised the squire
he would never sell him.</i>

284
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:55,815
<i>I hated saying goodbye
to that plucky little pony.</i>

285
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:18,672
<i>In no time, Ginger and Joe and I...</i>

286
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,677
<i>...also found ourselves miles away
from everything dear and familiar.</i>

287
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,373
Horses to the back!
What do you think you're doing?

288
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,101
I swear to you...

289
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,395
...someday, somehow...

290
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:18,315
...I'll be with you again.

291
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:23,111
<i>Take me with you now.</i>

292
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,932
<i>Don't go.</i>

293
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:06,446
<i>But he was gone.</i>

294
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,641
Lady Wexmire, Lord Wexmire...

295
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:36,351
...Lord George.

296
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,645
<i>They stared.</i>

297
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:41,481
<i>Staring at us with their critical eyes.</i>

298
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:43,984
<i>To them, we were no more alive...</i>

299
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:47,070
<i>...than the bits of harness on our backs.</i>

300
00:42:51,283 --> 00:42:54,202
Look at the long legs
on the chestnut mare.

301
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:58,039
What a hunter she'd make.
She'd fly over the jumps.

302
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:01,668
You must put these horses' heads higher.

303
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:04,838
They're not accustomed
to the bearing rein.

304
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:08,341
Their groom said they'd never used
the rein on either one.

305
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,760
- Didn't he, York?
- He did, my lord.

306
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,680
Be safer to bring them up by degrees.

307
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,223
Pish-posh!

308
00:43:15,432 --> 00:43:17,601
These animals are not fit to be seen.

309
00:43:17,684 --> 00:43:21,354
One notch tighter won't kill them, will it?
York?

310
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:25,734
As you wish, my lady.

311
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:30,864
Reuben, attend to the mare.

312
00:43:37,954 --> 00:43:41,249
<i>When a bearing rein is tightened,
it pulls back your head...</i>

313
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:44,628
<i>...so that you have to carry it
uncomfortably high.</i>

314
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:47,547
<i>People think it makes a horse look fancy.</i>

315
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:49,966
<i>But it made Ginger angry.</i>

316
00:43:57,474 --> 00:44:00,894
<i>This was a very grand place we'd come to.</i>

317
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:04,064
<i>Three or four times the size
of Birtwick Park...</i>

318
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:06,399
<i>...but not at all pleasant...</i>

319
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,069
<i>...if a horse may have an opinion.</i>

320
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,908
<i>Ordinarily, we would have
put our heads down and forward...</i>

321
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:16,409
<i>...but not now.</i>

322
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:19,037
<i>Now we had to pull with our heads up.</i>

323
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:21,957
<i>Pain shot through our backs and legs.</i>

324
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:23,249
<i>For what?</i>

325
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,793
<i>For fashion.</i>

326
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:32,926
Rein them tighter, York.

327
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:35,845
As you wish, my lady.

328
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:39,099
Reuben, shorten the bearing rein
on the mare.

329
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,060
<i>A bearing rein is well named.</i>

330
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:44,312
<i>For it is unbearable.</i>

331
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:46,106
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

332
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:49,442
<i>And nonsense can drive a horse mad.</i>

333
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:53,738
Rein them tighter, York!

334
00:44:53,947 --> 00:44:56,283
As you wish, my lady.

335
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:03,206
<i>I didn't know how much longer
Ginger could stand it.</i>

336
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,007
For pity's sake.

337
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,677
Are you never going to get their heads up?
Raise them at once!

338
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:17,095
As you wish, my lady.

339
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:18,638
Quickly!

340
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,475
<i>And then it happened.</i>

341
00:45:26,813 --> 00:45:28,648
You incompetent fool!

342
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:30,066
Whoa, there!

343
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:40,577
Keep a hold of her!

344
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:47,083
Hang on!

345
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:52,213
I can't be late for the Duchess!

346
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:57,385
Get him! Quick!

347
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:04,100
Give it here. Now, get that shaft off.
Go on! Get it!

348
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,735
The bloody rein's choking her.

349
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:15,195
There, lassie.

350
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:38,218
You idiot!

351
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,720
These horses have more brains than you!

352
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,068
Cover the chestnut with a blanket.

353
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:58,238
You fetch hot water and lotion
for the black one.

354
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:03,326
Whoa, there.

355
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:23,305
Stay!

356
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,195
Take care of the black one too.

357
00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:41,531
As you wish, Mr. York.

358
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,295
<i>My leg hurt.</i>

359
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:57,464
<i>The wound was deep.</i>

360
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:01,468
Well, it's her own silly fault
if she misses her tea party...

361
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:03,053
...not yours.

362
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:06,139
No, nor mine neither.

363
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:10,977
It's enough to drive anybody back to drink.

364
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:16,524
<i>They put wicked wooden contraptions
around our necks...</i>

365
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:20,570
<i>...so we couldn't even turn our heads
to lick our wounds.</i>

366
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:22,614
<i>After that...</i>

367
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:25,742
<i>...my lady never called for Ginger again.</i>

368
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,994
<i>I, on the other hand...</i>

369
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:31,706
<i>...continued to be subject
to her every whim.</i>

370
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:01,194
Look, man, look!

371
00:49:22,382 --> 00:49:24,467
Got a job for us then, Reuben?

372
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,887
Yes. It's stood out in all weathers.

373
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:30,390
Between that and the roads up there.

374
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,434
Plenty of rot here.

375
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:34,394
Plenty of rot everywhere.

376
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:36,688
What do they want to do?

377
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:39,232
Me lady craves a new coat of paint.

378
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:44,070
I believe your lady could use
a good deal more than a new coat of paint.

379
00:49:44,237 --> 00:49:45,572
Amen.

380
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,746
Keep the horse for me, will you?

381
00:49:52,912 --> 00:49:54,748
Best leave it saddled.

382
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:56,958
I daren't be late.

383
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,169
Where are you going then?

384
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:00,337
I'll be back later.

385
00:50:21,775 --> 00:50:23,151
Listen.

386
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:26,947
There's a loose shoe.

387
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:32,160
Where are you going?

388
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:35,622
You mustn't ride him, Mr. Smith.

389
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:41,586
Now stand up, will you?

390
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:43,046
He's standing.

391
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:44,881
Come on, there. Come on.

392
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:06,486
Now stand up.

393
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,800
Where's your head?

394
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,894
Get out of the way!

395
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,187
Come on.

396
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:03,877
<i>He pushed me...</i>

397
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,128
<i>...and pushed me...</i>

398
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:06,630
<i>...and pushed me!</i>

399
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:08,548
<i>What was the matter with him?</i>

400
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:10,342
<i>I was losing my shoe...</i>

401
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,969
<i>...but he had lost his mind!</i>

402
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:00,225
<i>My body couldn't escape...</i>

403
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,769
<i>...but my thoughts could.</i>

404
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:07,023
<i>They took me away from that awful place.</i>

405
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:09,317
<i>Far away.</i>

406
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:48,315
<i>But there was Reuben...</i>

407
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:50,734
<i>...still lying where he'd fallen.</i>

408
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:52,736
<i>I stayed with him.</i>

409
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:57,240
<i>My mother had taught me to be loyal,
no matter what.</i>

410
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:00,452
Good Lord, what's happened here?

411
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:06,875
Roll him over.

412
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,504
See if we can get him to his feet.

413
00:54:14,299 --> 00:54:15,634
I'll carry him.

414
00:54:27,687 --> 00:54:30,148
<i>Every step was agony.</i>

415
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:33,276
<i>I didn't know if my knees would ever heal.</i>

416
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:44,371
<i>We don't get to choose the people
in our lives.</i>

417
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:46,498
<i>For us, it's all chance.</i>

418
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,341
Come on.

419
00:54:58,301 --> 00:55:00,220
Come on, get on. Get on!

420
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:40,468
He won!

421
00:55:44,598 --> 00:55:45,932
Lovely ride, son.

422
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:47,601
Thank you, Mama.

423
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:51,771
Good God, George.
What have you done to the horse?

424
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:53,732
Didn't you bother to train her?

425
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,483
I won the race.

426
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:59,738
You've broken her.

427
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,990
She can't breathe properly.

428
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:06,494
<i>Ginger loved jumping.
Her heart leapt at every fence.</i>

429
00:56:06,703 --> 00:56:09,205
<i>But they raced her before she was fit...</i>

430
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,249
<i>...and it shattered her.</i>

431
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,835
They used to be such beautiful animals.

432
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:16,921
Now just look at them. Ruined.

433
00:56:17,255 --> 00:56:20,550
A 12-month run should bring back
the mare's wind, my lord.

434
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:23,303
Well, the black one will have to be sold.

435
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:26,598
I won't have knees like that in my stables.

436
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:28,141
<i>Sold?</i>

437
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:31,269
<i>Every horse knows that terrifying word.</i>

438
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:43,156
<i>When they came to take me away,
it was so sudden...</i>

439
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,868
<i>...that Ginger and I didn't even
get to say goodbye.</i>

440
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:06,429
<i>The terrible man who bought me
kept horses for rent.</i>

441
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,766
Suck it in!

442
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:13,144
<i>I was rented out to anyone who wanted
to hire me.</i>

443
00:57:32,163 --> 00:57:35,333
<i>I was glad my friends couldn't see me now.</i>

444
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:39,504
<i>They wouldn't even have known me.</i>

445
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:48,388
<i>We hated that man.</i>

446
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,604
You missed me, you stupid beasts.

447
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:36,436
This horse is 20 if it's a day.

448
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:40,065
<i>This lively place lifted my spirits.</i>

449
00:58:51,826 --> 00:58:54,120
I'll meet you after the fair, Joe.

450
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:55,664
<i>Wait!</i>

451
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:57,499
<i>I know who that is.</i>

452
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:59,334
<i>It's Joe!</i>

453
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:01,920
<i>Older, taller...</i>

454
00:59:02,712 --> 00:59:04,339
<i>...but it's him!</i>

455
00:59:06,591 --> 00:59:07,926
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

456
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:16,184
<i>- What happened to his knees?
- Stop!</i>

457
00:59:16,268 --> 00:59:18,770
- He took a spill in the stalls.
- A spill?

458
00:59:18,895 --> 00:59:21,690
<i>What are you doing? Where's Joe?</i>

459
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:24,025
<i>There he is.</i>

460
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,362
<i>Let me go!</i>

461
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:31,199
Lively one, isn't he?

462
01:00:00,604 --> 01:00:02,564
<i>Joe, don't leave!</i>

463
01:00:03,148 --> 01:00:04,441
<i>I'm here!</i>

464
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:25,378
Horses for sale!

465
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,617
Twenty-five guineas, he's yours.

466
01:00:56,284 --> 01:00:57,327
Fifteen.

467
01:00:57,452 --> 01:00:58,787
- Eighteen.
- Sixteen.

468
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,748
- Eighteen!
- Seventeen, not a penny more.

469
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:04,834
Done!

470
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:24,437
<i>How are you supposed to get through?</i>

471
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:26,690
<i>There were too many people.</i>

472
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:28,858
<i>There was too much noise.</i>

473
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:30,944
<i>The smell was awful.</i>

474
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:33,613
Coming through. There's a lad.

475
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,200
<i>Where was the grass?</i>

476
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:39,911
<i>Where were the trees?</i>

477
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:41,288
Excuse me.

478
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:58,722
<i>It was cramped...</i>

479
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,140
<i>...and damp...</i>

480
01:02:00,307 --> 01:02:03,435
<i>...and dank and dark and dreary.</i>

481
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:06,646
Jerry, what's wrong with him?

482
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,106
He's frightened.

483
01:02:09,983 --> 01:02:10,900
Step up.

484
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,320
Let me go. I want to go and pet him.

485
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:15,989
Give me a brush, Dolly. Don't worry.

486
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:21,077
Harry, put some straw in that stall.

487
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:29,044
Dolly, no!

488
01:02:29,252 --> 01:02:30,670
It's all right.

489
01:02:30,837 --> 01:02:33,340
Come on. Let's do it quietly.

490
01:02:33,673 --> 01:02:35,175
Give him a chance.

491
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:37,344
Up we go. There we are.

492
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:39,471
Thank you.

493
01:02:41,306 --> 01:02:44,017
It's like baby fur here.

494
01:02:44,976 --> 01:02:47,103
He's so soft.

495
01:02:47,312 --> 01:02:48,688
Yeah, he is.

496
01:02:49,189 --> 01:02:51,107
Come on, Pol, give us a hand.

497
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:53,777
How's it going with that straw?

498
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,945
All ready.

499
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:57,197
Go and get yourself a brush, then.

500
01:03:00,158 --> 01:03:01,284
There.

501
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,161
He's not so frightened now.

502
01:03:03,244 --> 01:03:05,205
And when he has to pull the cab?

503
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:07,082
Have faith.

504
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,335
<i>I listened quietly.</i>

505
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:12,545
What should we call him?

506
01:03:13,797 --> 01:03:15,924
Jack. After the old one.

507
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:18,385
He's far blacker than Jack.

508
01:03:18,677 --> 01:03:21,429
When's he's cleaned,
his color comes up lovely.

509
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:25,725
- Seeing something in him now, are you?
- I didn't say that.

510
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:27,936
All right.

511
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:33,817
We'll call you Black, because you are,
and Jack, after the old one.

512
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:37,404
And altogether, Black Jack,
because the odds are stacked...

513
01:03:38,029 --> 01:03:39,781
...against us both.

514
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:43,285
Black Jack.

515
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,330
What you got?

516
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,750
Black Jack wants to be pretty.

517
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:52,585
Good idea.

518
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:01,595
<i>All at once, I had hope.</i>

519
01:04:01,928 --> 01:04:04,764
<i>It's good people that make good places.</i>

520
01:04:05,432 --> 01:04:08,518
<i>Still, I wondered
what tomorrow would bring.</i>

521
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:31,499
Walk on. Come on. That's it.

522
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,168
Walk on.

523
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:37,464
- Babaloo's Food Emporium.
- Rat problem solved.

524
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:42,218
Vermin exterminated!

525
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:45,889
Easy, boy.

526
01:04:53,605 --> 01:04:56,024
Hello, Jerry! Have you got a good one?

527
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,984
Great one!

528
01:04:58,151 --> 01:04:59,527
He's too black!

529
01:04:59,736 --> 01:05:01,363
Be good for a funeral!

530
01:05:11,247 --> 01:05:13,541
Good lad. Come around.

531
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:24,678
Braids on his mane and tail?

532
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:28,181
What? Are you going on a parade
this afternoon, Jerry?

533
01:05:28,348 --> 01:05:30,517
He wanted to be pretty for his first day.

534
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,271
"Pretty for his first day?"
Did you hear that, lads?

535
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:37,983
Well, he's a regular dandy.
A bit like meself.

536
01:05:42,153 --> 01:05:43,697
Why shouldn't you be?

537
01:05:46,491 --> 01:05:47,826
Don't worry.

538
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:51,037
No worry, old Black, old Jack, old boy.

539
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,164
It's all right.

540
01:05:58,003 --> 01:05:59,713
<i>Jerry's hands.</i>

541
01:05:59,879 --> 01:06:01,798
<i>The quiet of them...</i>

542
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:04,092
<i>...gave me confidence.</i>

543
01:06:10,056 --> 01:06:12,809
<i>We spent our days
at one cab stand or another...</i>

544
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:15,020
<i>...collecting passengers.</i>

545
01:06:17,022 --> 01:06:18,732
<i>It was a hard life.</i>

546
01:06:18,898 --> 01:06:21,568
<i>The streets are hard on a horse's feet.</i>

547
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:24,029
<i>The cab is hard on a horse's back.</i>

548
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:25,572
<i>But I was lucky.</i>

549
01:06:25,864 --> 01:06:28,533
<i>I had Jerry. We were in it together.</i>

550
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:35,957
- Morning.
- Morning, Dinah.

551
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:37,417
Cabby!

552
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:39,919
There you go, Jerry.

553
01:06:40,587 --> 01:06:41,713
Cabby!

554
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:46,468
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, I'm all right.

555
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,554
Let's get these up quickly.
You'll get run over.

556
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:50,805
Look sharp!

557
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:54,184
Put on the steam and get us to Victoria
by 10:00.

558
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,686
We'll take you, but at the regular pace.

559
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,313
It'll mean a shilling extra.

560
01:06:58,396 --> 01:06:59,940
At the regular pace.

561
01:07:00,106 --> 01:07:02,692
I'm your man. I'll get you there in time.

562
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:07,113
It's against his conscience to work
his horse into a sweat, but not mine.

563
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:08,323
Make way.

564
01:07:08,406 --> 01:07:09,783
Coming through!

565
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,160
Get up. Get up!

566
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:15,956
Easy, easy, peasy, little gee-gee.

567
01:07:16,414 --> 01:07:17,958
You all right, Dinah?

568
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:20,126
I'm still in one piece, Jerry.

569
01:07:22,462 --> 01:07:24,506
Bonkers, all of them.

570
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,300
Coming through!

571
01:07:33,598 --> 01:07:35,600
Dinah Brown's mother...

572
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:37,769
...she's in a bad way.

573
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,105
Poor Dinah.

574
01:07:40,313 --> 01:07:42,232
She can't even go to her.

575
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,442
The place is in the country...

576
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,279
...and there are no trains on Sunday.

577
01:07:48,154 --> 01:07:51,783
The horse is tired, Polly. I'm tired.
It's our one day of rest.

578
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,952
But oughtn't we treat folks...

579
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:56,997
...the way we like to be treated?

580
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:59,916
You're giving me my Sunday sermon
early today.

581
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:03,837
I know if my mother was dying...

582
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:10,719
A lighter cart would make
a wonderful difference to the horse.

583
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:13,013
Look!

584
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:16,641
Here comes butcher Dawes now
to lend you his light trap.

585
01:08:23,815 --> 01:08:25,442
You're a clever woman.

586
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:28,445
All right.

587
01:08:28,987 --> 01:08:31,781
Fix me some bread and cheese
and I'll get ready.

588
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,772
Feel free to tie your horse with the cows.

589
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:06,858
The meadow belongs to us,
not to the estate.

590
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:11,571
I'd rather set him loose. It'd be a real treat
for him to have a turnout.

591
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:14,574
Kind to me, kind to the horse...

592
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:16,910
Run inside and see your mother.

593
01:09:16,993 --> 01:09:21,081
You're a tough one, Jerry.
How can a person ever repay you?

594
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:32,384
Here we go.

595
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:34,094
Here we go.

596
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:02,789
<i>Grass!</i>

597
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:05,041
<i>Not a cobblestone in sight.</i>

598
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,086
<i>I couldn't believe my eyes.</i>

599
01:10:09,296 --> 01:10:11,298
Now, where's that biscuit?

600
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,801
<i>Running made me very happy.</i>

601
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:18,138
<i>Why shouldn't Jerry be happy too?</i>

602
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:22,142
I want that!

603
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:24,185
Give it to me!

604
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:26,229
Give it here!

605
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:01,514
Right.

606
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:04,142
Thanks.

607
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,990
<i>The visit to the country refreshed me.</i>

608
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:22,702
<i>But I found I couldn't stop thinking of her.</i>

609
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:26,039
<i>Then as if by magic...</i>

610
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,666
<i>...there she was.</i>

611
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:33,338
<i>My beautiful Ginger.</i>

612
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,426
<i>Oh, God, she was skin and bones.</i>

613
01:11:39,052 --> 01:11:40,971
<i>What had they done to her?</i>

614
01:11:42,222 --> 01:11:45,725
<i>She was almost too weak
to know who I was.</i>

615
01:11:47,352 --> 01:11:49,062
<i>It's me, Ginger.</i>

616
01:11:50,063 --> 01:11:51,523
<i>It's me.</i>

617
01:11:54,693 --> 01:11:57,904
<i>The brightness was gone
from her beautiful eyes.</i>

618
01:11:58,196 --> 01:12:02,325
<i>Her face, once so full of spirit,
was now full of suffering.</i>

619
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,414
<i>I tried to comfort her.</i>

620
01:12:09,874 --> 01:12:13,295
<i>I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.</i>

621
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,550
<i>Don't give up, Ginger.</i>

622
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:34,608
Get up!

623
01:12:36,276 --> 01:12:37,944
Get on with you.

624
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:44,242
<i>My precious friend.</i>

625
01:12:50,624 --> 01:12:53,084
<i>That night, I dreamed of her.</i>

626
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:56,963
<i>I dreamed of what was.</i>

627
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:02,761
<i>And I dreamed of what might have been.</i>

628
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:33,583
<i>I'm here.</i>

629
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:35,835
<i>What is it?</i>

630
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:40,423
<i>And then I knew.</i>

631
01:13:58,149 --> 01:14:00,610
<i>Goodbye, my sweet one.</i>

632
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:15,917
Just be patient.

633
01:14:17,335 --> 01:14:19,713
It's ladies and gents who pay our rent.

634
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:23,091
They'll be out anytime now, you'll see.

635
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:14,517
Begging your pardon, sir,
I was engaged to come round at 9:00.

636
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:17,354
As it's after midnight,
perhaps they wouldn't-

637
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:21,358
You'll be wanted soon enough.
The party's nearly over.

638
01:15:23,944 --> 01:15:26,154
<i>We waited for our passengers.</i>

639
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:29,407
<i>And waited.</i>

640
01:15:31,117 --> 01:15:33,745
<i>People aren't thoughtless just to horses.</i>

641
01:15:34,412 --> 01:15:36,873
<i>They're also cruel to each other.</i>

642
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:40,919
Bless your heart, old man.

643
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:51,680
Good night.

644
01:16:01,982 --> 01:16:03,483
Get a move on!

645
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:05,318
It's freezing.

646
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:07,320
Just in a moment, sir.

647
01:16:07,404 --> 01:16:11,283
Don't be impertinent. We could've had
two more drinks "in a moment."

648
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,083
Walk on.

649
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,855
<i>Something was the matter.</i>

650
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:44,983
<i>Jerry always looked after me.</i>

651
01:16:45,483 --> 01:16:47,861
<i>But here was the boy instead.</i>

652
01:16:58,038 --> 01:17:01,291
Harry, I didn't want to trouble them
in the house.

653
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:04,669
How's your dad?

654
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,172
It's in his lungs, Mr. Crenshaw.

655
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:09,674
I'm very sorry.

656
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,136
Doctor says he'll tell Mom tonight.

657
01:17:13,678 --> 01:17:16,389
He says Dad can't drive cabs no more.

658
01:17:17,557 --> 01:17:19,017
Keep your chin up.

659
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:21,394
Help your mom.

660
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,904
<i>Never drive a cab again?</i>

661
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:32,572
<i>How could that be?</i>

662
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:43,917
<i>It was good to be outside.
I wanted to go back to work.</i>

663
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,168
No, Black.

664
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:47,212
We're not going to the cab stand.

665
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:50,298
We're just stretching your old legs,
old Jack.

666
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,762
- Morning, Dinah.
- Morning, Harry. Is your mama home?

667
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,822
Dolly, what do you think you're doing?

668
01:18:13,905 --> 01:18:17,242
Packing. We're moving to the country.

669
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:23,540
Daddy's going to drive coaches. Dinah
says he'll never have to drive a cab...

670
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:25,500
...ever again.

671
01:18:30,797 --> 01:18:32,549
<i>What would happen now?</i>

672
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:36,928
<i>Even though cab work had taken its toll
on me...</i>

673
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:40,890
<i>...I had hoped to spend
the rest of my days with Jerry.</i>

674
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,437
Goodbye...

675
01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:47,772
...beautiful Black.

676
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:59,784
Daddy said to give you a kiss for him.

677
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:35,570
<i>I was sent to a grain dealer, where
Jerry expected me to be treated fairly.</i>

678
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,990
<i>But what he expected and what was...</i>

679
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,702
<i>...were as different as a kind word is
from a whiplash.</i>

680
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:58,885
Come on!

681
01:20:14,901 --> 01:20:19,197
<i>For two long years,
I pulled the heavy carts...</i>

682
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:23,076
<i>...until I could not pull anymore.</i>

683
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:32,752
<i>Sixteen guineas for the pair.</i>

684
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,796
Wants you to ride and drive.

685
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:37,632
Sixteen guineas.
Who'll give me sixteen guineas?

686
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:40,093
Anybody out there?
Sixteen guineas for the pair.

687
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:42,429
It's not worth bothering about them.

688
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,266
There's nothing for them
but the butcher's knife.

689
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:49,603
<i>I was too weak to care.</i>

690
01:20:54,232 --> 01:20:55,191
Awful.

691
01:20:58,069 --> 01:21:00,572
Was that one a carriage horse, Granddad?

692
01:21:02,282 --> 01:21:04,200
He might have been anything.

693
01:21:04,284 --> 01:21:06,828
He has a finer build than the other horses.

694
01:21:07,454 --> 01:21:09,080
Wouldn't you say, Joe?

695
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,757
Poor old thing.

696
01:21:22,052 --> 01:21:25,096
Expect we'll have better luck next month
at Langley.

697
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:28,558
<i>That voice.</i>

698
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:30,352
<i>It woke me up.</i>

699
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,313
<i>I knew that voice.</i>

700
01:21:33,897 --> 01:21:35,857
<i>It was Joe!</i>

701
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:43,300
Black Beauty.

702
01:22:45,885 --> 01:22:47,554
I'm here, Beauty.

703
01:22:47,721 --> 01:22:49,055
I'm here.

704
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:56,479
You're safe now.

705
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:27,260
<i>I have now lived in
this happy place a whole year.</i>

706
01:23:28,762 --> 01:23:31,890
<i>My strength and spirits are back.</i>

707
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:35,268
<i>Joe promises me I'll never be sold.</i>

708
01:23:36,186 --> 01:23:38,146
<i>My troubles are over...</i>

709
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,607
<i>...and I am at home.</i>

710
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:44,402
<i>Often....</i>

711
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:48,406
<i>...I fancy I'm still in the big pasture
at Birtwick Park.</i>

01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,535
<i>I'm together with my old friends.</i>

713
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:55,664
<i>And nothing...</i>

714
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:58,458
<i>...will ever separate us again...</i>

715
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:01,378
<i>...ever.</i>
